      <P>On the Order, the amendment can be introduced today but I know the Taoiseach's sensitive feelings in this regard.  He does not like them being taken on the day they are introduced but, as a special consideration, in order to facilitate the despatch of business, if the Parliamentary Secretary can overcome the Taoiseach's scruples, I shall be prepared to agree to taking it today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to permit a rated occupier of a fishery or a licence holder to be eligible in certain cases for election to a board of conservators. It was pointed out in the Seanad that under the Bill as passed by this House a non-resident rated occupier who might indeed be the fee simple owner of a fishery right would not be eligible to stand for election to a board of conservators, that in many such cases there are rated occupiers with long leases of fishery rights who live outside a particular board's area or who do not hold real property in it.  Under the Bill as passed by the Dáil these people would not be eligible for election.  On consideration, I felt there was some merit in this point and, therefore, I introduce this amendment to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this amendment and are prepared to agree to it.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary can avail of this amendment, which deals with rated occupiers, to refer briefly to a matter which I mentioned to him in the course of the debate on the Fifth Stage of this Bill before we sent it to <Col N="815" /> the Seanad, in regard to certain problems relating to unascertained rated occupiers of certain fishing rights. Could he indicate now whether any early steps are likely to be taken to meet the problem to which I then referred?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>While this amendment deals with the eligibility of persons for the position of conservator, may I appeal at this stage to the Parliamentary Secretary to introduce a further amendment to permit boards of conservators to pay travelling expenses to conservators who are duly elected?  These men attend meetings throughout the country, at considerable expense to themselves.  They do it voluntarily.  We have reached the stage now, with the cost of transport and everything else going up, when they should be permitted to be paid some small allowance towards travelling expenses.  There is no more opportune time than this stage and the Parliamentary Secretary could introduce a further amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>Whether it is or not, may I make it quite clear that, as I said roughly ten days ago on the Order of Business, we regard it as essential that the costings in relation to the expenditure of £6,000,000 should be published and that it is most undesirable that the publication of those costings should be deferred until after Christmas?  Surely the Government, after all this period, are in a position at least to introduce the Bill and to take the Second Reading or even the speech by the Minister on the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that while I am very anxious to give all the costings necessary for a full debate, there are certain commercial considerations that limit the information I can give.  I am quite prepared at the earliest possible stage to give the fullest possible information to the Dáil but I do not see what the point is in having it before Christmas when the Dáil is convening so soon after Christmas.</P>

      <P>The Minister will also appreciate that there is a very undesirable precedent in a commitment of £6,000,000 being made before any information is made available to the House.  In those circumstances, when the commitment has been made, it is essential that not merely the House but the country should be given the figures <Col N="817" /> at the earliest possible moment.  The Minister will agree with me completely when I say that the place where that information should be given is the Dáil.</P>

      <P>If the Bill were introduced, it might be possible to circulate a White Paper with it giving the information even during the Recess. That would come some of the way to meet the problem that presents itself. As I understand the situation, a good deal of this information has already been imparted to vocational bodies and it does not appear seemly that this information should be floating about in an anonymous kind of way and that the Dáil should not have it in view of the commitments into which the Government have entered.  Would the Minister consider introducing the Bill and the White Paper could be circulated with the information at the earliest possible moment?</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon used the plural and said &ldquo;vocational bodies&rdquo;. There was only the NFA.  They were basing criticism on false premises and we thought it better to give them some information to put them on the right track.  It was given on the understanding that it was in confidence and that it was my obligation to give the Dáil the information first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the Minister will agree that, once information has been imparted, naturally it is circulated in an anonymous kind of way and there is speculation as to what the information may have been. All I am asking is that at the earliest <Col N="818" /> hour full information should be given and if the Minister does not care to do it by way of introducing the Second Stage before the Recess, then he might introduce the Bill and circulate a comprehensive White Paper giving the facts in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a <Col N="819" /> Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend and codify the law relating to inns and innkeepers.  The common law has, for centuries, placed the innkeeper in a special position in regard to his duty to receive travellers and his liability for the property which travellers bring with them to the inn.  It is the common law duty of the innkeeper to receive and lodge every traveller at any hour of the day or night, unless he has reasonable grounds for refusing to do so, and to receive the traveller's horse, carriage, car or other vehicle and any other goods with which a person usually travels, provided there is accommodation for them at the inn.  Failure to fulfil this duty is a criminal offence as well as a civil wrong.  Moreover, the innkeeper is under a strict liability at common law for the loss of all goods brought to the inn by a traveller.  It is immaterial whether the goods are lost by theft, through the negligence of another guest, or by the acts of the innkeeper's own servants.  The only cases in which the innkeeper can escape this liability are where he can show that the loss was due to an act of God or of the enemies of the State or the guest's own negligence.</P>
      <P>The Innkeepers' Liability Act, 1863, modified the common law liability by providing that an innkeeper shall not be liable to any guest for the loss of goods to an amount greater than £30, unless the goods are lost through the wilful act, default or neglect of the innkeeper or any of his servants or unless the goods have been deposited expressly for safe custody with the innkeeper.  This limitation of liability does not, however, extend to horses or other live animals or to any carriage, motor car or other vehicle.  The innkeeper has the right at common law to detain the property of a guest who fails to pay his bill and, under the Innkeepers Act, 1878, he has the right to sell the property after six weeks in order to satisfy the debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Almost a century has elapsed since the position of innkeepers was last regulated by the legislature and, in the meantime, great social and economic <Col N="820" /> changes have taken place which, coupled with the introduction of cheaper and faster methods of transportation, have resulted in the transformation of the old roadside inn into the modern hotel.  It has been represented to me that in the light of the altered conditions now obtaining a review of the law relating to inns and innkeepers is overdue.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested, for example, that innkeepers' strict liability in respect of the property of travellers operates harshly on the modern hotel-keeper and that it is an anachronism and ought to be abolished.  In Britain the Law Reform Committee examined the matter and reported in 1954 that certain amendments of the law were desirable.  The Committee's recommendations were implemented in the Hotel Proprietors Act, 1956.</P>
    <P>The subject has also been under examination by the Council of Europe which has prepared a draft convention aimed at securing uniformity of the law in this respect amongst member countries.  In the present state of the law obtaining here it would not be possible for this country to adhere to the Convention which, incidentally, will shortly be opened for signature. In view of all these circumstances I decided to have a detailed examination of the matter carried out and it is as a result of that examination that I am now putting forward the proposals which are contained in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill re-states the principles of the existing law relating to innkeepers subject to certain important amendments. Deputies will notice that we have elected to discard the term &ldquo;inn&rdquo; in favour of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; which is, of course, the more apt description nowadays.  The Bill imposes on the proprietors of hotels, as defined in Section 1, new statutory duties, liabilities and rights similar to, but in substitution for, those at present attaching to innkeepers under the common law.  The definition of &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; reproduces the substance of the present common law concept of an inn and, in addition, is so drafted as automatically to include every establishment registered as a hotel <Col N="821" /> with Bord Fáilte Éireann.  This latter provision is new and is designed to remedy one of the unsatisfactory features of the present law, namely, the difficulty of ascertaining whether a particular premises is or is not an inn.  The provision will mean that persons staying at registered hotels can be certain that they will enjoy the benefit of the protection accorded to them by the Bill.  It is of interest to note that in England the Law Reform Committee drew attention to this defect in the existing law but did not offer any solution and, in fact, the matter was not dealt with in the English Act of 1956.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill re-enacts the duty of a hotel proprietor to receive all persons presenting themselves and requiring sleeping accommodation, food or drink and to provide them therewith at reasonable prices, without special contract, unless he has reasonable grounds for refusal.  The duty is based on custom and originated in mediaeval times when circumstances surrounding travel were admittedly very different from those obtaining to-day.  In those days a person travelled on horseback and if, at the end of a day's journey, he was turned away from an inn, he might have to travel a considerable distance before obtaining alternative lodging for the night. This created obvious hardship and exposed the traveller to the risk of being robbed by highwaymen.  Because the circumstances which gave rise to the common law rule have now disappeared, it is sometimes argued that the duty to receive all comers is an anachronism and ought to be abolished.  I am satisfied, however, that this argument is fallacious and that it would not be in the public interest or in the interest of the tourist industry that hotels should be able to reserve their hospitality for selected guests.  It seems to me that if the proprietor of a premises holds himself out as prepared to receive all comers, it is only equitable that he should be prepared to take the rough with the smooth, and be bound by the law to receive every person who appears able and willing to pay for the services and facilities of the hotel, provided he is in a fit state to be received.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> Deputies may notice that in Section 3, and, indeed, generally throughout the Bill, the duties and obligations of a hotel proprietor will extend to all persons who seek admission to the hotel as guests and that the existing common law concept of confining these obligations and duties to travellers is being abandoned.  I am satisfied that the present concept is unreal and no longer of any significance under modern conditions.  Indeed the English courts have recognised that the distinction now exists only in theory by holding that a person who visits his local inn for a drink is a traveller, even though his home may be only a short distance away.  On the other hand, the distinction which the common law draws between &ldquo;guests&rdquo; and &ldquo;lodgers&rdquo; is preserved under the Bill and the obligations of hotel proprietors will extend only to the former.</P>
    <P>In this connection I wish to mention that, as a result of a recent Australian decision, it has been deemed advisable to provide that the duties and liabilities of hotel proprietors shall apply to all guests whether or not they are received under special contract.  The Australian case in question was one in which the Supreme Court of Victoria held, in 1953, that persons who had booked in advance to stay at a sea side hotel for definite periods of from nine to twenty-one days, and who claimed the accommodation so booked and were received by the hotel proprietor on the terms and basis of their prior contract, were not guests but lodgers, with the result that the proprietor did not come under the common law duty of insuring the safety of their belongings.</P>
    <P>It is not, of course, for this House to question the wisdom of the decision of the Australian court but I am satisfied that in so far as conditions in this country are concerned the tests which were or may have been apt in the seventeenth century to distinguish between the ordinary traveller's use of an inn and the use of it by a person then regarded as a boarder are no longer satisfactory criteria by which to distinguish between the two concepts as they are understood to-day.  The responsibilities of innkeepers under the common law were fundamentally designed to protect those who came as <Col N="823" /> guests to inns, but that does not mean that, in order to be a guest, a person must nowadays come in circumstances precisely similar to those which prevailed when the common law custom originated, for, if that were so, the custom would long since have died out.</P>
    <P>If one sought, for example, to limit the custom today to travellers who arrive unannounced at hotels there would be few cases in which liability under the custom would attach. Modern usage is such that it would seem mere anachronistic eccentricity for the law to impose on a hotel proprietor a greater duty to the relatively few casual callers who come without any notice and are fortunate enough to obtain accommodation than to the many who have the common sense to make a prior booking.  As I have said, therefore, the obligations of hotel proprietors under this Bill will apply to all guests whether or not they book in advance.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides that it shall be the duty of a hotel proprietor to receive any property brought by or on behalf of a guest for whom sleeping accommodation is engaged and Section 6 provides that he shall be strictly liable for any damage to, or loss or destruction of, such property.  I may add that I have carefully considered the desirability of abolishing innkeepers' strict liability for the property of guests.  There is no doubt that the historical circumstances which gave rise to the concept of strict liability have largely disappeared; travel nowadays is very much easier and more common than it used to be and travellers are no longer exposed to danger from highwaymen in league with dishonest innkeepers.</P>
    <P>At the same time, it seems to me that there is still good reason why a proprietor, who holds himself out as willing to provide food and lodging for all comers, should be under a special obligation in regard to the safety of the goods which guests bring with them and upon which, in return, the proprietor has a lien for his charges.  The tourist or other visitor is today, as much as in the past, exposed to the risk of loss through negligence on the part of the hotel <Col N="824" /> proprietor or his servants, but it would often, by the nature of the case, be difficult, if not impossible, for him to prove negligence, as he would have to do if strict liability were abolished.  In the case of travellers from overseas, of whom there are a large number nowadays, the difficulty of seeking legal redress against the proprietor would be even greater.</P>
    <P>On the whole, therefore, I am satisfied that it is desirable that the principle of strict liability should be retained. I am fortified in this view by the fact that the principle is accepted in most Western European countries. Indeed, the principle has now been so long enshrined in most legal systems throughout the civilised world that it would be revolutionary to abolish it. If this country were to do so, visitors to Irish hotels would be placed in a far less favourable position than in other European countries and there is little doubt that such a situation would react unfavourably on the tourist industry here.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the existing common law obligations of innkeepers are confined to travellers. Whereas formerly this term was interpreted as meaning persons who stayed overnight at the inn, in the course of time the meaning has been altered to include casual visitors who call merely for a meal or a drink.  It has been argued that the obligations of innkeepers in respect of property should only apply to the guest who stays overnight and that it is unreasonable to extend these obligations to the property of a casual visitor.  I must say that I find myself in agreement with this viewpoint.  Indeed, the present law has led to the anomalous situation wherein a person having a meal at a hotel is indemnified against the loss of any property which he brings with him, including a motorcar, but is not so indemnified if he eats at a restaurant.  To remove this anomaly and to restore the law to what was clearly originally intended, the obligations imposed on a hotel proprietor by Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill will extend only to the property of a guest who has booked sleeping accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> The liability under Section 6, that is to say, the strict liability for loss or damage, is being extended to property of which the proprietor takes charge outside the hotel, as, for example, where he sends a servant to collect the luggage of a guest from a railway station.  This proposed alteration is a logical one and is being made in order to bring the provisions of our law into accord with the Council of Europe Convention governing the liability of hotel keepers.</P>
    <P>In so far as a motor vehicle is concerned, an important new safeguard is being provided for the hotel proprietor in that his liability for loss or damage will not apply unless he has been previously notified that the vehicle has been brought to the hotel.  I ought, perhaps, to mention that in this respect the method of approach in this Bill differs from that in Britain under the Act of 1956.  There, motor vehicles have been removed altogether from the scope of strict liability.  This was done on the basis of recommendations made by the Law Reform Committee which argued, first, that there is a substantial difference between a car which, unknown to the hotel proprietor and contrary perhaps to his instructions, may be left in a car park by a casual visitor and other property which may be brought into the hotel by a guest. Secondly, cars are generally already insured against loss or damage.</P>
    <P>On the first point, I do not accept that there is any logical distinction between a motor car and the other property of a hotel guest.  Strict liability applies only in respect of property brought within the precincts of the hotel.  I can see no justification for distinguishing between cars and other property in the matter of the application of strict liability, especially as this liability will, under the Bill, be confined to the property of guests staying overnight.  The argument that cars are usually insured against loss or damage is irrelevant.  The issue to be determined is the fundamental one of where liability ought justly be placed.  My view is that this must be settled on general principles independently <Col N="826" /> of the relative abilities of the parties to meet the liability.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, there is some doubt whether an innkeeper's liability for damage to the property of a guest is on the same footing as his liability for the loss of that property.  Section 6 of the Bill remedies this position by making it clear that the liability extends to damage, loss or destruction. For the avoidance of doubt the Bill goes on to make it clear in Section 11 that the Accidental Fires Act, 1943, does not apply in relation to any claim for damages by a guest who invokes the strict liability of a hotel proprietor. That Act provides that a person who suffers damage by reason of fire accidentally occurring in or on the building or land of another person shall not be entitled to claim damages against that other person.  In a fairly recent Circuit Court case it was held that by virtue of the Act of 1943 a hotel proprietor was not liable to a guest for damage caused by accidental fire occurring on the hotel premises.  I am satisfied that the Act was never intended to apply in circumstances of that kind.  Hence the need for Section 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The strict liability of a hotel proprietor will not apply where the damage to, or loss of, property can be shown to be due to an unforeseable and irresistible act of nature or an act of war.  This follows the existing common law rule.  Where there is contributory negligence by the guest the position will be governed by the Civil Liability Act, 1961, which provides for the apportionment of liability in such cases having regard to the degrees of fault of the plaintiff and the defendant.  Where the court finds that the defendant, that is, the hotel proprietor, is guiltless of what may be called moral fault, while the plaintiff, or guest, is guilty of negligence, the whole loss will be borne by the latter.  Thus, for example, if a guest negligently leaves valuable jewellery exposed and unguarded in his bedroom and it is stolen by another guest, the hotel proprietor will have a complete defence.  Similarly, if a guest leaves his motor car parked carelessly on the drive-way up <Col N="827" /> to a hotel instead of in the car park set aside by the proprietor for the purpose and the car is subsequently stolen, the court would almost certainly hold that the entire loss should be borne by the guest.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill increases from £30 to £100 the existing limitation on innkeepers' liability in certain cases, and provides for a new limit of £50 in respect of any one article.  These changes are clearly desirable in view of the fall in the value of money since the Innkeepers' Liability Act, 1863, was enacted.  The new limits are further more necessary in order to bring the law here into conformity with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention to which I have already alluded.  As under existing law, the limitation will not apply to motor cars or property which is deposited with the proprietor expressly for safe custody or property which is damaged or lost through the negligence of the proprietor.</P>
    <P>In order that a proprietor may obtain the benefit of the limitation conferred by the section a notice in the form prescribed in the First Schedule of the Bill will have to be displayed conspicuously in the hotel premises.  Deputies will observe that the notice will require to be in both Irish and English.  Some proprietors may consider it desirable to have the notice in other languages also and there is, of course, nothing in the Bill to prevent their adopting such a course.  The new notice will replace the notice at present required to be exhibited under the Act of 1863 which is, in effect, a copy of Section 1 of that Act and is usually embellished with the escutcheon which appears at the head of every British Act of Parliament, namely the royal coat-of-arms. Thus, not the least of the reforms which the Bill will effect will be to ensure that the present anachronistic document will be replaced by a suitable notice prescribed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, the proprietor of a hotel is under a duty to take reasonable care of the person of a guest and to ensure that, for the purpose <Col N="828" /> of personal use by the guest, the premises are as safe as reasonable care and skill can make them.  It is obviously desirable that this duty should be preserved and provision to that effect is made in Section 4 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the duty of innkeepers to receive travellers and their property is an obligation under the criminal law as well as a civil responsibility, and an innkeeper who fails to fulfil that duty commits an offence for which he may be indicted. While the threat of civil proceedings is likely to be sufficient in most cases to ensure that hotel proprietors will fulfil the duty in question, circumstances may arise in which, on the grounds of public policy, the State would wish to be able to enforce fulfilment of the duty.  Accordingly, Section 12 of the Bill preserves the existing obligation under the criminal law but provides that offences shall be tried summarily instead of by indictment.</P>
    <P>I believe that this Bill will have the effect of bringing Irish law relating to inns and innkeepers into closer accord with modern social needs and conditions.  It will also serve to bring our law into closer conformity with that of most continental countries, and, in the process, will enable us to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the liability of hotel keepers.  Deputies will readily appreciate that unification and harmonisation of law in this particular field is most desirable from the point of view of the development of international tourism.  Finally, the Bill will fulfil the important function of clarifying and re-stating the law in a single, comprehensive, modern statute which will obviate the necessity to refer to previous enactments.  We are, in fact, codifying the law.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to deal with the main principles which arise under the Bill and I trust that what I have said, coupled with the information contained in the Explanatory Memorandum, will facilitate Deputies in their examination and assessment of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I should like to express my appreciation of the assistance afforded to me in connection with the preparation of the Bill by <Col N="829" /> the Council of the Incorporated Law Society who submitted an excellent memorandum dealing with the existing law and making suggestions as to the manner in which it should be amended.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone will agree with the principle that there should be a new Hotel Proprietors Bill to replace that which is now 100 years old and, therefore, completely out of date.  With that principle accepted, the actual consideration of the Bill becomes more a Committee Stage consideration of the details of the Bill.</P>
      <P>We all must accept that the function of hotels and the place of hotels in the national economy, having regard to the present position of the tourist trade, must be jealously guarded.  It is 17 or 18 years since I had the honour of being President of the Irish Tourist Association.  I remember making it clear at that time that it was not the 95 per cent of our hotels which were excellent that set the talking pattern for the Irish tourist trade, but unfortunately the fact was that people were more inclined to grumble about the things that were wrong, rather than talk about the things that were right and that, therefore, the odd 5 per cent. which did not completely live up to their obligations, as did their brethren, received more notice and did inestimable damage.</P>
      <P>It is as true today as it was then that it is this very small proportion indeed&mdash;and I stress &ldquo;very small proportion&rdquo;&mdash;of our hotels which do not live up to the reputation of the others which frequently bring the whole trade into unfair disrepute. Bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the manner in which the State has generously come to the aid of the hotel industry with different forms of incentives and inducements, I was surprised that the Minister did not go a little further in certain respects in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> There is nothing&mdash;and I defy contradiction of the word &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;&mdash; that does more damage to the reputation of all our hotels than the one hotel out of 100 that has dirty, insanitary, bad toilet accommodation.  It completely wrecks the efforts of everyone else to improve the standard of our hotels if one hotel in a town does not keep up a reasonable standard and it happens that guests or visitors go into that hotel.  Therefore, the Minister might have considered, when introducing this Bill, providing some system by which that odd one per cent.  &mdash;perhaps it is not even as high as one per cent.&mdash;might be prevented, under a code such as this, from doing damage to their colleagues and neighbours, and to our reputation as a whole.  Whether he feels it is not entirely proper for consideration in this Bill or not is a matter I would like him to indicate.  It is something of which all of us have heard from time to time.  Sometimes, let me add, it is not entirely the fault of the hotel proprietor, but may be the fault of the odd one per cent. of the patrons as well.</P>
    <P>That is one of the things that occured to me when reading this Bill &mdash;that when bringing the old law up to date, the Minister might have given consideration to conveniences of that sort for visitors, thus providing the degree of modern improvement to which we have become accustomed and which we have rightly come to expect.  I want to stress that I am speaking of a minute proportion only who do damage to an industry which, as a whole, has made and is making very great efforts.  It is many years since I made exactly the same point when speaking for the Tourist Association.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, the Minister has rightly made a differentiation between the person who drops in casually for a meal and the person who stays overnight in a hotel.  The fact that the hotel keeper will not be under a liability in respect of goods for the person who merely drops in for a meal does not, of course, as I understand it, relieve him of liability when, for example, a person gives his hat and coat to the cloakroom attendant <Col N="831" /> and gets a ticket for it or it is taken by a porter.  That is a contractual relationship, and this is merely a statutory relationship.  It is as well that the difference should be understood.</P>
    <P>In that connection, it is clear that the old limit of £30 set in 1863 is completely and absolutely out of date now.  It is highly desirable that the amount should be changed and brought into accord with the modern value of money.  I do not think anybody would accept that £30 in 1863 was the same as £100 now.  The amount would have to be raised much more substantially.  However, £100 is a fair enough figure from the point of view of the statutory obligation.  I should like in that respect some clarification from the Minister that it is £100 per person and not per account. In other words, if a husband and wife are staying in a hotel and there is one account, one booking, it is £200 obligation in respect of them, with the same over-riding limit of £50 for any one article.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that the provisions of the Accidental Fires Act, 1943, should be excluded from the liability of a hotel proprietor, but is it clear that in deleting the provisions of that Act from this Bill we are not in any way affecting the liabilities of one guest to another guest?  The 1943 Act was introduced because of the fire in Athlone.  The fire spread from one premises to another and it was held, prior to the introduction of that Act, that the owner of the premises where the fire originated was liable for all the damage wheresoever it was caused. Is it clear that the deletion of the provisions of the 1943 Act from this Bill will not mean that if a fire starts in a bedroom, perhaps because of a guest's action, that guest will be liable for the whole burning throughout the hotel?  I believe that matter must be clarified beyond yea and nay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, with a great flourish of trumpets, talked about the new notice that will be put up in hotels. In my view, there is only one word for that, and that word is &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.  Anybody who goes into a hotel is supposed to know the law, just as in every other <Col N="832" /> aspect.  Having a liability in relation to this Act measured just because a notice is or is not up on the wall is utter nonsense.  The obligation to display a notice in Irish, English, or any other language&mdash;if the persons concerned want to warn foreigners so that they will not be able to say they did not know what the notice was&mdash; appears quite nonsensical and should be dropped completely from the Bill. It is a fundamental principle of our law that we are all supposed to know the law.  Therefore, in this modern age, there is no reason whatever why that should be done.</P>
    <P>Personally, I also think that the obligation imposed in the Bill on a hotel keeper to provide accommodation is also an anachronism.  Today communications are such that anybody can telephone ahead for accommodation, if he wants it.  Why that normal procedure would not be adopted in respect of something that is to be made a criminal charge is not a thing I can understand.  I know the hotel keeper has the right to refuse if it is reasonable for him to refuse.  He can say he is full.  The question of whether he is full or not is always a matter of some argument.  It is always possible to put up a &ldquo;shakedown&rdquo; in a room normally used as a sitting room if he wants to do it, but he would not be obliged to do it.  In 1863, there was no satisfactory means of communicating one's desires, if one had to stay overnight in an inn.  That system has now completely gone by the board. To retain it in this Bill is to retain an anachronism and, not only that, but it is giving legislative sanction to what is an undesirable practice.  In these days of modern communications, if one can arrange accommodation by telephone or by writing ahead, it is only reasonable that one should do so. Therefore, I think the Minister should seriously consider the necessity for retaining that provision in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We all agree that a Bill of some sort is necessary after one hundred years to bring us into accord with modern practice.  Once that is agreed, the details become more a matter for the Committee Stage and we shall <Col N="833" /> have an opportunity of considering them next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise this Bill as a welcome attempt to bring the law up to date.  I propose not to say very much on it, except to mention that there was some confusion in my mind when I discovered it was the Minister for Justice who was taking charge of the Bill.  I appreciate now why he does, since it is, in fact, a Bill which deals mainly with the responsibility and liability of hotel proprietors towards guests and lodgers.  I think I am right in assuming that the Minister for Transport and Power would have responsibility for any improvements that might be required of hotel owners in the matter of room accommodation, toilets and so on.  For that reason, I trust the debate will not be so wide on this occasion as to appear to have transferred his functions from the Minister for Transport and Power to the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It occurred to me, listening to the Minister's speech, that if the general public had realised what the responsibility of hotel keepers was towards the public in respect of certain things, I fear we would have had much more litigation since the original Act up to the present.  It is well that the law is being trimmed up, so to speak, and that hotel proprietors and the general public will know exactly where they stand.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has not had full regard to the Convention of the Council of Europe in respect of hotel proprietors.  The Convention has not been signed yet but, if I interpret the Minister's remarks correctly, it has been more or less agreed between the member countries of the Council of Europe.  I do not know what the urgency is in this matter but if the signing of the agreement between member countries is imminent, I think it might have been desirable to wait until it has, in fact, been signed, if he has any reservations about its not being signed now, because I think it is important for various reasons that there should be uniformity in law of this kind in the European sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> We are told that we are to be in the European Economic Community in a very short time.  That factor should be considered but, even if we were not members of EEC, it would be desirable that people from Europe, travelling from one country to another as tourists, should find uniformity. Whether the Minister contemplates a revision of the law when the Convention is signed or if and when we enter EEC I do not know, but it seems, after a cursory glance at the Bill, that the responsibilities that are now being placed on proprietors of hotels here appear in some respects to be a little more onerous than those on hotel proprietors in other European countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Bill did not attempt to fulfill all the obligations contained in the Convention but he dismissed the matter in a few sentences. Would he, when replying, give in a little more detail the real reasons why he did not observe the Convention that has now been agreed on or why he did not wait until the Convention has been signed by the members of the Council of Europe?</P>

      <P>There are some matters in the Bill which could be commented on but, like Deputy Sweetman, I think these are better left for the Committee Stage. Therefore, I do not propose to say any more, but I applaud the fact that there is an attempt here to bring the law in respect of hotel proprietors up to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in one or two points here, particularly <Col N="835" /> Section 3.  The proprietor of a hotel is under a duty to receive at the hotel as guests all persons presenting themselves. May they refuse on certain grounds and, if so, on what grounds? Perhaps the Minister would tell us a little more about that because guests are refused.  I know hotel-keepers are entitled to refuse guests if they are disorderly or drunk but very often, for snobbery reasons, they are refused. For instance, if a person comes up from Connemara, perhaps well-dressed but without a collar and tie, may the hotel refuse him?  Or a man may come along with an open shirt.  Such guests have been refused.  Therefore, I should like to know on what grounds guests may be refused.  I know the law says hotel-keepers are liable to a fine of £100 if they do not receive guests but how does the person refused go about making a complaint?</P>
      <P>There is another point.  I understand that all guests are required to sign their names and addresses at the reception counter but I am only too well aware that in many cases the names and addresses are false.  So long as the name and address is signed, it is all right with the hotel proprietor.  In many cases, no effort is made to get any evidence that the names and addresses are correct.  It is a well-known fact that some hotels are used for immoral purposes.  I have read enough newspapers and books to know that.  In fact, the Minister is only too well aware that in practically all divorce cases, there is evidence of adultery in hotels.  Therefore, it is not likely that these people give the correct names and addresses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody can go to a hotel and bring in any woman he likes, put down names, and there is no question of producing any evidence that they are correct.  If other people are subject to scrutiny and inspection by the Garda, why should hotels be immune?  Why should they be privileged? I mentioned this only because if guests were required to show evidence of their correct name and address, it would be a deterrent against this abuse.  That is a very important point because so long as <Col N="836" /> people can put down anything at all, the hotels will be abused.</P>
    <P>There is not much more I want to say except to mention those two points, ensuring correct names and addresses and the grounds on which hotel proprietors may refuse to receive guests.  We are to have a Common Market when we may expect large numbers of visitors to this country.  Perhaps the hotels may not like coloured people.  Can they refuse on that account?  Could they pretend that the hotel is full?  There is always a way out of these situations.  Would they be justified in attempting segregation and saying to the coloured people: &ldquo;Of course, we accept you but you must go to the left.&rdquo;  That is done in America.  It could be done here.  If some hotelier did not like coloured people, he could accept them but ask them to go to the left or to the right.  The world is getting smaller and we can except large numbers of visitors here and cases of the kind I mentioned could arise.  There are quite a number of coloured students here and as often as not, they are refused admission to places.  Are they protected under this Bill?</P>

      <P>In conjunction with other speakers, I welcome this Bill.  It is one hundred years since the law was changed.  The Minister indicated that the Bill was introduced in order to enable us to accept the draft Convention of the Council of Europe.  I take it from the Minister's speech that the Irish Government intend to sign the Convention.  I think it is a very good thing and that they should do so.  The Council of Europe is a body representative of 15 nations. A considerable amount of work is put into the matter of Conventions.  In the Council of Europe, all shades of opinion are expressed by public representatives from all countries.  This Convention gives a wide coverage and displays a modern approach to hotel management and accommodation generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are one or two points in the Bill which I think need a little clarification. The new laws relating to the <Col N="837" /> responsibility of hotel keepers in regard to motors cars is a little ambiguous.  The Minister says that the hotel proprietor is not responsible for the motor car of a guest, unless he notifies the hotel that he has a car.  I presume that hotels have some sort of a garage or parking place of their own over which they have full jurisdiction. The car should be safe in every way. Therefore, the hotel proprietor should be responsible for the vehicle concerned. In the event of the hotel or guest house not having special accommodation for a car and a guest leaving his car outside without locking it&mdash; nowadays that is no guarantee against the car being stolen&mdash;and notifying the hotel proprietor, is the hotel proprietor responsible or not?  It is a point upon which considerable controversy could arise.  Unless this matter is clarified, there will be extensive litigation which will be of tremendous advantage to the lawyers but to no one else.</P>
    <P>I fully concur in what Deputy Sweetman said about the one per cent. of hotel keepers who do not provide the sanitary facilities they should provide, who do not keep their premises clean.  There is also a small percentage of hotel proprietors who overcharge, to the detriment of Irish tourism and their colleagues.  It seems to me that there is no particular reason why it should not be mandatory on hotel proprietors to put up a list of prices in the rooms.</P>
    <P>In my travels in many lands, not only continental Europe but in the United Kingdom, I have always found, when staying at a hotel, that the price is displayed.  That makes it clear whether the charge includes breakfast or not; in other words, one knows exactly what one is charged.  There is one per cent. or perhaps a little more of hoteliers in Ireland who are doing incalculable damage to the tourist industry.  If they get somebody whom they conceive to be a bird of passage and who they think is wealthy, they will present him with an enormous bill.  The person concerned has no redress whatever, unless the price is written up in the room.  That is the guarantee in continental Europe and in the United Kingdom as well.  A person knows exactly what he is being <Col N="838" /> charged and hoteliers cannot charge more.  I do not know if that comes within the Bill or not.  I admit that I have not studied the Bill very extensively. I merely heard the Minister's speech.  The point, however, is one which the Minister might seriously consider.</P>
    <P>If we are going to put up new notices in hotels, why not start afresh in order to get into line with modern conditions?  Having regard to the new European idea, we are going to have an influx of tourists.  I am glad that the Minister has stipulated in the Bill that if anyone wishes to display notices in other languages regarding the rules and prices, he can do so and I think hoteliers should be encouraged to do that.  There is nothing better than having these notices in three or four languages.  Foreigners feel at home if they can read their own language.  It is the custom to do that in Europe.  In Germany, for example, one sees notices in English, French, German and Italian.  The same applies to notices in the trains. And in London, they largely do the same type of thing.  Five or six years ago, it was the exception rather than the rule to hear a foreign language spoken in a hotel but now it is quite usual.</P>
    <P>The only other point that strikes me is this.  In the old Act, the liability of hoteliers was £30.  That ceiling is now £100.  The old Act was introduced in what is known as the Victorian era.  If the ceiling 100 years ago was £30 and is fixed today at £100, does the Minister consider that £100 today will buy what £30 would buy 100 years ago?  If he does, I do not think the ceiling is right and he should increase it.  This is quite a fair Bill to hoteliers.  If anybody is stupid enough to leave anything valuable such as a jewel in a hotel and it is stolen, the hotel keeper is not liable.  A sum more in keeping with modern times should be fixed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is generally agreed that the proposals in this Bill are a necessary improvement on the existing law.  In fact, the record of this country in ratifying Council of Europe Conventions is a good one and our record in ratifying a number of <Col N="839" /> international Conventions dealing with a variety of matters from ILO to the various Conventions of the Council of Europe is an indication that we are anxious to play our part fully in implementing the decisions of these various organisations.</P>
      <P>It is essential that we should ratify the Council of Europe Convention on hoteliers because of the very great importance of tourism here to the national economy.  As the Minister remarked, it is desirable from every point of view that we should harmonise our legislation with that of other member countries of the Council of Europe.  One of the things which can irritate tourists is the fact that they find a difference in the legislation and law applicable to their stay in one country compared with another.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, because of the work of the Council of Europe, a great deal is being done to make the law uniform and those Member countries who ratify these Conventions have an obligation to bring their own law into line with the changes that have been made.  Indeed, I think all of us who visit hotels from time to time and see the old Victorian notice under the Innkeepers' Liability Act have often regarded it as an anachronism.  It is high time that notice was changed. Where similar laws exist in other spheres, which are now out of date, it is time they were amended and modernised.  But that particular one, because of the obligation to give publicity to it and to display it in a prominent place, probably hits the eye more strikingly than many of the other laws which are probably out of date but still operate.  It is therefore essential that the law should be brought up-to-date and brought into conformity with modern conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the matters which has contributed to an expansion in the tourist trade here is the fact that so many of our hoteliers have, over a number of years, improved their standards and brought their premises to a condition comparable with the best either here or on the continent.  There are still a negligible few who fail to measure up to these standards and, despite the work done in the early days of the <Col N="840" /> Irish Tourist Association and in more recent times, by Bord Fáilte&mdash;indeed by the combined efforts of both&mdash;and by the numerous efforts made to impress on hoteliers the importance of providing the best possible facilities, the essentials for visitors, there are a negligible few who still fail to measure up to the modern standards which visitors expect.</P>
    <P>The damage which these few can do is quite considerable.  It may happen that a particular visitor or group of tourists visit only one hotel in a particular locality.  If they get the wrong impression, it may colour their attitude to a subsequent visit, or to that particular district.  While very few now fail to measure up to the high standard which is necessary, it is important that on an occasion such as this, emphasis should be placed on the need to measure up to the best possible standards, not only for visitors at home but, even more important, visitors from abroad.  One matter that does require some attention&mdash;whether this is the appropriate measure on which to raise it, I do not know&mdash;is the question which I believe, in the past, and sometimes even in the present, has militated against an improvement in hoteliers' standards and certainly in the matter of providing better accommodation, that is, the fear of revaluation.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the grants which are provided now by Bord Fáilte have had the effect of providing an incentive to many hoteliers to improve their accommodation and to provide amenities which are nowadays recognised as necessary if tourists are to be attracted.  While these grants are quite considerable, nevertheless a number of hoteliers feel that because their premises are liable to revaluation, and although increased business may be attracted by reason of the improvements made, the deterrent of revaluation has had a restricting effect on the improvements which a number of hoteliers might otherwise adopt.</P>

      <P>I was about to say that it might be a matter for discussion between the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  Other than that, I believe that this Bill is an improvement insofar as it brings the law up to date and modernises the attitude which we, in common with other Member countries of the Council of Europe, must adopt.  There are certain details of the Bill which we can discuss on Committee Stage, more appropriately than now&mdash;certain changes proposed require modification. The question of whether the change in the value of money has been adequately provided for is also a matter which can be considered on Committee Stage because undoubtedly what was an appropriate figure 100 years ago requires very considerable modification in view of the depreciation in the purchasing power of money since then.</P>

      <P>First of all, I am grateful to Deputies for the manner in which they have received the Bill. It is true to say the Bill has been generally welcomed, as I had hoped it would be.  Not the least merit of the Bill is the fact that it does something which we have been attempting to do all the time in this programme of law reform&mdash;tidying up in one modern statute of the Oireachtas all our statute law on any particular subject.  From now on, it will not be necessary for students, practitioners or ordinary citizens to do a great deal of research and to go to old statutes in order to find out what the statute law is.  Indeed, further than that, we have to a considerable extent codified the law. In other words, we have taken the common law as it has been evolved and developed by judges and written it down in black and white in the statute. I think that that is a commendable feature of the Bill and that it has commended itself to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the points which have been made are Committee Stage points and we shall be able to have an argument about them in greater detail when we come to the Committee Stage.  However, one or two points were made which I think it would be advisable to deal with now, primarily because <Col N="842" /> of their importance but also because there may be no particular section of the Bill under which we could appropriately deal with them later.</P>
    <P>The principal point to which I would refer is that raised by Deputy Sherwin about the possible emergence of a colour bar.  I want to make it clear that the Bill, as far as I can see and as far as we can plan, effectively disposes of any question of a colour bar emerging in our Irish hotels.  Deputy Sherwin has asked the question: On what grounds will a hotel keeper be able to refuse a person who comes along seeking accommodation?  The Bill, of course, states that a person must be received unless the hotel proprietor has reasonable grounds for refusal. The interpretation of what are reasonable grounds will be a matter to be determined by the court in relation to any particular instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems absolutely clear to me that no Irish court would hold that colour would be a reasonable ground for refusing admission to any prospective guest.  Therefore, I think the Bill does in that way effectively ensure that we shall not have ever emerging in our Irish hotels any suggestion of a colour bar; and I have no doubt that that would be the intention of every Deputy in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin also asked whether there was any obligation on hotel keepers to record accurately names and addresses.  Well, there is not in this Bill.  This Bill is fairly narrow in its objective.  It sets out to define the rights, liabilities, obligations and duties of the hotel proprietor to the guest and of the guest to the hotel proprietor. Any question of hotel keepers being compelled to keep registeres or accurate lists of their guests is not in this Bill a matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman made a number of points and asked some pertinent questions.  I disagree with some of what he said.  I think I can more or less safely leave his questions over until we come to the particular sections with which he was dealing. Deputy Esmonde asked about the Council of Europe Convention and Deputy Corish seemed to be under some misapprehension about the matter.  The position is that a draft Convention has been prepared and is now open for signature by Member States.</P>
      <P>As I explained to Deputy Corish by way of interjection, the purpose of this Bill is to put our law into such a state that we can, if we wish, sign and ratify the Convention.  The question of signing the Convention is a matter which the Minister for External Affairs is considering very actively at present.  I have informed the Minister for External Affairs that, if this Bill becomes law, we will be in a position, if he and the Government so wish, to ratify the Convention.  Therefore, as far as the Convention is concerned, this Bill is, if you like, a preparatory step.  It is putting us into the position that we can, if we wish, sign and ratify the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is just a subsidiary point that strikes me in connection with the ceiling of liability laid down in the Bill.  Some Deputies have adverted to the fact that £100 today is not equivalent <Col N="844" /> to £30 in 1863.  I fully agree with Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Esmonde that it is not.  However, as Deputy Sweetman himself said, it is a rough and ready measure.  In fact, it is greater than the limit of liability laid down in the Convention.  The Convention specifies 3,000 gold francs, which is approximately of £75.  Therefore, our provision of £100 in the Bill is greater than what the draft Convention provides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>New francs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, gold francs.  It is equivalent to about £75.  Deputy Corish also seemed to think that we were diverging from the draft Convention. I am not quite sure in what way he suggests we are, but I cannot see that we are.  In fact, we have actually used the wording of the draft Convention wherever possible.</P>
      <P>Another thing we have adopted, which is proposed in the Convention, a specific matter, is the provision that a hotel keeper shall come under the obligation of strict liability where he takes possession of the guest's property outside the hotel.  The sort of thing in mind is where he collects the property at a railway station.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman had a number of points about specific provisions in the Bill which, as I have said, we can safely leave over to the Committee Stage. However, in reply to Deputies who raised more or less general matters about hotels, hotel prices, hotel toilet accommodation, and so on, may I say that these are not really relevant to this Bill.  The only thing in this Bill about prices is contained in the provision placing on the hotel proprietor an obligation to receive the guest where he is in a fit condition to be received.  The proprietor is obliged to provide sleeping accommodation, food and drink at reasonable prices.  I admit that there is considerable scope for disagreement between one man's opinion of reasonable prices and another man's opinion.  As Deputies know, of course, Bord Fáilte publish every year a list of the prices charged in all the hotels registered with the Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no more to say at this stage, except again to thank the members <Col N="845" /> who have spoken for the manner in which they have approached the Bill and for the welcome they have given to it.  We can have a further and fuller discussion on the specific points of detail on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one matter raised yesterday at Question Time which I should be glad if the Minister would reconsider, that is, the fact that a number of applicants for the Garda who sat for the last examination and who were notified that they passed but who failed to get a sufficiently high mark to qualify them in the first 200, were subsequently notified that they would not be called and that it was open to them to sit again for the examination which it is proposed to hold early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise the matter for this reason. As the Minister said, it was clearly stated in the notice announcing the <Col N="846" /> examination that the fact that a person qualified did not necessarily mean he would be called for training; he had to surmount two subsequent hurdles, (1) the oral examination and (2) the medical examination.  While that was published in the notice announcing the actual competition, the practice has developed over some years&mdash;it may not have always been the practice&mdash;that when applicants sat for one of these Garda examinations and were notified that they passed, subsequently on passing the oral Irish and on being of the required medical standard, they were called for some or other course of training, those who passed in the higher places being called first and then those who got lower places in the examination.  Although in announcing the examination, the Civil Service Commissioners stated there was no guarantee that a person would be called, even having passed it, nevertheless the impression has been created because of the practice that has developed over a number of years that once a person passed, he might expect, on passing the oral Irish examination and the medical examination, to be called for training as a Garda.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be said for the reasons the Minister advanced yesterday, that it was very undesirable that a very long list of applicants who sat for an examination should continue to be called, say, for a period of a couple of years and for the future, I would say that should be the attitude. However, notice should have been given in view of the practice which has grown up.  It is not fair to say, merely because a notice was published in the Civil Service Commission advertisement announcing the competition that a person would not be called, that that was adequate notice.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, some of those who were down the list may have passed other Civil Service examinations or secured employment elsewhere but a great many of those who sat for this examination rightly expected to be called.  They are now told they will have an opportunity of sitting again. In the meantime, others may come in and it is possible that some of those who qualified at one examination may not qualify at another.  In any event, <Col N="847" /> they will also have to meet the liability of a second stamp in respect of the Civil Service Commissioners.  For the future, it could be clearly understood that competitions will be held twice yearly and that only those who reach a certain standard will be selected.</P>
    <P>There is a very strong case for reconsidering this question because of the circumstances surrounding a number of these competitions in the past few years.  It is reasonable that people should understand and be aware of the circumstances in which they sit for an examination.  Provided they comply with the conditions, both from the point of view of reaching the required educational standard in respect of Irish and also the written examination and complying with the medical requirements, they are entitled to expect to be allowed to present themselves and to be selected as members of the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to subscribe entirely to what Deputy Cosgrave has just said.  He has stated it so succinctly and exhaustively that it is unnecessary to recapitulate his representations.  I urge them on the Minister and I believe that no serious embarrassment would arise if, owing to the ambiguity that surrounds the present situation, this concession were made and a clear indication given that hereafter the Garda examinations will be held for, say, 200 vacancies, that the first 200 candidates will be chosen and the remainder will have to take their chance in any subsequent examination for which they are eligible.</P>
      <P>I should like to think the Minister would meet fully the representations made by Deputy Cosgrave but I gather that in any case he intends to meet the suggestion made by Deputy MacEoin, that certainly those who passed the examination on this occasion but did not come amongst the first 200 and who would pass the maximum age before the next examination is held, will be allowed to enter for the next examination by virtue of their having passed this examination recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one general matter arising in connection with these Garda examinations which I should like to mention. <Col N="848" /> As I understand, the present system is that the candidate sits for the examination, then does an oral in Irish and then undergoes the physical examination.  Possibly there are administrative difficulties but it seems to me that the sensible thing to do would be to have the physical examination first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a rough physical examination in the Garda station before acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but I have had a case, which I am sure the authorities will sympathetically consider and which gives an idea of the difficulties that can arise, of a fellow who did the examination and did very well in it and was then found to be five feet and seven and seven-eights of an inch, in height.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>He should do the exercises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that sympathetic consideration will be given.  Imagine the feelings of a fellow who has done an examination and who has taken a high place or, at least, has heard on the grapevine that he has taken a high place, and then discovers that he is half an inch too short.</P>
      <P>It seems to me it would not be unreasonable and it would not be impossible administratively at least to measure candidates.  Even at the preliminary interview in the Garda station where they propose to fill up their forms, it ought to be possible to measure them and, if they fall below the minimum height, to say that there is no use in filling up the form because, in forwarding the form, the person responsible would have to mark on it that the candidate's height was 5' 7&rdquo; or 5' 7½&rdquo;, and the application will be promptly rejected.  Whether the revelation that the candidate falls-below the minimum height should prevent his being considered at all in the Garda station or whether the Garda officer in the station should be required to insert on the application form the ascertained height when the candidate attends, or not, is a matter of indifference.  Some fellows may want their applications to go forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the record speak by having the station sergeant or the Garda officer responsible for accepting the application form write on the form the actual height of the applicant.  If he increases in height in the meantime and chooses to sit the examination, that is his own problem, but it does seem to me to be a hardship when a fellow sits the examination, does the oral in Irish and then fails on the height test, as opposed to one of physical defect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition will see that it could be a hardship the other way, if a man were shot down at the preliminary stages who might possibly gain the extra height in the subsequent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I see that.  I admit that problem.  Usually, when one knows all the facts, there are two sides to every story but I think the Minister will see there is a difficulty where a fellow first passes the examination and is full of eager anticipation and confidence that he has made the grade and then discovers that, owing to a difficulty that existed all the time, he never had any prospect of being chosen at all.  It is worthy of examination to see whether some eliminating process could not be gone through at the stage of the original application which would avoid that kind of thing happening.</P>
      <P>It is nearly true to say that at every second Garda examination I have got one or two of these cases&mdash;and I suppose the same is true of practically every other Deputy&mdash;of fellows who have passed the examination but who have failed on height.  It seems it ought to be possible to avoid that kind of problem arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of law reform and codification, the Minister has introduced a number of Bills.  This is not the appropriate time to speak of the desirability of legislation but it is the time to direct the Minister's attention to an important principle associated with the codification of law.  Most of these Bills he has been responsible <Col N="850" /> for introducing are in fact codifying Bills, Bills to tidy up the existing law and present it in one instrument rather than making it necessary for people to search through whole series of statutes that have accumulated down through the ages to ascertain one particular aspect of the law.  That is a very useful activity but there is always a temptation, when that kind of activity is in hand, to attempt the combination in one Bill of law reform and codification. That attempt is always attended by disaster because something gets overlooked.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that, where it is determined that a particular branch of the law requires codification, the first step is to determine in how far the law requires amendment or reform and to introduce an amending Bill dealing with that particular branch of the law and, that having been done, to bring before Dáil Éireann a codification Bill which can be put through the special machinery we have established in this House for the codification of law, machinery which is quite separate from that which we ordinarily employ for the reform or amendment of the law.</P>
    <P>If the course which I now propose were followed, the first step would be to deal with the amendment of the law and we would be all under notice in the House that the Bill under consideration was designed to change the law in certain details or matters of substance.  That having been done, the Minister's Department would then prepare a Bill whose sole claim was that it repealed all previous legislation dealing with this particular question and brought all the existing law into one statutory instrument.</P>
    <P>The custom is to present that Bill to the House on Second Reading, whence it goes to a Special Committee of the House and the Seanad, with a certificate of the Attorney General that this Bill represents no amendment of the existing law but operates solely to bring the existing law all within one instrument.  That is subjected to appropriate examination by a Committee, I think, of both Houses in the light of the Attorney General's certificate and then it is finally enacted by this House <Col N="851" /> and by the Seanad and thereafter becomes a readily accessible and convenient manual of all our statute law relating to that particular question.</P>
    <P>I think that has been done exhaustively only once, in connection with the fisheries legislation, which was codified in one large Bill.  It took a very long time to do it, for a variety of reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very arduous task, but when it was done, it was done.  Some of us entertained the understandable belief that when we had done that the fishery law would remain as it was for a long period. That turned out to be quite illusory and we found we had to amend it in two or three Acts since then.  It is very useful, however, because you can go back to the 1958 Act, or whatever it was, and beyond that nobody need go for the fishery law.  I suggest to the Minister that when dealing with matters relating to innkeepers or any one of those codifying measures which he has recently introduced, he should take them in two steps, first, amendment and then, consolidation and codification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal with another problem which is really within the ambit of the Minister's discretion.  We all talk a lot about juvenile delinquency but the real truth of it is in this country we have every reason to thank Providence that our problem of juvenile delinquency is relatively so small.  Compared with the problem with which they are struggling in the United States of America, Great <Col N="852" /> Britain, France, or even Germany or Russia, our problem is relatively trivial but the fact that it is imposes on us all the heavier duty to be vigilant to see we do not follow the same unhappy path as other countries have had to follow through their failure to take precautions in time.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the philosophy of certain pious people who think more with their hearts than with their heads that there is no such thing as a bad boy.  There can be young persons who require strict discipline to make them conform to the ordinary standards of civilised social life and the family as a rule ought to be able to provide the discipline requisite to bring about whatever degree of reform is necessary. I find it hard to believe that when a child's irregularity of conduct reaches a degree which persuades the Garda Síochána to determine they must bring him before a criminal court, and the stage is reached in the court where the case is determined and he is in his own interests removed from his family circle and committed to an institution for reform, there is not here present some psychiatric fault in the child or in the family which requires investigation, if the best disposition is to be made of the child in question.</P>
    <P>We ought to remember in dealing with these cases that we should count our blessings and amongst our blessings I count the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána are one of the finest police forces in the world in my experience. That is why, when some of them start giving &ldquo;lip&rdquo; to us, it makes me so irritated because one impudent Garda can cause more talk than 1,000 first-class Guards.  The real truth is that the Garda Síochána are a first-class force and are essentially a characteristic part of our own people and they are human and understanding. Therefore when a child misbehaves in a public place, so far as my experience goes, the Garda will chase him home to his parents or give him a clip and tell him to behave himself, with great patience and forbearance, and do it repeatedly, before reaching the stage of taking him into a Garda station and charging him.  So that one may be <Col N="853" /> pretty certain if a young Guard who is inexperienced whisks a child before an experienced old station sergeant, then in the vast number of cases, unless something grave has occurred, the sergeant gives him a clip and tells him to go home.</P>
    <P>Children do not get into the hands of the Guards officially unless they are recidivists and unmanageable, but if they do get charged and are brought before the Children's Court, I cannot imagine that the court, having heard the case, will ordinarily ordain that the child should be taken from the parents' custody unless a situation emerges which suggests that parental control has completely broken down and that there is no use returning the child to the parents and saying: &ldquo;Now, correct this child and see that he is made behave.&rdquo;  So that if a child is committed to Marlboro House on remand, there is evidence, one, that the courts are pretty well clear in their minds that this is a chronically troublesome child, and two, that the district justice is clear in his mind that the parents are not going to do what may be necessary to make things right and that it is necessary to separate the child from them in order to initiate his reform.</P>
    <P>It is a terribly grave thing to take a child from his parents and most of us are liable to forget it but if any of us had a child who got into trouble like that and he was brought to the court and we were blandly told that he was going to be taken from us and put into a remand home, it would give us a great shock.  But that is what is happening every week in Dublin and elsewhere and we should examine our consciences very carefully when we allow that procedure.  I remember when I was a young T.D. in this House, it struck me that we were legislating to put people in jail and by leave of the then Minister for Justice, I visited all of our jails, including what used to be Summerhill and is now Marlboro House.  I could not find anything in the jails that shocked me.</P>
    <P>I remember Sligo Jail which was then in existence but which has since been closed.  It was a very homely establishment inhabited by veterans <Col N="854" /> who came back from time to time and anything less like a jail, except from the outside, it would be difficult to find.  I thought the standard of the jails was high.  Mountjoy was smelly but I understand that the circumstances were such that it was very hard for it not to be smelly.  Portlaoise seemed to be excellent; Limerick was good.  I think Cork had been closed then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Summerhill was awful.  I do not want to go back to those old days but eventually we got Summerhill closed.  Here is the snag. Neither Summerhill nor Marlboro House is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Justice.  Both are under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Education.  Fortunately there is a joint committee sitting to consider juvenile delinquency and, amongst the things that committee must consider, is the accommodation and procedure at Marlboro House because, through Marlboro House, there must pass practically every juvenile delinquent from the city of Dublin who ultimately becomes the responsibility of the State. I believe that there is the point of selection, the point at which we must determine, probably finally, whether the proper treatment for a juvenile delinquent, or a potential juvenile delinquent, will be provided, or not. Remember, once the child is finally relegated to an industrial school, in our set up, it is highly unlikely that an industrial school can adapt itself to the treatment of one particular child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These schools must provide a relatively standard treatment to which all the children committed to their care must conform.  If a youth is sent to borstal, or a child is sent to the reformatory at Daingean, there is some measure of personal attention, but generally the person committed to Daingean or to borstal gets standard treatment which makes little or no allowance for the idiosyncracies of the individual.  It is desirable, and, to my mind, indispensable, that at Marlboro House such facilities should be available to enable us to segregate in good <Col N="855" /> time those children who are themselves neurotic or, what is even much more important, who are themselves normal but are unconsciously reacting to a gravely defective family background where neurosis, sickness or family disruption may be creating a course of conduct in the child which no one but a skilled observer can correctly connect with its true cause.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, urging on the Minister to accept an offer, which I understand will be made to him, for the provision of psychiatric examination of all children committed on remand to Marlboro House.  The sort of examination I ask is that each child so committed should, first, be examined by a competent child psychiatrist in the anticipation&mdash;in my anticipation, certainly&mdash;that he will report, in respect of at least half, that the child is perfectly normal but requires discipline; but I shall not be surprised if, in respect of the other half, the authorities find that competent child psychiatrist to report either that there is a genuine psychiatric defect in the child or that the child is unconsciously reacting to a domestic situation in his own family which explains his aberrant conduct, and that the appropriate remedy for this child's misconduct is not detention or punishment but correction of the family situation which is giving rise to the problem.  That, of course, falls within the province of the probation officer of the court.</P>
    <P>I have reason to believe that an effort will be made to get the Minister for Justice, via the committee which is examining this question of juvenile delinquency, to provide this psychiatric service voluntarily.  I trust, if and when that offer is made to his committee, he will accept it.  Some people may ask what is to become of these reports of the psychiatrist when they are made.  I think they should be furnished and should be a <i>sine qua non</i> of the return of the child to the court.  I think before the district justice of the Children's Court finally disposes of any child who has been on remand in Marlboro House, he should have before him the psychiatric report and should have due regard to it before determining what <Col N="856" /> is appropriate to be done in respect of any child.</P>
    <P>It would also give us the additional sense of security that, if somebody subsequently made representations to the Minister that the child was unreasonably detained, that his parents were well able and anxious to look after him, in calling for the appropriate papers to consider the whole question of releasing the child&mdash;strangely enough, that again is, I think, a function of the Minister for Education&mdash; he would have available to him not only the police report and the observations of the district justice but also the report of a competent child psychiatrist who had examined the child during detention in Marlboro House.</P>
    <P>I have never been in Marlboro House&mdash;I doubt if I have.  I used to visit Summerhill fairly regularly in order to keep up the pressure on the then Minister to get rid of it.</P>

      <P>I imagine I should find myself in sympathy with the Minister if he took that decision.  Borstal is, as the Minister will agree, a special problem of its own.  It deals with the adolescent.  I am dealing with the question of children and I am not without hope that the representations I am making here will bear fruit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sometimes criticised for being too forbearing and too modest in what I say in this House.  I do not share the view that it is necessary to have a dogfight over every topic that arises here.  We could make plenty of hay about dogs, and generally haul the Minister over the coals, and jump on him, and have lots of fun.  I believe it <Col N="857" /> is better Parliamentary practice, and Parliament works better, when it becomes known that, if the need arises to have a row here, we will have a row, full blast; but, where the necessity does not arise, we do not intend artificially to create one.  That may cause frustration to the Minister's father-in-law, but we have educated him in a good many things in the past, and we will try to make a good Parliamentarian of him before we finish and, in the process, perhaps we will train his son-in-law as well.</P>

      <P>It is a tribute to the high educational standard and fine quality of the candidates for admission to the Garda that almost twice the number required to fill the existing vacancies qualified in the examinations, but it creates a big problem departmentally, I am sure.</P>
      <P>Suggestions have been made from the other side of the House regarding a solution of that problem.  I am inclined to agree that those who passed the examination, and were also informed of it, should get another chance, and should not be disqualified by any small margin of age which might rule them out before the next examination is held.  Those who qualified should at least have an opportunity of sitting again.  I would be inclined to support such a proposal. It is discouraging to young men seeking this career, having been informed that they had passed the examination, to be ruled out because of any more or less technical obstacle of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also appeal to the Minister, that until some other arrangements are made, at least on this occasion, those who have been notified that they have qualified should be allowed to sit again.  They can improve their knowledge in the meantime by adequate instruction or study.  If all those who passed were ultimately to be called, I fancy there would be no examination for two or three years, which would not give ample opportunities to others coming along and seeking admission to the Garda, although their standard of education might be higher than that of those who qualified at the end of the list. This problem will, I am sure, be <Col N="858" /> looked into by the Minister and his advisers, and solved satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>Questions of height, and so on, have been raised.  I have known cases where people who were deficient in height to the extent of perhaps half an inch or less, were told to take appropriate physical exercises under instructions which were available to them in the FCA in their own areas. After a few months they qualified and were called.</P>
    <P>A few cases have also come to my knowledge of candidates who were disqualified by reason of the vision of their two eyes not being completely balanced.  Even though the weaker or lazy eye had adequate vision, if the other eye was particularly strong&mdash; and although an eminent oculist or eye specialist had certified that the candidate should qualify&mdash;he did not qualify by reason of the lack of complete balance in the two eyes.  I have known candidates who would not be accepted, even on such a certificate, because one eye was particularly strong, although the weaker eye was quite adequate.</P>
    <P>In regard to the physical requirements, I presume that now we have squad cars, and so on, although everyone is anxious to keep up the fine physical standard of the force, some men may qualify for the squad cars, or the office, who would not perhaps make the grade to the same extent as the men on the streets directing traffic and performing such duties.  We have a particularly fine type of members of the Force doing that job.</P>
    <P>The Minister can be complimented on the arrangements he and the Department have made enabling the younger members of the Force to put their case through their Representative Body for consideration of any grievances they may have, or any other matters they may wish to bring to the notice of the Department for amendment. It should satisfy all concerned that in their particular grade, whether they are officers or men, their problems will receive due and adequate consideration and be heard with sympathy by the Minister, the Department and the Commissioner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> Deputy Dillon mentioned juvenile delinquency and referred to industrial schools.  From my knowledge, they are excellent institutions.  The students are educated by priests, monks and lay teachers and are selected for various occupations in the trades appropriate to the schools or in agricultural pursuits. There is ample opportunity for observation of their general character and their response to instruction and advice given to them by their instructors. They are doing excellent work indeed.</P>
    <P>Taking it all round, since the Minister took office, he has been most assiduous in his work in the Department. One of the most important aspects of good relationship is the approach of the Minister to public relations generally between the officers of the Department and the officers of the Force.  That will lead to co-operation and will be creditable all along the line, and it will lead to excellent results generally in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say straight away that the Minister is to be congratulated, not on any particular item, but on the general manner in which he introduced this Estimate.  He appears, to a large extent, to have broken precedent because he did not merely give us a factual picture, as some Ministers are prone to do, taking the headings of the Estimate one by one.  I recognise that his speech was a comprehensive review of the administration of the Department and not just a factual picture because he gave his opinion on various aspects of the Department and seemed, in effect, to anticipate many of the points that would be raised.</P>
      <P>I should like frankly to congratulate him on the manner in which he dealt with the Estimate.  In the circumstances, many questions which I intended to ask have already been answered.  I should, however, like to mention a few points for his consideration. There is one matter I raised with him by means of Parliamentary Question in which I think he ought to consider some change.  It is the question of the lodgment of moneys belonging to minors in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> This came to my notice through this case.  A sum of £461-10-0 was awarded in compensation to a child of five years.  It was invested in British 3½ per cent War Loan stock.  It is true that interest was paid to the parents over the years, but at the end of the 16 years, the stock had depreciated to £251-11-3d.  That child was certainly a victim of circumstances, and it was little consolation to the child that the money had been invested in accordance with the regulations of the Supreme Court and High Court.  It seems there is no safeguard in cases of that kind.  If any of us had £461-10s. to invest, we would be much more careful in looking after it over a period of 16 years.  As in this case, if we saw a calamitous drop in the value of stock, we would be very careful to take it out of British War Loan stock after a period and invest it elsewhere. It seems to me the court merely invested the money and left it at that. They were content to leave it there until the child reached 21 years of age.</P>
    <P>That is not good enough.  If the rules require to be changed, they should be changed.  If it means a change in legislation, I am sure the Dáil would give the Minister power to correct a situation such as that as quickly as possible.  I cannot understand why that money was not invested in the Post Office or some much more profitable investment.  I do not know how attractive British War Loan stock is&mdash;I do not know anything about it.  While one cannot accuse the court of absolute carelessness, a lack of interest seems to have been shown in this case, and I am informed the same regulations of the Supreme Court and High Court govern the investment of moneys in all these cases.  While the Minister, by way of reply and private correspondence, tried to be as helpful as he could, he &mdash;like the court, I suppose&mdash;was confronted with this situation.  If it needs to be changed, it should be changed. I trust the Minister will give it further consideration in the immediate future to safeguard the investment of funds awarded in court under the circumstances I have described.</P>
    <P>Every time I speak on the Vote for the Department of Justice, I find myself <Col N="861" /> riding a hobby-horse on my own. It is the question of the censorship of films, and I want to give it another canter today.  The Minister suggested in reply to a Question I put down in July that if films were marked with an X certificate, that would be an attraction for some people to go and see them.  I grant it might be an attraction, but only for a very small percentage of cinema-goers.  The Minister or some of his colleagues said in reply to a Parlimentary Question recently that they did not think the British public were any different from us.  If the system of having X, A and U certificates is acceptable to the viewing public of Britain, we could well become accustomed to it here.</P>
    <P>It would not be right to give the impression that the ordinary form of censorship we have here generally allows in films detrimental to young people, but there are certainly some that have a harmful effect on youngsters here.  It has been said that parents should control their children in the matter of the films they attend. To give them all due credit, I think they do that as far as they can.  But they cannot study films and titles to such an extent that they can be absolute censors.  In any event, there is a censor and a censorship board here whose job it is to censor films. I think they have done a pretty good job and we could further entrust them with the grading of films.  The Minister should have another look at this matter, especially in the times in which we live.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider having television films censored by the existing censorship board.  I cannot understand why they are not, because they are films in every sense of the word.  Some time ago, I raised a question about a particular film which I thought was distasteful, not to ordinary adults but to young people and especially teenagers.  I suggested then that there might be censorship of TV films.  The reply I got was that there was a form of censorship in Telefís Éireann.  I have nothing derogatory to say about the people who operate Telefís Éireann, but I would suggest they are not competent to <Col N="862" /> censor films in the same manner as the censor and board appointed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>There have only been a few films that should not have been shown during the time teenagers would be viewing, but nevertheless there have been some.  Many of those films were made in the United States and Great Britain, and we accept that our standards are slightly different from the standards for films in the United States, France and other countries.  I honestly think there is a legal obligation on Telefís Éireann to submit these films to the censorship board.  I am not absolutely certain, but, in that they are films, they should be subjected to some kind of censorship.</P>
    <P>I applaud the interest the Minister appears to be taking in sport in the Garda Síochána.  One wonders why sport was allowed to flag so much over the past 15 or 20 years.  I well remember the high esteem in which the Garda were held about 20 years ago because of their feats on the athletic and sporting fields.  Anything the Minister can do to encourage them to engage in sports of all kinds in a more active way is something in which he should be supported.  I would also suggest that he should exploit the Garda Band more.  I have said this in respect of Army Bands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>This Bill may be regarded as an attempt to relieve certain members of the Oireachtas of burdens which would appear to weigh too heavily on them and which do not affect the majority. Members who live a long distance from Dublin and who are obliged to stay overnight in Dublin when the Houses are meeting are therefore, in a worse position comparatively than those who are within reach of their homes.  While it is true that for years they have had to pay their hotel expenses, it must be admitted that, in recent years, the cost has increased considerably for those who have to stay overnight.  I am satisfied that there is a strong case for the present proposal to recoup them for such expenses.  A claim can only be considered when a member claims expenses for a night before or a night after a meeting of either House of the Oireachtas&mdash;the House, of course, of which he is a member&mdash;or a meeting of a Committee of either House on which the member is serving.</P>
      <P>Regulations will be made from time to time by the Minister for Finance which will fix the amount of the allowances and will also lay down the member who is eligible for payment, having regard to the geographical position of his residence, and also fix the area within which he may stay during his time in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas have always had free telephone facilities for the metropolitan area but they had to pay for trunk calls.  It is desirable to have dial phones installed both for the convenience of Deputies and for the relief of the staff in the House exchange here.  When the dial phones are made available, new regulations will be necessary to deal with trunk calls especially.  It is not intended to give free trunk calls except in a few cases, where they might be regarded at present as trunk calls, but where they are available on the dial telephone. Members will be free, of course, to dial any number the dial phone may <Col N="864" /> give them, where they do not request the intervention of the exchange.  In that case, of course, there is only a nominal benefit for members but they will at least have a quicker service and, as time goes on, and the system becomes more automatic, they will gradually become entitled to a wider range of free calls.  Further consideration will have to be given to this question of trunk calls but that is a matter for discussion and for regulation.</P>
    <P>For many years, the question of free postage has been under consideration. There was always general agreement on the desirability of such a scheme but there was never agreement on a satisfactory method by which this free postage could be given, and it was difficult to discover a method which would run smoothly from the administrative point of view. It is proposed now to frank letters from Members to their constituents. They will be franked in the Dáil Office at Leinster House and this will mean a good deal, indeed, to Deputies who have a very large mail to deal with, whether the extra work is due to a more exacting constituency or a more willing Deputy.  It will mean very little indeed to others who have a small mail for whatever reason.</P>
    <P>I cannot give any sort of firm estimate of the cost of this Bill but it will be necessary to take a Supplementary Estimate for the first quarter of 1963 and then we shall have an idea of what the cost may be.  I should say that although the Bill comes before the Dáil at the end of the season, it is by no means a rushed measure.  I have been discussing these matters, the matters included in the Bill, over a long period with the Committee of Procedure and Privileges.  While I was in full agreement with the Committee that the proposals were acceptable, the delay arose from a desire on their part to produce a scheme that would benefit those, but only those, who had a compelling reason for relief and that would, on the face of it, show that no unfair or unforeseen advantage could be taken of it.</P>
    <P>The members of the two Houses are competent to settle their own salaries and allowances by legislation.  I think it can be truly said that they have <Col N="865" /> never abused that power.  The duties of a Deputy are always increasing and, while his occupation is officially regarded as part-time, it is not feasible for many Deputies to engage in other occupations or supplement their incomes from any source of employment. When the question of increased remuneration or higher allowances comes up for consideration, the time given is prolonged, not in a wrangle with those who look for more, but always with those who are reluctant to agree to any increase.  I commend the Bill to the members of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to underline what the Minister has said in relation to the long consideration that has been given to this Bill.  The matter has been considered for a very considerable time by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and only comes to the House now when, as the Minister said, that consideration has been completely exhaustive.</P>
      <P>We are informed by members of our Party, just as the Minister is informed by members of his Party&mdash;and, no doubt, other Parties also have the same experience&mdash;that the additional high costs of maintenance when Deputies come to Leinster House is such that it was placing an impossible burden on Deputies who are endeavouring to discharge their duties to the best of their ability.  There is no doubt in my mind that for the Deputy who really does his work, the allowances given to him are not anything like what he would be able to get in outside life.  There is without doubt an element in public life of sacrifice by those who really endeavour to serve the public.  Not every one serves in the same way; not everyone is able to serve the public in the same way.  For those who make a real effort to fulfil their duty as public representatives, the task has become more and more onerous and more and more expensive.  This Bill makes an effort particularly to meet those people who are doing that and doing it from the far-off places.  For that reason and because we are clear that it is necessary that the assiduous Deputy should be enabled adequately to carry out his work, we support this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has now become commonplace <Col N="866" /> for Deputies, particularly from the country areas, to receive letters from their correspondents about every phase of life.  They are not restricted entirely to public Bills and legislation going through here.  Every phase of life is concerned.  Whether that is desirable or not does not enter into the question.  The issue here is whether the public want that and clearly they do.  If the public want the facilities that will be given under this Bill for dealing with that correspondence, they are necessary and desirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained in relation to telephones that what is being done here is merely an extension for administrative convenience because if you have a dialling system and trunk dialling is in operation, it is physically impossible to separate one from the other and have the telephones operating efficiently.  In fact, I believe that what are called free telephone calls from Leinster House will cost less than the manual systems would cost ultimately carrying on as the position is at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered very carefully the safeguards necessary to prevent any abuse of the privileges being afforded.  They made their views known to the Minister.  He realises, of course, as we all realise, that it is the duty of the Minister for Finance for the time being to ensure that in the administration of any service, be it for the Oireachtas or anywhere else, the appropriate safeguards are put into operation.</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to Section 3 of the Bill, may I say that I think it is essential that any Bill dealing with the Oireachtas should be exactly the same as any Bill dealing with any other matter.  This Bill provides that the arrangements will be carried through by regulation.  I can see the Minister's reason for doing that.  It provides for the tabling of those regulations as is appropriate but it does not provide&mdash;and it should provide as is always provided&mdash;in relation to any regulations tabled, the appropriate annulling subsection without prejudice to what is done before annullment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="867" /> It is essential that in any legislation we may enact affecting ourselves, we be scrupulously careful to ensure that such legislation will follow the exact pattern followed in respect of other Bills.  The annulling subsection is commonplace in all Bills dealing with regulations and I suggest to the Minister that it is desirable that that subsection be added on Committee Stage next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to express our support of the Bill, I can, I suppose, do it better than anybody else because I happen to be one of the Deputies least affected.  As far as the allowance is concerned, I go home at night.  Therefore, I am not affected at all.  As far as the telephone facilities are concerned, I live in an area where there are at present no dial phones.  Therefore, again, I am not affected by the Bill at all.  Thirdly, while I claim to have as high a postage bill as anyone else in this House&mdash;it may, perhaps, be higher than most Deputies&mdash;the fact that I live 30 miles from Dublin would make it inconvenient for me to come to Leinster House to post my letters. Therefore, unless the Dail is sitting, the facility is not of use to me.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It remedies a real injustice in relation to those who have to come to sittings of the Dáil and Seanad and who have to sit here and stay in town for a period of nights and days at their own expense.  It is all very well to talk about the Dáil allowance.  Anybody who has the experience of trying to exist on the Dáil allowance and carry out his duties will realise that a Bill of this sort is long overdue.  We know of people who have been trying to live on what they get from the Dáil.  We know they have a very precarious living, no matter to what Party they belong.  The one feature that does need to be highlighted is that most of the people throughout the country are under the impression that Dáil Deputies have had for years free postage and free telephone facilities.</P>

      <P>Cheap cigarettes and beer, too.  Again, that does not affect <Col N="868" /> me.  They believe that Dáil Deputies, when they come into the House, have practically everything free.  However, this Bill will bring home to these people that, in fact, it is necessary for the Oireachtas to pass a Bill into law before certain limited facilities can be allowed.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We hope that, as time passes, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may be able to help out with the dial telephones all over the country so that we may all avail of the facilities.  We hope the Minister for Finance at a later date will consider some way by which posting can be done from a person's constituency rather than at Leinster House because there is one thing which we fear.  I hope we are wrong.  We all know how at Christmas time the post offices are cluttered up with letters.  We fear that every day will turn into a Christmas mail day at Leinster House.  That would be too bad if it occurs.  Perhaps the Minister would make provision whereby there will be sufficient staff to deal with the big rush during the first few weeks.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our support to the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, although it relates to the country Deputies. There is no assurance that the city Deputies will be considered.  I think I am the only Dublin Deputy on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Therefore, I advocated the point of view of the Dublin Deputy but the Bill, as it stands, gives us no facilities. That is what I want to refer to.  I agree that the Dáil allowance is not enough, although in many cases members get too much because they do not give the time to the House.  They spend a good deal of the time at their private business.  We must not, however judge all Dáil members by those members. We try to judge the active members and see how they are affected. The Dáil allowance, as such, does not compensate in any way the active members, whether from city or country. This measure helps the active country member as well as the fellow who gives little time to the House.  If he is poor and lives in moderation, the fact that he gets travelling and lodging allowances will enable him to make ends meet.  He <Col N="869" /> might be able to do things a bit cheaper, and I do not object to that.</P>
      <P>Dublin Deputies will not get any extra allowance as far as I can see. The conscientious Dublin Deputy who is here most of the time is not half paid.  I know a number of Dublin Deputies are quite well off, that many of them have good businesses, but they give most of their time to those businesses. I am concerned with those of us who are without means otherwise, and there are quite a number of us here.  The Labour Party are the group who should be most concerned with this because, if they ever hope to be a very large Party, it will be brought about because they will have in their ranks tradesmen and labourers who cannot keep on their jobs.  It was that aspect that gave rise to the Allowances Bill in Britain in 1911 when Lloyd George said that the emergence of the Labour Party meant that a number of miners and other working-class people would be returned to Parliament. That is the type of person I have in mind when considering this measure.</P>
      <P>Of course in Britain, up to that time, there were the big shots who said they did not want allowances.  All they wanted was to have a sort of <i>cartel</i> or club of their own, but, even the great Edmund Burke made sure that his son and his other relations were put into damn good jobs.  Do not kid yourselves that they did not make money of it.  There was a nice bit made out of corruption and it was that kind of thing that first gave rise to the idea of subsistence allowances.  As I have said, the Labour Party are vitally concerned here because, if they hope in the future to have up to 40 members in the House, they will find that one-third of those men will be labourers or tradesmen who will be unable to continue in their jobs.  The Minister should realise that that type of Deputy must look after his family as well as serving in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I studied the views of British Labour Party members in a recent issue of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> It was stated there that, if an MP is not paid sufficiently, he will have to neglect either his family or his work in the House and, of course, his constituents.  I have no <Col N="870" /> objection to the Bill as it stands but I do want an assurance that something will be done for Dublin Deputies.  The assumption is that country Deputies have to pay digs and so on.  I accept that, and even if some of them can do it on the cheap, I do not mind that either.  But let us consider the Dublin Deputies in the same context.</P>
    <P>A Dublin Deputy must eat in this House.  I do not.  I go home because I could not afford to eat here.  Dublin Deputies have to get a taxi here, there and everywhere, and they get nothing in respect of that.  They have an enormous call on their time which most country Deputies do not.  If they are members of municipal bodies, they are kept going all the time.  Country Deputies are relieved of these duties while they are here.  We are not.  I called at the Corporation offices this morning at 10 o'clock, as I do every morning.  I then rushed here at 11 o'clock.  As soon as I finish now, I must rush home to eat; then I must rush back here and when finished here, I must rush to a meeting at James's Street where I will be until 10 o'clock tonight.  I am fortunate in that I do not smoke, drink or gamble because if I did, I could not exist on what I am getting.  And, mind you, I should be entitled to do those things.  There are certain little entertainments which no Deputy can avoid and these cost money.</P>
    <P>Look at the case of the former Deputy John Murphy who had to do the unheard of thing of resigning his membership of this House.  He had to resign, because he could not afford to continue here.  If he wanted to drink a pint, he had to hide in the hallway of the pub in case there was somebody he could not avoid and for whom he would have to buy a drink.  He rented a hall for the unemployed but he was not able to pay the few bob for it and the hall had to go.  He should have been given an allowance for that sort of thing.  If he were to provide for a wife and family, he could not continue to serve here, even living in moderation.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to remember that the poorer Deputies in Dublin cannot avoid holding little entertainments from time to time, but such <Col N="871" /> things are not provided for in their allowances.  I am, of course, talking about the active men, not those who come here only when they are tipped off that a division is imminent.  These people say: &ldquo;The public will not know whether I am here or not&rdquo;, so they stay away most of the time.  I hope the Minister will keep those few points in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with only one aspect of this Bill, the question of telephones, which is not a matter of any personal interest to me.  I had hoped the Minister would regard this matter of free trunk calls for country Deputies as a matter of elementary right.  It appears to have been approached as a matter of administrative convenience only, as if the only point at issue were that, if we cannot catch up on who makes the phone call from a dial telephone, we might as well give it to him free.</P>
      <P>That is not the way of dealing with it.  The point at issue is that a country Deputy cannot discharge his duties to the maximum ability unless he has a chance of keeping in touch with his constituents and the local authorities of which he may be a member.  To burden the country Deputy with the cost of trunk calls is an unjust imposition on him and almost an encouragement to him to fail to do his duty. When we get our dial phones in the House, it then becomes administratively impossible to prevent Deputies from dialling trunk calls to any exchange on the dialling trunk system and a concession will be made that those calls will be free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view, that is a very mean approach and I think the Minister should seriously consider at this stage making all trunk calls from the House free immediately or from 1st January. I know some people may say this would cost a lot of money.  I do not agree for a moment.  The actual cost of anyone making a call from here to Galway, Cork, Limerick, Sligo or anywhere else is infinitesmal.  Nobody would seriously suggest it is costing the Department of Posts and Telegraphs 3s. 6d. to connect me to an exchange in Cork.  It does not cost them anything like that at all, never <Col N="872" /> has done and never will.  The trunk charges are simply a contribution towards the overall expenses of the telephone system but, if these calls were to be made freely immediately or from 1st January, as I do not imagine for a moment there would be any loss of revenue to the Department.</P>
    <P>At present, country Deputies who wish to make trunk calls think more than once before doing so and nine out of ten times, they say they will not do it because they cannot afford it.  Therefore the Department have not got that money anyway.  It is not a question of the Department suffering a reduction in revenue.  I hope the Minister will reconsider this and that instead of delaying the introduction of free trunk calls, until dial phones are available generally, he will do so at once as a matter of elementary justice to most Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The easy thing to do in a position of this kind where Parliament is voting to its members increases in their remuneration or allowances of one kind or another is to avoid taking sides, to say nothing, and in that way escape the opprobium which might come from people because they appear to be voting themselves increases. There is the possibility that one's actions might be adversely criticised outside by members of the public.  It is quite possible that the decision of the House to vote itself increases brings a certain amount of adverse criticism. For that reason, and to explain our attitude to it, I should like to say that I support the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only on a very superficial examination of the whole function of Parliament in society that a person could say of it that the Parliamentary representative, whoever he is, whatever Party he stands for, is in the position that the labourer is not worthy of his hire, that he is not worth paying properly or that it is not worth facilitating him in his work.  Anybody who looks around Europe today, whether you look at Moscow, de Gaulle, Adenauer, Salazar or Franco, will note that in any of these dictatorships or semi-dictatorships&mdash;I am not using it in the pejorative sense but in the realistic sense&mdash; they are not accepting the principle of <Col N="873" /> democracy, that they are accepting it less and are beginning to do so more and more.</P>
    <P>Democracy, as we see it in Ireland and as we see it in the British Parliament, is on trial and is, one might say, on its last legs.  Whether it can be made to work at all, whether these strongman types of Government are the only effective types of Government that can create prosperity, is the question that faces us.  Looking back over the years here, I think a good case can be made against Parliamentary democracy as an efficient unit, as a unit likely to create prosperity, full employment, health services, educational services and so on.  One has to try to examine the reasons for this.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the whole idea of representation in Parliament, the consideration of proposals by the Government, their discussion in Parliament and their eventual implementation is one that appeals to most people but if the price one has to pay for it is too high&mdash;as so many countries have decided it is too high&mdash;then there is the question of its complete rejection. Why is it that, in certain instances, Parliament has been found not to have achieved the objectives for which it was established?  It is quite reasonable to suggest that it has been made very difficult&mdash;more and more difficult&mdash;to attract the very highest level of administrative ability or intellectual capacity into the whole of the machinery of Parliamentary democracy. There are various reasons for that situation.  One is the inadequacy of our educational system whereby there are relatively few people to choose from: it is no fault of the public.  The other is the tremendous counter-attraction of industry and other administrative posts which are available to the able person in life outside public life as we know it.  Then there is the fact that, over the years, the Parliamentary representative has felt that if he appeared to inflate his value in the public eye, he would be told he suffered from delusions of grandeur, that he over-estimated his abilities and that he was over-paying himself for these limited abilities.</P>
    <P>That, at any rate, is one reason why there has been a decline in the influence <Col N="874" /> of Parliamentary democracy in western European countries.  We should have the courage to examine this whole question and try to decide whether this could be one of the factors which has led to the decline of what was, in theory, a very fine idea.  I personally believe that very many more considerations are involved but this is one of them.  Because of this fact, we should try to have examined or to examine ourselves in a completely fearless and courageous way the whole question of the position in a Parliamentary democracy such as ours.</P>
    <P>The day of the dilettante politician is long past.  Parliament did not work at its most efficient level when there was the extreme case of the dilettante. As we have advanced, it has presumably become more efficient.  As more people have taken positions in Parliament, then Parliament has become more efficient.  Nevertheless, it is still very inefficient for the creation of prosperity and social justice generally in society.  Anybody looking around to-day must accept that.  Because of this, I think one is faced with the proposition whether there should not be the professional politician, the person who is a full-time politician, the person who dedicates his whole life to organising society on behalf of his fellow citizens in a particular way, and one is also faced with the examination of the various theories and proposals for the betterment of the life of the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the suggestion that there should continue to be the dilettante type of businessman or industrialist, with the present level of very high competition that exists in industry and in administration generally, would be completely discounted. Everybody knows that there is now the development of the highly trained businessman and executive. He must be highly trained.  He can no longer drift in and do an hour's work and expect to be paid at the end of the year and keep his business prosperous during that year.</P>
    <P>The time has come when, if we are to continue to believe in and to try to foster the idea of parliamentary democracy, we have to accept the idea <Col N="875" /> (1) that the professional politician is essential and desirable and (2) that there is nothing discreditable in the vocation.  It is probably the highest vocation of all because you are concerned with trying to create a just society for the rest of the people in your community.  In that way, the sneers at politicians which we come across so often in other sectors of society are completely unjustified.  The level of integrity and behaviour in political life in our community and in Great Britain is certainly as high as you will get in ordinary industrial practice.  Therefore, we should be the first to try to establish a high level of integrity in politics and to see that others recognise that it does, on the whole, exist.</P>
    <P>Naturally, we are not without our defects and deficiencies but, generally speaking, I suppose the level is as high as you will get in any other sphere in society.  We should not subscribe to the idea that we have anything to be ashamed of.  People will take us at the value we put on ourselves, on our merits and on our work.  We should be courageous about it.  We should educate the public into the realisation that if we are the most satisfactory politicians available then, just as in business the business prospers, so in parliamentary democracy society prospers.  We are able to provide better health services, better education, to see that people are looked after and that there is no unemployment and consequently no emigration.  It gives great dividends back to the public who pay the bill in the end.</P>
    <P>This proposal does not make much difference to me but I have never understood how the country Deputy paid his way with the allowance or why there was this discrepancy between the effective allowance of the city Deputy and that of the country Deputy.  The conscientious Deputy who might spend two or three days in town has to pay his hotel expenses.  This represents a very considerable drain on his income.  It is a matter of relative unimportance to some Deputies but to others, it is a significant expense. The more conscientiously he <Col N="876" /> does his job, the more it costs him in personal outlay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth referred to telephone expenses.  It would be desirable if some system could be devised whereby the country Deputy was able to use the telephone for trunk calls.  The greater part of a Deputy's work is devoted to ringing Government Departments and I wonder if any system of reversing the charges could be devised so as to make it possible for a Deputy to have this advantage.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the allowances of Deputies is a particularly difficult one.  I often wondered whether it would not be possible to establish some sort of a commission outside Parliament to investigate the whole position.  In that way, we should be removed from the criticism which follows from people outside who may not understand the position very clearly. On further examination, I think it is quite clear that will not work in so far as, for better or for worse, we are the highest authority in the land and, for that reason, nobody can arbitrate for us.  Some people might say we like to establish the Labour Court, the Agricultural Wages Board, the Civil Service Commission and arbitration boards of one kind or another and we do not do it for ourselves.  That is an over-simplification of the matter.  It would derogate from the powers and from the dignity of Parliament if we were to accept any investigation by an outside body.  This is work we must do for ourselves and in so far as this is a definite advance on the existing position, I welcome it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman raised the question of these regulations.  I see no objection to having an annulment clause put in.  It is unlikely that any Minister for Finance would make a regulation that he did not think had the support of the House but there might be a minority who might object. It is only fair, therefore, that they should be heard and this is the only way they could be heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully said he hoped the Minister for Finance would think of a way by which a Deputy will be enabled to post letters free from his house.  I do not know about that, but if any Deputy can devise a system that would <Col N="877" /> be not only foolproof but would appear foolproof to everybody, I certainly would be glad to consider any such scheme that might be put up.  I do not think Deputy Sherwin is altogether right in saying there is no benefit in this for the Dublin Deputy.  The Dublin Deputies will have free postage.  Dublin Deputies will be in the same position as rural Deputies because I would say that perhaps more than half the rural Deputies will go home at night.  They will get the free postage of course but in that case the overnight allowance is of no benefit to them.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a little confusion on this question of the telephone.  What I tried to explain was that the dial telephone will be put in and calls will be free as far as dialling is concerned but if a Deputy has to contact the exchange to make calls then it is a different matter.  He will have to pay for that call.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Deputy Booth and Deputy Dr. Browne spoke of free calls by a Deputy to his constituency.  There may be something to be said for that and it is a matter that could be considered. Going back to Deputy Sherwin, he says Dublin Deputies have to pay for their meals, but so have the country Deputies, and so will the long distance country Deputies, even when this overnight allowance is provided.  Therefore we are all in the same boat in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies mentioned some misunderstanding in regard to phone calls.  I think some time ago there was a misunderstanding even about the bar here. As long as I have been Minister for <Col N="878" /> Finance, I have always insisted that the same prices must be charged in that bar as are charged elsewhere and I must confess I am not a bad customer myself.</P>

I take it the professional politician wants to be there for life and people are not prepared to leave him there for life.</P>

      <P>The impression might get out to the people that Deputies had free telephone calls.  That would be a very serious matter. Country people go to a Deputy and ask him to ring up the Custom House or the Department of Social Welfare. Most of my time in the constituency <Col N="879" /> goes in making telephone calls from my home to this city.  If the idea gets abroad that Deputies have free telephone calls, constituents will expect them to use the telephone.

      <P>I wish to make a few comments on matters which have concerned me as a member of a local authority for the past few years. There is a noticable tendency on the part of many Departments of State to shed some of their responsibilities and to pass them over to local authorities and, in so doing, to pass the cost, or the major portion of the cost of the services in question on to the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Justice why it is that he considers the provision of school traffic wardens as a problem apart from other traffic problems, the organisation and the cost of which should be borne by local authorities.  In what way is this service related to the work of the local authorities?  It is logically to be expected that the traffic problem created by children pouring out of schools, especially in the built-up areas, would be dealt with by the normal traffic authority.</P>

      <P>It seems to be a matter for another Minister&mdash;the Minister for Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is a traffic question?  I am suggesting that it is a <Col N="881" /> traffic problem and that it is being dealt with in the wrong way, that it is being transferred to local authorities. This matter is not the responsibility of the Department of Education.  I wish it were.  If the Department of Education would accept responsibility for it, I would be quite satisfied.  This is a new traffic problem which has arisen in recent years.  Dublin County Council resisted for at least two or three years the attempt to make it responsible for this matter in order to try to induce the Minister for Justice to accept it as his problem.  On a couple of occasions, we made representations and each time we got the reply that if there was a member of the Garda Síochána available at the time when the children were pouring out of schools, by all means he would be put on the job but that there would be no guarantee and there could be no guarantee.  I would ask the Minister to tell the House why he considers that this is not a normal traffic problem.</P>
      <P>Another attempt on the part of the Department of Justice to transfer responsibility and expense to the local authority is shown in the position with regard to traffic lights.  Fifty per cent. of the cost of traffic lights is borne by the rates.  To that extent, the Department of Justice is relieved of responsibility.  In that regard, also, I should like an explanation from the Minister because there seems to be no good reason for this position.</P>
      <P>During the year, I have asked Questions about a matter that has come under my personal notice.  It is the fact that in County Dublin, for considerable periods of each day, Garda stations are not manned.  That is a position that should not arise.  It is a practice that did not exist some years ago.  There are a number of stations that have not a member of the Force in them for a considerable time each day.  Should anything happen locally, which would require to be dealt with by a Garda, there is no one in the station to deal with it.  Admittedly, the need is not quite as great as it used to be because the squad car is usually available, if people can contact it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="882" /> The Leader of this Party has referred at some length to the problem of juvenile delinquency.  There has been a good deal of talk about Marlboro House.  The main effort should be concentrated on keeping people out of Marlboro House, in ensuring that they never reach it.</P>
    <P>A great deal of juvenile delinquency is the result of bad and ill-considered planning.  In many of the newly built-up areas, juvenile delinquency is due to the fact that little or no consideration has been given in advance to the provision of recreational facilities, facilities for vocational education, the things which keep children off the street, keep them occupied and attempt to educate them.  Opportunities for employment are non-existent. When children reach school-leaving age, they are forgotten.  These are the reasons for juvenile delinquency. There is nothing as sad as to see a child heading for Marlboro House or for a sort of prison life.  The whole effort should be concentrated on ensuring that they will not appear in these places.</P>
    <P>We owe a very great deal to the religious orders and such people who help to keep homes together where there is unemployment and other domestic problems.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy has occasion from time to time to make representations to Government Departments.  I have had occasion to approach the Department of Justice in regard to various matters.  Any representations that I have made to that Department have been dealt with carefully, courteously and expeditiously and I should like to thank the Minister for that courteous treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Estimate and reference has been made to that fact by most of the Deputies who have contributed to it. Quite a lot of the ground has been covered by other Deputies and, although I do not propose to go over in detail the ground already covered, there are a number of points on which I should like to comment.  My first point has already been dealt with by other Deputies to a great extent, but <Col N="883" /> although their contributions are helpful to the Minister, I do not think they have really put their finger on the trouble which has arisen in recent times, that is, the real lack of co-operation between the public and the Garda.  The Minister cannot deny that that lack of co-operation exists and it is our duty to try to trace the causes of what is a very serious situation at present.</P>
      <P>I feel that when the Minister was appointed to the portfolio he now holds, he got off on the wrong foot. He started off by using the heavy hand on the police force.  Admittedly the Minister is a young man and he is very anxious to do a good job in his Department, but it will be admitted that he started off on the basis that he was going to show the young members of the Garda that they would have to conform to a certain type of behaviour which he proposed to lay down for them.</P>
      <P>This all arose as a result of the dissatisfaction which has been apparent in the ranks of the Force for the past few years concerning pay and allowances, and other conditions which obtained.  It was known to the Minister that feeling was very high amongst the younger members of the Force and, in spite of the fact that he should have had his finger on the pulse as a young man himself, and known that the new members of the Garda are recruited from a very high level&mdash;they are very well-educated, intelligent and independent-minded young men, with a good background and with a good training&mdash;he proceeded to browbeat them&mdash;I can only put it that way&mdash; and intimidate the members of the Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had the situation in which members of the Garda wished to hold peaceful meetings to discuss their own grievances and on a number of occasions they attempted to assemble, lawfully and peacefully, to discuss their problems and get proposals from various members of the Force for improving their pay and conditions. When they came together to meet, as any group of peaceful citizens in this State are entitled to, they were met <Col N="884" /> with a stone-wall attitude on the part of the Minister.  When they went to a hall, as each individual went into the meeting his name was taken.  Plain-clothes men were on duty and higher officers of the Garda were detailed: &ldquo;Mark that particular Guard's cards. Keep an eye on him.&rdquo;  Indeed, access was gained to a meeting by resorting to a silly subterfuge by those who wished to find out what the young guards were doing.  The resort was that they said they wished to enter the hall in order to examine whether it was safe to hold a meeting there&mdash; safe from the point of view of fire precautions and so on.  That sort of performance on the part of the Minister's officers was not calculated to bring a feeling of satisfaction among the Garda.</P>

      <P>This must be said. I know it is unpleasant.  I have met members of the Garda and I have discussed it with them time and again, and I have waited quite a while before I took the decision.  I felt it was necessary.  The air must be cleared, no matter who is hurt in the process.  The Garda are a body for whom we must have regard and if they fail to protect society and carry out their responsibilities in the manner in which the public expect them to, then a very serious situation is likely to arise.  If the Garda have not got the confidence and co-operation of the public, the Minister is powerless to carry out the duties which his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is very valuable to try to turn them against the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in turning them against the Minister. The Minister knows quite well that the rank and file of the Garda have no time for the Minister.  That is the position that arose, due unfortunately to the Minister, as I said, starting off on the wrong foot.  We know that the situation was so serious in the Garda that a very highly-placed individual in the city of Dublin, who holds a very <Col N="885" /> responsible position, had to intervene with the Minister and the Force, in order to bring about a state of affairs in which the Minister could save his face and, at the same time, the Garda would not appear to have bowed down to the type of tactics the Minister was using against them.  It is a bad day when that type of outside interference is necessary and when that stage is reached between the Minister and his officers.  However, I want to make it clear that that was the wrong start and, from that day on, things have not gone well.  A number of Deputies suggested that the Guards take the view now that they will take their dissatisfaction with their own conditions out on the public.  I do not think the Garda are doing that.</P>
      <P>I am going to refer now to the problem of traffic.  I have listened to remarks made in this House about the traffic chaos that exists in the city of Dublin and indeed in many cities outside Dublin.  I am putting myself in the position of anyone who comes up from the West of Ireland to do some shopping in Dublin.  We have to get a picture of what the impressions of such people are when they come into the city.  In the past few years, there has been an enormous increase in the number of cars and vehicles of all sorts in Dublin.  The city is cluttered up, and so are the approaches to the city, with vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People coming from rural areas, whether on commercial or any other type of business, wish to park their cars within reasonable distance of where they want to do their business, but at every corner they run across a member of the Garda with his notebook, or if he is not walking up and down taking down the number of cars or putting pink slips on their wind-screens, a squad car is going through the streets observing where cars are parked illegally.  What is the reaction to this in any citizen's mind?  He takes the view that he is being hounded every hour of the day in the city, whenever he tries to park his car in what appears to be a reasonable place to park.  Automatically a prejudice is created against the unfortunate member of the Garda, who is <Col N="886" /> only doing his duty.  These Gardaí do not walk out off their own bat; they are instructed in their duties and they are instructed to do this as one of the means of trying to solve congestion here in the city.  In my opinion, this is putting the cart before the horse because the only effect is to annoy the Garda Siochána, who have to do an unpleasant task, and the general public who have to suffer the inconvenience involved.</P>
    <P>Why is there this present condition in the city of Dublin and elsewhere? Is it not because those responsible in Government, and the City Fathers have, over the years, failed to do their job?  I have listened here to all sorts of suggestions, and I have read the same suggestions made outside of this House, and learned of plans made for an extra bridge either under or over the Liffey, underground passages for pedestrians, and the provision of special car parking facilities.  What has been done about any of these plans? None has ever, to my knowledge, come to fruition; but every day the number of vehicles on the roads is increasing, and the chief method adopted by those in authority to solve the resultant traffic problems is to send out the Garda Síochána to hound the public about parking regulations.  You cannot put a quart measure into a pint pot.</P>

      <P>The Minister may be able to, but he is, of course, like the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.  If, however, he goes to his former leader, who is a mathematician, I doubt if his former leader will agree with him on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation is that the Government, the Minister for Justice and his Department, the Department of Local Government, and the City Fathers&mdash; God help them&mdash;are all putting the cart before the horse.  Instead of getting down to work, providing free channels for vehicles, proper parking facilities, places for pedestrians to cross, and so on, they go on talking about plans and regulations.  Until they do the things I have mentioned, the congestion in Dublin will continue and <Col N="887" /> it will become worse in the next few years.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is responsible for the Garda Síochána who are instructed to carry out certain duties with regard to parking and the safety of the public.  I shall not refer further to the responsibilities of the Minister for Local Government.  I think I have made the position clear.</P>
      <P>Last night, Deputy de Valera spoke about cars parked on the roads in the suburbs and roads generally leading into the city.  He pointed out the danger to young children who might pop out in front of a parked car and be run down by a car passing out. Having some experience of the situation in the Six Counties, I believe a speed regulation would help, but it would be only a limited help from the point of view of removing the existing danger.  Deputy de Valera last night pondered aloud; he expressed the thought publicly here that he had not yet reached the stage where he thought he should agree with preventing these cars being parked on the side of the road, but it was in his mind.</P>
      <P>Where will they park?  Has the Minister not responsibility to bring pressure on his colleagues in Government to see that the fundamental steps are taken to provide parking facilities, to widen roads, and so forth, before the Minister's police force is asked to carry out regulations impossible of implementation.  We cannot blame the Garda Síochána for the position in Dublin.  Every time a Garda has to remonstrate with, or criticise a car driver, another friend is temporarily lost to the Force.  The result is a lack of co-operation and a feeling of resentment on the part of the general public because of the way in which they are treated, and the only target on which that resentment can be visited is the unfortunate man in blue, who is only doing something he is detailed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The Minister is responsible for the fact that the Garda are being used as a buffer between the public and the Minister.  In doing this, the Minister is unfair to the Garda.  That is one of the reasons why there is at the moment a lack of co-operation, and it is not the fault of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer is the use of police dogs.  I do not want to say much about this.  I detest the idea of dogs being used to discipline or control human beings. I have a personal dislike of the species of dog used, the Alsatian.  I know what these dogs are like.  This use of dogs can be traced back to the arena in Rome, when wild dogs were set on human beings, to tear them asunder, to provide a spectacle for society.  Later in history, dogs were used to track criminals.  They were also used in the penal settlements. Many an escaping Irish so-called felon was tracked and savaged by bloodhounds.</P>
    <P>The pattern was brought up to date in the past 20 years in the extermination camps in Germany and the concentration camps in Russia.  Dogs were used for disciplinary purposes. As a result of the experience gained in these camps, the idea was subsequently adopted of using these dogs to control crowds in certain countries. Ireland is one of the countries which has decided on the use of dogs.  I gather certain regulations are laid down for the use of these animals. I disagree with their use, but the Minister has decided and it is, therefore, policy: they are to be used in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am not against the idea of the use of these dogs as tracker dogs to track down criminals, but I think there should be a limit to their use. I do not subscribe to the view that they should be used for breaking up crowds or against people, as recently happened, marching in a peaceful procession.</P>
    <P>It was a horrible thing to do.  I have a personal feeling that the Minister himself believes their use on that occasion was a mistake.  If that is the case&mdash;and I am giving him credit for <Col N="889" /> believing it is&mdash;he should be man enough now to say to the public that it was a mistake.  If he did that, he would be doing a lot of good in the interest of co-operation between himself, the public and the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that on the occasion when the dogs were used, the conduct of the majority of the Garda was exemplary, but there were one or two individuals whose conduct was anything but exemplary, and we have to-day the position that the Garda as a whole are blamed for the actions of one or two individuals.  The people of the city of Dublin are very annoyed at the idea of dogs being used in that fashion, and they are taking it out on the entire police force.  If the Minister were using his thinking cap, even at this late stage, he would say it was a mistake, that the one, two or three individuals, members of the Force, who were involved had misbehaved themselves on that occasion, and that they would be reprimanded or disciplined or that an inquiry would at least be held.  He would clear the reputation of the entire body of the Garda in the process.</P>
    <P>If the Minister took that action, he would bring about a great deal of co-operation and he would restore the confidence of the public in the Garda. The conduct of the majority of the Garda was, as I said, exemplary, and we cannot blame the majority for the conduct or misconduct of one or two. The Minister should take that action even at this stage rather than make the type of mealy-mouthed statement he made to the House.  Before I leave that question, I should like to say that I think it was a poor show on the part of certain members of the Oppositions to suggest that anything was planned that night because people were looking for publicity&mdash;that they were looking for free publicity, and in order to get it allowed themselves to be bitten by dogs.  That is the interpretation I put on the remarks made by a number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>I shall say no more about the police dogs except to urge the Minister to hold an inquiry and pin the blame for <Col N="890" /> what happened on the individuals concerned and make it known to the public. If he does that, he will clear the air so far as the Garda and the general public are concerned.  This incident has undoubtedly brought about a grave feeling of uneasiness in the public mind, and there is only one way to clear the air.  The majority of the Force were not in favour of what happened that night and the Minister should, even at this late stage, clarify the position.</P>
    <P>There is another matter upon which I should like to comment.  I have done so before, and I have heard other Deputies referring to it.  It is the question of guards of honour for judges when they go to the circuit courts or to the High Court.  I do not intend to refer to salaries, emoluments or &ldquo;perks&rdquo; enjoyed by the people who hold such high office.  Undoubtedly, there must be respect for the position they hold, but there is no need for anyone in this House to suggest that we should reach the stage of practically lighting candles in front of them.  We are not going to do that for members of the judiciary, high or low.  I want to make it quite clear that what counts in this country is justice.</P>

      <P>All the paraphernalia and pomp and ceremony have nothing to do with the question of justice.  They are a sham and they take away from the value of justice.  Justice should not depend on the use of pomp and ceremony.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a situation, as I see it regularly in Roscommon when there is a court in session, that anything from 12 to 16 members of the Garda are drafted in from stations up to ten miles outside the town to provide, at whatever time the court is sitting&mdash; let us say 10 o'clock&mdash;a guard of honour for the judge as he walks into the court.  They are lined up in two rows at 10 o'clock in the morning and he walks majestically between them into the court.  They have to stay in the town all day.  They have to hang around the town&mdash;able-bodied men who are fed up with that type of nonsense&mdash;and <Col N="891" /> at 5 o'clock when the court adjourns, they assemble again into two ranks and the judge walks through again.  That is all done to impress the public that justice is being done.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, we have reached the stage when that type of nonsense should be cut out.  The cost, even though it is substantial, of bringing in Gardaí who should be doing their other duties, is a minor issue, but the whole thing is demeaning to the general public.  The general public are educated and intelligent people.  They do not need that type of ceremony to impress them that justice is being done. I accept that the majority of the people are intelligent, but I am afraid the Minister and Governments who have held office over the years do not accept that the public are intelligent, because they use these ceremonial effects to frighten the public.</P>
    <P>Inside the court, we have the position that has been referred to here of the gentleman on the bench and counsel attired in the most mediaeval fashion in wigs of all colours and shapes.  There again the idea is to impress the public.  They are relics of the old times when the court went in session to frighten the ignorant peasantry down the country.  They are relics of that age when there was so little respect for the ordinary citizen that it was thought necessary to impress him to tell the truth by this frightening apparition before him of the judge in a wig and a guard of honour for the judge.  We have of course a situation at Christmas time when a man dresses up as Santa Claus.  That is done to make children happy, and no one minds it.  It is a little game; but when we are dressing up our judges in a similar fashion, not to make the people happy, but to frighten them, that is a different kettle of fish.</P>
    <P>It is time that an end was put to the guards of honour and to the pomp and ceremony attaching to the dispensing of justice.  The Minister knows that in the country which he and his colleagues are always quoting, America, there is very little of this <Col N="892" /> type of nonsense.  It is not too soon to bring about a change here because the mentality displayed by the Minister&mdash; and I am not saying this personally to this Minister; I am referring to other Ministers for Justice&mdash;is that the ordinary citizen will not have respect for the law, unless this pomp and ceremony is indulged in.  That is an insult to the intelligence of the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House any further.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider the question of bringing about co-operation between the Garda and the Department.  If he gives serious consideration to the point I made, he will see an opening there.  If he is not prepared to do that, there is only one alternative left and I do not think it fair at this stage for me to suggest it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his Department are provided with information by the World Health Organisation, or otherwise, as to the names and nature of drugs, which are available only on <Col N="895" /> prescription in the various countries of the world; if so, whether he will state the number of drugs which are available only on prescription in Northern Ireland but which are freely available to the public here; and if he will give a list of such drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Information of the detailed nature referred to by the Deputy is not furnished to my Department, with the exception of occasional communications from the World Health Organisation, through the United Nations, concerning narcotic drugs only.  These form a relatively small proportion of the drugs currently in therapeutic use.  The communications I have mentioned are sent to my Department by reason of this country's adherence to the International Conventions for the control of the special category of drugs which have addiction-producing potentialities, and all other Governments which are parties to these Conventions are furnished with the same information.</P>
      <P>In regard to the remaining portion of the question, while I would like to facilitate the Deputy, I should point out that he is asking me to furnish detailed information regarding the administration of the domestic laws of another State.  This is a matter for which the Government does not have responsibility to Dáil Éireann except, speaking generally, in those instances where an international arrangement might otherwise provide.  I can say, however, that there is a fairly wide range of substances available in Northern Ireland only on prescription which are more freely available here. In that connection I would point out that circumstances differ in various countries and, as far as this part of Ireland is concerned, the fact that no recommendation has yet been made by any authoritative medical or pharmaceutical body for restriction on the sale of such preparations would indicate that there is no apparent abuse or misuse of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the sale of a drug is permitted on prescription only, a person here desiring to use the drug, has to meet the expense of consulting a medical <Col N="896" /> practitioner in addition to the cost of the drug.  Consequently it would not be justifiable to impose this restriction in relation to any substance except where harmful effects might result from its use or there is at least <i>prima facie</i> evidence of a danger of abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have made quite a number of points in the debate on this Estimate.  I do not propose to reply to them all or deal with them in detail but I do want to assure all the Deputies, who spoke and have made known points of view on particular aspects of the work of my Department, that everything they said will be carefully considered.  If it seems to me, after careful consideration, that anything appropriate or useful can be done, then that will be done.  I am grateful to the Deputies who commended the work of the Department in one way or another.</P>
      <P>In regard to others who have been critical of myself or my activities, I say that I appreciate their criticism is offered with the highest possible motives, I am sure, and with the laudable object of improving the situation. I recognise that it is of the essence of Parliamentary democracy that these criticisms should be freely voiced and, indeed, cheerfully accepted on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch, Deputy Donegan and Deputy Timmons spoke about boys' clubs and suggested that State assistance for these clubs should be made available in some form or other. I fully realise the value of the activities of these boys' clubs and I think that a proper view of the working of the Department of Justice with <Col N="923" /> regard to the enforcement of law and order and the prevention of crime would not regard the Department's work as commencing at the time that a crime is committed.  Indeed, a broad view of the work of the Department and of the Garda Síochána should regard it as extending back beyond that point to the origins of crime and endeavouring to foresee the causes of crime, and, where possible, to take action to eradicate those causes.  In that regard, the activities of boys' clubs and similar organisations of that nature are invaluable.</P>
    <P>The State, of course, does come to the aid of these clubs in many ways. Substantial amounts of financial assistance are made available, not through my Department, but from other sources.  I will examine and see whether there are any additional ways in which my Department or the Garda Síochána can be of assistance to these clubs in their very laudable activities.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy mentioned the probation system and Deputy Timmons suggested that we did not have sufficient probation officers in Dublin.  I, my Department and, I think, most people, who have studied the problem, are firmly convinced of the enormous value of the probation system.  Indeed, the inter-Departmental Committee, which is sitting at the moment, is going very carefully into all aspects of the system.  As far as I know, for the manner in which the system is operated at the moment, the number of probation officers is adequate.  It may be, however, that the system itself and its operation could be very considerably expanded and that that extension would necessitate the appointment of additional officers.  If that is so, we will not hesitate to make available whatever resources are necessary to make the system work as efficiently and as beneficially as possible.</P>
    <P>Of course, the probation system can be abused.  One of the distressing things about the present situation is that very often the probation system is not invoked when it should be and frequently it is used when it should not be.  Deputies may have been horrified to read in the newspapers of the <Col N="924" /> probation system being applied in cases where hardened criminals are up before the court for the fifth, sixth or seventh time.  On the other hand, I frequently come across cases where the application of the system would have been invaluable but, for some reason, the justice in his discretion decided not to avail of it.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful to the Leader of the Opposition for the many useful things he said about juvenile delinquency, psychiatric treatment, Marlboro House, industrial schools and so on.  I can assure him that everything he has said will be very carefully considered.  Indeed, any offers of the sort he mentioned which may be made to us will be very gladly availed of, if at all possible.  Marlboro House is, of course, the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  I know that the Minister has in mind replacing the existing building.  I think that the &ldquo;go ahead&rdquo; has actually been given for a new building on the outskirts of the city to replace it.</P>
    <P>Here again, let me repeat my invitation to the Leader of the main Opposition Party to come and see St. Patrick's, where really useful and valuable work is being done.  I cordially invite any Deputy who is interested in these matters to pay a visit.  We will facilitate in every way any Deputy who wishes to visit this institution.  The same applies to Mountjoy Prison where Deputies will also find that a great many new things are being done.</P>

      <P>It is only one of the many improvements that are being made.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned traffic wardens and suggested that the Department of Justice was to some extent remiss in these matters.  The true picture is that the Department of Local Government are responsible for traffic matters generally&mdash;traffic legislation and so on&mdash;and the local authorities also have a responsibility and a participation. In fact, the Department of Justice and the Garda enter the matter only in so far as the enforcement of the law is concerned.  If local authorities decide to provide traffic wardens, that is a local authority service which they provide in pursuance of their duty as a local authority and it does not in any way relieve the Department of Justice or the Garda of any of their responsibilities.  It is something which local authorities must decide to do of their own accord.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. Lynch asked about lorries which travel on our roads, carelessly laden.  The situation is of course that a prosecution can be taken by the Garda against persons offending in that manner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall refer the matter to my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, who is responsible for things of that sort.  Deputy Colley mentioned a number of matters and I was interested to find a clash of opinions between him and Deputy T.F. O'Higgins on the matter of civil juries.  I hope that the committee sitting at the moment will very soon get down to a full examination of this matter and let us have a recommendation which can be brought here to the House and <Col N="926" /> decided on one way or the other.  In that respect, I would appeal to all members of both professions, solicitors and barristers, to submit any useful ideas they may have to that committee in regard to the workings of the courts generally, reduction of the cost of litigation and so on.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley spoke about law reporting and I want to tell him that very question is being examined by my Department at the moment.  We all agree that the present system of law reporting is not satisfactory; we have been carrying out an examination of the position and are considering an alternative system of law reporting.  I hope to come up with some suggestions soon in that regard.</P>
      <P>In the matter of law of evidence also, I readily agree with Deputy Colley that a number of questions could be agreed between the parties before the hearing.  Expert evidence and so on could be agreed by the parties before coming to court.  That is something I hope the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure will deal with and on which we might get a recommendation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley mentioned the question of the removal of the sum of £14 which up to quite recently in the solicitors profession was levied on apprentices and paid over to the Benchers.  I want to claim some credit for bringing about that valuable and noble reform but I also should pay tribute to the Benchers who graciously agreed to the change, which was long overdue.  I think the Benchers are to be complimented on their agreeing to that change.  It is not easy for any of us to give up a privilege which we have held for many years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley also mentioned the question of registration of title and the system which obtains in the Registry of Deeds and in the Land Registry.  Again, I can assure him that we are at the moment working on a new Registration of Title Bill which is well advanced and which, with any luck, will be introduced in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy reminded me of that because it is something I had intended to mention. I agree with him on the general principles of the approach to law reform and the manner in which he suggests it should be pursued.  The normal system of law reform is to proceed by way of amendment, first of all, followed by a consolidation measure. That is the practice which is followed on most occasions where Departmental legislation is concerned, such as the Housing Acts and the Fisheries Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Minister's failure to do that caused him trouble over the Official Secrets Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would you think so? I think a lot of the legislation with which we are dealing does not readily lend itself to that particular procedure and indeed the other procedure of amending, consolidating and codifying at the same time is sometimes better in the case of a lot of the legislation which comes within the ambit of the Department of Justice.  The method which Deputy Dillon outlined is undoubtedly the best where most of the existing law on the subject is contained in statutes and where the amendments are not terribly significant.  Then it is almost certainly advantageous to amend first and then have a consolidating measure, but where you have a situation, as we had in the Hotel Proprietors Bill where a lot of the law is common law and where the amendments are fairly substantial, then I think it is desirable, and you get quicker results with adequate safety, to proceed in the way we did&mdash;doing it as one operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a lot of the law is old and outmoded, I think it is as well to clear it off the Statute Book at one operation rather than repeat and carry it forward in a consolidation measure. This latter system has this advantage: it enables the House, when a Bill comes before it to review in full debate all the law on the subject, whereas if you come into the House with an amending measure, the House can deal only with the amendments <Col N="928" /> in that measure without being able to advert to the whole of the law affecting that particular subject.  Both methods are valid and both are suited to different types of operation.  My approach to the matter would be to use whichever is more appropriate to the particular type of operation you are trying to carry out.</P>
    <P>Deputy T. Lynch mentioned the question of persons coming to the aid of Gardaí Síochána and incurring injury. He wished to know what the situation was with regard to their being compensated.  I am not sure what particular case he had in mind.  In all types of cases of this sort we make <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the people concerned. We have no reason to believe that anybody has been dissatisfied with the payments we make.  I can assure Deputies that any public-spirited citizens who come to the aid of the Gardaí in this way are never at a loss and that we make reasonably generous provision in the form of <i>ex gratia</i> payments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins and Deputy Corish mentioned the grading of films and the issue of limited certificates.  It is a difficult subject and one on which there is scope for genuine and honest disagreement.  Both systems have advantages and both systems have disadvantages. So far, none of my predecessors has been persuaded that there is any real advantage in making a change.  I am prepared, certainly, to look at the system again and to see whether circumstances have so changed that we should make a change at this stage.  I doubt if that is so but since the matter has been raised I feel I should give an assurance that I shall examine the matter.  The difficulty, of course, is that we are trying to apply an arbitrary age limit. <Col N="929" /> It is terribly hard, at the point of entry to a cinema, to decide between the ages of 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or 21&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly if it is a woman, as Deputy Sweetman says.  The question of the proficiency tests in Irish in the Garda Síochána was raised.  I think everybody is now satisfied with the position.  This Irish proficiency test was introduced in 1959 and made, to apply, retrospective to an earlier date.  The Garda Representative Body came to see me and protested about this.  They pointed out that it brought about a situation where a member of the Force could have passed an examination and been fully entitled to be promoted and could have gone along for years on the understanding that he was in a position to be promoted but, suddenly find that his position had been changed and he was no longer entitled to be promoted.  There was an element of unfairness in that, I think.  The Government agreed that that was so and they altered the situation to make the requirement for the test apply only from the date it was announced &mdash; July, 1959.  Therefore, it applies only to persons after that date and any element of unfairness in the situation has been removed.</P>
      <P>Somebody mentioned the rather silly type of interview given to a newspaper some months ago by a former chief superintendent.  I feel I should be restrained in dealing with that sort of action.  I agree fully with Deputy Murphy who deplored the fact that a former officer should lend himself to that sort of thing.  It would be very undesirable if officers generally in the Army or the Garda Síochána&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;or in the Department of External Affairs or in any other Department were to proceed, after their retirement, to divulge confidential information of any sort.  I do not know what prompted this officer to engage in that type of activity.  Some <Col N="930" /> of the statements attributed to him seem to me a little unreliable, to say the least of it.  He is quoted as saying that he had sent appeal after appeal to the Department of Justice to remedy conditions.  There is no record anywhere in my Department that they ever received any appeals from him. That is only to be expected.  He had no function in regard to matters of that sort nor was it ever his duty to communicate with my Department in regard to these matters.  I may say that these matters were dealt with through the Commissioner and the Representative Body.  I feel I should not say too much and that I should be restrained in dealing with the gentleman concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins asked for an assurance that the present Representative Body machinery is adequate and that there were no complaints with regard to it.  As far as I know, it is entirely adequate.  Certainly, no complaints have been communicated to me or to my Department or, as far as I know, to the Commissioner about it. I have said on a number of occasions and I am glad to take this opportunity of repeating that if there are any complaints or if the members of the Force at any level feel that their machinery can be improved in any way then we shall sympathetically consider any suggestions for such improvement.</P>
      <P>There has been some public comment recently and some Deputies have mentioned Communist activities in the country.  I want to assure the House that I am fairly fully informed on everything that goes on.  While my Department or the Garda Síochána can never be complacent about any form of activity of that sort, I can say that a very great deal of what has been said or written in the newspapers recently has been grossly exaggerated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy also mentioned, and Deputy Corish adverted to a similar subject, the question of court funds and funds lodged in court for minors and others.  As far as I can gather, the situation with regard to the payment of moneys to persons who have been made wards of court is unsatisfactory at the moment.  This is a matter which is entirely within the jurisdiction of the High Court and I have no official function with regard to it.  I understand that there is some ground for complaint on the grounds of delay.  In any case which came to my notice, I did what I could to expedite it and I shall continue to do so.  I understand that there has been some dislocation because of changes in personnel in the office of solicitor to the wards of court in recent years. It is a matter in which my Department has no particular function, but in so far as my good offices are of any help I shall be glad to use them at any time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish is coming to a different point now.  I was going to deal with this matter Deputy Corish mentioned, the question of sums lodged in court for minors and juveniles which are invested and which are reduced in amount when they come to be paid out, are less than the amount awarded.  I am afraid some instances of that sort did happen and the case Deputy Corish adverted to is typical.  It arose through nobody's fault.  Court funds of this nature were invested in a particular type of security which had no redemption date.  That is where all the trouble arose, but it was not just the court funds alone that were invested in this security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Government funds of different types were also invested at the same time and also suffered loss. <Col N="932" /> While we must regret very much that unfortunate people whose money was lodged in court suffered loss, nevertheless I am afraid there is nothing we can do about it at this stage, except to ensure it will not recur, and I can assure Deputies that is the position.  Steps are now being taken to ensure that all these moneys are invested in such a way that there will be no loss of capital when the time comes to pay them out of court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the security is chosen with an eye to the redemption date, and the date on which the child will become of age to draw it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman is quite right in that.  The aim will now be to make sure that the redemption date of the security will coincide with the date the money is to be paid out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot help that. That arises out of general economic conditions.  The case Deputy Corish mentioned was even worse in so far as, apart from the normal decline in the value of money, the actual amount of money paid out was only about half what it should have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin asked some questions about the situation in our prisons and made some suggestions. I am glad to be able to inform the House that things are improving consistently in our prisons.  First of all, to deal with one specific point Deputy Sherwin made, there is no case where there is more than one prisoner to a cell.  Fortunately, our prison population is not high and we have adequate accommodation to cope with our needs.  This inter-Departmental Committee which has been set up is very energetically tackling the whole question of penal reform and has already made a number of valuable suggestions <Col N="933" /> for improvements which are being implemented in our prisons.</P>
    <P>An illustration of the sort of thing we are doing is the proposed appointment of prison welfare officers.  It may come as a surprise to Deputies to know we never had prison welfare officers up to now.  A moment's reflection will convince anybody of the value of such people.  This is the sort of work this committee is doing in regard to our prisons and I think really valuable results will come from what is being done.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, prison nowadays must be regarded just as much as a place of rehabilitation as a place of punishment and the object should be as far as possible to send the person out of prison ready to take up the life of a useful member of society.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pretend I am dealing fully or exhaustively with all the points made.  However, these are the ones which seem to me to call most for comment.  In conclusion, I wish to repeat my assurance that everything which Deputies have said and suggestions which they have made will be carefully and earnestly considered and, where necessary, action will be taken in regard to them.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £20,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and <Col N="935" /> Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid. </P>
    <P>This Estimate is necessary to provide for the preliminary expenditure on Ireland's participation in the New York World Fair.  The Fair, which will open in April, 1964, is being held in celebration of the Tercentenary Anniversary of the city of New York.  The central theme is &ldquo;Peace and Understanding&rdquo; for the purpose of educating the peoples of the world as to the inter-dependence of nations and the need for universal peace.  About 75 countries will have pavilions in the international section of the Fair.  The city of New York is in a special category as far as this country is concerned in that it has for so long been a port of entry for Irish emigrants to the United States and a place of residence of millions of Irish birth and descent. The Irish form one of the main population elements of the city.  I feel sure, therefore, that Deputies on all sides of the House will agree that, despite the substantial cost, there are very good reasons why Ireland should be represented at an international exhibition of the magnitude contemplated for the 1964 World Fair.  We are fortunate that a site of modest proportions has been secured in a very favourable location in relation to adjoining sites, including that of the United States, and ease of access.</P>
    <P>The problems involved in participation in the Fair have been under examination for some time by an Inter-Departmental Committee.  In considering what form our exhibit might take, the Committee concluded from the outset that any ideas should be discarded of presenting an expensive technical exhibit or one containing mechanical novelties aimed at capturing the imagination.  Such an exhibit would be costly and would not be characteristic of the Irish scene; in any event we could not complete in this field with wealthier nations.</P>
    <P>Suggestions as to the form of the exhibit were sought from numerous <Col N="936" /> State-sponsored, trade and cultural bodies.  The various ideas received were considered from the viewpoint of whether it would be possible to present an exhibit based on one central theme. No acceptable single idea emerged from the suggestions but an idea common to most of them was that a realistic image of Ireland and of the Irish people should be presented from certain aspects, including economic development, tourist attraction and cultural attainments at home and abroad.  The Committee noted that it is the practice of many other countries in preparing for exhibitions of this kind, to aim at presenting in an attractive way the industrial, commercial, cultural and social life of the particular country, including a reference to their contributions to international welfare.</P>
    <P>They recommended, therefore, that the most practical course to adopt would be to present a comprehensive image of this country using for this purpose the broad divisions of (a) economic development, which would depict selected aspects of industrial, agricultural and commercial activity and would include a reference to the facilities afforded for investment by foreigners, (b) tourism, which could include a display of tourist, recreational and sporting attractions, and (c) cultural attainments, in which could be featured Irish contributions to the development of other countries, particularly to the United States, and to the achievement of world peace.  A display of this type would be consistent with the central theme of the Fair and would also possess the advantage that some positive benefits by way of increased trade, tourism or investment by foreigners might result from it.</P>
    <P>I should explain that our display will be a national exhibit and will not take the form of a presentation of individual manufacturers' products. Particular products will be featured only to the extent that they are required to contribute to the general impression to be conveyed.  I think it will be generally agreed that the Committee's recommendation affords the best prospect for presenting a suitable exhibit at the Fair.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="937" /> The Government have entrusted responsibility for the design of the exhibit to a prominent Irish architect. In order to deal adequately with the many complex problems connected with the construction of a pavilion and an exhibit at a World's Fair in the United States, the Government have authorised the architect to engage the services of an American architect and exhibition designer of international repute who, in addition to designing and display, will also supervise the construction of the display and the building of the pavilion.  I am satisfied that outstanding professional advice has been secured for the project and I am convinced that our exhibit will attain an extremely high standard.  The plans for the exhibit are well advanced but they have not yet reached the stage where I could describe them in detail to the Dáil.  Without wishing to exert any undue influence on the Committee or on the professional consultants engaged, I have expressed the view that our exhibit should not take the form of a glass and aluminium structure but should consist of something constructed on traditional lines which would have a high prestige value and which might include a colourful presentation of different aspects of Irish life.</P>
    <P>The cost of constructing and operating an exhibit at the Fair, which will continue for six months in each of the years 1964 and 1965, is likely to be considerable.  The Government have felt it necessary to limit the expenditure on the project to a maximum of one million dollars, or approximately £360,000.  The bulk of the expenditure will be made in the financial year 1963-64 and will be provided for in the Estimates for that year.  Strict control will have to be maintained over expenditure on all aspects of the project to ensure that it is kept within the limit prescribed. The Supplementary Estimate which I am now presenting to the Dáil makes provision for preliminary expenses likely to arise in the current financial year, comprising such matters as site rent, professional fees and expenses, and other miscellaneous expenditure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="938" /> I recommend that the House should approve of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the difficulties in connection with any World Fair exhibition is, of course, the fact that for the small country to present anything is comparatively a much heavier burden on its resources than it is for the large country.  The policy, therefore, in the past has been to pick out specific exhibitions or fairs in which participation by us would be of advantage and to concentrate our energies and resources on those rather than endeavour to skim a little through all of them.  It has been a wise policy. It is perfectly clear, whichever policy we adopted in the past, that so far as the New York World Fair is concerned, in 1964 and 1965, it would be unthinkable for this country not to participate and to be represented in it.  As the Minister has said, the amount of toil, sweat and energy in human beings from Ireland that has gone into building up the United States of America, entering through New York, has been so considerable that we must of course take part, no matter what the cost may be.</P>
      <P>I hope, however, when the exhibit is being planned, an attempt will be made to portray our country in a more dignified way than sometimes has been the case in the portrayal that has come in some instances to be regarded as normal in the United States of America, Too often in the past it has been represented that the Irish were a wild and uncouth race of people, going over there to fill jobs and to carry out tasks and to occupy places not of the highest order. To some extent, perhaps, we have occasionally contributed to that idea ourselves by portraying a type of stage Irishman that has gone long ago. It is absolutely essential in an event such as the New York World Fair that the portrayal should be on a wholly dignified plane, that it should build up, not the conception that there may be in some people's minds of what the Irish are, but the image of what we should like them to appreciate us as being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="939" /> To digress very slightly to an aspect of a motion that is down for consideration by this House on another occasion, I have to doubt that one of the difficulties of getting Irish whiskey drunk in the United States of America is that unfortunately Irish whiskey has become typified there over the years as a drink that is taken in brawls and in the lower class saloons.  That, of course, is entirely away from the fact, entirely untrue, but, unfortunately, it is the image that has been created over the years and it has made the task of selling whiskey in America infinitely more difficult.  This is an occasion where we will have an opportunity of portraying the image of our country, of selling the image of our country, and if there is to be any error, I hope that error will be on the side of over-stressing dignity rather than overstressing anything else.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Minister that the fair will be open in the last six months of 1964 and will run through the first six months of 1965.</P>

      <P>It will involve a very high maintenance cost for everyone during the intervening six months, but of course it was a decision that was not taken in consultation with us; it was a decision of their own and clearly, as I say, one with which we have to fall in and agree.  It would be unthinkable that we should not participate. I do not know whether the Minister yet has any indications of a more detailed description of the image to be portrayed.  I can understand it quite well if he says at this stage he has not and, in that case, I assume he will be prepared to give us those details when his main Estimate comes along for consideration next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="940" /> I trust that while the ideas of an architect will be given free rein, yet, at the same time, the decision on those ideas will not be left entirely to architectural people.  It would be unthinkable for what I may, perhaps, describe as a layman to endeavour to plot and plan what is an architectural concept and what must be developed by someone who has the training and ability.  I do not know, quite frankly, whether I am peculiar or not but I certainly would not at all agree that the decision should be left to such a person alone. It seems to me that it is far better for a skilled person to make the presentation and for someone who is, shall I say, typical of the viewer, to be the person finally to determine whether the presentation as put forward by the architect is correct or not.  In this case I suppose the person should be the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>It would be highly undesirable that the Minister should just give general instructions to an architect or an architectural committee&mdash;I understand an American expert is to be brought in&mdash;and leave the entire matter to them.  It should be quite clear that the decision rests with someone else, presumably the Minister, unless he has delegated it to some lay body, apart from the professional body, and they therefore would be more likely to be governed by the reaction of the person who will see it than by the reaction of the person who wants to create it. Without in any way being critical of creative people, we all know they are rather inclined occasionally to think that something that is startling is the acme of creative work.  That may be so in certain respects, but in this case the guiding principle should be one of presenting a dignified image of our country rather than a startling one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible for me to say whether one million dollars is a sufficient amount to establish an Irish exhibition in the New York World Fair and therefore, I leave it to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his advisers to say what the proper amount should be. It would also be impossible for me to say what the picture to be shown <Col N="941" /> in the Irish exhibition would be, but I do not think anybody could take exception to the three themes that might be depicted in the Irish exhibition. I certainly agree with Deputy Sweetman when he says we could do much more harm than good, as we have in other cases, by giving the impression that this country is still populated with what the Americans and other people regard as stage Irishmen.  If we have emphasis in any way on the pig and the clay pipe, we can do much more harm than good.</P>
      <P>I did not know how modest or how extravagant this effort is going to be, but the Minister is much more conscious than most people of the harm that might be done if our effort would seem to be too niggardly.  If it was too niggardly and gave the impression of a poverty stricken country we would do much more harm than good. I also agree with Deputy Sweetman when he says that the construction and the general lay-out and design should not be left entirely to an architect.  I am certain the Minister did not intend to convey that in his speech but that the architect would be solely employed to set up, so to speak, or design the actual framework of whatever pavilion this country is going to have.</P>
      <P>I assume that in the general presentation of Ireland through this pavilion many other bodies will be consulted including&mdash;and I thought it might have been mentioned by the Minister but perhaps I missed it&mdash;the Arts Council.  Irish industry, I am sure, will also be consulted.  As I said, it is impossible for me to say what money should be spent or to suggest a theme or a picture and I merely want to say that as far as we are concerned we do not object to this proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that our country should be represented at such a very important event as a World Fair.  In the modern world in which we live it is highly important for a small country such as ours to try to get it across to other nations that we are a progressive nation and that we have made great strides, in the past 40 years, towards a better standard of living and greater efficiency in manufacturing goods and in achieving in <Col N="942" /> general the national aims of our people. I feel that all our exiles, and there are thousands if not millions of them in the United States, will during the course of the World Fair pass along those international stalls and exhibits. I am confident they will be greatly thrilled if the country of their origin is seen displayed in those shop windows with articles manufactured in this country which can compare favourably with those of any other nation.  We pride ourselves on our manufacture of spirits, particularly Irish whiskey.  If our people in America bought one bottle of Irish whiskey per year, that would be of immense value to us.  It would be much better than all the advertising indulged in by the distillers to try to put their products across.  Similar products from other countries have been heavily subsidised and highly advertised for generations past.</P>
      <P>I believe that those of Irish extraction who visit this World Fair will be very glad to see portrayed there some of the individuality of their own nation.  Apart from the display of goods, I presume some attention will be paid to letting people know that the Irish language is still alive.  Indeed, it should be used in advertising some of these displays.  I believe it would be an added attraction to my mind, and very often, the non-national likes something different.  We could get it across that we have made tremendous progress in every sphere of our national endeavour.  Our own people would be delighted.  Bodies such as Gael Linn could help in promoting this exhibition. I commend the Minister for introducing this Supplementary Estimate and hope that advertising will be of a very high standard and that it will repay one hundredfold not alone in prestige but in securing fresh markets and augmenting those already established there.</P>

      <P>While I have no objection to this Supplementary Estimate, I want to ask the Minister, in the name of common sense, why it is we have to wait so long before making an attempt at Government level to take part in a World Fair?  For the past eight years in London, there has been a food exhibition at which 87 <Col N="943" /> countries have shown their goods. Every civilised agricultural country has taken part in that exhibition; yet we have not thought it worth our while, living within three hours of London, to put up even one small stand to show Ireland to the world. Now we propose to spend £20,000 on a prestige effort in New York.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is a million dollars, I do not know where we will end.  A Deputy on the Fianna Fáil benches talked about the possibility of getting Irish people in America to drink Irish whiskey.  I presume the distillers will be given an opportunity to display their products on this stand. The distillers have been subsidised for the last eight years by the taxpayers and they have failed to sell any of their products in any market in the world.  I know we have Irish connections in America.  There must be at least 20,000,000 with Irish blood in them.  As the Fianna Fáil Deputy said, if these bought one bottle a year they would be doing a good turn for the home country.  Have they made any attempt to do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>If some of the Irish people at home brought it, they would be doing a good turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Despite all the publicity, what sale has Irish whiskey got in America in the past five to seven years?  Remember, £80,000 a year of the taxpayer's money has been devoted to helping these people to sell their product. Will portion of this money go again in the form of a hidden subsidy to these people who have failed the national economy by their failure to sell their goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a consumption of <Col N="944" /> £600,000,000 of spirits in America. The Scotch market is about £47,000,000.  The Irish market is not even a fraction of one per cent.  Yet, we are proposing now to spend $1,000,000 to show Ireland at the New York World Fair.  I have no objection to an expenditure I thought was in the region of £20,000, to do what every other country is doing, namely, display its goods, but I would prefer to see this sum being spent where we would get a return for it; that is, across the Irish Sea, only a short distance away.  I am afraid this Estimate is founded on what all this Government's Estimates seem to be founded: &ldquo;Far away fields look green&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with Deputy McQuillan in his estimate of the number of Irish in the United States of America.  It is estimated that there are about 40,000,000 with Irish blood in them in America.  It would be very wrong, I think, for Ireland not to take part in this World Fair.  I should like to hear from the Minister what kind of exhibit we will provide. He did say goods would not be shown by individual firms.  Do we propose showing Irish products or will it be a purely prestige pavilion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a prestige pavilion and goods will be shown only in so far as they will be consistent with the general theme of the exhibit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are curious corollaries to that.  I do not know, for instance, whose goods will be shown.  Taking whiskey as an example, will all Irish whiskey be shown, or whose whiskey will be shown?  Will there be no &ldquo;punch&rdquo; selling?  Will it be a very decorative effort?  The results for us might not be so good.  It may not be fair to question the Minister on details like this at the moment.  We must take part in the Fair.  We have an empire in America.  Our links are closer, stronger, more influential than ever before.  There is more than trade involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the pavilion, I do not know who the architect is.  I have <Col N="945" /> a great fear of architects.  I think architects are all a bit &ldquo;screwy&rdquo;. Two or three should always be engaged, to keep an eye on one another.  Above all, some lay people should be brought in to watch the architects.  I do not know if the Minister has considered recruiting assistance from someone on the Arts Council or setting up a committee of citizens who would be conscious of the need for attractiveness and dignity.</P>
    <P>The Minister used the word &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and said that he was inclined towards it himself.  I am not quite sure what he means.  Sometimes I am afraid of that word.  It led us in the past in the wrong direction.  The British, in their advertisements in America, and particularly in their tourist advertisements fill pages with old English cottages, Beefeaters and bits of history.  It has become rather a joke because the British do not pay much attention to those things themselves, but the Americans do.  The Americans think the British countryside is littered with that paraphernalia, as if England had not advanced since the 16th century.  The British convey that to the Americans and the Americans like it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of many kinds.  They also sell Scotch more efficiently than we are selling Irish whiskey.  I am a bit uneasy about this. I have every confidence in the Minister and in his own willingness to listen to other people's advice.  A thing like this could be a mess or it could be something of which we should be proud.  I have attended some few exhibitions and I feel that the bigger countries overpower the smaller countries with the type of pavilions and stands they provide.  We should try to get our message across in as simple and as charming a way as is within the bounds of good taste.  The Minister should consult all the organisations that have links as between this country and America, whether they are travel organisations or trading organisations.  I am sure the Minister <Col N="946" /> will ask Córas Tráchtála to co-operate with him on this job.</P>
      <P>He mentioned that he proposes to stress three things: agriculture, industry and tourism.  I hope that is not the order in which he proposes to stress them.  That order should be reversed.  I do not see any point in advertising our agricultural produce and progress, if any, in the United States.  There is not a great deal of point in advertising our industrial products because very few of them will sell there except the traditional ones, and whiskey, in which there is room for expansion.</P>
      <P>Tourism is another question.  It is most important in view of our other activities in carrying tourists here.  Tourism should be the keynote of the stand which we erect.  At an exhibition like this, the stand should be subjected to the most critical scrutiny by people most competent to scrutinise it.  We should not move in the direction of excessive modernism and we must be very careful about the traditional because it is a very tricky and sometimes a humiliating procedure. I am not sure if the old thatched cottage is the right line to take.</P>
      <P>It is very necessary that there should be co-operation between all the bodies who might advise the Minister.  No one group of people should overpower the organisation.  I do not think it would be unfair to ask the Minister to see that the initial preliminary plans of the proposed exhibit should be made available to members of the House before a final decision is taken.</P>

      <P>I was at an international housing conference in Brussels a few years back, during the period of the Brussels World Fair.  There were some quite stupendous exhibitions and the Russians seemed to have the most spectacular of all, with their sputniks and their other accomplishments.  The Russians and Americans between them captured the show.  We had a small stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you are exhibiting in a foreign country where a foreign language is spoken, you do not get a very good result.  Here we are dealing with an exhibition in the States where they <Col N="947" /> speak the same language as we do. Therefore, we will have a 100 per cent advantage over the people from non-English speaking countries.  As has been said, we have over 20,000,000 Irish people in the States.  I know New York because I lived there for a while, and I know that all the nationalities are well-organised.  It would pay us to work in conjunction with these organised societies, especially the Irish societies.</P>
    <P>Since we are interested in tourism as well as trade, some attempt should be made to organise the Irish in America to bring some tourist business here around the period of the exhibition. A large number of Irish people could be inspired to come here by what they see there.  Almost everyone goes to these exhibitions.  The international exhibitions are such a sight that few people miss them.  I am sure that many people who have thoughts of visiting Ireland and feelings of wanting to see their homeland again could be encouraged to come here if we had organised excursions, and in that way we would get back some of the money we are expending.</P>
    <P>I am always impressed by excursions and organised affairs not left to the individual.  There is a Thursday excursion to Belfast that does well because it is cheap, well organised and advertised. I am sure they make three times more money on that day than on any other day of the week.  By organisation and perhaps cutting prices, large numbers of Irish people could be encouraged to come here.  At this exhibition, we have the advantage of exhibiting to the Americans and to the other nationalities who have become acquainted with the English language. That is a tremendous advantage which we should not miss.  I am sure that if the Irish in America were organised to come back here as tourists, they would come, and the dollars they would spend would make up for what we are expending.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the other speakers that we should have a stand at this World Fair in New York, but there is one word of caution and warning I should <Col N="948" /> like to give to the Minister.  The Minister is a lawyer and he knows that many a good case has been lost by too high an opening.  Counsel in opening to the jury very often open too high and a very good case is lost as a result.</P>
      <P>We should endeavour not to exaggerate what we have to offer to any visitor to this country.  I have seen some magazines produced by Bord Fáilte and one would imagine to look at them, seeing people bathing on strands, and seeing the various ballrooms, that we were in one of those Las Vegas establishments of din, gin and sin, instead of giving a true picture of what our Irish seaside resorts are like.</P>
      <P>There is not much use in displaying our agricultural produce on a stand in New York, unless there is some hope of selling it there, and I am afraid that if we are to sell our agricultural produce abroad, we will have to look more to the east than to the west.  I see no prospect of selling very much of our agricultural produce in the States.  Again, in regard to our industrial produce I cannot see very much hope of our exporting that to the United States of America, but we can sell our tourist attractions to the States and we should concentrate on them. We should give a true picture of what these people may expect when they come here.</P>
      <P>As a result of the establishment of the Inland Fisheries Trust, we have improved our Inland Fisheries considerably. As a result of the activities of voluntary bodies, we have now improved our sporting sea fishing as distinct from industrial sea fishing.  We have our golfing, our shooting and our scenery.  These are all things we can put across, thus attracting a considerable number of tourists to visit here in passing on their way to Continental countries.  But, for goodness sake, let us not paint the picture too rosy.  If we do so, when these people have come here once, they will never come again.  We will be only doing more harm than good, so far as making them advertising agencies for our tourist attractions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers have spoken about one thing we could export, that <Col N="949" /> is, Irish whiskey.  At present at least 80 per cent.  of the whiskey consumed in the States is imported from Canada and Scotland, and only a very small percentage &mdash; almost a fraction of a percentage&mdash;comes from Ireland.  How many of us have had the experience of seeking Irish whiskey in New York and seeing how it is presented, as distinct from how other whiskies are presented?  It is something the Minister could look into.  Some Deputy pointed out that there is a considerable sum spent each year in subsidising the export of whiskey.  We can make very good whiskey here, but not everybody can sell it.  A serious effort should be made to channel our whiskey through some of the agencies through which other whiskies are being channelled in the States.  If we could do that, I have no doubt that whiskey is one of the commodities we could freely export.</P>
    <P>Another commodity we could export &mdash; it is a small one but it has become a big attraction in the States at present&mdash;is carrageen moss.  I have seen small packets of it sold in the States for as high as half a dollar.  We are very lucky if we can get three shillings a stone for it here, selling it in bulk.  It is something in which Bord Iascaigh Mhara might interest themselves, and something which we might advertise at a fair such as this.  There is not much use in advertising our butter, our beef and our industrial products because we can never hope to compete with the United States in these products.</P>
    <P>I have much sympathy with the Deputy from Cavan who suggested that Gael Linn should be brought in. I am afraid, however, the American businessman is a very hard-headed gentleman and he is not too interested in our Irish language.  We should be interested in putting across to him in a language he understands what we have to sell.  That is the important thing.  Let us try and assist the language in other ways, but we would be carrying it too far by bringing it across to the States and endeavouring to advertise our produce there through the medium of the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I do not begrudge the expenditure <Col N="950" /> of £330,000, if we can get something for it.  It is sad, as Deputy McQuillan pointed out, that there has been an exhibition in London for the past eight years at which we are not represented. I was unaware of that and I presume the statement is uncontradicted. Even if we have not done so in the past, surely London is now one of the places where we should show our products, in view of our forthcoming entry into the Common Market?  We should show them not only for London but for all the other countries of the Common Market.  In addition to this £330,000 for the American fair, it might be possible for the Minister, even at this stage, to channel some moneys towards the displaying of our wares at the food exhibition in London to which Deputy McQuillan referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister on deciding that we should exhibit at the New York World Fair.  It is a step in the right direction. Such actions are badly needed in the interest of our country.  I note what the Minister said about the presentation of the exhibition, that it will not take the form of individual manufacturers' products.  I appreciate we could not do that and ensure that all the different manufacturers were represented satisfactorily.  But undoubtedly we will have to display some goods, and I was wondering if we would avail of this opportunity to display the products of the Irish Sugar Company, who are doing excellent work in the matter of food processing &mdash;a type of food very acceptable to the Americans.</P>
      <P>If we are to display Irish whiskey, an understanding should be arrived at beforehand on the manner of presentation to ensure it conforms with proper standards.  Everybody will agree that the behaviour of the Whiskey Distillers' Association here is not the very best, having regard to the way they try to push their wares.  Sometimes they appear to be quite content just to stay easy and not make any progress. They are satisfied to avail of all the forms of subsidy extended to them down the years to promote their sales.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to explain my point.  Not so very long ago, the Whiskey Distillers' Association were asked to join in furthering the sales of whiskey outside the country.  They were asked to give a measly few bottles of whiskey for an exhibition, 12 bottles in all.  There was great difficulty experienced by the promoters in getting three bottles from each of the members.  The exhibition was held in Torquay and was so successful that there was a terrific demand for cases of Irish whiskey.  The Press people were very impressed with Irish coffee, but the people who put on the Irish coffee had to pay for the whiskey.  That is the type of attitude to which I am referring.</P>
      <P>Thousands of pounds have been spent in America on furthering the sales of Irish whiskey, and how far have we got?  We have made no progress at all in securing portion of the market from Scotland.  We do not seem to have the right technique. I would hope that the day will come when we will send whiskey to America and that it will go through one source alone, approved by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this matter of exhibitions, we should try to have some exhibition of a permanent nature nearer our own country.  Why can we not have permanent exhibitions in England, particularly in London.  Manchester and Liverpool?  A sum of £360,000 is to be spent on this New York programme and I would hope a similar sum would be spent putting on exhibitions nearer home, say, in London, trying to make them of a permanent nature.  We will then be in a position to sell more goods.  We <Col N="952" /> talk of thousands of Irish people in America but we should not forget the thousands and thousands of Irish people who are forced to live in England, Scotland and Wales.  They are just as patriotic as the American-Irish; in fact, they are more patriotic and obviously care more about their country because they are sending home money during the years since they were forced to emigrate when they could not find employment here at home.</P>
    <P>Apart from those people, if we had permanent exhibitions in different parts of England, we would help tourism by bringing to this country many more English people.  It would all depend, of course, on the image we presented.  We must be very careful to ensure that we do not give misleading impressions to people we are urging to come here.  I agree with Deputy Barry when he suggests we should put tourism first when considering efforts of this kind.  Obviously, we stand to gain a great deal from tourism by bringing the English, the Americans, the Scottish and the Welsh visitors over here.  By doing that, the benefit will also be felt by agriculture because we shall have to feed the tourists.</P>
    <P>I hope when this exhibition takes place, there will be perfect understanding in regard to the theme.  It could easily happen that the architect would be told to do something, would do it, and when done, you would find that it is not to the complete satisfaction of those who commissioned it.  Then it is too late.  I hope the American architect who is being approached in conjunction with our own, will understand that he must conform strictly to instructions given and not give rein to his imagination because Americans have an odd way of assessing our characteristics.</P>

I attended the Brussels Fair some years ago and the impression I got was that it was all too symbolic and that if we were similarly represented there, it would have been of no practical value to a small country not particularly interested in world power and prestige. Almost the entire effort there <Col N="953" /> was concentrated on the actual pavilions, as if to see who could produce the most expensive, the biggest or the most unusual building.  We should not be interested in that aspect of it, in which in any case, we cannot complete.  It is of no value to us.  We should be anxious to provide a building that will give us adequate accommodation and be reasonably ornamental and attractive in appearance.  That is all we require and it would be foolish to put a lot of money into the building itself.</P>
      <P>We should use it as a means of achieving the maximum sales value and we should concentrate the expense on having the best possible representation available there when the time comes.  We should have the maximum information available with the maximum quantity and variety of our goods.  We should have sufficient people there to talk to all who come along and explain what we have and make the greatest possible effort.</P>
      <P>In Brussels, it was very difficult to get anybody interested in what was on the stands.  Because of the symbolic theme, I suppose, you were expected to appreciate everything happening in the country.  Possibly it was intended to make one inquisitive but you could not get any information you wanted there on the spot about the various countries.  We should make the most of this opportunity to sell Irish goods to those who will come to see this stand.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that the approval of the House has been so fully given to this Supplementary Estimate.  When the Government examined this proposal at first, they did so with some trepidation.  They gave it very close and careful study and only after that did they decide to participate in this World Fair.  They felt, as the House obviously feels, that if a World Fair is being held in New York of the magnitude envisaged, it is one World Fair that Ireland should not be out of.  Contrary to what Deputy Sherwin suggested, we were not in the Brussels Fair.  No doubt the Government of the day weighed up the pros and cons carefully and decided not to go in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> Like many Deputies who spoke, I visited the Brussels exhibition and one would require a week to see all that was to be seen there.  In the short time at my disposal, I found that one of the most attractive exhibits was that of the comparatively poor country of Morocco.  Its exhibit was sited in a corner beside a site occupied by the Russians, the Americans, the Vatican and, a little further away, the British.  In the immediate vicinity, the competition was fairly strong but that exhibit impressed.  It was on traditional lines and not garish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry suggested there was a connotation of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; that he did not like.  The context in which I used the word was in regard to the building and that was one decision I took without caring who advised to the contrary, that there would not be a glass and aluminium structure because every American who will visit that fair will have emerged from a plethora of glass and aluminium before reaching it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman suggested that I might be able to give an idea of the form of the structure. I fear I am unable to give much detail. It will not be a square building but it will have a fairly favourable site quite close to the American exhibit, which, no doubt, will be of fairly pretentious proportions.  Of the 75,000,000 people expected to visit the fair, the vast proportion will be Americans and there will be a great advantage in having our exhibit close to the American.  We can reasonably assume that many Americans who will visit the American exhibit, whether or not they have any ties with Ireland, will at least see, and I should say, inevitably come to visit our exhibit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope to have an attractive entrance, not necessarily a door, that will lead one in.  Then, there will be a little patio probably in the open air and that will lead into the main exhibition hall.  None of these will be on a pretentious basis.  By and large, these were the ideas the architect got, having visited the site itself and <Col N="955" /> having discussed the amount of space at his disposal.  That general concept would appeal to most Deputies.  I cannot at this stage give any more details about it.  I suggest it ought to appeal to Deputies rather than having a square building with a door opening on an avenue or road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that, but as the Deputy will understand, when you have too many cooks, it is very difficult to formulate any unified idea.  I certainly will consider it.  I want to assure the House, first of all, that I, for one, will not have anything like the clay pipe and the leprechaun. I would be very conscious of the manner in which we can portray ourselves in the United States.</P>
      <P>I was there quite recently myself, as the guest of the National Foreign Trade Council, who held their convention in the last week of October.  I was conscious of the manner in which an Irishman can present himself and being conscious of that, I was not going to put a clay pipe in my mouth, metaphorically speaking.  I spoke to a man who had an Irish name.  I presume he had Irish ancestry.  He is in an important position.</P>
      <P>I was reading the other day in Tatler's Column in the <i>Irish Independent</i> a reference to this man's conversation with me.  This same man who was at a lunch asked me about Irish economic progress and about many other aspects, including the licensing laws about which I was able to give him some information.  The only quotation in Tatler's article was to the effect: &ldquo;Oh sure we passed a law to open the pubs on St. Patrick's Day last year.&rdquo; That certainly was not the impression I got myself of the conversation I had with this gentleman.  I was very disappointed to read it.  I have asked for the original article and will convey my displeasure to the gentleman concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is easy to convey a wrong impression to the people in the United States because they want to believe these things about us.  I mention that to <Col N="956" /> indicate how concerned I would be to take the clay pipe and leprechaun out of it.</P>

      <P>In regard to the freedom of action of the architect, as Deputy Sweetman suggested inevitably he will have to have a certain amount of freedom.  He has been in touch with the Committee that has been set up to steer this project through.  As I said, there is a Committee on which all the Departments that could be interested are represented, including the Office of Public works.  By that participation we have professional representation on the Committee.  The Committee have found the architect most helpful and sympathetic in regard to any ideas they have put forward.  While, of necessity, he has his own individuality, he is not going to get an entirely free hand.  The architect is in America.  He is a young Irish architect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Not directly, but the Committee keep in consultation with <Col N="957" /> the Arts Council as it does with all other bodies that would have any interest, such as the Cultural Relations Committee, Bord Fáilte, Córas Tráchtála, the Industrial Authority, Aer Lingus and so on.  There is full consultation as occasion arises with these people.  On the advice of the Irish architect, we appointed an exhibition designer.  I mentioned the name of our architect.  He spent some years under that famous American architect, Mr. Wright.  He had a certain knowledge of the American scene.</P>
      <P>As a result of that knowledge, he had contact with another exhibition designer whose eminence is well-established. One would wonder whether we should rely upon an exhibition designer from Ireland or elsewhere. We found, I will not pass any comments on the quality or otherwise, that, on balance, once we got an exhibition designer of sufficient calibre and his knowledge of and sympathy with Ireland were established, it would be better to have such a man on the scene. That man, in fact, was an architect.</P>
      <P>We discovered, apart altogether from his interest in Ireland, that having appointed him, he came of his own volition to Ireland on holidays with his wife.  He has a very high regard for the Irish people.  I can assure the House that I was very much impressed with this <i>post factum</i> knowledge of the interest of the exhibition designer in us.  We are well satisfied with this man's appointment.  I believe we will be well satisfied with the presentation of Ireland.</P>
      <P>On that subject, I endorse entirely what Deputy P. O'Donnell said.  We are not going to do it in a ballyhoo way.  Personally, I do not like ballyhoo. I think it would be wrong to present a front that would not be borne out in reality.  This will be an honest portrayal of Ireland and the Irish people.  It will show, I hope, a compact country whose affairs are well managed, whose feet are firmly established on solid ground and whose people are not only dignified and well conducted but realistic.  It will show a country pleasant to come to and pleasant to live in.  These are the general ideas I have of what we will require.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> Mention was made of the lack of participation in the World Food Fair in London.  I have not any close knowledge of the food fair in London but I have knowledge of our permanent exhibition at Frankfurt in Germany.  Down through the years we have found it difficult to interest Irish manufacturers in taking stands or parts of stands at these international fairs because they say the cost of participation is never reflected in the actual returns to them.  They find it more valuable to send representatives directly to known customers or potential customers in those countries so that fixed exhibitions in places abroad are not always the best way of making progress.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have a premises in Regent Street, London, in which they house regularly Irish products.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to get suitable space in that part of London and to get it elsewhere would not be of much value.  The particular drawback that the premises in Regent Street has is that under the lease none of the tenants is permitted to display any products outside, so that one has to go right in and down a corridor of perhaps 30 feet in length before one sees anything in that premises.  Therefore I should say active steps have been taken to remedy that position and I hope that before long we will be better able to present Ireland in the heart of London, where Deputies obviously agree that we should do so.</P>
    <P>I think I have covered most of the points made.  I want to associate myself with Deputy Sweetman in his rejection of an allegation made by Deputies Mullen and McQuillan.  He knows, and I know, that perhaps to some extent the difficulties there are in the way of protecting Irish whiskey.  We did make an effort in the last few years, which was contributed to by the whiskey distillers themselves, in the United States.  There was this institutional campaign, which was sponsored mainly by CTT with financial assistance from the Department of Industry and Commerce Vote, but at the same time there was an obligation on the distillers to contribute to that campaign. The Irish whiskey distillers are concerned not so much about the <Col N="959" /> extent to which Irish whiskey is selling abroad as to the extent to which other whiskeys are selling in this country and they propose to do something about it.</P>

      <P>I have got some information about what they propose doing and I can promise here and now to give them my full support.  I would urge on Irish people who like Irish whiskey not to take other whiskey just because it is fashionable or a fad. I believe that many people take whiskey other than Irish whiskey because they feel it is the thing to do. That mentality prevails in our whiskey-drinking public too much.  I shall not say any more at this point because we will have a fuller debate on this again when the time comes for the main Estimate.  This Vote is for £20,000 which will cover the first year's rent.  The cost of the site will be roughly £26,000.  The amount sought here will, as I say, cover the first year's rent, which is either payable forthwith or before 31st March, and certain other incidental expenses.</P>

      <Col N="960" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will came in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Finance, including the Paymaster-General's Office.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this token Supplementary Estimate is to afford the Dáil an opportunity of debating the group of Estimates normally moved by the Minister for Finance.  That group of Estimates was among those allowed through in the Dáil without discussion last Session on the Taoiseach's undertaking that opportunities of debate would be afforded this session. The group comprises the Estimates for the President's Establishment, Houses of the Oireachtas, Central Statistics Office, Comptroller and Auditor General, Office of the Minister for Finance, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, State Laboratory, Civil Service Commission, Superannuation and Retired Allowances, Secret Service, Expenses under the Electoral Act and the Juries Act, Agricultural Grants, Law Charges, Miscellaneous Expenses, Stationery Office, Valuation and Ordnance Survey and Rates on Government Property.</P>
    <P>The total original net estimate for 1961-62 was £294,300.  A further sum of £2,500, mainly to meet the balance of the cost of the eighth round salary increases, was obtained from Vote No. 56.  The total net provision of this year's main Estimate, £351,460, shows a net increase of £57,160 over the original net figure provided last year. The total gross increase was £59,260 but we deduct from that a sum for decreases of £2,100 which gives us the net figure of £57,160.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming on to the main matters which I wish to discuss on this group of Estimates we can perhaps use the time available this evening to deal with one or two of the smaller ones.  The Minister is responsible for, among other things, the Stationery Office.  In connection with the Stationery Office, I want to say that while I have always received the greatest possible courtesy from those in the Government Publications Sales Office in the GPO Arcade, at the same time I do not think they are always allowed to keep sufficient stocks there to meet immediate needs.</P>
      <P>It may be I have been looking for Ordnance Survey maps which were either in keen demand or were out of print, but some effort should be made if possible to increase the stock available in the Arcade so that maps can be obtained without going up to the Ordnance Survey Office in the Park in an emergency.  Let me say that, without question, if a certain map is not available in the Arcade, it is always made available by going up to the Park, if it is in print, but that is not a journey that is either convenient or always possible.  It may be that the difficulty is one of space.  I do not know what storage space is available but it is certainly something that should be borne in mind in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, it is the Stationery Office itself, I understand, which allots the printing contracts for the registers and for the documentation of this House.  In relation to the registers, I have heard complaints in counties other than Kildare that the electors lists were not furnished on the due date, that is to say, 22nd November, <Col N="962" /> because they had not come from the printers.  The Stationery Office are responsible for ensuring that the printing contracts are such that if a delivery date is imposed on the printers, that date should be adhered to.  The Minister and every Deputy is aware that for reasons which the Committee on Electoral Law Reform examined and found were necessary, the period of time between publication of the electors lists and the latest date for claims, and even more so for objections to those lists, is all too short, and it is as much as people can do in their various constituencies to get the check of the electors list through in that period, if they desire to do so.  If the electors lists, in consequence, are delivered late, it means that that period is cut down even more and the task becomes a virtual impossibility.  The Minister, therefore, should make certain that the Stationery Office will so arrange their contracts that they will get proper delivery from the printers.</P>
    <P>The Stationery Office, too, I imagine, are responsible for the binding of the volumes of debates of this House and of Seanad Éireann.  I do not understand why there has to be the quite unnecessary time lag in the issue of bound volumes of debates there is at the present time.  Apart from the difficulty of keeping individual numbers of the volume in order for oneself, if one wants to refer to them regularly, there is the question of indexes.  We are running now in the eighth volume of unbound debates.  To find one's way through those&mdash;to find Questions, replies, references&mdash;without the advantage of any index, such as there is in the bound volume, is a totally unnecessary difficulty which is being created for the members of this House.  It may be difficult to get that work done &mdash;I do not deny it&mdash;but it can be done.</P>
    <P>Private people can get their binding done.  If they are able to get it done, I do not see why the Government should not be able to ensure, through the proper authority, that such a delay does not occur.  I would ask the Minister, between now and when we resume this Estimate on Tuesday next, to examine this position and to be able to give us not merely some information <Col N="963" /> but some positive assurance on Tuesday that that work will be brought up to date so that we shall not start off the Dáil next January with the same backlog as there is at present.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the question of maps from the Ordnance Survey.  One would like also to know what progress is being made towards the remapping of the country, particularly the remapping of those areas where there has been some considerable alteration in the geographical features.  The remapping particularly of areas bordering towns is a matter requiring urgent attention continuously and not merely that it would be done one year and then left aside.  It seems to me a matter that would require to be brought along the whole time.</P>
    <P>The Minister is responsible for the Revenue Commissioners' Department, even though, under the law, the Revenue Commissioners have a certain amount of autonomy, as indeed is proper so as to be quite certain that no use can ever be made of the Revenue Department for the purpose of the individual wishes of a Minister in regard to political matters.  At the same time, he has control of it and it is necessary therefore that he maintain that control. In 99.9 per cent of the cases with which in recent years I have had contact with the Revenue Commissioners, the courtesy I received, without people realising that I might be a Deputy, is quite phenomenal.  The kind of trouble to which they go to ensure that the appropriate facilities are given to the person concerned to understand his rights as well as his liabilities needs no commendation.</P>
    <P>There are, however, one or two cases unfortunately where that is not the case.  The best way of ensuring that such cases do not become too frequent is for public criticism to be made of that unfortunate minority on an occasion like this.  I have come across individuals in the Revenue Department who seem to think they are only one degree removed from the Lord Almighty.  If that idea were allowed to spread&mdash;I am glad to say it has not been allowed to spread&mdash;the <Col N="964" /> position of the ordinary taxpayer would be quite intolerable.</P>
    <P>I think it proper, too&mdash;speaking today on the day the Final Report of the Income Tax Commission has been published&mdash;that I should take advantage of the opportunity to express publicly my personal thanks&mdash;because I set up the Commission&mdash;and thanks on behalf of our Party, our thanks, for the work those individuals have done in preparing their several reports. Whether one may agree or disagree with all they have reported, nobody can deny that they have taken an immense amount of trouble to try to sift the evidence backwards and forwards and to endeavour to arrive at conclusions suited to the national economy rather than the tax regulations anywhere else.</P>
    <P>I see in the report that apparently there were some 142 meetings of the Commission.  Attendance at a meeting of the Commission is by far the least of the jobs the members had to do. I was aware, when I was Minister, of the vast amount of submissions being put before them, even at that time, and of the immense amount of work that had to be done in order properly to understand those submissions. That has gone on, I imagine, ever since.  I want therefore to say that the thanks of everyone in the country is particularly due to the members who performed that task gratuitously and for no reason other than that they felt it to be a public duty to serve their country in that way.</P>
    <P>I think it would be wrong if I did not say that a word of thanks is also due by us, not merely to the members of the Commission but to the Revenue Department on the members of which the sittings of the Commission imposed a very big additional strain, as well as to the members of the professional bodies who gave such information and assistance and help as they could to the Commission in its labours.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>The following table gives, in the form requested by the Deputy, the number of national schools in which all subjects except English were taught through the medium of Irish for the year 1960-61. The figures for the year 1961-62 are in course of preparation and will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the statistics sought are not available in my Department and their preparation would involve an inordinate amount of time and labour.</P>
