    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before reporting progress last evening, I had been referring to the glowing tributes paid by Deputy Moher to the agricultural policy Deputy Dillon has been advocating for some years past.  Deputy Moher gave us, too, a pretty graphic picture of the prestige of the industry in his area.  I made the point that, in spite of the undeveloped state of agriculture, the <Col N="2510" /> industry was still, and would continue to be, the foundation of our entire economy.  It provides a livelihood for approximately 50 per cent. of our people and produces a very large share of the national wealth.</P>
      <P>In his introductory statement, the Minister was able to tell us that the agricultural industry in 1961 accounted for approximately 70 per cent. of our total exports.  Deputy Dillon has on many occasions stated that agricultural production is capable of being doubled.  This is a view to which I subscribe wholeheartedly.  What is the present position?  What indication have we of the efforts that are being made at the moment in relation to this industry?  As I know the attitude of the Government, it is that any increase in production would be undesirable and would, in fact, lead to further difficulties for the Government.</P>
      <P>I regard that as a shocking indictment of Government policy at a time when every Government in Europe, with an interest in agriculture, is straining every nerve and bending all its energies to increasing agricultural production.  We have problems and difficulties but these problems and difficulties did not start to-day or yesterday.  They are due to the fact that we have failed to look ahead and to keep abreast of developments elsewhere. We have, in particular, difficulties in the disposal of our dairy products.  They are due to many causes.  They are mainly due to over-concentration on our lowest priced, home-produced product, butter.  They are due also to our failure to provide incentives to our dairy farmers to produce cleaner milk, milk capable of being processed into higher-priced, more diversified and more saleable products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are due also to the fact that the costs of production are too high. They are too high because the milk capacity of our cows is low and we have made very little effort to increase that capacity.  We have failed to provide the advisory service that would impress upon farmers the importance of good quality pastures, the importance of producing such pastures, of profitably grazing them and of conserving <Col N="2511" /> them, the importance of providing large quantities of high quality bulk feeding for the winter periods. We have done something to improve the milk producing quality of our cows through AI but not half enough is being done in progeny testing of bulls.  Coupled with the AI service we should have a veterinary service because there are very considerable annual losses through cows failing to hold calf for the normal period.</P>
    <P>This is very important since our cattle numbers are dropping so drastically. There has been a drop of 112,000 in our cattle population in the past year.  This is a serious matter because we imported about £8,000,000 worth of animals in that year.  It may fairly be said that the eradication of bovine tuberculosis has been responsible in some measure for the reduction in stocks but since this is in some way an artificial removal of cattle some artificial measure will have to be adopted in order to replace them.  I am slow to suggest how it should be done but something in the nature of a grant will have to be provided for in-calf heifers if we are to get cattle stocks back to the desirable level.  One of the main planks of the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was a big increase in cattle numbers.  We have not achieved that.  Since 1958 the number of cows has dropped by 18,000.</P>
    <P>We have trouble also with the disposal of bacon and this when we have only 1,500,000 pigs in this country while Denmark, a country much smaller than ours, has 12,000,000 pigs. The Danes appear to have little difficulty in disposing of their bacon at a price very much in excess of what we are able to obtain, a price 44/- to 45/- a cwt. better than we can obtain.  This, again, is due to a number of causes.  It is due to the fact that the Danes have better breeding stocks, better feeding, better management, better curing and marketing processes.</P>
    <P>The pig industry is all important to this country because of the small farm economy that exists here.  We are all anxious to maintain the small or <Col N="2512" /> smallish farmers in this country and to give them a standard of living approaching the standards enjoyed by the other sections of our community. If we are to take pig production seriously we must realise that it is all important that we should import the best possible breeding stock wherever it may be obtainable.  I understand that the best breeding stock available to us is in Sweden.  One of the main difficulties with regard to carcase quality that we have here is the shoulder cut thickness.  I believe that in Sweden the average is 37 millimetres. In Ireland it is 47 millimetres.</P>
    <P>I fully realise that the importation of breeding stock is not the whole answer to our problem, but it is a quick way to get to the position that our competitors have arrived at in the years of testing.  Five or six years ago, when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, he provided the first progeny testing station for pigs and I understand that at that time the plans were well under way for a second one. We are still waiting for that station. I believe it is now being constructed but when it will be ready for use I do not know.  We should now be well on our way towards providing a third station.  The idea that a stock of 1,500,000 pigs is enough for this country is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>Our pig housing is anything but what it should be and our feeding and management generally should be improved.  This is all part of the work of an intensive advisory service but there is not much point in having such a service unless we have an outlet for our production.  I have indicated some of our marketing difficulties but all the talk we have had about selling difficulties has led our farmers into the frame of mind in which they believe that any extra production will lead, as it has always led, to a reduction in price.  The attitude of the Minister, as far as I know it, is that while costs of production are rising and continue to rise and while the cost of living is rising the price of the farmer's produce must be kept down; that under no circumstances must he be allowed an increase in the price of his produce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2513" /> Milk production has been seriously disturbed by this business of reducing the price by 1d. per gallon and then, when the fury of the dairy farmers was let loose, restoring that penny. In the liquid milk producing area, where there is no subsidy and no difficulty in selling, no price increase is permitted.  It is something I fail to understand.  The price of half a pint of stout is a shilling and the farmers are expected to put on the customer's door at 7 o'clock in the morning for seven days a week, twice that quantity of milk at half the price.  If this is not unfair discrimination against the farming community I am not able to recognise it.</P>
    <P>Since the last increase in the price of milk in the Dublin district, agricultural wages have increased by approximately £2 per week and rightly so; if we do not make an effort to approximate the wages of agricultural workers to those of other similar workers we shall have no agricultural workers.  I mention that as one of the costs of productions which have increased considerably.  In view of the fact that there is no subsidy I would ask the Minister to explain why he will not permit an increase in the price of milk in the Dublin district.  It is an end product. It is unlike the produce in the dairying areas.</P>
    <P>There is this aspect of it as well.  The dairy farmers in County Dublin can perhaps increase production slightly due to the increasing demand from the city, but it is confined to that and any farmer who decides to produce milk in excess of that quantity has no outlet.  He has no outlet even at surplus price and up to the present, at any rate, wholesalers have refused to allow new people to come into milk production at any price.  That is a restriction on production but there are many restrictions on production.</P>
    <P>The price of wheat has been reduced in the past.  It has been reduced by the reduction in the quantity of wheat that will be accepted at the mills.  It has been reduced by the inevitable effect of the introduction of more severe standards, especially the colour standard which will result inevitably in less wheat being taken for milling.  It <Col N="2514" /> is hard to understand that attitude also because last year we imported over £6,000,000 worth of wheat.  The Minister does not accept responsibility for standards.  He says it is a matter for the mills.  As far as I can see the millers are allowed to do what they like and treat the farmers as they like.</P>
    <P>Barley has been pegged down to the price at which it has been for some years and there is little justification for this either.  Last year we imported £1.7 million worth of maize and a considerable amount of other feeding stuffs and grain generally.  It is difficult to see how this policy can be supported. In view of the size of our imports one would think that some little extra encouragement would be given to our farmers to produce barley. Barley can now be produced in almost every part of the country because of the introduction of the lime scheme and of high-yielding varieties of feeding barley.</P>
    <P>In an effort to see what could be done in County Dublin to improve the income of the farmers our County Committee of Agriculture got the advisory officers to make a detailed survey of the position.  We may not have a first class committee of agriculture but I would not like to describe its worthiness in the terms in which Deputy Moher described the Cork County Committee last evening.  We tried to make a fair assessment of the position in County Dublin and I think we did it at the Minister's suggestion. He stated that county committees were carrying on in the way they had been carrying on for the past 40 years and it was time something was done about it.  We set about doing something about it.  We got this detailed survey and unfortunately we found that in almost all the traditional lines in County Dublin there was no room for further expansion because of the limitations of local markets.  Wheat is produced pretty extensively.  The attitude there is to reduce production. Pigs and milk were produced extensively. Milk is restricted because there is only a local market and the price is pegged down.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pegged down in regard to milk.  The Dublin District Milk Board has been given overriding authority.  As a member of the county committee I have been bringing all the pressure I can to bear on the wholesalers in the milk trade in County Dublin to do something about a milk processing unit in order to allow some expansion.  The other traditional line is vegetables.  Again we are limited to the Dublin market.  There is no scope for expansion.  In regard to vegetable production there are many areas where valuable crops go to waste because it is not worth while bringing them into the market.</P>
      <P>There are, however, two lines that could be profitably expanded; they are mushrooms and blackberries.  In County Dublin at the present time we produce close on 700 tons of mushrooms per annum and about 500 tons of these mushrooms are exported.  This is a valuable crop and it gives good and well paid employment.  There is no difficulty about a market.  We have a good export market and the prospects of the Common Market are excellent.  During the year I asked the Minister would he be prepared to give grants for the establishment of mushroom industries comparable to the grants available for the establishment of other industries and he refused without giving any good or convincing reason.  We looked for tax concessions which might make it possible to export fresh vegetables and that, too, was refused, so it is not easy to find a way to increase production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to sheep.  I agree entirely that not nearly enough is being done, so far as sheep are concerned, in County Dublin, and in many other counties as well.  The <Col N="2516" /> Department should give a better lead in that respect.  They should set up breeding farms for the production of the right class of breeding ewe and for the general encouragement of sheep production.  The output of both sheep and wool dropped in 1961.  That is a bad sign and it is something that the Minister should be able to explain.</P>
    <P>I referred to market gardening in County Dublin.  We could be the biggest market gardening area if we had the facilities for selling the vegetables. At present there is absolutely chaos in the vegetable markets and when the farmer comes in with his vegetables, he is there half the day before he can get rid of them.  In the county committee of agriculture, we have been trying to organise some sort of processing unit in North Dublin where vegetable production and market gardening is a traditional line, but I cannot yet say if we will be successful. That is the type of development in which I should like to see the Minister take an interest.  Very valuable work could be done through the organisation we have in the county committee of agriculture.</P>
    <P>County committees of agriculture were criticised here yesterday and I think some criticism is justified.  Some changes should and must take place in the way they are elected.  It is not right that they should be elected on a completely political basis as they are at the moment.  That is not the way to get the best type of people on these committees. I am not saying you do not get some very good people under the present system but there should be some way in which the organised farmers will be entitled to representation. Not only would that give us people with a wider knowledge of agriculture, but it would provide the all-important link between the advisory services and the organised farmers.  The greatest platform the advisory services have, and will have in the future, is the platform provided by organisations like the National Farmers Association, Macra na Feirme, Macra na Tuaithe, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, and all the other valuable groups which have been doing first-class work for Irish agriculture over the years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2517" /> I have tried to stress the importance of having an outlet and indicating to the farmers that the outlet is there.  It is the Minister's job to say to the farmers: &ldquo;If you increase your production, we will assure you of a profitable market for that produce.&rdquo;  The Minister has told us that he is proud to say that there was a considerable increase in the amount of artificial fertiliser used by the farmers during the past year.  I want to ask the Minister what did that extra application of fertiliser produce and how much has been lost? The number of cattle fed on the land has dropped considerably.  There was a small increase in sheep&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister's attitude all the time is to fight people he should be defending.  We are told that the income of farmers has increased by £8 million but we know that stocks <Col N="2518" /> have been depleted to a considerable extent and we know that the farmers' indebtedness to the banks has increased over a period of five years from £19 million to £35 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are trying to do something to keep the small farmers on the farms.  I have indicated that the price of pigs has been reduced by about 6/- a pig as a result of the introduction of more stringent standards. I know that these standards are necessary but we have reached them before making the necessary provision for securing those standards.</P>
      <P>We want to increase the number of cattle.  I do not think we are doing anything like what we should be doing to get that increase.  Our veterinary service is not what it should be.  We have done a first class job, in my view, in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. I would say there has been very satisfactory progress.</P>
      <P>We should be on our way towards providing a scheme for the eradication of contagious abortion.  Northern Ireland, Britain and many other countries are either working on this problem at the moment or are preparing schemes. The present position is that we shall get into this country, across the Border, I would say, a large percentage of cows that are rejected because of contagious abortion, the same as happened when we started to eradicate bovine tuberculosis.  It would be an easy matter to eradicate contagious abortion now that we have the veterinary service working on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  We need a better veterinary service all round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need better marketing facilities, and we need, above all, to let our farmers see that no matter how much they produce there will be at all times a profitable market for that production. We cannot arrive at that point until we improve our processing and marketing.  I am glad to see that there are some indications that one bacon factory at least in this country has started pre-packaging bacon.  This has provided a valuable way in Britain for the disposal of certain types of heavy bacon, and so on.  Such a method can profitably be used for any <Col N="2520" /> type of bacon in the near future.  It is a good sign and the industry that is proposing to bring about this extension should be encouraged in every way.</P>
    <P>I have touched on the main points that I wanted to make in regard to agriculture.  All that our farmers want is encouragement through a first-class advisory service and the assurance of a market.  I have no doubt in my mind that we shall get production and that we shall get quality but we have not made an effort to get a market. In that regard, we can well follow the example of the other countries who have got them.  How did they secure these markets?  They secured them because of the quality of their products, to begin with, but they went in and they bought their way into the wholesaling end of the business.  We shall have to buy our way into the wholesaling end of the business and there is probably no other way.  Get into a district, concentrate on that district and expand.  We are prepared to spend a large sum of money&mdash; foolishly, I believe &mdash; on a fertiliser factory.  That money could much more wisely be channelled into the provision of a wholesale outlet for our agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should just like to say a word on agricultural education.  As far as I can see, there is a reduction in the number of students taking agricultural degrees.  In 1958, there were 492 such students and in 1960 the number was reduced to 396.  That, again, is an indication of a lack of confidence in the future prospects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall give the House the numbers for the other places. There is no increase.  They are exactly the same since 1958 &mdash; 584 and 583: that does not indicate an increase. <Col N="2521" /> There is no indication that people have confidence that there will be a future for them as agricultural scientists, as advisers or in any branch of agriculture.  We need them and need very much more of them if we are ever to get anywhere.  The sooner we get down to these main problems, the better.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moher tried very hard yesterday evening to exonerate the Government from blame for what he described as the depressed and deplorable condition of agriculture throughout the country.  How he can set out to exonerate the Government, a Government that have been in office for 24 years, from responsibility for the deplorable conditions which he so graphically described in this House yesterday is more than I am able to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The picture which the Minister painted when introducing his Estimate seemed to be a pretty bright one as far as livestock was concerned but was not nearly so encouraging as regards tillage.  Of course, anybody who lives in the country will appreciate that the small farmer is dependent not so much on livestock but mainly on tillage.  If the price for what he grows is bad then he has a bad year.  Nobody will deny that the small farmer has had a particularly bad year, a couple of particularly bad years, and that prospects do not seem to be improving for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things in which the small farmer will be interested is the rearing of poultry &mdash; particularly turkeys &mdash; and fruit, vegetables, and so on.  He would depend on that as his main source of income.  The picture as regards poultry is that the export in 1959 was 87,886 cwts.; in 1960, 58,530 cwts. and, in 1961, 52,473 cwts. Take turkeys on their own.  In 1959, the export was 59,039 cwts.; in 1960, 31,138 cwts.; in 1961, 29,745 cwts. The Minister will agree that there is something very seriously wrong there because, if the main cash crop of the farmer, poultry, is going down at that rate, there is definitely something wrong &mdash; and the stocks of poultry in the country are dropping.  Therefore, <Col N="2522" /> it would appear that the Minister and his Department must do something to improve that position and do it very quickly.</P>
    <P>Another matter which many of us find difficult to understand is the cause of the present potato shortage.  Why does it happen that potatoes which have been traditionally a crop in this country and which could be grown practically everywhere should be so scarce and therefore so dear?  We were told recently it was because so much potatoes were being exported. In fact, the potato position is similar to the poultry position.  In 1959, the acreage under potatoes was 260,000; in 1960, it was 235,400; in 1961, it was 213,100.  If we come to the export of seed potatoes, the position is again the same: in 1961, we exported 43,300 tons and in 1962, the figure was 32,000 tons.</P>
    <P>It appears that we have here a crop that can be grown and for which there is a real market but, for some extraordinary reason, that crop is not being grown to the same extent as previously.  It seems that we shall soon be seeking an alternative to the potato as we will not be able to get it even for the home market.  I know the Minister cannot just wave a wand and solve all these problems but I believe that the onus is on him and the Department to see that something is done about it.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, while the export of cattle and sheep was up last year, canned meat exports were down very considerably.  Again that is something which should cause alarm because it has been the practice, I understand, for a long time to encourage the killing and canning of the meat here, so that the industry would improve.</P>
    <P>In passing, let me comment that while we must congratulate the Minister on his efforts to conclude the bovine TB eradication scheme, we hope that every effort will be made to ensure that once the country has been finally cleared, nothing will be allowed to make the position almost as bad as it was before.  I am sure the Minister is aware from evidence in other countries that after an intensive scheme, there is a tendency to ease off and that the easing-off has resulted in <Col N="2523" /> T.B. being brought back to herds that had been completely clear for years.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the incidence of TB among people handling cattle has been a factor and while, thank God, it has almost completely disappeared in this country, the recent scare about its return among the over-40s might give cause for a certain amount of alarm.  It is something that should be watched because up to date over £30,500,000 has been spent on the eradication of bovine TB I understand the amount this year is £10,725,500 which is quite a sizeable sum.  Nobody will grudge the spending of the money if it achieves the object intended, but we all feel the Minister must be very careful to ensure that once the country is cleared, it will be kept clear.</P>
    <P>For many years, I have felt that vegetables and fruit represented a field for which there is a big outlet and that the Government should do everything possible to encourage the proper handling of fruit and vegetables.  We know that for most of the year one can buy English, Canadian and Australian apples at 6d., 7d. or 8d. each while Irish apples, possibly because they are not handled properly or possibly for other reasons, disappear completely in the late autumn or early winter, while Irish apples could be bought at a fraction of the price which the foreign apples cost.</P>
    <P>If the Irish consumer is prepared to pay an average of 6d. each for foreign apples, surely some arrangement could be made by which the Government would try to have Irish fruit properly handled, even if it increased the cost to the consumer over the present level for Irish fruit.  I think everybody would gain as a result.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that the Irish Sugar Company have made an attempt to do something in this direction with their fruit and vegetable scheme and I should like the Minister to comment on its progress because it is something that is being watched by all interested in fruit and vegetables in the country. Something which gives food for thought is the recent report of the <Col N="2524" /> British National Farmers' Union which sent a team of fruit and vegetable experts to investigate the EEC position. They reported there was a grave danger of a surplus of fruit and vegetables in EEC countries.  That should be watched closely.</P>
    <P>On numerous occasions, the Minister has said that the entry of this country into the Common Market, if it takes place, will be a great help to Irish agriculture.  I hope he is right.  Is the Minister going to say he did not say that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>My authority is the <i>Irish Press</i> of 3rd May, 1961, which contains a gem from the Minister.  He says that the future for Irish agriculture is one of tremendous advancement, accompanied by a great raising of standards of living of all those living on the land.  That is very optimistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is happening every other day and it will continue to improve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But this statement was made by the Minister when referring to the Common Market.  It was very optimistic and I hope he was right. Unfortunately, I do not believe there will be such a wonderful upsurge and I do not believe the standards of living will continue to rise, unless certain things happen.  I know there is a scarcity in EEC countries of a certain type of beef but we also know that West Europeans do not fall for the steaks as do the people of Ireland and the neighbouring island.  Something will have to be done to get them to cultivate a taste for mature Irish meat if we are to cash in on that market, or else we shall have to change our system of cattle rearing.  Perhaps the Minister will say he can do nothing about that but I suggest that it is something which must be seriously considered, if we are to take advantage of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the dairy farmers and also of the liquid milk farmers has been discussed.  In most counties, even in places like County Meath where land is very good, most small farmers <Col N="2525" /> depend on the cheque they get from the milk people to balance their budgets.  There is no doubt about that.  While everybody says milk is not paying, farmer after farmer turns over to milk production and all of them agree that the regular cheque is what keeps them going.  I do not propose to decide whether that is right or wrong, but I know grave confusion has been caused by something which the Minister has explained was outside his power, the matter of An Bord Bainne putting on one penny levy and the Government restoring the penny to the farmers after a certain amount of to-do.  That has caused much unrest in the farming community, particularly among those who specialise in that type of farming.</P>
    <P>A question that has been posed on numerous occasions and to which the Minister gave the answer a few weeks ago is the cost of the transaction.  What did the collecting of the penny by An Bord Bainne and the paying out again of the penny, after its collection from the smoker by the Government, actually cost?  We are told it is a fantastic sum.  It is one of those things that cause a lot of unrest when people believe their interests are not being properly looked after by the Department that is supposed to look after them.</P>
    <P>The question of education for young farmers has been mentioned by Deputy Clinton who, in my opinion, made an excellent speech.  Except for the little barrage at the end I thought that it was made in a completely non-controversial manner.  Something has got to be done about this question of farm education.  While the technical schools are doing a certain amount there is not nearly enough being done.  The farmers themselves could do a great deal more.</P>
    <P>We have heard a lot of talk about the farm apprenticeship scheme which never seems to come to anything. Perhaps the National Farmers' Association would again attempt to do something about it and try to train people for the job they have to do.  It has been said that the only good farmer is <Col N="2526" /> the man who can learn from the bottom up.  Over the years he is always learning.  If we are going into the Common Market we must be able to deal with the matter in a very up to date manner.  Other countries for years have been taking a deep interest in this type of education. France has gone further than anybody else and has established what is called an agricultural engineering degree. The man who acquires that degree knows everything that is to be known about farming.  However, one of the things they regret is that out of the number who do the course and get the degree only about three per cent. return to practical farming.  The remainder go to teach farming to other people.  That might not be a bad thing and it might be adopted here.</P>
    <P>I also want to deal with the question of farm incomes and farm wages. We are aware that small farmers are receiving pretty small incomes.  Many farmers, particularly in the western portion of the country, have incomes which are less than the wages being paid to hired farm labourers in other parts of the country.  It has been suggested time and again that the reason why farm workers' wages must be kept at a low level is that the small farmer is not able to pay higher wages.  The small farmer does not employ hired labour except in exceptional cases.  The small farmer is even anxious to hire out himself and members of his family as hired farm labourers and therefore he is as much interested in the matter of higher wages as the man employing labour. Over the country where there is good land the average number of men employed per 100 acres is about one. The average per 200 acres is less than two for 52 weeks of the year.  That should be remembered.  There are portions of the country where only one farmhand is hired per 1,500 acres. While some of the land may be very bad there are portions where it is reasonably good and where there is only one man on average per 400, 500 or 600 acres.</P>
    <P>When you take that into account the amount of money which has to be paid <Col N="2527" /> out to farm labourers is not so great as many people would have us believe. At present in certain areas farm labour is becoming scarce.  The reason is the low wage policy.  As long as we have a situation in which a young girl in industry can earn £7 or £8 a week while her father, a skilled man with 20 to 40 years' experience on a farm, can earn only £6 a week, we will not have people rushing into agricultural employment.  According as the use of machinery increases the number required to be employed declines. While some years ago a farmer, what they call a strong farmer, would not be seen walking up and down after a pair of horses now he, or his wife, son or daughter, will have no objection to sitting on a tractor to do the same type of work.  When it comes to the heavy work, however, that is done by the farm labourer.  In addition, if repairs have to be done to agricultural machinery the farm labourer is the man who carries them out.</P>
    <P>According to the Agricultural Wages Board the amount he is entitled to is £6 per 50-hour week.  The neighbouring countries, particularly Northern Ireland and England &mdash; which we have been condemning over and over again &mdash; are paying £3 per week extra for six hours per week less work. Something has got to be done about this.  Somebody may say that we cannot blame the Minister but we can blame him in this way, that the Agricultural Wages Board was originally doing an excellent job but has deteriorated so much that it is not now doing the job for which it was set up. The Minister is responsible for nominating the people who represent workers and employers on the Board.  Some of the people who appeared on the Board as workers' representatives are known to have worked for years as builders' labourers in Birmingham.  In addition to the workers' representatives and the employers' representatives there are three neutral members.  A neutral person is a person who has no interest one way or another in a particular matter.  If he has a bias one way or the other he cannot be neutral.  Surely it is unreasonable to ask us to accept <Col N="2528" /> as neutral a man who employs about 140 people in industry?  In rural areas the wages being paid to agricultural workers influence the wages paid in industry.  Therefore, it is a joke to call that person neutral and we have such a person on the Board.  However, a Bill will be coming before the House which I hope will remedy all that.  The Board has outlived its usefulness and should be given decent burial.  We should deal with agricultural wages in a responsible way just as we deal with the wages of workers in any other industry.</P>
    <P>We should always remember that agriculture, no matter what anybody may claim, is still the primary industry and whether we go into the Common Market or remain outside, Ireland will stand or fall on agriculture.  There should be no doubt about that.  If we keep that in mind we might be more inclined to deal reasonably with the people who are employed on the land.  I would again appeal to the Department of Agriculture to remember that the small farmers of the country have got to get some assistance. The small farmer particularly has got to know that he will get a market and a price for what he produces. If he does not get that, he must go out of existence.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk at the present time about foreigners buying land in this country and how it will interfere with Irish agriculture.  Statements have been made in the House that that is not being done at present on a big scale.  I do not agree with those statements. I myself have pretty conclusive evidence that land is being bought all over the country, particularly in places like County Meath, by various methods, land which eventually will fall into the hands of foreigners.  I should like to make this very clear. As far as the people coming into the farms are concerned, while we do not like to see good land falling into the hands of foreigners, if the foreigners are prepared to give good, well-paid employment on the land, we would have no more objection to them than we have to the people who come in to start some of the so-called factories for which they obtain hefty Government <Col N="2529" /> grants.  A person in rural Ireland who depends for a livelihood on what he can earn working as a farm labourer does not mind whether his employer is a German, a Jew, an Irishman or an Englishman, provided he gets decent wages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested to hear Deputy Tully speaking about the type of farmer who does not like to be seen doing any heavy manual work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I can well understand the type of person who does not like to do any type of work because he is too lazy but I have never met a farmer who can possibly avoid doing every type of work on the farm and continue to survive as a farmer.  Deputy Tully's proposition that the average strong farmer, as he described him, is a sort of semi-gentleman who does little or nothing is hardly tenable in modern conditions.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Clinton was speaking this morning, it occurred to me that it was very interesting to contrast the type of speech he made with the type of speech made here yesterday by Deputy Moher.  It is very easy to take the line taken by Deputy Clinton and to say, quite truly, that farm incomes are not what they ought to be and to advocate a very simple process of the Government or somebody else providing increased payment for their produce out of some source which can be conveniently left aside or unmentioned.</P>
      <P>Every fault that besets our farming or agricultural pattern was laid at the door of the Minister for Agriculture, whether it was his responsibility or not. This is like the vexed question of the price of milk about which all the basic facts are understood by every intelligent farmer.  These things are trotted out year after year by Opposition speakers, with the inference that a change of Government would produce a change in price for the farmer's betterment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I firmly believe &mdash; it is obvious that Deputy Moher also believes &mdash; that the <Col N="2530" /> farmers to whom these speeches are addressed have progressed a great deal beyond this futile stupid chapel-gate kind of politics.  I believe that, in this House in any case, it should be possible for us on this Estimate to talk about this all-important matter of agriculture in an objective and intelligent fashion.  We can save our chapel-gate politics for the proper time.</P>
    <P>It has been the obvious policy of the Government and the Minister over recent years to attack this question of farm incomes from the production end rather than at the top, that is to say, rather to reduce the cost of production and so increase the farmer's income than pay him more for the product he produces which may in many cases be over-produced, as it is, for instance, in the case of wheat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say that milk is a similar case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been described as an over-produced farm product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not subscribe to that view.  It is generally agreed that while we have reached very high proficiency in the production of tillage crops, our grass husbandry is probably as low as one will get in Europe.  Our grass husbandry has been extremely bad.  A start has been made in dealing with that problem, as is revealed by reference to the use of fertilisers in the past 10 years.  In 1950, in units of P2O5.  48,300 tons of P2O5 went on the land of Ireland.  It cost £10 18s. a ton.  This year, that has gone up to 80,800 tons but the price has gone down to £7 14s. a ton.  In 1950, 9,600 tons of K2O were used and the cost was £24 a ton.  In 1962, that figure went up to 65,500 tons but the cost went down to £15 4s. 6d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the nitrogen is used in the production of early grass.  In 1950, we used 6,300 tons of nitrogen at a cost of £18 10s. a ton.  This year that 6,300 tons has increased to 24,600 tons and the cost has gone down to 17 guineas a ton Those figures speak more eloquently than anything I could <Col N="2531" /> say about the action this Government have taken since they came into office in 1957 to attack this vexed problem of grassland husbandry.  Obviously, the problem is so huge that no corrective measure we can take will produce a general result in any short term of years.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the statistics.  There are 11½ million acres of pasture in this country.  I have no doubt at all that the carrying capacity of those 11½ million acres could be multiplied by three.  One and a half million acres are devoted to a crop called &ldquo;other hay&rdquo; and the volume of production which it produces could be got from one-third of the area that would be superior in quality and quantity to what we get now.</P>
    <P>The first part of the problem that I should like to see tackled is what is known as permanent pasture.  Since I myself began to farm, I have made the discovery that there is no such thing as permanent pasture.  When a field is sown down to grass for some time it begins to drop in efficient production. By the end of five years, it will be past its best.  At the same time, by far the biggest proportion of our pasture land is this thing called permanent pasture.  If anybody examines it, he will find it is made up of bent grass, Yorkshire Fog and other inferior grasses which will produce a little wisp of green in the months of summer. The short grass season given by pasture of this kind is responsible for a graph usually printed in the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> every year showing the amount of milk delivered to creameries. If you look at that graph over a period of years, you will find that it is like a saw.  In the months of May and June, when the old permanent pastures begin to produce the little they are able to produce, the graph rises.  In December, however, it has reached a trough and production reaches almost vanishing point.</P>
    <P>It is quite easy, by the use of new leas and, above all, by the use of fertilisers, which are pretty heavily subsidised at present, to extend the grass season, first in the spring of the year. In normal weather conditions, you can <Col N="2532" /> have pretty decent grass growth by St. Patrick's Day.  You can extend it at the other end of the year to 1st December, depending on the first incidence of frost, and reduce the foddering period to a minimum.  In my own parish in Kilkenny, there are medium-sized farmers of from 50 to 100 statute acres running herds of 30 or more cows.  Those cows have green fodder under their heads for 12 months of the year.  The winter gap is made up by strip grazing of kale. This is the most economic way to produce milk.  I have seen it proved by my own neighbours.  The Government subsidy on fertiliser is definitely an advantage.</P>
    <P>One of the most vexed political problems here has been wheat.  I have been clawed about it by Fine Gael Deputies, and from time to time I have done a bit of clawing back.  But, irrespective of that, one great result is that this controversy has made ordinary working farmers, who produce their own living, break up the old leas.  Since the farms were their own, and they were interested in the well-being of their farms, they seeded the leas when they were finished growing their wheat, in a careful way. Some of them discovered for the first time the fallacy that existed previously concerning perennial pasture.  I mean &ldquo;perennial&rdquo; in the sense that they would go on for ever and I am not referring to any particular variety of grass.  I have seen on the records of this House, in the discussions that took place here on compulsory tillage during the war, that very eminent Deputies of that time made most eloquent speeches in favour of the primeval pastures that had been there since the olden days.  They could not be replaced; they could not be broken.  That myth has been exploded, chiefly by the attractive price obtainable for wheat in the past decade. Whether it has slid up or down a little bit is not really important in this context.</P>
    <P>There is no problem at all about multiplying the production of our grass land by three.  It should follow that our production of livestock would be considerably increased.  In that regard, it is necessary to consider the <Col N="2533" /> part that would be played by the co-operative creameries.  I spoke about them on this Estimate last year, and I am afraid I incurred the displeasure of some creamery managers in my constituency.  I want to point out again &mdash;I was very glad to hear Deputy Dillon speaking on roughly similar lines yesterday &mdash; that our present creamery set-up is not realistic and does not fit into the context of the competitive markets we will be entering, possibly, in the next year or two.</P>
    <P>To begin with, the size of the unit is too small.  It may consist of a parish with 200 or 300 cows in it.  Next, there are in my county about 20 creameries, most of them small.  While some of them have done remarkable work within their own areas, there is no coordination between them to make a general attack on the problem.  Grass is the basis of production, but the creameries deal with milk and seldom concern themselves with grass.  We are told by everybody that if we want to succeed in the British and European markets, we will have to have a standardised product of high quality.  Our present creamery set-up will not give us that.  Hundreds of creameries dotted over the south of Ireland are producing butter.  Some of it is very good butter; some of it is indifferent; possibly some of it is bad, though I do not think very much of it is.  The important thing is there is no standard supply of that butter.  Those creameries have their own fixed, little establishments. They are not able to channel milk at appropriate times into the production of other products, such as milk powder, cheese and chocolate crumb. There is one creamery in my locality with a more realistic approach, although it is quite a small creamery in a poor area.  It ploughs its profits into such things as subsidies for lime and fertiliser distributors.  Those efforts, worthy though they are, will be lost because of their smallness.</P>
    <P>There does exist an organisation which receives an annual subvention from this House, the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society, whose duty should be to recognise this problem. It is staring us all square in the face, <Col N="2534" /> and they should see it, too.  As far as I know, they have done nothing at all about it.  They have done very little I can see in recent years.  The spur is being applied to them in certain areas by the NFA and other groups to set up creameries, but, apart from that, the federation and centralisation of the creamery organisation has not been attempted by them or by anybody else.  By virtue of the fact that this House pays this organisation a subvention every year, the Minister is in a position to tell them to put their house in order, and do so at once.</P>
    <P>A Deputy referred to the recent payment of one penny per gallon for milk by way of compensation for the imposition of the levy upon wheat growers.  That penny was welcome, of course, to most people, but I should have preferred to see a payment made for something more tangible.  I should have preferred to see a substantial increase in payment to farmers in the southern area especially for milk from attested herds.  That would be a profitable thing for the Minister and the country; it would pay a dividend to pay 3d. per gallon &mdash; I merely put that figure forward &mdash; on attested milk because it would have the obvious double effect of providing a very effective incentive to farmers in the southern area to get attested, and get attested fast and, at the same time, it would increase their incomes.  The penny that has been paid by the Department, while it is, of course, welcome, is really something in the nature of a dole.  I cannot see how it contributes to the solution of our problems in any way.  God knows, our problems in the southern area are acute enough from the point of view of the production of milk and its subsequent processing.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words in praise of the Department and the Minister for the work they have done in the eradication of bovine tuberculosis. When this Government took over in 1957, the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme was a ludicrous farce.  In 24 counties out of the Twenty-Six it was possible for a farmer to get an annual free test and to identify his reactors, and then do with these reactors whatever he wished.  If he <Col N="2535" /> wanted to sell them to his neighbour he could do so.  As far as helping to solve the problem of bovine tuberculosis is concerned, any activity that took place in these 24 counties before 1957 was nothing except the frittering away of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  There was no herd grant; there was no herd bonus; there was no identification, or earmark, on reactors; there was no defence for a farmer, except his own judgment, when he bought an animal at a fair or mart as to whether the animal was or was not a reactor.  Now the picture is very different.  The Department are moving into the six southern counties for what is described as the &ldquo;final push&rdquo; in the really bad area.</P>
    <P>In his opening speech the Minister mentioned that he was not sure he would have the co-operation he would like to have in some of the southern counties.  I am quite sure he did not mean County Kilkenny because we have been pressing him for a long time now in an effort to persuade him to make ours a clearance area and get on with the job as quickly as possible.  The faster the Department work in the area the better we will be pleased.  We should like, in fact, to see the greater portion of County Kilkenny, where the incidence is very low except at the extreme southern tip, cleared.  The Minister can be sure of co-operation from every farmer in the county.  I know he is aware of that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the arrangement made in relation to the standardisation of wheat, this colour test mentioned is a cause of great anxiety to farmers in my constituency.  Every farmer, and probably every miller too, knows that the colour of wheat varies according to the soil on which it is produced. There are areas which will produce a bright coloured wheat.  There are other areas with certain types of soil which produce a darker wheat, a wheat which, though darker in colour, may be superior in quality.  I hope there is nothing binding, or final, in the arrangements that have been made by the millers and, I believe, the National Farmers' Association for the determination of the value of a sample of wheat by its colour.</P>

      <P>Last year I raised a matter here but I failed to get any satisfaction from the Minister, or anybody else.  I refer to this fraud called the &ldquo;screens test&rdquo; in wheat.  I maintain this has the effect of placing a double penal imposition on the grain grower for the same fault.  If one takes a sample of wheat and that sample bushels 57, the main reason probably why it bushels 57 is the presence of screenings.  Screenings consist for the most part of immature wheat seeds full of moisture, bits of broken grass and weeds that go through the combine as it threshes.  Because of the presence of these screenings the moisture test reads high and the bushel weight is low because of the low specific gravity of the screenings.  The farmer is penalised by bushel weight and moisture content.  The farmer having been so penalised, the grain merchant then comes along with his 2.25 millimetre screen.  He does a test.  He takes out the very same screenings for which a penalty has already been imposed.  He tells the farmer there is four per cent. screenings and proceeds to dock him once more.</P>
      <P>A couple of years ago the Irish flour millers acted as hosts to every county committee of agriculture in the country.  I am sure Deputy Clinton recalls the festivities that took place. The flour millers asked for questions. I asked a question to the best of my ability based on the information I have just given the House.  Perhaps I did not put it very well.  The millers consulted together in a scrum in a corner.  Eventually they told me they would write to me.  They did write but they did not answer my question.</P>

The screenings test is a fraud and the millers have been getting away with it for several years.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the very significant increase in sheep numbers in this country in recent years.  In 1957 we had 1,250,000 ewes and last year we had 2,000,000.  That is an increase of three-quarters of a million.  When you consider that matter in the context of the fact that last year New Zealand sold 18,000,000 lamb carcases to Britain it must be as clear as day that whether we are in or out of the Common Market there is an unlimited market for Irish lamb in Britain provided no liberties are taken by individuals in the export business by way of the substitution of inferior quality products.</P>
      <P>I should like to see our sheep numbers multiplied as rapidly as possible.  There is a very profitable market there for us.  If New Zealand is able to transport economically that vast quantity of lamb across 10,000 miles of sea we are in a very advantageous position to compete.  Regardless of whether we go into the Common Market or not we will continue to sell most of our stuff in Britain and the best we can hope for from entry to the Common Market is equalisation of prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to discuss another political perennial here in the House. That is the question of the small farmers. There have been more idiotic speeches in this House and outside it about the small farmers than on any other subject.  About 90 per cent of these bad political speeches do not deceive anyone, least of all the small farmers themselves.  If you have a farm of ten acres you have got to get a minimum of £40 an acre to make a <Col N="2538" /> living out of it.  There are hundreds of thousands of holdings like that in the country and if we are concerned at all about this question it is time that the Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture got together and reallocated the responsibility for the development of the small farms along economic lines, possibly with the introduction of a new Ministry or subMinistry. There are special problems to be dealt with in regard to the small farmers.</P>
    <P>When I speak of small farmers I have in mind the men who make their livelihood exclusively from their farms. I do not consider the people that Deputy Blowick speaks about annually as fleeing the country.  I find it difficult to see how men with a valuation of £3 to £5 can ever be established in big numbers.  The solution of that problem will have to be found either in afforestation or in industry.  Special attention will have to be given to this whole problem, possibly by the reallocation of the responsibility between the Minister's Department and the Department of Lands.  The time has come to try to do something radical about it if we are serious about the problem at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">

      <P>According to many Opposition speakers the agricultural industry in this country is doomed. According to them the farmer is on the threshold of the workhouse and it is only a question of whether he will knock at the door to get in or wait a few days to see if things will change. Opposition speakers say they have found a remedy to these evils.  The remedy is to put them into Government and they will let loose a horde of inspectors on the farmers and as soon as they do that everything will be all right; between the farmers and the horde of inspectors agricultural produce will increase and there will be no trouble in disposing of it; there will be millions of pigs here and we can send them all to Africa.  The only trouble about that is that as far as I know the Africans have not a great deal of money to pay for the purchase of pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume it will not be necessary for them to find the money because we will establish a society for the provision <Col N="2539" /> of pigs to Africa; somebody will go about roasting them and will burn his fingers and then make a discovery like that made in China many years ago and the Irish farmer will be on the pig's back.  The wonder to me is that when the gentlemen on the Opposition side got all their brilliant ideas about Africa they did not take in Asia as well.  As far as they are concerned the future of the Irish farmer is now dependent on the whims of the blacks.  I would suggest to some of these people who have these brilliant ideas that they should keep them to themselves.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the most profound statements made here on the future of the farmer and of agriculture are generally made by people who have no connection with farming, armchair farmers, theoretical farmers, those who read books and then write to the papers about farming.  I am rather inclined to think that if the farmers' business were left to the farmers it would be a good day's work.  If they were to take up some of the ideas offered here they would not be farming for long.  They would be in the county home.</P>
    <P>There are farmers and farmers. There are some farmers who are not interested in their farms at all.  They are more interested in racing, hunting and cock fighting.  In my opinion that type of gentleman does not deserve much consideration.  He is making no endeavour to operate his farm as it should be operated and very often he lets his land.  There are people like the landlords in County Limerick who are now letting their land to the people from County Galway and going off racing and having a good time.  They do not help the agricultural industry in any way.  Many of the difficulties experienced by such people are the result of sheer laziness.  The best proof of that is the fact that the people who went from small farms in the West to the midlands or east midlands or to any other small farms in the country made an immediate success of farming. I have not seen any of these people knocking at the door of the county home and I do not think any of them has the slightest intention of doing so, <Col N="2540" /> even though they have been given only small farms.  I know these people and have visited them.  They come back to the area they left for a holiday and they tell me they are doing quite well. If they are doing quite well on these small farms, the farmer who has a colossal acreage of land should be a semi-millionaire.</P>
    <P>The problem in the West is that the majority of the people have not sufficient land.  For that reason I believe the farming methods of many of the midland farmers should be very carefully scrutinised and where they are not making proper use of their land the land should be purchased by the Land Commission and given to people who know how to use it and very soon there would be a very different complexion put on the agricultural industry.  If that were done the Minister would be relieved of a great deal of trouble because these people, instead of trying to scrounge State aid, would be quite prepared to operate their farms properly.</P>
    <P>Some extraordinary statements have been made here about the drop in the number of cattle, pigs and so on. How do the people who make these statements know the number of cattle in the country?  Everybody unless he is a fool knows that the census of cattle was taken back in the early 1920's by the original members of the Garda Síochána.  The Garda would go into one house and probably estimate from that the number for half a parish.  If he liked the person he visited he would put down a small number of animals and if he disliked him he would make it ten times the number in order to exclude him from obtaining some kind of State aid.</P>
    <P>We have not the remotest notion of the number of cattle in the country and we will not have until the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme has been put into operation in every county.  The same applies to sheep and pigs; we do not know what the figures are.  We might know the number of cattle in counties in which the bovine TB eradication scheme has been in operation but we have not a clue as to what is the number of cattle, say, in Cork or Kerry.  The chances are that <Col N="2541" /> the numbers of cattle in the country have substantially increased rather than reduced.</P>
    <P>The price of all kinds of animals has greatly increased and there is a natural tendency to sell but there is no farmer such a fool as not to maintain his stock as far as possible.  If we are trying to create the impression that our stocks are going down and that we are becoming an impoverished nation, while at the same time we are trying to catch up with Europe, we are only fooling ourselves.  I do not believe there are many European countries whose people have as good a time as we have.  It is no use for the farmers to depend on the agricultural methods which were used by their great grandfathers and which have been the same since St. Patrick came to Ireland or since Noah came out of the Ark.  Tremendous advances have been made in the West of Ireland and if the midland farmers are as backward and as needful of aid as some of their representatives here want us to believe, they should go West and have a look at modern agricultural methods.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any need to let loose any more agricultural inspectors.  I do not think farmers are as backward as we are led to believe they are.  If they are, the representatives who have been speaking about them should go back to their constituencies and preach the sermons they are preaching here.  There is no doubt that better organisation and better marketing facilities are necessary and that presents considerable difficulties. We are able to organise methods of marketing other commodities and there is no reason why, with a bit of co-operation and forward thinking, we should not be able to provide better marketing facilities for agricultural produce.  If there is a ready market on our doorstep and we find that the New Zealanders and the Australians can send their products thousands and thousands of miles to that market, there is something seriously wrong and it is time somebody looked into it.</P>
    <P>The use of modern processing methods should be of tremendous value to the agricultural community.  If <Col N="2542" /> people take the attitude that they must make all their money in a day or a night these methods will not work but if they take the long-term view there is a good future in store for the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>There are many crops which could be more extensively grown than they are.  We are very backward in the growing of fruit and vegetables from which there is a considerable amount of money to be gained without any great outlay and without any great trouble in tending the crops.</P>
    <P>Something should be done about the provision of a subsidy for the production of pigs.  Other countries have found a means of dealing with this problem and there is no reason why we should not be able to find some solution.  There is no use in preaching to the people about these things.  The day is past when a farmer's wife or daughter engaged in the production of pigs.  I suppose the dance halls are one of the greatest factors in that situation.  I cannot see a young lady going to feed the pigs if a dance is being held.  There is no danger that she will change her mind in the future either.  If we are to have pig production we will have to make it worthwhile to keep pigs.  I doubt that many people in my part of the country would consider it worth their while keeping pigs although at one time they were amongst the greatest pig producers.</P>
    <P>A more realistic attitude must be taken towards the congested areas. When agricultural land of a reasonable standard is put up for sale it should undoubtedly be purchased and made available to improve the position of the small farmers.  I have no objection to any foreigner buying land if he is prepared to give a reasonable amount of employment, but if he is a gentleman who is prepared to imitate what is going on so excessively in the Midlands he is <i>persona non grata</i> with me.  I do not want to see him in the East, the West, the South or the Midlands.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to a foreigner buying non-agricultural land in the West because there are hundreds of <Col N="2543" /> acres of land there which are not usable for agricultural production.  It is absolutely vital that the purchase of good agricultural land by foreigners should cease.  That land should be purchased by the Land Commission and made available to people who have already shown that they are capable of developing land.  There is no point in purchasing that land and making it available to large farmers. Before any man is given good agricultural land, his past record should be carefully examined and if he can show that he has been successful as an agriculturist, the size of his farm should be used as a yardstick for giving him land.  If he has five or six acres and has proved his worth, he should be given land.  Only when the farms of the country are broken down and given to the people who have shown their worth will agriculture stand on its own feet.  The subventions from the State which are necessary at present will not then be required.  Until that happens the present happy-go-lucky method of what I might call farm bribery by the Government &mdash; by any Government &mdash; will continue.</P>
    <P>It should not be beyond the ability of the Minister and his advisers to do something now which will show results in the near future, and put us in a position in which we can readily compete with those people who are not half as favourably placed as we are. There must be something wrong when, with our opportunities and facilities, we can be beaten by lengths.  I would ask the Minister to set up some organisation which would try to rectify the matter by means other than State subventions which are dished out and which are a brake upon agricultural production rather than an incentive.</P>

      <P>I want to advise Deputy Clinton to keep as clear as possible of his Party and his Leader, Deputy Dillon, for the next week or so until his speech is forgotten, because if he is caught, after all the statements he made, he will be slaughtered.  How he can reconcile what he said with the known and definite policy announced by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to agriculture, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2544" /> There is very little use in talking any longer about the small farmer. The small farmer has been put out of business.  The days when he could get something out of wheat or feeding barley are gone.  When we had to deal with the problem of too large a wheat acreage being grown we rationed the wheat acreage.  The same thing should be done by the Department to the ranchers in the Midlands who produced bullocks when wheat was wanted and are now growing wheat when no one wants it.</P>
    <P>How can the ordinary small farmer compete in grain against the man who hires an auctioneer in Dublin and takes anything from 500 to 2,000 acres and puts it all under wheat?  If he gets a profit of a quarter barrel of wheat per acre it will pay him, but I should like to see the farmer, even with 40 acres and with 10 acres of wheat, who could live on a profit of a quarter barrel an acre.  I suggest to the Minister that he should again examine the wheat contract system.  I took those figures with a grain of salt until the proof was produced to me. I saw the stubs of cheques.  I saw that a sum of over £20,000 was paid by one miller to one supposed farmer who lived in Africa.  It is time all that was ended.</P>
    <P>The small farmer must adopt an entirely new policy.  He will not make a livelihood on a £20 or £30 valuation holding out of cows or dry cattle or grain.  If we can bring home some sense of realism to those people we may be able to make a start.  I look on this matter with a certain amount of pride.  I am chairman of one organisation which set a headline for the farming community in regard to prices.  We succeeded in 1948 in getting an agreement with the Sugar Company that we would set up a system of costings.  On that system of costings, we have been paid from 1948 up to the present day.  If anyone wishes to see the difference between that policy, as carried out between farmers and the industrial concern that was taking their produce, he need only come here and take up the White Paper on the Common Market and there he will see for himself the result of the two policies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2545" /> Our price per ton for sugar beet, at 137/11, was beaten only by Germany who paid 140/-.  The rest of the Common Market countries are under that price.  Take the other crops grown by the farmers and consider the difference.  I wonder if Deputy Clinton, when he was talking here about Denmark a while ago, went into this position at all.  The return price given here for feeding barley in this country was 37/- a barrel.  Deputy Clinton complained that the Danes have hunted us out of the British market and said they are paying 48/6 a barrel for feeding barley.</P>
    <P>I remember, away back, when we had the honour to have the late Tom Walsh here as Minister for Agriculture, the price of feeding barley during the whole of his period of office was 48/-a barrel &mdash; and pigs were fattened and money was made on it during that time.  What has happened since? That is a straight question.  When Deputy Clinton complains about the price of feeding barley today, he should remember that the first man to put his thumb down on the price of feeding barley was his present Leader who reduced the price of 48/6 for feeding barley to 40/-.  That was followed out, very accurately, by the organisation I mentioned a while ago, the National Farmers' Association, which came along and asked the Minister for 38/- a barrel for it.</P>
    <P>I went to see the then Minister for Agriculture, to abuse him about the matter and what he said to me was: &ldquo;In the name of goodness, Corry, is he not a good man who gives what he is asked to give?&rdquo; Now we have mutterings about the prices.  Let us look things in the face.  If we are to do anything for our small farmers it will have to be on that basis.  The gross return from an acre of beet today is somewhere between £80 and £125.  No wonder we have people looking for contracts.  The tillage farmers would be far better off today but for the idiotic attitude of the inter-Party Government who allowed Britain to put a levy on our sugar for that market.</P>
    <P>We come here and we put Ministers in charge of Departments.  I admit <Col N="2546" /> that the then Minister's outlook was indicated by his statements in this House that he could double the children's allowances by importing fine sugar and doing away with the beet factory.  You could not expect much from that sort of man.  That man, with his colleague at that time, Deputy Norton, brought us back an agreement under which we were hamstrung in our efforts to sell sugar to Britain.</P>
    <P>If we look at the future from the point of view of the Common Market &mdash;we must look at it from that point of view &mdash; the present levy and duty, which amounts to £26 a ton, on Irish sugar exported to Britain will have to cease when both Britain and ourselves are in the Common Market together. Then the position is at once created that unless we get crops of the same value as that, our ordinary small farmer will have to clear out.</P>
    <P>If we cannot get into processed foods, if we cannot establish factories for the processing of vegetables, peas, and so on, which will return at least £100 to £200 an acre, there is no good in talking about the small farmers any more.</P>
    <P>I laughed at some of the statements I heard from time to time but last week I saw one farmer with 40 good acres of land in my district who let the land and is now making from £18 to £20 a week in industrial employment&mdash; and he has far shorter hours and a softer time.  There is that complete change as far as agriculture is concerned at the present time and there is no good in talking about labour on the land.</P>
    <P>If all that can be offered at the present time is from £6 to £7 a week to an agricultural labourer, who must work on Sunday as well as on Monday because unfortunately we have not yet invented the five-day cow &mdash; if that is all that that man can get for his labour on the land and if that is all the land can offer &mdash; well, then, the question of labour on the land is finished.  Nobody is idiotic enough today to work for that wage.  There is no use in pretending otherwise.</P>
    <P>Neighbours of mine around my own district, some of whom are men who spent 11, 12 and 14 years working <Col N="2547" /> with the one farmer, good skilled men, have asked me for letters for Haulbowline, Rushbrooke, and so on.  I will not stand in any man's way.  I gave them the letters.  Those boys are now earning anything from £12 to £25 a week, at work which requires one-tenth of the skill they need in agriculture today.  While there is that gap between agriculture and industry, so long shall we have the farmer compelled to compete with the old age pensioner and the cripple.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully was anxious about the Common Market.  When I hear statements about prices here and when we are told that if prices were any higher other sides of the farming industry could not carry on, I wonder how the Common Market countries can afford to pay an average of 52/- a barrel for feeding barley compared with our 37/-or 38/-.  If the price of milk here is 1/9 per gallon, how is it that the average price of milk in the Common Market countries is 2/7 a gallon?  I am taking the figures from the White Paper that was issued and I should like those figures to be considered by the Department at their leisure.  On those lines, I say there is a great future for Irish agriculture but it will have to begin on the basis of a minimum wage of £9 or £10 a week for agriculture labourers.  If we try to go lower than that, we will not get them.  It will not be easy to get them even at that wage.  I am very glad we have succeeded in creating the situation here where people need no longer work for £6 or £7 a week.</P>
    <P>We hear complaints about the levy on milk but that was provided for in a measure which was accepted by this House.  The farmers and farming organisations went into An Bord Bainne with their eyes open.  The Minister deserves every credit for stepping in and relieving the farmers of the burden when he found An Bord Bainne had to put a levy on milk.  We hear a lot of tripe here and outside about who was responsible for that. The people responsible were the Deputies from the dairying areas who advised the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are enormous opportunities <Col N="2548" /> at present for changing the whole outlook as regards small farmers.  There is the fruit and vegetable business. There are peas, cabbage, cauliflowers, broccoli and other vegetables.  Thank God, we have an organisation, the Irish Sugar Company, prepared to take advantage of this situation.  I like to pay tribute when it is due and no doubt the work of the Irish Sugar Company in that respect is second to none.  When I hear Deputy Clinton moaning about finding markets I remember that when we found that Britain had us crippled with regard to the export of sugar we found a market for it in America, a market that, please God, will expand and where the price is practically double what we get in Britain when the levies are taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister has done a splendid job also in regard to eradication of bovine T.B.  My only complaint is that he is not going fast enough as far as the six dairy counties in the south are concerned.  Unfortunately, there is a section of the community that will sit on the fence until they are forced to do something.  Opportunities are being provided as quickly as possible.  We have four principal processing plants at present for fruit and vegetables, Tuam, for the potatoes, Thurles and Carlow and Mallow for the vegetables. We now have &mdash; just branching out, please God, in the next few months&mdash; the planting scheme in my own constituency in East Cork.  Next year, please God, it will happen in Deputy Murphy's constituency in West Cork.</P>
    <P>Only in this way can I see the agricultural community being maintained on the land.  One cannot expect a man to live on £200 a year that he might get from cows or dry stock or from oats and barley.  He will not do it.  He will say: &ldquo;I can get £5 a week out of the farm but if I had no farm I could get £12-£24 a week from Irish Steel or in some other job.&rdquo;  That is a complete and welcome change.  It will put agriculture on its toes to find ways and means of meeting the new situation.</P>
    <P>There is no use in Deputy Tully talking about wages here and in Great Britain.  That question was fully examined by two pretty good teams of agricultural experts from Messrs. <Col N="2549" /> Arthur Guinness and the Beet Growers' Association.  They agreed that the difference between the Irish farmer and the English farmer was roughly £4 an acre and when they put it into figures for us, they paid us 7/4 a barrel extra for the barley on that basis.</P>
    <P>Those people are no fools.  They paid 7/4 a barrel over the British price of malting barley, because, taking everything into consideration &mdash; English and Northern Ireland farmers pay no rates on agricultural land; they have better subsidies in regard to limestone and manure than the Irish farmer&mdash; that represented the difference.  When everything was taken into account, it came to 7/4d. a barrel exactly.  There is no use talking about the farmers in this country and the farmers in England.  If we are going into that market, I suggest to the Government and to the Minister for Agriculture that the sooner that problem is tackled, and the Irish farmer put in as good a position as his competitors, the better it will be for everybody concerned. There is only one way to do that, that is, by the complete derating of agricultural land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine my remarks almost entirely to that branch of agriculture which is of vital concern to the people in my constituency, that is, the dairying industry.  The future of this industry is not alone of great importance to the people in my constituency who depend on it for their livelihood but it will be a very vital factor in the future development of the agricultural industry as a whole.  In my constituency of East Limerick, dairying is the main enterprise on the farms, but, in addition, practically the entire industrial and commercial life of that constituency is based on dairying. Even in the city of Limerick, the major industries are based either directly or indirectly on dairying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is only right that I should address myself to the problems which confront this industry and start, so to speak, right down at the dairy farm.  Here we find a situation which exists in no other sector of the <Col N="2550" /> economy.  We have a section of the community trying to carry on under very grave difficulties.  Dairy farmers have had no increase in income since 1953 and all along the line, they have had to try to meet increased costs of essential commodities, such as the price of machinery, etc.  I know because I live on a dairy farm and among dairy farmers and I can state quite emphatically that the dairy farmers in my constituency are finding it very difficult to make ends meet.  I have ample evidence that many of them are in very poor financial circumstances. Practically every week in recent months, dairy farmers have been coming to me for advice on financial problems.  I have been particularly perturbed to find in a number of cases in which my assistance was sought in the filling of application forms for loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation that a considerable proportion of the amount applied for was for the purpose of meeting debts.</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago, when the banks became more lenient and more inclined to advance money, there were many cases of dairy farmers borrowing money in order to increase or improve their herds.  Now after two or three years, they find they are unable to meet their commitments except by further borrowing.  I am not commenting on this in a destructive way but merely trying to present the factual case.  I believe unless there is an immediate examination of the problems of the dairy farmers at farm level, we will have a complete collapse of the dairying industry.  In the southern dairying areas, including my constituency, dairy farmers are now faced with the problems of eradicating bovine tuberculosis from their herds by 1964.  They are also faced with the problem of having to streamline and modernise production to meet the higher standards of hygiene, cleanliness and so on, now demanded by the creameries.  Therefore, I feel there is urgent need for a complete review and a thorough examination of the whole dairying industry.</P>
    <P>I believe three steps are necessary if the dairy farmers are to be put on their feet and enabled to do what <Col N="2551" /> we expect of them.  First of all, I am convinced that we must give our dairy farmers an economic basic price for their milk.  In addition, there is a case for giving bonuses on special, high quality milk.  If I were asked what is most required by the dairy farmers of my constituency, I would say they need long-term, interest-free loans to enable them to instal modern equipment and to clear their herds of reactors and so on.  Thirdly, we need an adequate and specialised advisory service for dairy farmers.  I would stress the need for having a re-examination carried out into the problems of dairy farmers.  Unless such an examination is carried out, the system of dairy farming as at present practised in the creamery areas cannot hope to survive.</P>
    <P>The next arm of our dairying industry is processing.  Drastic changes are needed here and we will have to have a complete reorganisation of our present processing arrangements.  There is a need of rationalising the processing of dairy produce.  That has now been generally recognised and I was particularly glad to learn recently from the Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary Question which I tabled, that at present a survey is being carried out into the processing of dairy produce. I sincerely hope that there will be no undue delay in reporting the findings of that survey.  In view of the inefficient manner in which our processing is organised at the present moment it is absolutely futile to think that we can sell our dairy produce competitively in foreign markets.  We cannot do so unless we take steps to rationalise processing.</P>
    <P>In County Limerick this inefficient type of arrangement is clearly to be seen.  Most of our surplus milk going into manufacture is being transported long distances to Kerry, Cork and Waterford.  From enquiries I have made, I have been reliably informed that the transport costs alone represent roughly 1.25 pence per gallon. Here is one place where costs could be reduced.</P>
    <P>It is only common sense to suggest that the processing plants should be <Col N="2552" /> located as centrally as possible.  The milk from County Limerick creameries should be processed at central points within the county so that transport costs would be reduced to a minimum. With a view to achieving centralisation of processing, the co-operative creameries should be encouraged more and more to establish processing plants.</P>
    <P>I have been tremendously impressed by the progress of the Golden Vale Food Products.  Here is an example of a processing plant which is handling milk from 16 shareholding co-operative creameries.  The success of this enterprise points the way to a rational organisation of processing.  To put it in a nutshell, what is needed is more co-operation among the co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I would, therefore, urge upon the Minister the need for getting down to this business of considering the question of rationalisation of the processing of dairy products.  It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to organise creameries into groups for the purpose of processing milk.</P>
    <P>The next point is, perhaps, the most important and the most difficult.  It is the question of marketing.  No matter how efficiently farmers produce milk and no matter how well organised processing might be, it will all be to no avail unless we find markets for dairy produce.  The task facing An Bord Bainne is a formidable one.  While producers in general have not, as yet, much confidence in the Board, nevertheless, there is a general realisation and appreciation of the magnitude of the task facing An Bord Bainne.</P>
    <P>There is need for much closer co-operation between An Bord Bainne and the various interests in the dairying industry.  In fact, the Dairy Produce Act of 1961 makes provision in clause 35 for such co-operation.  Clause 35 states:</P>
    <P>The Board may, if it so thinks fit, establish a regional advisory committee composed of milk producers and representatives of the dairying industry generally to advise the Board in relation to the performance of its function.</P>
    <P>As I said, there is need for closer co-operation between all interests in the dairying industry.  The suggestion in <Col N="2553" /> clause 35 is a very applicable one.  It could easily be tied up with my suggestion regarding the reorganisation of processing.  In other words, the dairying areas would be divided into regions.  Each region would comprise a number of co-operative creameries who would group or federate for the purpose of processing milk at some central point.  In addition, in each region there would be this advisory committee that is recommended.  In that way, by co-operation between all interests, some progress could be made.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is need for considerable scientific research into all aspects of the dairying industry.  A start has been made already at farm level.  The Agricultural Institute has established the Dairy Research Institute at Fermoy.  There is also the experimental dairy farm at Herbertstown, County Limerick.  While each of these units of the Agricultural Institute is doing very valuable work, there is one aspect of research in relation to dairy farming that has been completely overlooked, that is, the question of co-operation at farm level.  This question of co-operation applies not merely to dairy farming but to all types of farming. The Agricultural Institute, in addition to carrying out scientific research into milk production, dairy farming management and so on, might look further and see how a group of dairy farmers could co-operate to produce more efficiently.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is need for research in the fields of processing and marketing.  The establishment of a full-scale processing and market research institute is now a matter of vital importance.  I would suggest that such an institute should be established in the most central position in the dairying area and I cannot refrain from advocating or at least suggesting that the obvious location for such a research institute should be in the city of Limerick which is in the centre of the dairying areas.</P>
    <P>Taking the dairying industry at its various levels, at dairy farming level, at processing level and at marketing level, we can see there is need, first of all, for surveys; there is need for research and for close examination of <Col N="2554" /> the industry in each of the branches which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>We have to face the fact that there is no future in butter as an economic outlet for surplus milk.  Alternative outlets must be found.  I have been inquiring into this matter very closely and have discussed it with people engaged in the dairying industry at all levels.  I feel there are two or, possibly, three outlets on which we should concentrate.  First, there is cheese.  Our <i>per capita</i> consumption of cheese is, I think, one of the lowest in Europe.  It has been suggested that, if we could double that consumption, most of our immediate problems regarding the disposal of surplus milk would be solved.  The home market is ready for development and the problem is one of education, publicity and propaganda.  We do not seem to realise the nutritional value of cheese. If a determined effort were made, starting at school level, to make our people more aware of the value of cheese as an item of diet, we could expand the home market quite considerably.</P>
    <P>In addition, I am informed that there is considerable scope for the development of an export market in cheese.  I understand there is a very big potential market for the more specialised types of cheeses.  It is advocated in the report on the marketing of dairying produce that we should concentrate on the development of a distinctive Irish cheese. Having inquired into this at manufacturing level, I am informed that one very important factor in the production of high-quality cheese &mdash; the same applies to the production of powdered milk and other high-quality dairy products &mdash; is the quality of the milk. You need a high-quality milk.</P>
    <P>There is only one way in which you will get high-quality milk, that is, by paying a bonus to the farmers who take the necessary steps to produce it. At present, there is no incentive for the dairy farmer to produce better quality milk.  In my own area, some farmers have in the past couple of years gone to considerable expense installing milking parlours and so on. Some of them at present are producing milk of a very high standard untouched <Col N="2555" /> by hand.  Yet that farmer gets the same price per gallon as his neighbour who produces milk by the traditional methods.  I would suggest to the Minister that the payment of a bonus for high-quality milk would yield a very big dividend.  It would enable us to expand the production of high-quality cheese and other dairy products.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Deputy define high-quality milk?  The Deputy is talking about clean milk, not high-quality milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to milk which comes up to the standard required.  Milk being processed into powdered milk, for instance, must undergo a number of laboratory tests at the primary stage. The first is a sediment test; the second is a test for acidity; and the third is a test for flavour.  Milk which does not pass each of these tests cannot be used in the manufacture of powdered milk.  If it is allowed through, the defect in the primary process stage will be reflected in the final product and may lead to the marketing of an inferior product.</P>
      <P>When I refer to quality milk, I mean milk which will pass the laboratory test.  At present, in the Golden Vale food plant at Rathluirc, milk is bought from 16 shareholding creameries. These laboratory tests are carried out in the actual processing centre.  I was speaking to the chief chemist in that industry the other day.  He told me that the previous week he had to send back a number of consignments of milk.  One big tanker brought from 2,000 to 3,000 gallons of milk from a certain creamery and it failed to pass the different tests.  The whole lot had to be sent home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be argued that payments on a quality basis may not be a practicable proposition and that they would create undue difficulties for the different creameries.  If each creamery set up its own little laboratory, the milk could be put through the different tests there before being sent to the central processing plant.  Each farmer's milk could be tested once a week for <Col N="2556" /> sedimentation, acidity and so on.  Payment would be made each month and a special bonus given for milk reaching a high standard.  I have very strong views on this.  I am convinced of the need for payment on a quality basis.</P>
    <P>This is a very involved matter.  I am as conscious as anybody of the difficulties at all stages confronting the Department and the various sections of the dairying industry.  I believe in the future of the dairying industry.  If we have a realistic, down-to-earth, dynamic policy for dairying, we will be able to enter foreign markets competitively.</P>
    <P>The Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce in its Report on the Export of Dairy Produce states at page 3, paragraphs 8 and 9, that there is need for a long-term plan for the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>At this stage we would like to refer to the need for a long-term plan for the dairy industry in this country.  It seems to us that it is essential to evolve an overall national policy for the industry and that this should be done by the milk producers, the Irish Dairy Produce Board, recommended by us, and the State.  The fundamental point to be decided is whether this country should be an exporter of whatever temporary surplus of dairy produce may arise from time to time or whether the country should be a long-term and regular exporter of dairy produce...</P>
    <P>We consider, however, that proposals for the future marketing of Irish dairy produce should be based on the assumption that the country must have an increasing volume of such produce to export and our report must be read in that light. A significant increase in the volume of exports of dairy produce cannot be brought about rapidly and we believe that a definite long-term plan aimed at increasing milk output and providing a steady flow of dairy products for export must be evolved. In formulating such a plan it is important that the following two points should be borne in mind. <Col N="2557" /> In the first place, the plan should be a long-term one which will be maintained over a reasonable period irrespective of temporary developments. Secondly, the producer must be assured that any increase in efficiency and productivity resulting from his efforts will be reflected in an improvement in his standard of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department could not do better than take another look at this report and try to formulate and implement a long-term plan for the development of the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of agriculture in which I have a particular interest. I refer to the question of the survival of the small farm.  Deputy Corry referred to this earlier.  Reference was made to viability, as it is now called.  I think the use of words like &ldquo;viability&rdquo; in this connection leads only to misconceptions.  We should keep our language simple.  With regard to the survival of the average Irish farm, or viability, this matter was dealt with fairly thoroughly by the Minister for Lands when he introduced his Estimate here a few weeks ago.  I believe the average Irish farm, under our present agricultural policy, and with the methods and systems practised on the farms, has not an earthly hope of survival in the future.</P>
    <P>We would, I think, be getting much nearer to the problem, however, if we thought here in terms of parish viability rather than individual farm viability.  If we think of these little family farms, which dot the plains and hillsides of this country, as individual units, each self-dependent, and so on, we must admit that there is not very much hope for their survival.  If, however, we think of rural Ireland and these individual family farms co-operating with one another in the utilisation of the land, then we can hold out some hope for the future of the average Irish family farm.</P>
    <P>In terms of acreage, the average farm compares very favourably with the average farm on the Continent.  The figures I have here show that the average size of a farm in Belgium is 16 acres, in France 35 acres, in Holland <Col N="2558" /> 24 acres, in Italy 11 acres, in Luxemburg 22 acres, and in Western Germany 21 acres.  In Ireland the average farm is 40 acres.  From the point of view of size, our Irish farm is fairly good.  From the point of view of utilisation of the land, I believe co-operation at the parish level is the only answer to viability, or the survival of the average Irish family farm.</P>
    <P>That brings me now to a very controversial matter, a matter which engendered quite a lot of controversy and about which there was a considerable amount of argument and discussion. I refer to the parish plan for agriculture produced some years ago by that great apostle of rural Ireland, the late Canon Hayes.  I am convinced that the parish plan for agriculture was the most outstanding social concept of our time.  It was described by an OEEC mission as the most forward step in Europe for the development of agricultural advisory services.  In 1957, we did not know much about community development in its modern connotation, but, because of the mass of literature produced over the past few years on community development, we now see the basic fundamental principle behind the parish plan in an entirely new light.</P>
    <P>Recently we had an international seminar on community development at Gormanston College.  The fundamental principle underlying the parish plan, the fundamental idea of community effort and organisation for economic advancement, ran right through the whole seminar.  This idea of community co-operation has now come to be accepted throughout the world. There are numerous examples of successful experiments in the application of this idea of community effort to economic development.  The late Canon Hayes sought to apply the idea of community effort to the development of agriculture and he has now been proved, beyond all doubt, as having been 100 per cent. correct in his approach.</P>
    <P>I suggest, in all sincerity, that the Minister and his Department should now have another look at the parish plan.  I am fully aware that certain difficulties arose.  There was duplication <Col N="2559" /> between the parish agent and the agricultural advisers employed by the committee of agriculture.  There was a good deal of treading on one another's corns, so to speak.  With goodwill on all sides, now that we have a better realisation of the fundamental philosophy underlying the parish plan, we can, with very little difficulty, reintroduce the plan.  It was said that the parish plan was the idea of Muintir na Tíre and that organisation, as a community movement, should have nothing to do with agriculture.  It was said that the parish plan would take the agricultural advisers out of the control of the county committees and would lead ultimately to direct control from Merrion Street.  These are all difficulties that could have been surmounted. The basic fundamental idea remains.  Those are obstacles which could have been surmounted if we wanted to develop Irish agriculture and ensure that the average Irish family farm would survive.  To surmount them, we must have an adequate advisory service at parish level.</P>
    <P>I am not speaking on this matter of co-operation from the point of view of the academic approach.  I will tell the House briefly of my own experience of promoting agricultural co-operation. A couple of years ago a group of farmers in my own parish came together to discuss ways and means by which they might co-operate to make their farms more efficient.  They sought my assistance to obtain information as to how they might go about it. While the Minister for Agriculture will tell the House that the IAOS, the Department of Agriculture and the agricultural instructors are ready and willing to provide advice I found, two years ago, that before I could get the advice which that group of farmers was seeking I had to go to about eight different agencies.  Finally we did evolve a plan of operation.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that there is specialist advice available in the Department of Agriculture.  I am acquainted with a number of senior officers in the Department who have studied community development and <Col N="2560" /> co-operation abroad but that is not enough.  If we accept the thesis that the survival of the small family farm will depend on co-operation we must ensure that there is in each county at least one agricultural adviser who has made a specialised study of the matter and who will give the people the technique of co-operation as applied to agriculture.  We have a skeleton specialist advisory service in operation at the moment but it is not enough.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House any longer.  I have tried to make a case for the parish plan and I am convinced that Canon Hayes' original idea was essentially sound and that by very little effort it can be adopted to meet current problems.</P>
    <P>There is one question which has been agitating my mind regarding our major national industry and that is the question of what increase in output is practicable in agriculture or what scope there is for expansion.  I could not better conclude than by referring to what the acting General Secretary of OEEC said in Dublin in July, 1957.  He said that if we set ourselves to increase our agricultural production by one or two per cent. we could do so and that if we set ourselves to increase it by six or seven per cent. we could also increase it.  In a study made two years ago Senator Professor P.M. Quinlan examined the position very thoroughly.  I was very impressed by one observation he made and that was that an expansion of six per cent. in agricultural output would provide 75,000 to 85,000 jobs per annum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody agrees that agriculture is the most important industry in this country and therefore it is only natural that the agricultural Estimate would get the closest attention of the House.  It is difficult to devise an agricultural policy generally applicable to this country because of the variations in agricultural conditions.  A farmer in Wexford, Kildare or Tipperary has no relation to the farmer of the western seaboard and parts of the southern seaboard. On previous occasions I have expressed the viewpoint that our agricultural <Col N="2561" /> policy should be more varied and that the country should be divided into agricultural zones.  A policy that may be applicable to the midlands would not be of any advantage to other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>There is nothing new in the Minister's statement.  It is evidenced from the trend of the debate and the contributions made not only by members of the Opposition but by members of the Government Party that if there were a reshuffle in the Government of this country such as there was in England during the past week the Minister for Agriculture would go. The Minister for Justice points to himself. He would be perfectly safe and I am not making use of that expression in any personal manner.  The Minister for Justice has looked after his own people very well.</P>

      <P>I would not have mentioned it at all were it not for what my friend and colleague said. We have had a lengthy statement from the previous speaker on the dairying industry.  He confined his remarks to the industry as it flourishes in the constituency he represents in County Limerick.  Most people regard Limeerick as a very wealthy county and consider that farming and industrial works flourish there.  Deputy O'Donnell stated that the dairy farmers in East Limerick are in a poor way.  He elaborated on that statement by telling the House of the number of farmers who come to him to complete forms for loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and to get accommodation from other lending societies, such as banks.  I have no doubt that Deputy O'Donnell's statement was an honest one.  I find it very difficult to understand why the farmers in East Limerick are in that position but I must accept Deputy O'Donnell's statement as being truthful.  If the farmers in East Limerick are in a poor way, in what way must the farmers be in South West Cork, South Kerry, Mayo, Donegal, Leitrim, the province of Connaught in general and the other poor parts of the country?  If the farmers in East Limerick are in a poor way, to quote exactly the Deputy's words, the farmers in the other parts of the country I have named must be in a desperate way.</P>

    <P>Dairy farming, as Deputy O'Donnell and other speakers have pointed out, is the main source of income of the general body of farmers, particularly in southern Ireland, and the main income is the monthly milk cheques, where they come.  However, in my part of the country in most cases the farmers do not see any cheques because <Col N="2563" /> they are almost continuously indebted to the creameries who withhold payment for the milk to cover payment for other household essentials.  What increase has the dairy farmer got? Some members of the Government believe that he is doing very well and that possibly there is no need for him to get an increase.</P>

      <P>What increase has the dairy farmer got from this Government?  Was he catered for in a similar manner to that in which the judges were catered for by the Minister for Justice and that in which various other sections of public employees were catered for?  Did he get an increase in his income and what was the extent of that increase?  Does it compare favourably with the increases measured out to other sections of the community? I assert that it does not, that it compares most unfavourably with the increases given to other sections of the community.</P>
      <P>First of all, we had this juggling, something like the three-card trick man would be operating at a fair or a race meeting, in relation to the withdrawal of the penny from the dairy farmer with one hand, and giving it back to him with the other hand.  It was a stupid piece of juggling which has cost the country several thousands of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were told by the Minister for Agriculture that it was imperative, having regard to the measure passed in the House a few years ago establishing Bord Bainne, to take from the dairy farmers a penny per gallon for milk supplied to creameries and hand it over to An Bord Bainne.  He did that despite soundly based protests from the farmers' organisations.  Then in view of representations made and in order to satisfy people he decided to give back the penny.  In the meantime there was the process of extracting the penny from the taxpayer.  The man who smokes got the blow this time.  It gave the Minister an excuse to introduce a Supplementary Estimate. It is only right to say that a number <Col N="2564" /> of farmers smoke also and that, in common with other members of society, they have to make up this penny a gallon for milk.  The position now is that creameries must pay this levy to Bord Bainne, submit their account to the Minister who will recoup them. I should like to know from the Minister what is the cost of that juggling.</P>

      <P>Would it not be easier and avoid the extra work involved for the Minister to say: &ldquo;I have made an honest mistake.  I should, in the first instance, have given that subsidy to Bord Bainne myself.  I should not have interfered with the income of the dairy farmers by reducing milk by one penny a gallon at a time when every other section of the community was getting an increase.&rdquo;  He could have saved the unnecessary expense involved.  However, that is over and done with and I hope that possibly as a result of the contributions made in this debate the unnecessary cost involved in the removal of this levy and its restoration from Government sources will be saved to the Exchequer.  I hope that unnecessary work will be avoided in future.</P>
      <P>Where does this leave us?  We find that the farmer has benefited nothing. He got 1d. reduction and then the price of milk was increased by 1d. so that in terms of income, he has got no increase.  Possibly the Minister is reluctant to give an increase in the price of milk, in view of the difficulty of selling milk and milk products.  I appreciate that.  The Minister may say that if we were to give dairy farmers increases on a par with civil servants or others, the milk yield would increase so much that it would cost the Exchequer a good deal of money to subsidise.  That may be the Minister's reason but can it be sustained?  Are the dairy farmers the one section of the community who are to be satisfied with their present incomes because of the difficulty of selling their surplus products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We established An Bord Bainne a year or two ago.  Their job was to act as a marketing board and find <Col N="2565" /> markets for surplus milk and milk products.  Are they doing that?  We have had no report from them since their establishment.  The only thing we have had from them so far is the levy of 1d. per gallon on milk.  Are they in close touch with the Minister? Does he know what is happening?  Is he informed of their activities?  What markets have they got abroad for our surplus butter, cheese and other milk products?  Are they worth their money?  I hope we shall have a statement from the Minister on the board's activities because in his introductory statement, he had very little to say about them, except to mention that they were working and that it was imperative to give them money to continue their work.  My remarks are not to be taken as derogatory.  I do not know whether the board are doing any good or not.  The Minister should give more information as we know how difficult it is to get replies to questions addressed to Ministers regarding the activities of Statesponsored boards.</P>
    <P>I had hoped that difficulties arising from the marketing of milk and milk products would be overcome by the board and that it would be possible to give the dairy farmers an increase. When the other Government were in power, that was done through the Exchequer.  Milk products were subsidised so that the increase was not passed on to the consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;dairy farmer&rdquo; is very wide because a dairy farmer is a man with three cows or 43.  The term could be used for a wide variety of farmers in the constituency I represent.  The average number of cows is possibly not more than five or six in half of it and, possibly, 11 or 12 or 13 in the other half.  How will the Minister for Justice, who is now deputising for the Minister for Agriculture, deal with the man that I pass coming up here, the man who is jogging along to the creamery every morning with his churn of seven or 12, 15 or 20 gallons of milk?  What increase is he getting for his work?  Or what reduction in the hours of his working week?  He is getting nothing, and, as a Fianna Fáil speaker from Cork told us, he is moving out.  You will find him over in England.  The Minister need not accept that statement from me. Deputy Corry has stated the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have observations from various other people on the economics of the small farm to the effect that the position is so bad at present that a big number of these farmers, unfortunately, are not getting married, even though of marriageable age.  It is true that in the constituency of Cork South-West, as I am sure in other similarly-circumstanced constituencies, we have a big number of small farmers of marriageable age who are single <Col N="2567" /> and likely to remain so because their uneconomic holdings are not fit to raise a family with present day standards. It is even difficult for them to get wives because every girl knows that to marry a small farmer means a very difficult life, that she must work Sundays and Mondays and that the income is exceptionally low and not sufficient to raise a family and give them a reasonable standard of living.</P>
    <P>Those are facts.  I need not go beyond my own parish where that position obtains.  It obtains also in neighbouring parishes and in the greater part of the country where small, uneconomic holdings exist.  Surely there is an obligation on the Minister for Agriculture to address himself to the repeated representations on behalf of small holders, representations by members of the House, committees of agriculture and various farming and vocational organisations.  These small-holders are worse off even than people working publicly or privately for £6 or £7 a week.  They do not even measure up to the agricultural wage or anything like it, small as it is, that obtains in other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The question of agricultural workers does not arise in my area because they have gone.  The people could not pay them.  Why should a man work on the land for half the amount he can get in industry or in some other employment? Before leaving that question, I want to ask the Minister what he is going to do for the small farmers?  We get White Papers and we get a few reports now and again about the prospects of the small farmer.  I remember a long time ago the former Minister got away nicely for five or six years with the Milk Costings report. That was originated by the late Minister for Agriculture, God rest him.  It was on the move for almost six years. Finally, it came to light.  Deputy Smith was Minister when the report came along.  It cost several thousand pounds and the Exchequer agreed that it cost more than £30,000 to compile this report but not a single member of this House got a copy of it.  There were only a few extracts read as far as I know.  The money went down the drain, so to speak.  They kept the farmers of this country waiting five <Col N="2568" /> years.  They were told by the Minister:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have a commission set up to examine your affairs.  You must wait until we get the report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that this report is a very valuable document from the information I got about it, even though it was completely discarded, thrown into the wastepaper basket or put in some place in the Department of Agriculture where it will never see the light of day. We got certain information and certain extracts from that report.  The one formidable assertion in the report of the Milk Costings Commission was that the conditions of farming varied very much in this country.  It even mentioned that the cost of milk production at that time varied from 5d. per gallon to 2/9 per gallon.</P>
    <P>That was a big variation.  Naturally, the Minister might say that it is very difficult to bolster up milk production in uneconomic districts.  The report indicated very clearly the position of the small farmers whose cost of production is so much higher than the big farmer.  It costs the small man in my part of the country going to creamery with a churn of milk just as much as if he had five churns of milk. I think it is time that we got some more definite information about these small farms.</P>
    <P>We have here in the Minister's activities another sample which will keep us going for the next 12 months. There is a paragraph in the notes on the activities of the small farmers in relation to the small western farms to the effect that the Minister set up an informal committee to make submissions. I should like to ask the Minister whether this is something on a par with the Milk Costings Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from notes on the main activities of the Department at page 29.  In fact, I did not quote; I only paraphrased.  I hope this report will bear more fruit than the Milk Costings Commission but the terms of this report are somewhat similar to the terms of the Milk Costings report which was to report on the price of milk in the <Col N="2569" /> different parts of the country, the average costings and so on.  This is a report concerning the small western farms.  Having regard to the fact that portion of the report was made available quite recently, we expect some more elaborate statements later on, particularly from the Agricultural Institute and other organisations that some effort will be made to follow the trend of the report.</P>
      <P>We had a statement from a previous speaker about the advisability of developing horticulture on the small farm.  I hope that some useful work will be done in the uneconomic districts of Ireland to bolster up the economy of the areas.</P>
      <P>Before I leave the question of small farms, I should like to refer to the remarks made by the Minister on our possible joining of the EEC.  It is quite clear from the terms of the Treaty of Rome that there is little or no hope for the small farmer in the Common Market. I assume we will do nothing about joining the EEC for the next 14 or 15 months.  I know from today's Press that Britain may not join until the Autumn of 1963, if she will join. I assume that our job so far as the EEC is concerned is to follow Britain's footsteps.  We cannot jump ahead of Britain in case we find ourselves members while she remains outside. We will have to be cautious and keep a step behind Britain.  The Minister for Justice may smile but at the last election, we had very interesting statements about the EEC, the small farmers, the big farmers and agriculture in general.  It is a well-known fact that members of the Government Party during the election campaign said that once we became members of EEC the price of creamery milk would go up to 2/9 a gallon.  That would be an increase somewhere in the region of 90 per cent.  Deputy Corry made that assertion.  Others had the same thing to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many reports that have come to our notice so far as the Common Market is concerned there is nothing factual to indicate that the price of milk will increase to 2/9 per gallon.  I cannot visualise what will be the position, if and when we enter the EEC. <Col N="2570" /> However, there will be another agriculture Estimate before that day dawns.  As I have already stated, it is clear that we will not move ahead of Britain.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his report dealing with poultry and eggs has agreed that the industry is on the decline.  He more or less accepts the general viewpoint that eggs and poultry, including turkeys, are very much on the decline and that the prices of such stock are not economic.  I referred to the small farmers a while ago.  I had in mind that eight, nine or ten years ago, these people, particularly the womenfolk, had a fine way of making money through the poultry industry.  It gave them self-employment of an economic kind.  The women-folk of the family had their hens and chickens and their weekly supply of eggs as an addition to the family income.  That source of income has gone.  It is true some people are still holding on to poultry and eggs in the hope that prices may improve at some future date.  At present, on the figures given to us by the Minister, the net return from the export of poultry and eggs last year including turkeys was less than £1,500,000.  That speaks for itself. How many millions was it worth some years ago?  Is that not a reduction in the income of these people?  Have they not been robbed of that income?</P>
    <P>I turn now to pigs.  The first item I notice in this report of the Department's activities is that the number of breeding sows increased to 121,000 this year, an increase of almost 13,000 on last year.  I should like to know from the Minister how this increase came about.  Is he satisfied it is a good thing to have an increase of 13,000 in the number of breeding sows? In several parts of the country, particularly in the constituency I represent, sows are a very important item in the economy of the farmer and even of the cottier.  You have small farmers with one, two, or three sows.  If everything turns out well, they will have two litters of bonhams for sale from each sow annually.  That is a big source of income.  Many of these farmers would find it difficult to make ends meet, were it not for this source of income.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that we <Col N="2571" /> now have people going in for keeping sows in a very big way.  Before the poultry industry finished up, we had concerns keeping several thousand chickens and so on.  I hear the same is happening, as far as sows are concerned. In fact, it has come to my notice that one organisation has 30 sows on one farm.  If the number of sows is to appreciate because of concerns going in for the mass production of bonhams, it will have a most deleterious effect on the small man.  It will mean prices will be depressed. The Minister should pay special attention to the number of sows being kept by concerns, agricultural societies or individual farmers.  I am very much against limitation on or interference with the private affairs of concerns or farmers, but I believe a limit should be put on the number of sows they are allowed to keep.  It is completely unfair to other people earning their livelihood, or part of it, by keeping sows for breeding to have some organisations set up sow farms and having 20 or 30 sows.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did it ever strike the Deputy that there have been many upward changes in prices in the past few years but that still remains at 240/- because the supply is quite sufficient to keep the price depressed <Col N="2572" /> at the fixed level?  I am sure Deputy Dillon will accept that a person who got 240/- for something in 1957 should now get something more.  When Deputy Dillon addressed the House, I think he calculated that £1 in 1962 is equal to 16/- in 1957.  There is a 20 per cent. decline in the value of money. Yet the pig price has not improved.</P>
      <P>I want to again stress to the Minister the advisability of having reports from his live-stock inspectors on the establishment of sow farms, whether the number of pigs there is large or small.  This kind of scheme is, I think, in its infancy.  It should be nipped in the bud.  It should not be allowed to develop to the stage where individuals can keep an unlimited number of sows. I can visualise the adverse affects that would have on the small-holders who keep one, two or three sows.</P>
      <P>The Minister had a good deal to say about the BTE scheme.  We are all as anxious as possible to co-operate with the Minister in the implementation of that scheme and to ensure maximum success for it.</P>

      <P>I have lost no opportunity to press, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, for improvements in the services in question. I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 6th June, 1961, in which I mentioned some of the improvements which had been then achieved.</P>
      <P>Among additional improvements for this season are the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  At least 40 additional sailings will be provided this season on the routes in question, 26 on the Dún Laoghaire route and 17 on the Rosslare route.  On the Dún Laoghaire route, passenger capacity for the 1962 summer season is approximately double the numbers actually carried last year.</P>
      <P>(ii)  To encourage more even utilisation of the services, the validity of the cheap mid-week fares has been extended and the requirement of sailing tickets for day sailings has been cut to the minimum.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the services provided by British Railways, improvements at the mail boat pier at Dún Laoghaire are continuing.</P>
      <P>There are catering facilities available at Dún Laoghaire, Rosslare and Fishguard as well as on the vessels and trains which operate from these ports.  These services have in recent years been extended and improved following representations and suggestions by Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>The inquiry referred to presumably relates to an investigation carried out by officers of my Department into matters concerning the civilian employees of the Department in Dún Chill Choinnigh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this investigation occurred in the <Col N="2587" /> normal administrative course I do not consider the public interest would be served by making public the terms of the report submitted by those officers to their superiors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister should give the result of that investigation to the House.  The workers in Kilkenny are very disturbed at the results of it and at the penalty imposed.  The Minister has mentioned one employee as being removed from the stores at a loss of 5/- a week. Is he aware that one employee lost his employment last year?  Is he aware that a foreman has been asked to take up work in Naas?  Is he aware that a man who was promoted storeman for one day was demoted again?  Many questions have been raised and to allay the anxiety of these people in Kilkenny, the Minister should give fuller details than he has given of the findings of the inquiry carried out by the military authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>No; the Deputy is not making a request for a public sworn inquiry.  The Deputy is making a request that the findings be made known of an investigation which had the effect of causing one tradesman to lose his position in the barracks, another man to be promoted by phone one day as storeman, confirmed the following day in writing and in the next couple of days, to be demoted again, another man to be let go apparently on the basis of being redundant but brought back again not to his old position but to a position as storeman. The Minister would be doing the Government a reasonable service by giving the results of the inquiry.  After all, the results cannot damn anybody. They cannot damn the Minister.  There <Col N="2588" /> is nothing political in the results&mdash;I hope not anyway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence (1)  whether he is aware that the Secretary of his Department has stated by letter that of the sum of £72 4s. 2d. still withheld from the gratuity of a retired officer the sum of £50 is in respect of the loss by theft of certain stores; (2)  whether it is a fact that on his conviction for the theft of such stores an NCO was released on his undertaking to repay the value of the stolen goods; (3)  whether the officer after his retirement was found responsible in any way for the loss by theft of certain goods; if so, whether by Court of Inquiry, Audit Board or other tribunal; and whether he was given the opportunity of hearing any evidence at such tribunal or giving <Col N="2589" /> evidence on his own behalf; (4) whether, if the officer now suffers a deduction from his gratuity of £50, this will entail a modification of the undertaking given by the NCO to repay the value of stolen goods and a modification of the verdict of the Civil Court which tried the NCO; (5) whether he has read the proceedings and findings of the Court of Inquiry into the deficiencies in the FCA stores in question; and whether in the light of the special circumstances established by that Court he will now either reduce to £22 4s. 2d. the amount to be deducted from the officer's gratuity in substantial conformity with the findings of the Court; or, if not, whether he will furnish to the officer the particulars of the basis on which he has reached a decision to enable the officer to furnish an explanation for further consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to (1) is that the letter from the Secretary of my Department stated that, of the sum of £72 4s. 2d. which it is proposed the officer should pay, £50 is related to the stolen stores.  The reply to (2)  is that the non-commissioned officer was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, not to be enforced if he paid the sum of £663 3s. 9d. within a stipulated period.  He has not done so.  As to (3)  I satisfied myself, having regard to all the facts, that the officer's responsibility is reasonably measured in the sum of £72 4s. 2d.  With regard to (4), it was because of reluctance to withhold indefinitely a very large portion of the officer's gratuity and because of the strong representations made as to the difficulties which withholding it created for him that I formulated the proposal which has now been conveyed to the officer, before the eventual position as to payment by the ex-CQMS is known.  I am not in a position to express an opinion on the specific point raised by the Deputy.  If, however, the ex-CQMS eventually paid in full any deduction made from the officer and related to the stolen stores would, of course, be reconsidered.  As to (5), I have given full consideration to all <Col N="2590" /> relevant factors and I arrived at a conclusion which I regard as not in the least inequitable to the officer.  I have given him a full indication of the grounds for that conclusion and at the same time I have given him the opportunity of submitting whatever representations he wishes before I order the deduction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it from the Minister's reply to the fourth part of the question that the officer was not found responsible for the amount of £50 by any tribunal whatsoever?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question which I asked the Minister in the first place: was he found responsible by any tribunal, and the answer the Minister gave to me was that the Minister had come to some conclusion. May I ask the Minister now whether he came to that conclusion as a result of an inquiry or finding by any tribunal or whether this is a purely arbitrary decision, as I suspect it is?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The conclusion I came to was arrived at not on the basis of the report of the inquiry exclusively. As I have said, I have taken all the facts and factors into account and I have arrived at a decision which I think is quite fair to the officer concerned. I am now awaiting his representations and on receipt of them a further decision will have to be made by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While we wish the B.T.E. scheme every success, I should like to get some information from the Minister on its costings.  To date, the cost is £30.5 million.  The net amount paid to herd owners is £19,300,000, so that more than one-third of the total expenditure has gone on administrative expenses.  I believe that is far in excess of what it should be.  The number of cows in the country <Col N="2594" /> at present, according to the last page of the notes, is 1,290,500.  That figure is somewhat greater than the previous year's figure and, as those of us who are conversant with the BTE scheme know, TB is more or less confined to cows.  The percentage of affected cattle other than cows is very low.  In County Cork, the figure at the original inspection was only about six per cent., and it scaled down to a negligible percentage in some cases.  Taking the Minister's figures, we must bear in mind that up to date more than £23 per cow has been spent by the Department on this scheme.  That is more than £23 per head of our total cow population. That is a formidable figure, and the question now is, could the work be carried out cheaper?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>That all the money was spent on cows only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The greater part of it.  I have mentioned, as one who has studied the figures supplied monthly by the chief officer for Cork, and the figures for the other counties as they became available, that TB was confined to a great extent to cows and that the percentage of non-cow reactors was small.  In some areas, more than 40 per cent. of the cow population was affected, while the non-cow population affected was only about five or six per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the cow population, we have paid up to the present more than £23 per head towards the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  Have we been successful?  Was the money utilised to the best advantage?  Could we have done better?  Were better methods suggested by members of the House and if they were accepted, would they have reduced the all-in cost by a considerable amount?  They were not accepted and the Minister and the Department devised this scheme and no advice was accepted, and no recommendations from subsidiary committees, such as the Cork <Col N="2595" /> BTE Committee, were accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>We find that a number of herd owners who had 12 or 13 cows at the original inspection have more reactors now than they had originally.  It seems that this matter was treated lightly, to a great extent, in the early stages.  A man with 15 cows had, say, five reactors. The herd was tested; he sold two or three reactors and said he would hold on to a few that were good milkers.  When the next test came, he still had five reactors or, perhaps, six.  Unfortunately, some of these cattle are carriers of TB and spread the disease not only to animals in their own herd but to adjoining herds also.  As a result, we had to pay big sums by way of headage grants and also for the administration of the scheme.</P>
    <P>To date, we have paid £23 per head of the cow population under this scheme.  I assert with some reasonable knowledge of this work and after conversations with people familiar with the technical side of the problem, that the cost is much greater than it should be and possibly if we had tackled the programme in a different way in the early stages, or if the Minister had accepted recommendations addressed to him after close and careful consideration by local organisations such as the BTE Committee in Cork, we might have had better and cheaper results.</P>
    <P>We are told that compulsory measures are being introduced in the southern area.  Having regard to the amount of money being expended, it is possibly necessary to introduce such measures.  We dislike compulsion but unfortunately some seven or nine per cent., I think, of the farmers in County Cork refused to co-operate in the scheme or at least failed to apply or have a first test.  Naturally I assume it is essential for the common good to introduce such measures.</P>
    <P>We have now reached the position where herds must be attested and reactors disposed of, whether we like it or not.  A peculiarity of this scheme is that 79 per cent. of the farmers in the County Cork did not co-operate. <Col N="2596" /> You possibly have a similar percentage of farmers in the other five counties of the southern area.  Viewing it not from the national point of view but from their own personal angle, they were very wise men because they will do better than the man who was co-operating in the scheme all along and who had his tests frequently.  When his cows went down, some of them good milkers, he sent them to the farm or market immediately and got rid of them.  The Minister is looking very nicely after the man who did not bother.  He will not be at any personal loss or inconvenience.</P>
    <P>The Minister will tell us now: &ldquo;We will test your cattle.  It is compulsory and, of course, we will pay you the market value for any cattle that are found to be reactors.&rdquo;  The percentage of people who did not co-operate in the scheme are now guaranteed the market value for their reactors, as if they never reacted.  That is made quite clear.  They will be bought at their market value.  That may be all right, but I think we should have some foreknowledge of this.</P>
    <P>Let me take my own case.  I am advising farmers, whenever I meet them or whenever they pose the question to me, that it is essential not only in their own interest but in the national interest to get rid of reactors; that there was nothing to be gained by holding on to them; that this scheme was essential for the good of the country and the cattle export trade; that they should free their herds and that the scheme in existence at the present time was possibly as good as, if not better than, any future scheme which the Minister might put forward.  However, as a result of the generous way in which the others are being dealt with, I believe that that advice was not very sound and that it would have been better for such people to have held on.</P>
    <P>If we have additional money to spend or if there is some additional fund in the kitty, some way must be found to channel most of that to those who are co-operating rather than to the other considerable percentage.  I agree that it would be very hard to use compulsory methods and take cattle <Col N="2597" /> from a person without giving him value for them.  It is peculiar, having regard to the fact that this scheme has been in existence for such a long time, that the people who held out are to fare best.  I think the Minister in his concluding statement should be in a position to let us know what the final figure will be.  We have gone a reasonable part of the road now and the Minister should be able to give us what he believes to be the approximate all-in cost of this scheme.  He should do a little explaining in regard to the expenditure of this big amount of money on the administrative side.  He should tell us how, out of the total money devoted to this scheme, more than 30 per cent. is channelled into the administration side.  That is a rather big percentage.  I think the Minister owes us some little explanation.</P>
    <P>We are told, as well, that every endeavour should be made to have attested herds and that it should be the aim of every farmer to have his herd tested.  The number of attested herds is given in this report at page 14 for the end of April, 1962.  It is unreasonable to ask people to have attested herds in isolated districts, one here and one there.  Surely it is impossible to carry out such a scheme without taking a group of farmers together?</P>
    <P>We in Cork submitted proposals to the Minister and to his Department stating that peninsulas should be deemed to be clearance areas and should be attested areas in a very short time subsequently.  The Berehaven peninsula is about 44 miles in extent. The total percentage of reactors in that area was only two&mdash;the smallest in the country.  There are a big number of small farmers there.  We in a local committee in Cork thought that where there was a peninsula it should be deemed to be an attested area.  I know the difficulty.  In view of the insignificant percentage of reactors in that area, how could you expect a farmer in that district to say he was going to have his herd deemed to be attested?  If he did that, look at the difficulty that would confront him in the sale and purchase of cattle, when everyone round him was not <Col N="2598" /> attested.  Surely the obvious thing to do, when you have a big group of farmers, is to attest the lot in bulk? A similar position could apply in the other two peninsulas&mdash;Sheeps Head and Mizen Head, as well as in the islands.  I do not want to delay further on the matter.  I hope that in the not too distant future the Minister will be able to say that the work has concluded.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat any statement I made here earlier on, but in dealing with milk, the price of milk and butter and the income of farmers, I overlooked the question of home-made butter.  Home-made butter does not cost the Exchequer anything by way of subsidy or any subvention from the Department.  The quantity of home-made butter is very small, as the returns here indicate.  Of course, people produce this type of butter only when it is not possible for them to avail of the creamery service.  I believe that they should get some consideration.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in a group of people who have no opportunity whatsoever of sending butter to the creamery.  Those are the farmers in the islands off the coast of West Cork.  There are a big number of small holdings there.  Butter production is completely uneconomic in such places. Representations were made to have a travelling creamery provided to meet their requirements but that was found to be impossible.  I agree that a travelling creamery was not a practical proposition, but in any case the Dairy Disposal Board, which is a State-sponsored body, in the course of their submissions to the Government, actually rejected completely the idea of providing creamery facilities by way of travelling creamery.  They also believed that the islanders had a good case for special consideration.</P>
    <P>If my information is correct, they made the case that here was a group of people entitled to subsidy, that creamery butter produced in inaccessible places should be subsidised to some extent, say, from 3d. to 6d. I questioned the Minister here on the submission of this independent and neutral body.  I assume they viewed this matter impartially and made their <Col N="2599" /> submission.  I would ask the Minister to consider this case as a special one. I am sure he will agree these people are entitled to some increase in their income.  The only increase this Government have given that type of farmer is this insignificant increase in rates.  Most of them are of £6 or £7 valuation and they will benefit from the recent Government measures to the extent of about sixpence or sevenpence per week.  I do not know whether the Minister considers that reasonable help for these people.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the Connemara scheme mentioned in this report on the Department's activities.  It states, at page 21:</P>
    <P>Rated occupiers in that part of Co. Galway west of the Corrib whose rateable valuation (including buildings) is less than £10 per acre are eligible for grants amounting to 3/4 the estimated cost of the approved work (subject to a maximum of £30 per acre) and, in addition, where the land reclaimed requires ground limestone or fertilisers, these materials are supplied free of charge up to a limit of £8 per acre.  Up to the end of March, 1962, grants had been approved under this scheme for work on five thousand acres.</P>
    <P>In the constituency of South West Cork, which I represent, I believe we could make as good a case, to put it mildly, as the Connemara districts for such concessions.  I am sure the Minister has an idea of the type of land on the islands and the three peninsulas. The same could be said of South Kerry and other parts of the southern seaboard.  I would ask the Minister to consider the extension of that scheme. I do not see why such a scheme should be confined to one area.  It is a big advantage to farmers in that district to get £8 worth of fertiliser free of charge along with the £75 grant for reclamation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to remind the Minister of the problems besetting the small farmers.  I hope that this report on the small farms will be acted upon and that the Department will initiate the establishment of <Col N="2600" /> industry based on agriculture, such as the processing of vegetables, in the seaboard areas.  I cannot see why the Minister cannot find the money to devote to the development of the agricultural industry.  It has been the main industry of this country for centuries and will remain so for years to come.  A foreign industrialist has no trouble in getting large grants for industries of doubtful value, doubtful in that they may not measure up to economic requirements and, as has happened, may not continue for very long.</P>
    <P>I am making a special plea on behalf of the farming community in general and in particular on behalf of the small farmers.  The Minister should be more watchful than he is of agricultural interests.  Every other Minister looks after the people within his sphere of activity better than the Minister for Agriculture is looking after his.  All other sections are fairly well catered for now so far as increased incomes are concerned.  They are much better looked after than the farming community.  It is the Minister's job to ensure that the farming community will continue to get their fair share of the national kitty.  I do not think they are getting it at present. The small farmers and the small shopkeepers are two sections not getting their share.  The Minister's job is to ensure that farmers, big or small, will be treated fairly; but in view of the difficulties facing the small farmers, if there are any special measures which would help them, such measures should be brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to be in the position to congratulate the Minister on the very excellent work he has done in this particular field. When one looks back on the early <Col N="2601" /> stages of this scheme, and recognises the great obstacles which faced the Minister in his efforts to get this disease under control, one must admit immediately that he has done excellent work.  In the beginning, he had to convince the farmer that this work was necessary.  I remember meeting many farmers at that time who appeared to think this effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis was a fad, something which would pass after a time, and in relation to which there was no necessity to be in any way concerned.  When the Minister succeeded in convincing the farmer that it was vitally essential, it was then necessary to convince him that it was possible.  Again, remembering the enormous obstacles, it was difficult to convince the farmer that it would be possible to eradicate the disease.</P>
      <P>I should like to couple with these congratulations my congratulations to the NFA for the manner in which they helped to convince their members of the necessity for this work.  Finally, I should like to point out to those who are engaged in manufacturing industry and who, on occasion, complained of the very large sums which were being devoted to this particular purpose that, were it not for the fact that this work was undertaken, and were it not for the drive and energy put into it, our cattle industry could have collapsed; if that happened, then the raw materials necessary to keep our factories going would not be available.</P>

      <P>This Estimate is one of the most important which comes before this House.  It provides a quarter of the national income, absorbs one-third of those gainfully employed and, in one way or another, is responsible for three-fourths of our exports.  For that reason, it is necessary that we should concern ourselves with the possible admission of this country into the Common Market and consider the effect that this might have upon our major industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, we are all, I think, agreed that agriculture will benefit from our admission to the <Col N="2602" /> Common Market.  That is not to say that it will benefit without any effort on our part, that we are, for example, producing the best quality products, processing them in the most efficient way, where that is necessary, and marketing them in the most efficient manner; in short, that agriculture will have a simple or a soft time if we succeed in our application for admission to the Common Market.  Far from it.  In fact, without a positive effort on our part, the obvious benefits which should accrue from membership of the Common Market could very easily pass us by.  In my opinion, that would be disastrous for the country because it is mainly dependent for its economic life on agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural provisions of the Rome Treaty and the proposals of the Commission for a common agricultural policy are something with which we can, I think, be in relatively full agreement.  The common agricultural policy is based on a system of fixed price, with variable levies on imports, and with the objective of raising farming incomes and of maintaining the family farm.  That is a very desirable objective, so far as we are concerned.  In time, it will, I think, eliminate fluctuating prices for agricultural products, which are largely the cause of any uncertainty which has been for a considerable number of years noticeable in agricultural production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast bulk of our exports goes to Britain.  It is clear to everybody that this trend will continue if we become members of the Common Market.  While we would face severe competition in the British market, this would be compensated for very considerably by the better conditions which would be available from the point of view of price.  As we are aware, at the present time the British system puts many of our agricultural exports, such as eggs, dairy products, and bacon, in a vulnerable position.  As time passed, were the position not to change, the fact that there would be reductions in the tariff wall between <Col N="2603" /> Britain and the EFTA countries would place us in an even more difficult position.  Our exports to the Common Market countries are at the moment restricted in many ways but, if we get into the market and if we are in a position to compete with producers in the Common Market countries, because we are a relatively low-cost producing country, we would have a very good chance of getting a reasonable corner of the market.</P>
    <P>Taking it, then, that we are satisfied we would have improvement generally in regard to agriculture, if we were to get into the Common Market, it is, of course, necessary for us to examine the various exports we have and to consider what their position might be.  Because of the natural advantages we have here, the beef trade would have the greatest potential under free trade.  We have, relatively speaking, and compared with prices in Europe generally, a low price for our beef.  At the moment, the bulk of our beef is exported on the hoof.  With an expanding market for beef products, I believe the dead meat trade should improve very considerably.  Such an improvement would have, of course, a number of advantages in that it would give us a better price for the animal and also help in the establishment of various industries to deal with the by-products.</P>
    <P>According to statistics available, there is a surplus of milk and milk products in the Common Market countries.  Whether this is caused in a natural way or because these countries subsidise, in one way or another, their milk production, I am not sure, but I think it is for the second reason. The fact that there is a surplus should not deter us because production costs and marketing will have a very considerable effect on sales.  As I have said, if we can produce a quality article at the right price, and market it efficiently, there is no doubt that we will be able to compete and gain our share of the market.</P>
    <P>The milk yield here is low mainly because we turn it into a low-priced product.  Other Deputies have discussed the position with regard to <Col N="2604" /> cheese.  I do not intend to go into it in any detail.  The production of cheese here is low.  While we constantly advocate that cheese production should be increased, we have to recognise that it is not an easy industry to operate. For the better grade cheese, a very high quality milk is needed.  The techniques of cheese making are also very complicated.</P>
    <P>We should not be deterred by any temporary setback in this field.  We have had some setbacks in it but we should not be deterred by them.  We have cheap production costs here and we should be able to compete in this market.  I have no doubt that Bord Bainne is examining the whole structure of the creamery industry and that from that examination we will get results in time.</P>
    <P>With regard to grain crops, it is agreed that there will be some reduction in the wheat acreage under Common Market conditions.  This reduction will be compensated for by an increase in the production of barley.  Wheat, however, will remain an important cash crop as far as the farmer is concerned. The increased price for barley which is visualised under Common Market conditions will have its effect on the pig industry.  That effect may not be so bad for the farmer feeding his own barley to his pigs but it will have a detrimental effect unless we can do something with regard to those who will have to buy barley for feeding purposes.  This matter concerns not only individuals but pretty wide areas throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We will have to be able to answer a number of questions if we are to be successful with regard to the pig industry. One question is why we cannot get the same price for our bacon as the Danes can get for theirs.  Our pig food is as good as theirs.  Part of the answer seems to lie in the methods of feeding.  There are new methods advocated to produce the most attractive type of pig.  The question of housing also arises.  Here the increased grants to farmers for piggeries are having their effect.  I was glad to know from the Minister that there is a considerable increase in the demand for these grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2605" /> There is also the question of our marketing methods.  We have to ask ourselves if they are as good as those of the Danes.  I am afraid, from my experience of enquiring into these matters in Liverpool some years ago, that we have a lot to learn.  There is the question of our overall costs, and whether we are conducting experiments in costings to see how our costings compare with those of the Danes.</P>
    <P>Because of the fact that our horticultural industry is of relatively recent origin and is a protected industry and because, so far as we are able to ascertain, there will be free trade in vegetables and fruit in Common Market conditions we will have to strain every effort if we are to keep our horticultural industry alive.  Much of our horticultural produce is protected in season and we have to consider what will happen if there is free access to our markets for horticultural products from the Continent.  Our aim must be to increase production in this line and to reduce costs as much as possible.</P>
    <P>To do this, expert advice is necessary and I am glad to note that over the past few months the Department have been particularly anxious to help county committees of agriculture in sending members of their advisory services to countries such as Holland to learn what they can do in this field. The county committee in Louth were glad to avail of the opportunity of sending a member of their advisory service to Holland on a study tour there and we have no doubt that what this man has learned there will be of great value to the horticultural producers in the county.</P>
    <P>The deep freeze scheme of Córas Siúicre Éireann is another matter which is very helpful in this regard.  If we could develop this facet of our agriculture to a high degree of efficiency we would be going a considerable way towards helping the small farmer.  In fact, it would help to clear away many of the problems that face our small farmers at the present time.  Many Deputies have laid stress on the fact that it is impossible for the small farmer to farm <Col N="2606" /> successfully when using the methods applicable to the large farms.  It is impossible for the small farmer, as Deputy Moher has said, to ranch successfully.</P>
    <P>In connection with horticulture processing is most important and I feel that with the great market shortly to be opened up to us in this field, there is a great future for our processing industry.  This is the type of industry we would prefer to have as it is based on home-produced raw materials.  With reference to the sale of agricultural products it is difficult to decide which is the most important aspect, producing goods at the right price, processing them as efficiently as possible or marketing them.  We recognise that they are all important aspects but from our point of view, because it seems to be the least developed, I think we will have to concentrate to a considerable extent on marketing.</P>
    <P>It is easy to criticise our marketing endeavours, but I would stress that the really important matter in connection with marketing is that we must be able to guarantee continuity of supply. It is absolutely useless to attempt marketing unless we can guarantee that continuity.  One could not visualise an industrialist sending out salesmen with a first-class product to sell, telling them to go around and sell as much of it as possible, to create a market, and at the same time, making no provision for a continuous supply.</P>
    <P>If we are to be successful in our efforts to sell our agricultural goods to other countries, it is more than ever necessary, especially with the Common Market facing us, that we should follow the ordinary business maxim that the customer is always right.  We must consider what suits the British palate, what suits the German palate, what suits the French palate, and so on.  For example, we must be concerned about whether they want their bacon fat or lean.  We must be concerned about the method of packaging.  We could learn something from the report issued some time ago by the Swedish experts on design.  We <Col N="2607" /> find, for example, that one colour attracts the customer, another colour repels.  It is essential that we should study the basic principles of salesmanship. However, the most important aspect of all is to be able to give the customer continuity of supply.</P>
    <P>In a study I made some years ago in connection with our butter in Britain, I found that where a supply was available, eventually people would begin to buy it.  They developed a taste for Irish butter and then after some time, the supply dropped off.  The result was that when the supply became available again, people had developed other tastes in regard to butter and our butter had to start at the bottom price in the market again so as to get a footing.</P>
    <P>Should we enter the Common Market, I recognise our agriculture will have an uphill road to travel. However, the reward when we get to the top will be well worthwhile.  We shall have new confidence which will be based on stable economic conditions in the industry.  I would suggest, too, that we redouble our efforts to attract the industries from the Continent which are using agricultural products as raw materials.  If we could get industries from the Continent which are basing their products on these raw materials, it would be of benefit, first of all, to our own farmers.  These industrialists would also have a knowledge of what exactly the continental people want and would be in a better position to supply it.  The fundamental point we must always keep in mind is, that while we have natural advantages in relation to agriculture, success in the long run will depend on our ability to produce a quality article at the right price, to process it efficiently where that is necessary, and to market it well.</P>
    <P>To do this, we need more and more technical know-how, and more and more research.  The farmers' bugbear has always been over-production, whereas in order to be successful now, we need more and more production. The economic stability which the conditions laid down by the Common Market countries for agriculture, would <Col N="2608" /> appear to make available to us if and when we do enter the Common Market would give us a sound basis for increased production and a more stable economy for the country generally.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have referred to the cattle position.  We know there are fewer cattle in the country than there were last year, but the number of milch cows, the number of heifers in calf and the number of cattle under two years on the farms last January was higher than in 1961.  This is a good basis on which to proceed.  We could increase our cattle population considerably with better management of our grassland and more use of fertilisers. It is here the very excellent scheme which the Minister for Agriculture introduced some years ago of subsidising fertilisers should be of great help.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reduction which was given in the rates, I should like to compliment the Government on the fact that they made available this £2,500,000 for this purpose.  I made my own views on that clear in my speech on the Budget.  I would prefer if it had been possible to allocate a greater proportion of this money to the small farmers but we must recognise that the NFA request in connection with rates was that health and roads should be taken off the rates which was tantamount to asking for a reduction of a specific amount in the £.  That is the manner in which this money was allocated.  The NFA is a democratic body and the manner of the allocation of this money was obviously the manner in which they wanted it allocated.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the courteous manner in which he has dealt with the many problems from my constituency which I have put before him during the past year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start by quoting from the Minister's speech last Thursday:</P>
      <P>As the House is aware a useful arrangement was negotiated some time ago with the United States authorities under which some 5,000 tons of sugar were exported to that country on favourable terms, in consideration of the import of a quantity of maize.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2609" /> Deputy Clinton and I yesterday asked the Minister if he would state if the export of sugar was contingent on buying maize and how much maize was bought.  We did not get any answer from the Minister at all, except a reference to a document in the Library.  It seems to me that a Question asked in this House is the property of the House and that Deputies are entitled to know the answer.  As the Minister would not give the answer, I am forced to give it myself in the House to-day, having looked at the facts.  As far as I can read the Agreement made, the arrangement is that in return for the export of 5,000 tons of sugar, we have to buy 50,000 metric tons of yellow corn over and above the normal purchase of yellow grain from the United States of America.</P>
    <P>That poses a question as to whether it is a good deal or not.  I agree that it is highly desirable that we should try to sell sugar to the US.  It is obvious there must be a considerable market for it in the US, in view of the changed trading relations between the US and Cuba.  But is it a good deal when we have to buy more maize or yellow corn from America in return for the sugar we export?  I wonder if there is not some other avenue of export, especially when we consider that we are already importing nearly £2 million worth of yellow corn from the US, and that we are importing 1,000 tons of feeding barley also?  It seems that it would be better overall policy if the Minister were to give a better price for barley and encourage farmers to grow more foodstuffs at home.  At present we are guaranteed 37/- a barrel as a minimum price for barley.  That price has been guaranteed for the past few years, but the Minister knows that the cost of every item of production has gone up, wages, machinery, fuel and so on.</P>
    <P>It might well be, and probably will be, argued by the Minister, that the object of farming in this country is to produce grain as cheaply as possible so that pigs may be economically fattened.  That does not hold water as an argument when you find we are importing 1,000 tons of barley and <Col N="2610" /> nearly £2 million worth of yellow corn. In the majority of cases, barley is sold here on the open market, after the first rush is over, for £2 a barrel.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this to the Minister.  Many people have been fighting the case of the small farmer. It is the small farmer who is &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; every time with the minimum price. The bigger farmers can afford to wait; they are not in such a rush for money and have storage facilities, but the small farmer must sell the crop as soon as he has it.  That is the idea of giving a proper, fixed minimum price.  I see no reason why the Minister should not increase the minimum price for feeding barley to £2 a barrel, thus safeguarding the farmers and ensuring production here.  It is surely good economics to produce the feeding stuffs we require to rear the raw material that is vital to our balance of payments and the entire community.</P>
    <P>I am glad that quite a few Fianna Fáil Deputies took part in this debate. They have been unusually silent in recent years.  Perhaps they are not encouraged by their leaders to speak. Deputy Moher, in quite a long speech, posed many questions to the Minister. I thought his speech was very sound in spots and was a very severe indictment of the agricultural policy of the responsible Minister.  Deputy Moher made three main points: that the farmers were not producing as much as they could produce; that they had not money at their disposal to do it; and he also referred to markets.  He was not the only Deputy who did so.  Had he been in the House when Deputy Dillon was speaking, he would have heard Deputy Dillon deal with these three points very clearly and incisively. He outlined the policy of the Fine Gael Party when we get into office again.</P>
    <P>In regard to markets, he said we should look for markets other than those we have.  He said there were many possibilities and openings in many parts of the world for new markets and said the Minister should do something about that.  Whether the Minister has done anything or not, I do not know.  The only information we had from the Minister as a result <Col N="2611" /> of a Parliamentary Question today is that An Bord Bainne are supposed to be looking for markets for butter.  That is the first time we heard that information. Apparently, An Bord Bainne have secured markets for butter in several European countries.  There is no information as to what the price of that butter is, whether it is economic or whether we are just selling the butter to get rid of it.  I do not think the Minister has given us any other information as to what has been done or what his Department are doing in an effort to expand and increase agricultural markets.</P>
    <P>Dealing with Deputy Moher's queries, in regard to getting better production from the land, particularly among small farmers, Deputy Dillon said&mdash;and he is constantly advocating this&mdash;that there should be an increase in the advisory services.  Our contribution to the Freedom from Hunger campaign of the United Nations, is to send technical advisers to Tanganyika, as far as I can gather from the Minister's speech, but we are very short of technical advisers at home.  Deputy Dillon has repeatedly said that it is necessary to have an agricultural adviser in every parish.  That may not be possible, but every Deputy knows that there are insufficient advisers on agriculture in this country.  If anybody wants advice and tries to get hold of one of the agricultural instructors, he has to wait a very considerable time. In County Wexford, which is a fairly big county, I believe we have only about four agricultural matters.  We have a few horticultural advisers as well.  That is another point in our policy which the Minister would do well to adopt.</P>
    <P>Another point concerns the straitened financial circumstances of small farmers and the question of credit.  Every Deputy knows that one of the main difficulties of Irish agriculture&mdash;is that it is grossly under-capitalised.  The farms are understocked; they have insufficient fertilisers and poor fencing in many cases, all due to lack of capital.  It is no use saying that farmers are lazy, that they will not try to <Col N="2612" /> do what other farmers in other countries are doing and try to compete. Farmers in these other countries have capital at their disposal.  The only means we have of getting capital is to pay a high rate of interest.  That does not meet the situation.  If a small farmer is lent money, it imposes an obligation on him to pay interest of perhaps 6 per cent.  If he goes to the bank, even if he is creditworthy and gets a loan, he is not in a position to repay the loan and has to bear the extra charge of the interest.  Small farmers cannot do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon stated categorically here&mdash;and in his election address also &mdash;that it is the policy of this Party to give farmers interest-free loans of up to £1,000.  Someone, sooner or later, will have to do that if they want to put agriculture on an equal footing with other countries.  There is no use talking about being competitive, being able to increase our production and being able to sell in other markets unless they are put in a position to do it.  That brings me to the question of the small farmers.</P>
    <P>A report has recently been issued&mdash; the Report of the inter-Departmental Committee&mdash;which gives many reasons why people are leaving the land and why they are leaving the farms in the west of Ireland and the poorer parts of the country.  You need not even go to the west of Ireland or the poorer parts of the country to see people leaving the land.  They are leaving the land everywhere.  That is a situation which obtains in countries other than Ireland but they are not leaving at the same rate as the people in Ireland. They are leaving the land in Ireland because of the things I have been talking about; because they are under-capitalised and have not got reliable markets.</P>
    <P>The inter-Departmental Committee seems to indicate&mdash;and I largely agree with it&mdash;that the particular form of husbandry which exists in this country at the moment is not suited to the small farms.  I want to suggest that in the light of the discussion going on in Europe in relation to the Common Market, whether it relates to agriculture <Col N="2613" /> or any other aspects of the economy, the aim of the Common Market is an outward-looking one.  It is a world policy.</P>
    <P>If a common agricultural policy for Europe is achieved, one of the things that must result therefrom is that each country will be encouraged to produce what it is best able to produce.  We will be somewhat fortunate if we get into the Common Market in that we are in a position to produce the two things that will probably be saleable within the Common Market itself and, indeed, not only within the Common Market but also in other parts of the world.  Those two things are protein in the form of meat and processed milk and horticultural produce.  That brings me back for a moment to the question of the small farmers in the poorer areas of Ireland who are living on a few acres of land and are unable to get a satisfactory living from the land. They are unable to maintain the members of their families or even themselves on the land.  Surely horticulture opens up for them prospects?  The climate is suitable.  We have a better climate than Denmark or Holland.  Both of those countries go in for horticultural produce.</P>
    <P>We are able to produce vegetables earlier in the year than the people in Holland.  We can produce greens and cauliflowers from February on and even sometimes from January on.  The frost in continental Europe destroys these products.  Therefore, we can supply these products and put them on the market earlier than they can.  It is, perhaps, not right for me to speak about the west since I am an Eastern Deputy.  The climate in the west of Ireland is particularly mild and free from frost.  In that area, there are admirable opportunities for widespread horticultural development, both in vegetables and fruit.</P>
    <P>Deputies may well say that if you produce vegetables and fruit <i>ad lib</i>, you are going to glut the market.  They are perishable goods and you will not be able to get rid of them.  That reminds me of what the Danes did.  They preserved the fruit and set up fruit processing plants.  They have an industrial <Col N="2614" /> arm associated with agriculture. In Denmark to-day, there are only 22 per cent. of the people engaged in agriculture. Our percentage is, I believe, 39.  The rest of the people in Denmark, apart from the few employed in heavy industry, are employed in the processing of agricultural products.</P>
    <P>There is a market there.  There is an up and coming market in the United Kingdom to which we export most of our products.  The market has grown enormously during the past few years.  It was £15,000,000; it is now approximately £40,000,000.  There is almost an unlimited market for that type of produce in the United States of America.  I submit that we can extend our agricultural arm.  We can export to Europe having regard to the outward looking policy.  When we have a united European policy, we can export all over the world.</P>
    <P>In the statement of the activities of the Department of Agriculture, I could not discover anything about horticulture. If there was anything about it, it was buried away in some obscure part.  The horticultural activities of the section within the Department of Agriculture are very limited.  I think the Minister should bear these things in mind.  He should bear in mind the discussions which are going on and which are bound to go on in relation to the Common Market, whether we are to be a full member or an associate member.</P>
    <P>The standard of living is rising in Europe.  When the standard of living rises, people acquire a taste for the higher quality products.  Having regard to our climate and the grass we grow, we possess the best and the highest quality meat in the world.  On the Continent of Europe, the custom has been largely to go in for poultry and pig meat, veal and so on.  They are more inclined to concentrate on the older type of meat.  With the rising standard of living there, there is no doubt that the Common Market area is booming with prosperity.</P>
    <P>Taking the statistics of the EEC and those of FAO, they are 6 per cent, deficient in their meat requirements in the Common Market, although <Col N="2615" /> they may produce more themselves as time goes on.  Their standard of living is improving and the market is increasing all the time.  We have that market for a first-class product.  I do not see that we should have any anxiety, if and when we get into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>With regard to the further extension of protein products, I have already said that there is a demand for protein even in countries that are already enjoying a fair standard of living&mdash; the new emerging countries throughout the world.  According to the FAO statistics, they are short of protein. They have not as yet developed their economy.  They, too, to a very great extent, can buy the higher class product we have to offer them, such as meat and processed milk.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister, his advisers or any of the numerous boards associated with agriculture, have done anything about looking for markets along those lines?  I happen to know that in Nigeria&mdash;it has a population of 35 million&mdash;they have to bring their cattle by rail from up country to the populous areas on the coast where the industrial sections and the residential areas are. Whatever fat is on them when they leave the fields, by the time they get to the coast, there is no meat on them at all.  Nigeria has to import meat from New Zealand and Argentina. Have we sent a trade delegation there to look for exports of beef?  If we have not, the sooner we do, the better. I understand that the greater part of £250,000 voted in the first Fianna Fáil Budget when they came back to power in 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If money is wanted, surely the Minister could go to the Minister for Finance and look for more money for an important matter such as trying to get exports of meat?  Would the Minister tell us if he or anybody else has done anything about looking for exports of first-class products such as meat to any of these emergent countries?  Have they done anything about trying to export the cheaper type of protein there?  If they have done so, I will withdraw everything I have said.</P>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister about the Farm Improvement Scheme.  If a farmer puts up a building under this scheme, the peculiar situation obtains in my constituency that there are two inspectors.  One inspects the building and, when he is finished, he has to wait until another man comes along and looks at the same building.  Is that necessary?  First, it seems to involve double expense to have two inspections of the same building.  Secondly, it leads to frustratingly long delays.  I am told that the delays with regard to paying grants under this scheme are due to the big backlog of work.

      <P>The information I have is that he has to get the advice of his senior, whether he wants it or not.  If I am wrong, let the Minister say so.  If I am right in my suggestion, then I think each of the inspectors should do a particular job of his own, instead of having this overlapping of work.  Then we will not have this continuous backlog we have had all along.</P>
      <P>The carriers of wheat have complained to me, as they have to other Deputies, that they are not allowed by the Minister to charge extra for the transport of wheat.  Ultimately, it must mean that the charges of those who handle and deal with wheat will have to go up considerably.  The Minister says he has a fixed price, but the millers say&mdash;they seem to have a pretty big say in everything appertaining to wheat&mdash;that the price is fixed and they, therefore, cannot give any more.  What we feel on this side of the House is that if the carriers are not able to get more for wheat, they must ultimately impose the charge back on the farmer himself.  Although they may not be allowed by the Minister to charge more and although the Minister may think he is protecting the growers by doing that, it ultimately means these people will have to get their money from somewhere.  It will be a case of, perhaps, increasing the price for sacks, which they will have to do to cover their own expenses.  In the final analysis, the farmer will have to pay more.  I would ask the Minister to look into that.  I hope the Minister will try to accept some of the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>It is always a pleasure <Col N="2618" /> for a Minister to reach the end of the discussion on his Estimate.  Not very much new emerged from the discussion on this occasion.  The one thing I tried to do in the course of my introductory remarks was to set out clearly what the position in regard to agriculture was during the year 1961-62. I tried to do that as objectively as possible.  I claimed it was one of the best years on record for farmers. I did not do that in any boastful way but I produced the figures to prove it.  I did not claim that farmers or agriculture in general had not difficulties to contend with.  I believe that is how a Minister for Agriculture should present the picture when introducing his Estimate.</P>
      <P>One disappointing thing in the discussion was the tendency to distort facts and figures and to make it appear that the claims made by the Minister are either exaggerated or incorrect.  In many of the speeches from the Oppositions benches, emphasis was laid on the fact that there were 112,000 fewer aged cattle in the country.  Actually, that is an excellent thing.  That is a trend with which we should be very pleased.  We had last January, a record number of cows.  We had a record number of young stock.  It would not do some of the members of this House any harm if they admitted these facts, but that, apparently, is too much to expect in a discussion on this very important Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan quoted the statistics incorrectly in presenting a picture of a fall of 30,000 cows.  He gave the January figure for 1962 and he compared that with the June figure for 1958.  Had Deputy Donegan taken the January figure for 1958, he would have got an entirely different picture. Now Deputy Donegan should know that the figures for January and June are not comparable and comparing them only results in distortion of the actual facts.  To illustrate what the distortion meant in this particular instance, the figure Deputy Donegan gave for January, 1962, was 1,242,201 as against a June figure for 1958 of 1,260,400.  But the figure for January, <Col N="2619" /> 1958, was 1,211,000, which was 31,000 less than in January, 1962.</P>
    <P>These comparisons can be accidental. Any Deputy may make a mistake.  He may also, of course, use the figure that may be most attractive to him from the point of view of making his case.</P>

      <P>There was no attempt on my part to come in here and proclaim in a boastful spirit that 1961 was the best year on record.  It was the best year.  But I do not say it was the best year in the sense that one could deduce from that statement that this was a land flowing with milk and honey, as far as the agricultural industry was concerned.  I admitted there were difficulties, but the claim I made could be, and was, substantiated by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought there was a more noticeable tendency during the course of the debate this year for Deputies on both sides to make a reasonable effort to approach this very important facet of our economy in a reasonable way. However, there is one remark that one still hears all too frequently, not only here but outside, and from people in all walks of life.  Bemoaning the state of agriculture, they say: &ldquo;Something&rdquo; must be done about it&rdquo;.  One never hears, however, what the &ldquo;something&rdquo; is.  It is true that one gets suggestions, such as those made by the Leader of the Opposition, and supported by Deputies on the same side of the House, that a great deal could be done and quite an improvement could be achieved, were we to increase our advisory services.  The rate of progress and improvement in the past ten years in the advisory services is in fact very notable.  Between 1952 and 1962, there has been an increase of over 100 per cent. in the number of agricultural instructors. Since 1956, there has been an increase of something in the region of 40 per cent.  If one includes the number of parish agents&mdash;the number is the same as it was&mdash;and the number of horticultural instructors, one finds a very considerable number of people <Col N="2620" /> engaged at the moment on advisory services.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a considerable expansion in our advisory services.  Some counties have done much better than others, but, taking the country as a whole, it can be said that the technical staffs available today are much greater than those available ten years ago.</P>
      <P>I remember the discussion on this subject last year.  I remember when the parish plan was first mooted.  I was a member of this House but I was not at the time a member of a local authority.  The question I immediately asked myself was whether we were going to have two advisory services, one running alongside the other, one supervised and controlled from Merrion Street and the other recruited and operated through county committees of agriculture.  I immediately made up my mind that we should not have two systems and I have not changed my mind since.</P>
      <P>Then, having made up my mind that we should not have two, the next question was that we must have one and if we are to have one, how is this one to be operated.  Wisely or not, as an individual with some knowledge of the strength and the weaknesses of county committees and with some knowledge also of the weaknesses of a centralised organisation operated from Merrion Street, I came down in favour of the county committee system and that is still my opinion.  I would have been glad if some of the Deputies on either side of the House, and two of them made an effort to do so, had offered to me their honest criticism of what they thought of county committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I see weaknesses in those organisations but if you invited me to make a choice as between that scheme and a scheme operated from a Government Department in Merrion Street or somewhere else in Dublin, I would decide in favour of the County Committee scheme.  The next question is whether we can improve upon it because it needs improving.  I tried, when I <Col N="2621" /> attended the last annual meeting of the General Council of County Committees, and looked at the agenda, to make a few remarks in the hope of shocking those people into a realisation of their failure to face up to their real responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon might say the attractiveness of the parish plan as against the advisory services of the county committees is that &ldquo;I&rdquo; pay for the services provided through the parish agents, and when he says that &ldquo;I&rdquo; pay for them, he means that the taxpayer pays for them; on the other hand, the local ratepayer pays 50 per cent. of the cost of every member of the advisory service employed by the county committees. That would not create any problem at all for me as Minister for Agriculture.  If there is a problem there, it can be met.  I do not believe that you will get real support for any system of State assistance that is flung at the heads of those local bodies without asking for some contribution from them towards what it is felt they want.</P>
    <P>Let it be known now that if we could find some means of improving the relationship between the county committee, their advisory staff and the farmers and if it was felt that whatever reconstruction of those organisations might be decided upon as an improvement might call for more advisory people, as far as the money side of it is concerned I think we could meet that situation.  We could have done that at any time.  I would like to have heard some comment from those Deputies who have associations with these bodies and who know how these bodies operate in relation to their technical advisory officers.  I often had the feeling that the relationship between the CAO and the members of the committee is so fast and friendly that if the Department, through its inspectors, makes a suggestion or offers some criticisms of what a committee is doing, there is a line-up between the committee and the staff which, in a lot of cases, could be harmful.</P>
    <P>I have heard people say that our method of electing county committees is wrong, in so far as they are often selected on a political ticket by the <Col N="2622" /> parent body in the county and that therefore it would be better if some provision could be made to ensure that a number of what might be described as knowledgeable outsiders might be selected instead.  I do not know whether that would be a success or not.  I have noticed from watching and reading the discussions at meetings of these bodies, as reported in the local newspapers, that whether a man is selected on that basis or not, when they come together in a deliberative assembly, it is not too long until they show their hand one way or another in a political sense on some issue.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear any member of this House, at any time, no matter to what Party he belongs, if he has a constructive suggestion to make on this matter.  It is not a matter of my having to refute the Leader of the Opposition when he talks about the necessity to expand the advisory services in the country.  But if you moot that proposition or cause it to be mooted at a meeting of a county committee, the chances are that the majority will vote against it.</P>
    <P>If their reason is that it would have an effect on the size of the rate to be struck, then I will meet that by saying: &ldquo;If we can arrive at some system or scheme whereby they will at least make some contribution then they will be free to decide in favour of further recruitment of these advisory people provided there is a need for them.  I have read a condensed version of a statement made recently to a meeting of the Cork Committee of Agriculture, as a result of an investigation, that in certain areas in Cork, the percentage of people who made use of the advisory services was 25.  I thought the figure referred to was very good&mdash;some people might think it was very low&mdash; but I was personally astounded that it was as high and I was so curious that I made inquiries and found that that 25 per cent. could be qualified in many ways that would completely after the conclusion at which one would arrive at first sight.</P>
    <P>It is all right for us to talk about the need for advisory services.  I cannot dispute that but it is the most humiliating thing in the world for technical <Col N="2623" /> men or outdoor men of any kind employed by a local committee or by a Government Department to be walking about and spending their time doing nothing.  I know parts of this country well.  When you know parts of it intimately, then you might say you know it all.  I refer to the rural areas of course.</P>
    <P>I do not know, but I have often wondered how best you could manage to introduce the local advisory man to our farmers, how he would manage to make contact with them.  He is not required to go to these farmers unless he is asked.  It appears as if something better than that will have to be done. If it is not done I take a poor view of the progress we shall make.</P>

      <P>That is all right but unless there is some means by which these advisory people will make the contacts then the situation will continue that a small percentage of the population benefit by these services because very few are making any demands upon them.</P>
      <P>When we talk about the improvement of the advisory services we must think clearly as to the foundation on which we shall build them and how we are to design them so as to ensure that the advisers will be able to make the contacts that are necessary if progress is to be made.  I am not saying that even if they were able to make these contacts they will secure results in all cases but it will be necessary to make them.  I have never met a body of people who have put up to me a solution for that problem.  It does not seem to be a terribly intricate problem and yet I have never heard the solution to it.</P>

      <P>I know the extent to which these organisations have contacts with the farmers.  I would say these contacts are very limited even if taken together.  Some of these organisations come to me and claim to speak for all the farmers.  They are entitled to make that claim; I am not objecting to it; but when they claim that they can interpret what is in the minds of farmers generally in relation to any agricultural problem, I know they cannot.  I know that as a public man, as a person who moves about through the country, my contacts are far greater than all of theirs combined. First of all, it is a matter of how the advisory services should be controlled, whether centrally from Merrion Street or locally.  Secondly, if it is to be locally is there anything we can do to improve the machinery there?  I think it needs improvement.  Thirdly, having improved the machinery, is there any way, any plan or design we can put before the county committees to ensure they will make contact with at least 50 per cent., 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. of the farmers even though they do not get an immediate response from that number?</P>
      <P>We have heard discussions here, not only during the debate on this Estimate but from time to time, about markets and marketing conditions. Attempts have been made to paint pictures as to what Europe will be like if the Common Market idea expands as we hope it will.  I would always be inclined to be cautious as to my attitude towards a development such as that, the ultimate outcome of which I cannot clearly foresee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I see as attractive in the Common Market idea is that it offers a fair opportunity to compete with your neighbours; to produce what suits your climate and it gives a fair assurance that you can do so without limitation.  It gives you the sort of freedom that, if you happen to be Minister for Agriculture, you can go <Col N="2625" /> out confidently and say: &ldquo;You know the conditions under which you produce and it is up to you to set your sights on your target and you can do so in the confidence that you will not be obstructed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In recent months, we heard a great deal of talk here about milk and milk products.  The one frightening thing I felt about milk last year was the British attitude in imposing penalties following the development of a certain situation there.  My whole anxiety, especially in view of European developments, was to preserve here a situation wherein we could encourage our farmers who were engaged in milk production to increase cow numbers, if that were possible and attractive at present prices, and that we could at the same time offer the assurance that the milk would be taken from them and that the products resulting from it would be marketable.</P>
    <P>The same could be said for my attitude towards pigs and bacon because the market there has been very &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; for a considerable time, but with the prospect of the developments that are spoken about in Europe, we should do everything not only to hold on to but to expand that industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not work that out here.  My main concern was to ensure that we would be able to tell our farmers: &ldquo;You will get a market for this product without limitation as to the amount you produce.&rdquo;  Much as we were disappointed with the ultimate quota which the British gave us and although that quota will not enable us to dispose of our full production in Britain this year&mdash;because we expect this year to be even higher <Col N="2626" /> than last year which was the best year on record for milk&mdash;I am glad to say that we were able to say to our producers that they could continue to produce to capacity.  When we talk about the cattle population, about improving grasslands and increasing their capacity, I can see no way of stocking the land and availing of that improved capacity except by increasing the number of cattle.  I can see no way of increasing the number of cattle except by increasing our cows.  I see no better way of increasing the cow population than by increasing the movement of older cattle out of this country.  That is something that has been criticised in this debate but it is true that the quicker they go, the greater and the keener the demand will be for younger stock.  The demand for younger stock will mean that in-calf heifers, the present day prices of which are a source of complaint by some people should also increase in value.</P>
      <P>The number of cows therefore is largely, though not entirely, influenced by the price of milk.  The price of milk influences the number of cows we keep but while we would like to see the number of cows increase, we must have regard to the problems that confront us in the marketing of the products resulting from more milk.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, when I advised the Government that we should extend the creamery industry to that portion of the west of Ireland where it had not so far developed, it was awkward to make that recommendation because of the marketing problems involved.  It was difficult to justify that recommendation while we found it hard to sell our surplus dairy products.  One must keep these things in balance.  You think you see the long-distance need for pursuing a certain course but if you approach it with too much enthusiasm &mdash;not so far as creamery development is concerned but in regard to prices given to producers&mdash;you are naturally confronted with the immediate problem of marketing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all right for those who see the advantages that may arise to argue about what the Common Market may mean for us, but those responsible for <Col N="2627" /> disposing of the commodity at present cannot say with any degree of certainty what the future holds.  They must keep in mind all these facts and factors to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>There was some discussion about the possibility of developing contacts and establishing new markets in the under-developed countries.  Most people know that the problems in that regard are tremendous.  These countries are poor; the standard of living is low.  In many cases, they have not developed a taste for the products we have to sell and even if they had, they have not money to buy them.  Things may change in that regard, but it may be years before that happens.  There are those who say: &ldquo;Could the developed countries not come together and make some effort to meet that situation?  Would it not be a good long-term investment to distribute surplus foods free in these countries?&rdquo; One must remember that these foods must be paid for.  The farmers of the exporting countries have to be paid for the surplus foods and the only way in which that can be done is by the Governments concerned pooling some of their resources to finance that sort of activity.  It that were to develop, of course, we would in our own small way be glad to take our part in it. Those who have examined that situation and who were in search of outlets are almost unanimously of opinion that there are no commercial opportunities there at the present time as far as these markets are concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked me about the Bovine Tuberculosis Scheme and especially irregularities arising in connection with that Scheme.  Let me tell the Deputy and the House that in every case where we detect irregularities, on the part of our own officials, on the part of professional men, or on the part of exporters, or farmers, we immediately report that discovery to the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>I do not pretend to know the difficulties these authorities have in investigating these cases but I often thought that the time it takes to carry out these investigations is unduly long.  I know, of course, that when the State goes to court whether it is a criminal or other case, it is not an easy thing to have your proofs in order but, notwithstanding that, I often thought that the time lag was tremendously long between the date on which the facts, as we knew them at the time, were reported to the authorities and the actual legal steps taken one way or the other.  As far as the Department and myself are concerned, the procedure I have outlined is the procedure we have followed and will follow.  We have had in all about 200 prosecutions since the Scheme was introduced.  At the same time, I should not like to give the impression that this is the only scheme in which irregularities can occur.</P>
      <P>I have said before that we have got a tremendous amount of co-operation from farmers.  In some cases, however, we did not get as much as we were entitled to.  We have got a tremendous amount of co-operation from practitioners all over the country.  In some cases also, they were not as helpful as they might have been.  The same could be said of the cattle dealers and the exporters but the point is that, it being a human world, nothing will be perfect.  You will not always get people to obey the regulations and the law.  We are trying our best but we do not pretend that a loophole will not be found in any regulations made by us.  We can only try to stop the gap when we discover that the weakness is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made considerable progress. When irregularities happened in the early period of the Scheme, when people were inclined to be in doubt as to our capacity successfully to undertake this work, I might have made allowances for them.  In view of the advanced stage at which we have now arrived, and the success which we have achieved, it is amazing to me that one or two of our people <Col N="2629" /> should still attempt to sidetrack the regulations.</P>

      <P>I think so.  The people I have in mind would.  Even if they had not, that is not an insuperable barrier.  I am prepared to discuss with anybody any suggestion they can offer to break down that prejudice.  This is not confined to any area.  It refers to the whole country.  In view of all the facilities available for improving <Col N="2630" /> land, when I see the amount of land that is neglected I am ashamed of my life.  I travelled once by special train to the Bog of Allen to see some turf development work.  I had some people with me who did not understand the country as well as I did.  There were places I would have liked to prevent them seeing.</P>
      <P>On the one hand, we talk about the freedom of movement the Common Market will bring.  On the other hand, we complain because a few dozen, or perhaps a few hundred foreigners bought some poor land in various parts of the country.  They bought some land in my county.  If they work it and make a success of it, I wish they would buy more.  I am not saying all foreigners are the best farmers in the world.  History tells us that some foreigners who came here did not stay too long.  If they buy land, give employment, work the land and give good example, showing us what others can do, I have no objection to that kind of development.  But I do not think the opportunity should be used for making a campaign against foreigners as a plank in a political plan.</P>

    <P>I am not boasting when I say that the introduction of a substantial subsidy for phosphates was one of the best things ever done.  The one thing I regret is that the consumption of phosphates, lime and potash, although it has increased, has not increased to the extent it should.  Deputy Clinton mentioned the challenge I threw down at the <Col N="2631" /> annual meeting of his agricultural committee last year.  That is the sort of thing I have in mind, that the CAO would call his assistants together and say to each of them: &ldquo;Here is a map of your area and here is a list of farmers.  Canvass every one of them and see if you can induce them to use more phosphates and lime and undertake a programme of that kind.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I have not any doubt that if we can organise the local Committees on that basis and induce the majority of our farmers to take that simple, inexpensive <Col N="2632" /> step, we will increase the carrying capacity of our land tremendously.  In addition, what it will carry will be worth while.  The results will be evident both in milk and beef production. That has been my aim and belief for years.  This Party subsidised phosphates 35 years ago.  The records are there.  I am not claiming this as something personal.  If we could reach the stage where the County Committees of Agriculture had that one objective, it would give results.  It would pin those men to do a job.  They would have to cover their areas completely.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £460,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for payment of Increases in certain Pensions, etc., in respect of public service.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Estimate is to seek the approval of the Dáil for increases in public service pensions. including military service pensions and special allowances, and to authorise payment of the increases with effect from the 1st August next in advance of legislation.  The necessary Pensions (Increase) Bill to give statutory authority for the increases will be taken next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introducing the Budget in April last, I adverted to the fact that public service pensions had not been adjusted as frequently as had the pay of serving personnel, even though a number of pensions increases had been given in the post-war period.  I had decided to provide a further pensions increase this year to enable pensioners to meet post retirement increases in the cost of living, and a sum of £450,000 was allocated for this purpose in the Budget.  I indicated that it was proposed to give priority to those longest retired and to bring all pensioners who retired before the pay revision of the 1st November, 1955, up to the level of their equivalent colleagues <Col N="2635" /> who retired with the benefit of that pay revision.  The additional estimate now before the House provides for this increase.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that it was not easy to compile an estimate of the cost of this step.  There are some thousands of individual pensioners, who had retired at various dates over the past 25 years or so, at various salary points and with varying lengths of service, and it was much more difficult to calculate the amount required to bring each of them to the level of an equivalent 1955 colleague than it was to calculate the cost of previous pensions increases given in the form of percentage additions for various broadly defined classes.</P>
    <P>However, I am glad to say that the £450,000 provided in the Budget proved to be adequate, and there was, in fact, a little left over which allows me to give a further increase to the pensioners who have now been brought up to the 1955 level, and as well as this, to give an increase to all the 1955-59 class of pensioners, that is, who got the 1955 pay increase, but had retired before the pay increase which was given in the Civil Service as from the 15th December, 1959, and to other classes on other dates.  This further increase will be 6 per cent. and will be given to all pre-December, 1959 pensioners, whether they retired before or after 1955.  This second step will cover a good part of the rise in the cost of living since November, 1955, and it should be welcome to the 1955-59 group, whose pensions are now being increased for the first time.</P>
    <P>In the case of flat rate pensions, appropriate percentage increases have been determined by reference to increases granted in cognate pensions in relation to pay or cost-of-living movements or other relevant factors.  The maximum appropriate increase for these flat rate pensions has generally worked out at about 20 per cent. over the current rates.  Special allowances to persons holding military service pensions or Service Medals will be increased by 5s. a week.</P>
    <P>The total amount which is being <Col N="2636" /> asked for in the additional estimate is £460,000.  This is the amount required in the current financial year to meet the payment, as from the 1st August next, of the increases for all public service pensions paid direct to the recipients out of Votes of the Oireachtas.  The main classes of pensioners &mdash; former civil servants, national teachers, and so on&mdash;appear on the face of the Estimate. Local authorities will be empowered to give corresponding increases to their pensioners.  Part of the cost of certain local authority pensions, such as vocational teachers' pensions, is recouped by the Exchequer, and the Estimate contains a small provision to meet any claims which may be presented by the local authorities before the end of the financial year.  In a full year, the cost of the increases is estimated at approximately £820,000, including a full year's recoupment of the Exchequer share of local authority pensions increases.</P>
    <P>The sum asked for is £10,000 more than the £450,000 allocated in the Budget, to enable me to equalise and to round off the appropriate percentages.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, very glad to be able to give these increases.  Deputies will realise that the superannuation terms provided for public servants by or under the various statutes of the Oireachtas, or under earlier legislation which is still in effect, did not provide for any post-retirement increases in pensions.  The Government are, strictly speaking, bound by no obligation or commitment in this respect.  What I have been endeavouring to do, in relation to pensions increases, is to disburse whatever money it might be possible to make available, within the limits of Budgetary conditions, to make good the depreciation in the value of pensions caused by the rise in the cost of living.  Any future step which it may be possible to take will be in the same direction, subject always to Budgetary considerations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that this is merely a detailed Estimate following on the provisions of the Budget and, as such, it will not be discussed by us in any great detail. <Col N="2637" /> The Minister is being theoretical when he says that there is no obligation on the Government to provide these increases in pension, having regard to the terms of the Superannuation Acts. That may be so according to the strict terms of the Acts but it has always been the practice, since the end of the last war, that the question of pensions should be revised from time to time having regard to the requirements of the Budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned local authority employees.  On a fairly recent occasion when there was a question before the House, I mentioned to him the position of State company employees or former employees.  As I understand it, no question would arise of payments directly out of the Exchequer in respect of such pensions but whether they arise by way of direct Exchequer subvention or not, State-sponsored bodies would naturally consider the view that would be taken by the Minister for Finance in considering how they should deal with pensions of former employees.  Some of the pensions awarded to former employees of State-sponsored bodies are so small as to make it difficult if not impossible for these persons to have an adequate standard of living in the evening of their lives.  When the step has been taken in relation to civil servants and local authority employees, the Minister should indicate that similar measures will be adopted in regard to the various State-sponsored bodies and companies so that they will endeavour to equate their rates of pension to the pattern laid down for the Civil Service and local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will welcome the provision which has been made in this Estimate for increases in pension for persons who retired when the cost of living was substantially lower than it is today and those who have been endeavouring to live on the pensions fixed when prices were much lower than they are today will be glad of any assistance they will get from this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still much to be done in order to give the person who has <Col N="2638" /> retired a pension equivalent to what would now be obtainable by his successor. There is something ironic about the situation in which a person who has served in a post for 40 years and borne the heat and burden of the day, finds that his successor is allowed a higher pension than he, the first occupant, or previous occupants of the post.  While the provisions of the Estimate will be welcomed by those who are potential beneficiaries we still have to place this whole question of pensions on a much more equitable basis than exists at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this State never contracted to grant increases in pensions and that it fulfils its obligation when it gives a pension based on a certain fraction of his salary to a retired servant.  That argument died with Queen Victoria.  If it did not, it certainly ought to be buried with her because it is as out of date as a philosophy as that old darling herself.  The fact of the matter is that more than 40 years ago pensions were adjusted in accordance with the cost of living. Anybody who goes to the trouble to look up the retirement awards made during the first World War will find that salary was tied to a cost of living index figure.  When the person retired on pension he got a certain proportion of his salary and a certain proportion of the cost of living index figure.  If the cost of living index figure went up, the pension went up as well. Having done that more than 40 years ago it is a bit too novel to suggest in 1962 that the State can now disregard its obligations to make good the shrinking value of the £ and its obligations to the retired officer to see that he gets paid in valuable currency rather than a depreciated currency in the creation of which he had no hand, act or part.  Governments very largely influence the strength of the currency; world wide factors also influence the strength, but the retired officer certainly has no power to influence the currency values or the cost of living indices.  It is unfair therefore to suggest that the State has no obligation to make good the shrunken value of his pension.</P>
    <P>In a number of countries throughout <Col N="2639" /> the world it has been found possible to arrange a scheme whereby pensions of retired officers are tied to the cost of living after the officers retire.  In other words, if a person retires when the cost of living is at a certain level and the cost of living subsequently increases, the pension of that person is automatically increased. That arrangement operates in a number of countries.  The organisations representing the retired officers of this country have urged that their pensions should be put on a basis which will enable them to get automatic compensation for increases in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>While this Estimate is introduced today to provide increases for retired officers, force of circumstances will compel us to do the same next year and perhaps the year after and this whole question will continue to be a source of disputation between retired officers' organisations and the Government of the day.  We ought to take the long and equitable view of this whole situation and say that a person who has served the country effectively ought to be paid a pension which is related to the value of that pension at the time he retired and not expect him to live on an attenuated pension and deprive him of the security to which when he entered the service he was entitled to look forward on retirement as represented by the pension which was formerly due to him at the date of his retirement.</P>
    <P>We can only do that by putting these pensions on a basis which will ensure that they will be automatically adjusted to cost of living increases.  Not only should we do that in the case of State, local authority and public corporation pensioners but we should go further and adjust social welfare pensions in the same way so that if the cost of living increased there would be automatic adjustment of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Estimate indicates that he is moving somewhat in the direction of bringing the pension of the retired officer more closely into relation with the current cost of living.  I do not know how far he has progressed <Col N="2640" /> towards giving a definite decision that the objective to be aimed at and to be achieved as soon as possible is to relate the pensions of all retired officers from all services to the cost of living index figure which fluctuates and may continue to fluctuate long after the officer has retired.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister, apart from the classes mentioned here, what it is proposed to do with the employees of State-sponsored bodies who have retired on pension and who to a greater or lesser degree have suffered the same hardships as the classes who are now getting increases under this Estimate.  I should also like to know whether legislation will be needed to enable local authorities to adjust the pensions of their retired officers in the same way as this adjustment is made in the case of the classes referred to in the Estimate.  If it does need legislation, would the Minister say whether the Government have approved of the introduction of legislation and whether any indication is being conveyed to the local authorities that they may now proceed to make the adjustment, in anticipation of the legislation being put through the House?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support very briefly what has been so ably said by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Norton. So long as we retain the archaic system of pensions for State servants, a dreadful amount of official time and effort must be wasted in calculating pension structures.  The mere fact that we have had to wait three months from the date of the Budget before the Minister can present a scheme to the Dáil under which he will allocate the moneys is an indication of the colossal amount of official time and effort unnecessarily used to apportion, under the archaic system, the money we are to give to people who have done some considerable service to their State and country in their time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Norton said, many of the more progressive countries of the world have long since accepted that State pensions of former employees or pensions of employees of public authorities should be directly related to the <Col N="2641" /> salaries currently earned by people who still remain in the service.  There is certainly no administrative reason why the pension of any State servant should not represent a proportion of the salary paid at any time to a certain official of a rank equivalent to the rank held by that public servant when he or she retires.  If and when that day comes, a great deal of official time and money and effort will be saved which could be put to much more useful purposes.</P>
    <P>As has been pointed out, depreciation in the value of money occurs mainly through inflation and inflation is something which is largely caused by the working and spending section of the community.  The working and spending section are certainly not those who are retired and living on small pensions; certainly not the people who have to adjust themselves to living on a smaller amount of money than that to which they have been accustomed, certainly not the section of the community who, by reason of age and lack of mobility, no longer get around as much as they used to.  That being so, so long as society allows inflation to continue and money to depreciate in value&mdash;and it seems to me it is something which in any thriving society will continue&mdash;society has an obligation to the people who have completed their term of work to compensate them adequately and see that they do not suffer if, by reason of those who succeed them, inflation should in any way depress the value of their money.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that the pension structure is based upon the argument that pensions are in fact only postponed pay and that therefore the pensioner has no right to claim a greater amount than the pay which he or she might have received at the time when a certain amount of it was being put aside for pension purposes.  What annoys me in what is regarded as the orthodox approach, is the emphasising of the question of postponement and not that of pay.  What we need to emphasise is the question of pay and to see that if it is something that is postponed, that if a man is paid money, it shall represent the real value rather than the purely nominal value of <Col N="2642" /> the pay.  If retired public servants were paid at a rate equivalent to the spending power of their money when they were working, they would certainly have to get a greater amount than the Minister is now offering.</P>
    <P>What has been said by Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Norton in relation to former employees of State companies cannot be over-emphasised. The pittance offered by CIE to the pensioner, a pittance which is reduced as soon as the State pension becomes payable at 70 years of age, is so miserable as not even to be worthy of the name of pension.  Even though it may mean an extra charge on those who have not yet retired, I think we must accept, once and for all, that the working element in the community should maintain during their working days the section of the community that is not working.  The day will come when each one of us will be on the retired list and then it will be an obligation which will lie on those still working. The difficulty I can see for any Minister for Finance is the change-over. It will mean perhaps a considerable increase in outlay but rather than postpone it indefinitely, I think we should do it and the sooner, the better.</P>
    <P>I observe that the Minister for Finance met the Garda pensioners last Monday and it was subsequently announced that he had under consideration the question of the rent allowance. I hope the Minister will expedite this consideration and that the result will be favourable, thereby putting an end to the unfair differential which operates against members of the Force who retired prior to 1960.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of retirement from the Garda in recent years because a very large proportion entered the Force in the 20s and in the last decade, the greater part of those reached retiring age.  On and from December, 1960, the rent allowance of serving members of the Garda is included as a pensionable emolument but those who were unfortunate enough to retire prior to December 1960 do not enjoy that right.  My information is that the cost of giving this right and making the rent allowance a pensionable emolument in the first year would be £80,000.  That is a <Col N="2643" /> figure that would fall year by year because those who would immediately enjoy this concession would in God's good time, have to go to their reward. It is a charge on the State that would not increase but rather diminish.  It is a very small portion of justice to which these people are entitled and I hope the Minister will see his way in the very near future to introduce that benefit for those people.</P>
    <P>One cannot lightly treat the Minister's remark that he and the Government are under no obligation to increase pensions.  There may not be a statutory obligation because the Oireachtas failed in the past to discharge its moral obligation but the moral obligation is there and is as real as any moral or social duty ever was. On that account, it would be much better if the Minister would say: &ldquo;We realise we have an obligation and this is the best we can do.&rdquo;  That would be a more honourable approach than the approach adopted.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the Defence Forces side of the increases.  I listened to Deputy Norton stressing the need for some system other than that of haphazard increases depending on the goodwill of the Minister or circumstances and I fully agree with him.  In fact, I have a motion on the Order Paper for some nine months which I hope will come up in the autumn and which is actually based on that principle. That motion reads:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that, following a general increase in wages, a proportionate increase (apart from budget increases) should be granted immediately to all those in receipt of social welfare benefits...</P>
      <P>Although it refers to Social Welfare benefits, the principle should also apply to other benefits and pensions.  The motion continues:</P>
      <P>...because a general increase in wages is usually followed by a general increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I hope that the motion will be accepted and likewise it should be accepted in the case of State pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister said, he has no <Col N="2644" /> statutory obligation but he has a moral obligation.  If people retire with a certain pension and if in time the cost of living jumps considerably, it is only fair that they should not be worse off in terms of value than they were originally.  The principle should be accepted.  We are improving as we go along.  We are no longer living in the days when people who had no means had to go to a workhouse.  We have to organise all aspects of society now.  I hope, when my motion is taken, the principle will likewise be accepted in the case of those pensioners.</P>
    <P>In regard to the increases in the wounds and disability pensions, military service pensions and special allowances, I have advocated since I came in here that the OLD IRA were badly let down&mdash;those who did not qualify for active service pensions. According to the Act, &ldquo;active service&rdquo; means that you must have taken part in armed combat.  That has been debated over the years.  Pensions are granted only to persons who can show that they took part in armed combat. The majority&mdash;I would say 80 per cent. &mdash;did not take part in armed combat but they were serving.  They were on parade and they served just as much as those who took part in armed combat.</P>
    <P>If in the British forces men go to a battlefield, those who were on the battlefield, whether they took part in the battle or not, are on active service for all purposes.  Here there is the differential in regard to armed combat. You would imagine that those men opted themselves and that the other fellows funked it and would not go out on a job.  There was nothing like that at all.  Both classes were just the one group on parade but some were privileged nice and privately.  They were told they were wanted for a job. The other fellows were not informed. There was no question of anyone backing out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that they got a raw deal.  When it comes to special allowances, I am trying to <Col N="2645" /> bridge the gap.  These men have served anything from three to six years and they have got nothing.  They are now permitted a special allowance if they happen to be unable to work or are over 70 years of age.  In those circumstances they get a limited amount called a special allowance.  I am asking the Minister to be more generous in regard to that special allowance, particularly when he considers that those to whom I have referred have given from three to six years' service and never received a penny.  At least it should be made up to them in their old age.  I built up the first part of my argument to demonstrate the claim they have on the State's generosity in their old age.</P>
      <P>What is granted to them is not a lot.  The objectionable feature is that there is a strict means test.  The means test at least ought to be considerably eased.  That is my point.  These people are dying out.  Last year there was a saving of £18,000 in the Pensions Estimate.  That saving will increase considerably as time goes on.  The Minister should be more generous as far as special allowances are concerned. At one time I advocated that those old IRA men should get a gratuity for the service they rendered, if not a pension.  I do not expect that to happen but what I am expecting to happen is that the Minister would be more generous than heretofore on account of the obligation on the State in regard to these men who gave anything from three to six years' service. The majority of these men not only went through the Tan war but were victims of the Civil War.</P>
      <P>Altogether they had about six years' service.  A great many of them suffered imprisonment but they got nothing for the ills and troubles through which they went.  The State is under an obligation to treat those people generously in their last few years.  The means test should be eased in regard to this pension which is not up to much.  I am an old IRA man.  I represent them.  I want better treatment for those people, particularly for the disabled and for those who will qualify for the special allowance.</P>

      <P>With regard to State <Col N="2646" /> employees, they would not be covered by the Estimate.  It is a matter for each State body to do what they think is right and what they can afford, which is a very cogent argument. I mentioned that the Government had no obligation.  I mentioned that just as a fact.  I did not want to say that any Government should escape its moral obligations to look after these pensioners who have fallen behind in relation to the cost of living. Deputy Norton was wrong in one thing.  He said that pensioners in the past got an increase when the cost of living went up and that the pension was reduced when the cost of living went down.  I believe it never went upwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not speak for them.  As the Deputy knows, they got special treatment.  In any case, I do not think you could refer to this thing as a Victorian idea&mdash;the idea that we had no obligation.  No Government as far as I know took any steps in this matter until after the last war so that it is a comparatively modern idea that pensions should be adjusted on account of the cost of living.</P>
      <P>Local authorities will be enabled to pay their pensioners and these pensioners will be in much the same position as our own pensioners.  We intend to pay the increased pensions from 1st August.  We will get legislative sanction, we hope, in the autumn session.  The same will apply to local authority pensioners.  The Minister for Local Government can sanction any proposals put up by local authorities if they want to pay increased pensions on the same lines as paid to State pensioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be sanctioned in legislation afterwards, just like our own.  Reference was made to the colossal amount of time involved in preparing the scheme.  Up to this any increase given was given on a percen- <Col N="2647" /> tage basis.  It was a simple matter and we thought we should lay a proper foundation.  We made an estimate that £420,000 would enable us to bring everybody up to the 1955 increase. To prepare that was a very big matter because practically every individual had to be considered.  They varied.  They were on varying scales at varying times.  Some of them had not full service.  It could also be said that even some of the grades that were there were abolished and new grades put in their places.  It took a lot of time to calculate what a particular individual might get if he retired after 1955 instead of retiring in the early 1930's or the 1940's.  Having got that foundation, there will not really be so much trouble in the future.  If there is money to expend in future Budgets, it will be an easy matter to bring them to the 1959 level.  Having brought them so far, anything that might be done after can be done on a percentage basis on the cost of living.  There would be no great administrative trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on the money available.  The six per cent. on top of the 1955 award will bring in all those who retired up to 1958. There might be a very small number not covered&mdash;I am not sure.  We have gone a long way.  These are pensioners who retired 25 or 30 years before the 1955 increase.  I met not only the representatives of the Garda Síochána but also the representatives of the Civil Service, the teachers and the Army and discussed this scheme with them.  I told them the amount of money we had to distribute and what we were able to do.  As one might expect, they were grateful for what was done but would like to see more being done.  We can always expect that from any group on a deputation of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if I could agree altogether with Deputy Sherwin that the old IRA have been let down.  I have not been ungenerous to the IRA. Between military service pensions and <Col N="2648" /> special allowances, about £1,000,000 a year is distributed to them.  That is a fair amount of money.  It is true, as Deputy Sherwin says, that only a small number qualify for pensions because they have to prove they took part in an armed engagement.  It is difficult to avoid that definition because it is very hard to define exactly an IRA man at that time.  Some of them drifted in for a while and went out again.  It would appear to be going a bit too far to grant an IRA pension to every man who applied for it.</P>
    <P>Some test, therefore, had to be devised.  The test was that he must have taken part in an armed engagement, and of course that had to be verified by his officer.  That may have been severe in certain cases.  I know it has been because, as Deputy Sherwin pointed out, there are very good men who never had an opportunity of taking part in an engagement but who still played a big part.  In more recent times, we brought in the scheme of special allowances.  In that case, a certificate that he had served as a soldier for three months before the Truce qualified him.  Then, if he had been either disabled or reaches the age of 70 and has no means, he is entitled to a special allowance.</P>
    <P>In the general review perhaps I may not have stated generally what they were getting.  A man with a military service pension gets a 20 per cent. increase and a man with a special allowance gets 5s. a week.  It must be remembered that many of the special allowance people will also be getting an increase in social welfare benefit so that there will be a fairly substantial increase, comparatively speaking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In the case of a man getting a non-contributory pension or a widow getting an increased pension, the means will not be changed either way.  I am not sure in the case of the contributory pension.  We have not made the regulations yet.  There may be some slight count taken of the contributory pension in the case of the person also getting an increased special allowance.</P>

      <P>It is.  No such section has appeared since 1937.  I believe there was a clause in every Appropriation Bill up to 1937 dealing with the declaration to be made by pensioners. In 1937, a permanent provision was put in providing that every pensioner must sign a declaration each quarter, the declaration to be witnessed by a certain person in a certain category.  That does include, which is very convenient, a bank teller; he can sign the declaration. We felt there is not much to be gained by being so restrictive in this matter and what I am now asking the House for is liberty for the Minister for Finance to make regulations changing these restrictive conditions and asking, perhaps, for a declaration once every six or once every 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 12 to 17 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  in the case of the county boroughs of Dublin and Cork after the hour of eleven o'clock in the evening, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  in the case of the remainder of the country after the hour of half-past eleven o'clock in the evening.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A great deal was said on the Committee Stage for and against the various points of view in relation to the hours that should operate during the week. I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  I would appeal to him to take into consideration a number of very important factors.  It is vital that three important factors should be considered.  We must consider the type of people attracted into the liquor business, the people who dispense drinks in public houses and all kinds of bars.  If the hours advocated by the Minister are insisted on, a considerable number of young people will be dissuaded from going into the business. The reason is obvious, particularly when one remembers that the hours being advocated are half past ten in the morning to half past eleven at night in the summer time.  That is a 13-hour spell.  At the moment there is absolutely no regulation in public houses that a youth should work a certain number of hours.  I am referring now to regulations laid down by the State.  It is quite true that trade unions and employers can make regulations, but not every house is organised.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned in this amendment with the city of Dublin.  I have been asked, too, by my colleagues to mention Cork.  I consider there is very good reason why Dublin and Cork should be treated in a different fashion from the rest of the country.  That is one of the factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor we must take into consideration is the people presently engaged in the business.  These proposed <Col N="2654" /> hours postulate that operatives will be expected to work past the time of the last bus in the city of Dublin. That fact alone compels one to realise the difference that exists between Dubling and the rest of the country.  To my knowledge, the rest of the country does not have the kind of bus service that Dublin city has.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was drawing a comparison between Dublin and the rest of the country.  In the country, people working in licensed premises generally live on the premises or live close by. The same cannot be said with regard to operatives in licensed premises in the city of Dublin.  It is quite common to find an operative in a Dublin public house living some few miles from his place of employment.  If these hours go through, that postulates that he will have to arrange for transport. A considerable number of these operatives do not use bicycles.  Even if they did, the weather is so unpredictable and so inclement, it would be most unfair to expose them to the elements after their hard day's work. These are the people to whom the Minister should give consideration. These are the people upon whom he should not impose a hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next consideration the Minister should have in mind is the customer. I am satisfied that the customer in Dublin does not want these new hours. During the Committee Stage debate, I inquired where the new hours came from and who initiated them.  I suggested that they did not come from the Minister and contended that he was wrongly advised in agreeing to them.  We are told that this Bill has not been introduced for the purpose of looking after the tourists.  That being so, we must take it that we are looking after the locals.  Surely the obvious thing to do is not to encourage them to go too far in their drinking. It would not be a wrong thing to encourage the local customer to finish up at 11 o'clock at night and go home, having regard to the fact that the vast majority of these people have to be at work next morning at 8 o'clock. <Col N="2655" /> If we think in terms of their health, we must realise that such people should be encouraged to have and guided into having reasonable hours of rest.  The opportunity should not be presented to such people to waste time drinking when they should be resting so that they can be on time for work next morning.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should advert to is that despite the protestations of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions acting on behalf of the unions that look after the interests of bar operatives in Dublin, the Minister still felt that he should stick to these hours.  It was decided to initiate some method of ascertaining the people's feelings on this matter.  In conjunction with the barmen's trade union, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union conducted a canvass of customers in trade union houses.  This canvass was carried out without putting on any pressure whatever.  There was no pressure whatsoever used to get the customer to indicate how he felt about the proposed hours.  It was done deliberately with a view to showing what the facts are.</P>
    <P>While that canvass has not yet been completed, the situation was found to be, as a result of a week's canvass in the public houses which asked the customer to give his views on the proposed new hours, the existing hours and an alternative suggestion, that 10,260 people put their signatures to a petition.  The result showed that 7,140 persons voted for or indicated their desire to have the present hours of drinking continued; 1,159 people were in favour of the new proposals; and for a suggestion that there should be 11 p.m. closing all the year round, 1,961 people were in favour.</P>
    <P>In hotels and restaurants, there was another canvass which has not been completed.  After one week of the canvass, the situation was that 2,432 people signed the document presented to them.  Of these, 1,646 advocated that the hours should remain as they are, and 486 in favour of the new proposals. That canvass has not been completed but there is there a strong indication that the customer is not in favour of the new hours of drinking.  I have yet to hear from the Minister one good reason <Col N="2656" /> as to why the existing hours should be changed.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the fact that the Minister has indicated that these new hours are not for the purpose of catering for tourists, and I hold that if the present hours are to be changed at all, they should be changed to 11 o'clock closing all the year round in Dublin and Cork.  It is true to say that if the change proposed in the Bill is brought about, you will have a set of people who were formerly inclined to come into the business no longer coming into it because the hours of trading are too long.  You will always have the situation where the trade unions will have no option but to negotiate for new payments for the hours suggested by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Some people may say that is nothing bad but I believe that we have come to the stage now where we have to make up our minds whether we can continue increasing prices.  I am satisfied that if these new hours are continued, the price of the pint will be increased by about 4d. and that will have a serious effect on the customer.  A considerable number of working class people get great enjoyment from the pint, and there has been considerable resentment in recent years about the increases.  To increase the pint by another 4d. would be pushing it too far.</P>
    <P>Let us give a little consideration to tourism in this connection.  One of the attractions of this country for the tourists is that drink is cheaper than in England or the North of Ireland, but if these new hours are introduced, we will price ourselves out of that valuable market.  I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  It asks that we have 11 o'clock closing in Dublin and Cork all the year round.</P>

      <P>It should be made clear that Deputy Mullen is speaking about hotel workers as distinct from barmen.  It was made clear here by the former Minister for Justice and I quoted it on 28th June.  At Column 145, Volume 177 of the Official Report of 11th November, 1959, Mr. Traynor, the then Minister for Justice, pointed out:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions have been stressing the hardship on barmen and <Col N="2657" /> porters which later working hours would entail.  But the conditions of employment for barmen are already safeguarded by the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938 and these safeguards would apply just as much when licensed premises keep open for a 70-hour week as in the case of an 80-hour week.  Under the 1938 Act, barmen may not be required to work for longer than 11 hours in any day, or for longer than 48 hours in any week&mdash;56 hours, including overtime.  The employment of persons under 18 years of age between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. is prohibited. Barmen may not be required to work for more than six hours without a meal interval.  There are provisions for annual holidays and for compensatory leave for work on half-holidays or Sundays.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Mullen knows of anybody who is not complying with those conditions he should bring that to the attention of the authorities who would have these people prosecuted because they can be prosecuted.</P>

      <P>The argument, therefore, that the pint will go up by fourpence is unsound.  Deputy Mullen says there is great difficulty in getting people to go into this trade.  That may have been so some years ago but the remuneration for barmen has been considerably enhanced in the last few years and they are in a better position than they were in 1959 or 1960.  In regard to hotels, I think Deputy Mullen would confirm that a number of hotels have not adopted the 1960 hours yet.</P>

      <P>If arguments were needed to justify what Deputy Mullen has said those arguments would be presented by Deputy Lemass who points out that there is a statutory obligation upon employers to observe the conditions of the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938.  How does he expect that to be done except by their getting more money to pay extra staff or to pay the existing staff more money for working extra time?  How is that money to be got except from the pockets of the consumers who will have to pay more to drink the quantity they drink at the moment over hours they do not want?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Deputy representing Dublin who is in any way in touch with his constituents must know that Dublin as <Col N="2659" /> whole does not want the extended hours that the Minister is forcing upon it in this unwanted Bill, as far as Dublin is concerned.  The majority of consumers are reasonable and I am concerned only with those.  I am not concered with the fellow who takes a glass of sherry the day his daughter gets married or with the fellow who goes into the public house as soon as he leaves off work and stays there until closing time.  We cannot make laws for these extreme cases or to suit these people.</P>
    <P>I am concerned with the person who is difficult to define but we understand what we mean when we say &ldquo;the average man&rdquo;, the average man who wants to have a drink at reasonably convenient hours.  For that purpose he does not want the public houses open from 10.30 a.m. until 11.30 p.m. with an extra 10 minutes for the few who cannot get out before closing time.  If we do not adopt more reasonable hours for Dublin not only have we the 13 hours but we shall also have an extra 10 minutes under the latest proposals, which means that the workers in public houses will have to work for longer periods than they have at the moment, an extra 40 minutes of employment they do not want, no matter what they are paid for it but which if they want to hold their jobs, they will have to work.</P>
    <P>The last increase in the price of the pint of stout was partly attributable to the Minister for Finance in the Budget and to some extent attributable to an expectation of different working hours on Sunday.  I speak subject to correction but I think the publicans put on twopence to meet the extra hours they expected for Sunday.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Sunday hours arise on the later amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the publican nor the employees expected longer hours on Sunday plus longer hours on weekdays, which are been forced upon them and for which compensation will have to be given to the employees.  If I thought there was a certainty of greater employment in <Col N="2660" /> the licensed trade without any increased cost for the consumer, there might be something to be said for the Bill, but from the point of view of the consumers there is no demand for it; in fact they are very much opposed to it.  It is no proper answer to suggest that public houses need not remain open if they do not want to.  If that system is to operate and the unions refuse to work these hours we shall have a system which sometimes exists on Saint Stephen's Day when only family houses are open. They are chockful for the few hours they are open; there is nothing but chaos.  There will be some houses closing at 11 p.m. and others at 11.40 p.m. Then we shall have shebeens night after night and all kinds of confusions and unfair trading.  Whatever hours are set out here will be uniform hours. I do not think there is any need to give to Dublin the hours proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen's amendment would mean a reduction of the hours we have at present which is worthy of consideration and adoption.  The argument may be used against it that it would provide again the key to the <i>bona fide</i> traffic which was abolished with, in general, overall beneficial effects.  If there is to be a differential of only half an hour between city and rural public houses and if there is to be a ten minute concession for city consumers to enable them to consume their drink after closing time, there would be only 20 minutes in which to get out to the nearest <i>bona fide</i> and I do not think any person would be bothered making a mad rush for that period.  Therefore, Deputy Mullen's amendment is worthy of serious consideration even at this late stage.  If it is not accepted it is clear the Minister is completely out of touch with what Dublin wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unions are to be congratulated on the impartial manner in which they went about taking the census of opinion in relation to drinking hours in Dublin.  The forms which they made available to the publicans did not plead in any way for particular hours. They set out at one column the present hours, in the second column the proposals in the Bill, in the third column <Col N="2661" /> some amendments, and in the fourth column other amendments.  I saw two sets of those forms which had been completed to a certain extent.  In both cases the majority for the weekday alternative was in favour of the existing hours and was followed very closely by a preference for 11 o'clock all round.  There was only a very small minority that wanted the hours proposed by the Minister in this Bill which is unwanted as far as Dublin is concerned.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to consider Deputy Mullen's amendment on its merits so far as this city and its people are concerned. They want reasonable facilities; they do not want to pay, in the few hours drinking they have, for a staff that have not got sufficient work to do for the remaining period of opening.</P>
    <P>We found under the 1960 Act that the result of the extended hours in most cases was that people did not repair to their &ldquo;local&rdquo; until about an hour later than was their wont beforehand.  When the summer time extended opening to 11.30 p.m. came round it simply meant they went to the &ldquo;local&rdquo; a half an hour later than their normal time.  That is the case with the majority of people in their local club which is the local public house.  I do not think we should compel the working man to pay for the unnecessary hours which perhaps suit parts of the country, or do so for some portion of the year, but which certainly the ordinary decent Dublin citizen does not want.</P>

I am here only to speak from what I know.  I happen to be in a public house every other night at the time when it closes.  I do not drink but my wife takes a bottle of stout.  In fact she does not go in until I arrive and as I live now in Portmarnock, that is at about twenty minutes to eleven.  So, at twenty minutes to eleven my wife has one or two and I have two stone beers.  I am mentioning my experience as it is.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know we are discussing Deputy Mullen's amendment to alter the hour for Dublin to 11 p.m. and that the hour suggested by the Minister in the Bill is 11.30 p.m. The point I am getting at is that the Minister is now preparing to give ten minutes which will mean that the public houses will be open up to 11.40 if the Bill is passed and until 11.10 p.m. if Deputy Mullen's amendment is carried.  The ten minutes has a bearing on the discussion.  I believe in uniformity at night.  I shall argue against it later on the Sunday hours for the daytime.  I believe in uniformity at night because at night we have plenty of revelry and other things that we have not got in the daytime. The danger of any differential between Dublin and the country at night is this.  If you take Baldoyle, for instance, half of it is in Dublin City and half is in the county and you could have a case of two public houses in the one town or village so situated that one would be open up to 11 p.m. and the other until 11.30 p.m.  Then you have the <i>bona fide.</i> That will occur around the fringe of the city and in all likelihood those public houses which have to close at 11 p.m. will be empty.  The &ldquo;boys&rdquo; will become wise and will go out because they will say: &ldquo;We will not be allowed in after 11 o'clock in the other one.&rdquo;  Half of the public houses would be empty while the others would be full.  In other words, you would have a <i>bona fide</i> trade. That is why I object to any differential at night.</P>
      <P>I believe in a happy medium.  This is not in the Bill and it is not on paper but perhaps the Minister could agree to 11.15 p.m. for Dublin since he is going to give another ten minutes?</P>

      <P>What I disagree with in regard to the 11.30 p.m. is that the last bus to Finglas, for example, is at 11.30 or 11.25.  I get the last bus in winter.  This means that there are people in public houses who may live in Finglas and may miss their bus. That may mean a taxi or else walking home.  Eleven-thirty is too late.  In many parts of the city the last bus goes before that.  If the closing hour is a little earlier, not only will the drinker be able to get his bus but perhaps the barman also.  There will be trouble with the 11.30 hour in the Bill.  That, now, will mean 11.40&mdash;again the ten minutes.  I ask the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept Deputy Mullen's amendment, to consider introducing an amendment himself to bridge the gap.  One cannot argue without bringing in the ten minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin has put his finger on the difficulty here.  It seems quite clear that neither the publicans not their customers in Dublin want the hour of 11.30 p.m. Whatever may be said for the hour of 11.30 p.m. in rural areas it seems to be quite definite that it is not wanted in Dublin City.  I understand the same applies in the case of Cork. Publicans and their customers in Dublin and Cork will be forced by the Minister under this Bill to accept the hour of 11.30 p.m. for the greater part of the year as their closing hour. Once that is being done the only solution is an amendment on the lines of that proposed by Deputy Mullen but that immediately creates the difficulty adverted to by Deputy Sherwin, that <Col N="2664" /> you are creating a differential at the wrong end, so to speak.  All the evils of the <i>bona fide</i> trade arose out of the differential in the closing hour.  I do not think there would be any objection from what might be described as the <i>bona fide</i> point of view to a differential at the opening hour but what is suggested in this amendment is that there should be a differential at the closing hour.  Deputy Ryan is probably correct in his assessment of the position and I should be glad to have the Minister's views on this because I presume the Minister will speak with the views and investigations of the Garda authorities behind him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan has suggested that a half-hour differential will not make any great difference; that it will not recreate <i>bona fide</i> traffic and the evils associated with it.  There may be something in that.  Certainly, if there is any assurance forthcoming from the authorities that that is the position, that they would not regard a half-hour differential as likely to recreate the <i>bona fide</i> trade, my personal view would favour Deputy Mullen's amendment. It is a matter which should have the serious attention of the Minister and I hope when he speaks on this amendment he will be able to give us the views of the authorities on the matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has referred to the position of the workers in the trade. It is worth drawing the Minister's attention to the fact that there was a very strong view expressed by the minority report of the Intoxicating Liquor Commission.  The minority report was a very strong report in this way.  It was signed by nine members of the commission, whereas, if my recollection is correct, 12 signed the majority report.  Nine signed the major minority report.  These were the views expressed in the minority report with regard to the question of hours in county boroughs.</P>
      <P>I quote from the minority report of the Liquor Commission in 1957. They said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After careful consideration we are satisfied that the extension to 11.30 on week-days and 5-9 p.m. on Sundays in the densely populated <Col N="2665" /> areas of County Boroughs would mean:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Complete disruption of the present pattern of family life.</P>
    <P>(b)  Absence of public transport facilities.</P>
    <P>(c)  Attendant ills of late drinking, increase of prostitution, public scandal, all its consequential evils and the acute exposure to danger of young people.</P>
    <P>(d)  Potential increase in petty and general crime.</P>
    <P>(e)  Fatal consequences to the general family economy.</P>
    <P>They went on a little bit later in the minority report with these words, also on the same question:</P>
    <P>We cannot but be impressed by the considered views of the employers and the employees who submitted evidence before the Commission to the effect that if the proposed hours of 11.30 p.m. closing were to come into operation in Dublin over 2,000 workers, many only 16 to 18 years of age, would not finish work until after mid-night.  Substantial numbers live several miles from the place of their employment and would be denied the facilities of public transport.  It is certain that such a change in hours would be followed by an acceleration in existing emigration among this class of worker where recruitment is already a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Amongst others who signed that report &mdash;his name is the last but it stands out &mdash;is Martin J. Corry.  There were two other members of the present Dáil who signed it, both from these Benches.  I am referring to the matter to point out to the Minister that this was obviously a question which exercised the minds of a substantial minority in the recent Liquor Commission who felt that very serious dangers would be created if the 11.30 opening was extended to the county boroughs.</P>
    <P>Let me say that I recognise the Minister's difficulty in this.  I recognise that by virtually the unanimous wish of this House and the Oireachtas generally the <i>bona fide</i> trade was brought to an end under the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2666" /> I recognise that that differential in the closing hour&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>And the corollary was, of course, the 11.30 opening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That 11.30 opening was there, I think, four months of the year under the 1960 Act.  It is now becoming about eight months in the year.  It is now going to be summer time as fixed by ministerial order.  This year is runs from 25th March to 28th October, which is a very substantial lengthening of the period.  However, the point I want to make is that this is a matter that was very seriously considered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen is quite right in bringing it to the attention of the House by means of this amendment in order to get our minds focussed on the problem.  There is a problem there. There is a problem for the Minister and there are difficulties for the Minister. I believe the Minister will be failing in his duty to the House unless he can give us some assurance that this question has been specifically examined not only by his Department but by the Garda authorities for which he is responsible as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen and his colleagues in the trade union movement have gone to the trouble of trying to compile evidence of the views of the people in the city of Dublin.  I believe there is a definite obligation on the Minister to have this examined from the point of view of the authorities to see whether or not there would be a serious danger of recreating the <i>bona fide</i> traffic if an amendment on these lines were to be adopted by the House.  I want to be quite blunt about it.  As far as my own personal view is concerned, if there was any danger of recreating <i>bona fide</i> traffic, I would not support an amendment which would create a differential in closing notwithstanding the fact that there is ample evidence before us that the hours proposed by the Minister are not wanted by the people of Dublin or Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to say a word with reference to Deputy Noel Lemass.  He mentioned that if people wanted to close at 11 p.m. they could <Col N="2667" /> do so and that anybody who liked could stay open until 11.30 p.m.  That is ridiculous because if 90 per cent. of the publicans decided they would like to close and that it would be better to close at 11 p.m. and only 10 per cent. decided they would open, that would eventually be the cause of the 100 per cent. of the licensed houses being open until 11.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>It is obvious what would happen if 90 per cent. of the pubs closed at 11 p.m.  There would be some overflow going over to the pubs which would be open.  A substantial percentage of custom would eventually be lost to the people closing at 11 p.m. because the people who would go over would say to themselves: &ldquo;I am not going back to the old pub again.  It closes at 11 o'clock.  I will go over to the man who stays open until 11.30.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Nobody wanted this Bill.  I do not know who wants it.  I do not think there was any pressure from the inner courts of the Fianna Fáil Party on the Minister for the Bill.  There was not any pressure from the licensed trade nor was there any from the customers or from the country as a whole.</P>

      <P>For some weeks past, we have listened to all these futile arguments about hours in the licensing trade.  We have listened to those people who have tried to prevent the Minister from giving the ordinary public what they so manifestly want. These people have held up this legislation unnecessarily.  I have no hesitation in saying that the result will be that they will be taking thousands of pounds out of the pockets of many publicans in the next few months. When these gentlemen go out to thank those who elected them, I hope they will explain the real reasons for which they held up this Bill.  If ever they have to pay a visit to Achill Island in my constituency, the publicans there will be delighted to listen to their excuses.  As a result of their misguided activities, the publicans in such places as Achill and Enniscrone will have lost thousands of pounds.  I hope these gentlemen will be able to convince these publicans that they are right and the Minister for Justice is wrong.  I doubt it.  The publicans in my area are not such fools as some of the gentlemen from Waterford and elsewhere seem to think they are.

The Minister came in here to try to give the people of the country the type of legislation for which they have been asking for two years.  A crowd of people, who represent nobody except themselves, are trying to sabotage the Minister's efforts.  I see no reason why the cities of Dublin and Waterford should dictate to the rest of the country.  We are just as much entitled to consideration as the people in Dublin, Waterford or Cork.

      <P>I am sure if the Minister could get another address in the country, he would be glad to go to it.  The tourist industry will suffer very greatly.  Already thousands of people who normally came to the West no longer go there.  They just go to Dublin and no further.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the gentlemen from Dublin want to perpetuate this type of legislation and prevent people going down to the West among decent people.  I do not believe tourism is the beginning and end of everything, but it is one of our most important industries.  The people in the tourist areas should not be victimised to suit a few people in Dublin, usually cranks and cynics.</P>
      <P>I do not want to hold up this Bill any further.  I want to congratulate the Minister on bringing in a sensible Bill, which I hope will go through in the way he wants it.  I also want to thank him sincerely for his amendment of Section 27.</P>

      <P>All that is involved in this Bill with regard to weekdays is an extra half-hour for the additional months of Summer Time.  I do not think it can be seriously argued that that will make any substantial difference to the situation of the Dublin barmen.  I want to point out to the House, and to Deputy Mullen in particular, that the Dublin and Cork publicans have not said a single word against this proposal. In fact, if it were to be put to them as a specific issue whether or not they would opt for the proposal in the Bill as against some differential, I know their answer would be overwhelmingly in favour of what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that the Dublin and Cork publicans have made representations to me on many matters, but this additional half-hour for the extra months of Summer Time was not one of the matters to which they <Col N="2671" /> adverted at all.  From what I know of them, it is something they are fully prepared to accept.  It is, I think, a reasonable suggestion, one indeed which was widely canvassed when the 1960 Bill was being put through, and one which experience since then has shown to be eminently desirable.  My main objection to accepting Deputy Mullen's amendment is that it would create a differential.  My mind is very much set against differentials for the reasons advanced by Deputy Sherwin and others.  There is no doubt that, once you breach the broad principle of uniformity, you have no bastion on which to stand.  You would have to start giving in all over the place and you would finish up with chaos.</P>
    <P>The question was specifically put to me by Deputy M.J. O'Higgins as to whether or not the Garda were consulted in this matter and, if so, what their view was.

      <P>As I was saying, we keep in very close touch with the Garda Síochána.  We seek their views in these matters.  But this is not a matter in which the views of the Garda Síochána could be accepted because this is a matter of the general habits and movements of the people and, in regard to that, I would not look to the <Col N="2672" /> Garda Síochána for an opinion. Deputies are the best fitted of any section in the community to give an opinion as to what our people might do or how they might behave in any given situation.  It is the point of view here that should guide us.  We have between us an accumulation of experience unequalled by any other section of the community.  I object to Deputy Mullen's proposal on the principal ground that it would reintroduce differentials. That would be bad.  It would have bad effects.  There is, of course, inherent in Deputy Mullen's suggestion&mdash;I do no know whether or not it is accidental&mdash;a proposal that in the rural areas the closing time of eleven should be changed to eleven-thirty in the winter months.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act.  I would not accuse the Deputy of doing it purposely, but he carefully refrained from mentioning that that Act prescribes minimum regulations to be enforced by officers appointed by the State.  It does not apply only to trade union establishments. It applies to all types of shop employees, organised or unorganised. There is no provision in this Bill to safeguard the worker.  Under this measure, operatives will be expected to work for 13 hours a day.  I have asked the Minister not to do anything to dissuade young people from going into the licensed trade.  It is very important that these young people should be able to travel home by bus at night. Deputy Sherwin said he felt that this half-hour would lead to a resuscitation of the <i>bona fide</i> trade on the perimeter. I do not believe that for a moment. What is a half-hour?  He said 11.15 p.m. might meet the situation.  The amendment says eleven o'clock and, in advocating eleven o'clock, we are leaving the rest of the country untouched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make that point for the benefit of Deputy Leneghan who talked about <Col N="2673" /> the thousands of pounds the publicans would lose.  His concern, I understand, was with the publicans outside the city of Dublin.  I have not said a thing about what should happen to publicans outside Dublin.  I have no objection to their implementing the hours proposed by the Minister in this Bill. My interest is in the people in the city of Dublin.  Despite what Deputy Leneghan thinks about Dublin, he is very pleased to come up here and sit in Parliament.  Unfortunately for him, Dublin is the capital of Ireland.  If he feels as he does about Dublin, the proper thing for him to do is not to appear here at all.  If he is sincere, that is what he will do.  He would, of course, say anything for a joke.  Indeed, sometimes he talks without thinking.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out&mdash;I can well understand his purpose in doing so&mdash; that by accepting this amendment, we would be spoiling the uniformity.  May I remind the Minister once more&mdash;I made this point already on Committee Stage&mdash;that the tendency in organised areas is to reduce rather than increase the number of working hours?  The people working for Deputy Leneghan <Col N="2674" /> are not organised.  If they were, things might be different.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the Dublin publicans have made no representations about the weekly hours of trading.  I accept what he has said, but I point out that the Dublin publicans, in conjunction with their employees, conducted a canvass of their customers to obtain their opinions.  I understand that the week before last they held a meeting and unanimously decided that the obtaining of a petition was an excellent idea; they were against the proposed weekly hours of trading.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a good argument for the Minister to differentiate between Dublin and the rest of the country.  Dublin is a densely built-up area.  It is in a different category from anywhere else.  Perhaps that is why some people like to come up to Dublin, even if only for the purpose of making fools of themselves in this Parliament.</P>

      <P>Very well.  When we discussed this matter before, I defended the retention of the midday closing but listening to the debate I think the weight of argument is in favour of the abolition of that mid-day closing.  Having taken the other point of view the last time, I thought I would table this amendment particularly in view of the Minister's statement at columns 908-9, Volume 196, of the Official Report of 27th June, 1962, in which he said:</P>
      <P>It seems to me that all we are really concerned with here is the convenience of the Dublin and Cork publicans and their staffs.  It does not seem to me that the general public will be inconvenienced one way or another.  In that situation we might leave over any further discussion until the Report Stage...</P>
      <P>He went on to say at column 909:</P>
      <P>...I would also like to have further discussions with the publicans concerned because my information is that the Dublin publicans are fairly well divided on this issue.</P>
      <P>In the same column, he said:</P>
      <P>My understanding of the situation is that in Dublin the larger publicans, who employ in the main trade union labour, are in favour of a total abolition of the midday closing hour, but that the smaller publicans who man their own premises are in favour of its retention because it provides them with an opportunity of having their midday meal and of tidying up their premises.</P>
      <P>My own personal inclination would be to abolish the midday closing hour altogether...</P>
      <P>Although I defended the midday closing hour in the first instance, in the same volume at Column 908, I said:</P>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputies P. O'Donnell and P.J. Burke that the more restrictions you have, the worse type of drinking you will have.  To my mind, the fewer restrictions you have the less drunkenness there will be.</P>
      <P>In view of these statements, I thought it would be better to table this amendment in order to give the Minister an opportunity of letting us know the outcome of whatever discussions he was to have and the further consideration he was to give to the matter.</P>

      <P>I object entirely to the amendment.  Strange as it seems, I have a letter from a publican in Waterford last week who said he was shocked at the suggestion made by the Minister to keep public houses open all day.  Having referred to my own speech, he said: &ldquo;We know.&rdquo;  He pointed out these session drinkers, those fellows who have money and nothing to do, who do not want to leave the public house and who are responsible for wrecked homes.  The people of the country areas are more of a working type but there are a tremendous number of people in the cities, especially Dublin, who live on pensions and who live on their wits. They are in Dublin in thousands as compared with scores in country areas. Those fellows would live in the public houses.  They would be a nightmare to the publicans, to themselves, their wives, and everybody else.</P>
      <P>I live around the markets and I know what goes on behind the scenes. I know Dublin.  I have run dances for 30 years and you get to know everyone. You get to know the underworld and the &ldquo;overworld&rdquo;.  I know all the &ldquo;spunkers&rdquo; and all those fellows up the lanes drinking poteen, methylated spirits and hair oil.  I also know the fellows who go in for the glass of whiskey and the cup of tea.  I know a number of people who would not leave the public house and if they did come out later and happened to be drivers of cars, they would have deaths on their hands.  That would be the Minister's responsibility also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This midday closing is a deterrent. It prevents people from overdoing it and gives the publican an opportunity to get the people out.  By chance, they may go home for their dinner.  It also gives them a chance to know how drunk they are.  It is a fact that people do not know how drunk they are until <Col N="2678" /> they stand up to go out.  As far as the capital city is concerned, it would be dangerous to accept this amendment and I do not think we should even discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As promised, I discussed this question further with the various interests concerned and I am assured by the Dublin city publicans that they are overwhelmingly in favour of the retention of the midday closing period.  Not alone that, but they are in favour of retaining the existing hours, half-past two to half-past three.  That is also the view of the Dublin barmen conveyed to me through both their unions.</P>
      <P>I understand the same is the situation in Cork.  In those circumstances, I think the argument for retaining the midday closing hours of half-past two to half-past three is unanswerable.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, there is no real public interest involved in Dublin and Cork in this matter and in that situation, I think we can have serious regard to the wishes of the people engaged in the trade.  I know there is a small section of Dublin city publicans who would like the midday closing hour abolished but on balance, I am convinced we should retain it for the moment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 19 after &ldquo;Cork&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or the borough of Waterford&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rise to speak on this amendment with great hope, having listened to the Minister tell us that he must retain the midday closing hour in Dublin and <Col N="2679" /> Cork because the publicans of Dublin and Cork have come to him and asked for it.  I put it to the Minister that he should include the Borough of Waterford for the same reason.  I placed in the Minister's hands a document, petition or memorial&mdash;whatever you wish to call it&mdash;signed by nearly 90 per cent. of the Waterford publicans saying that they wanted to retain this hour of closing between 2.30 and 3.30 p.m.  That is, or should be, as convincing to the Minister as a meeting with the representatives of Cork and Dublin publicans.  Tonight, when he was speaking on the first amendment, the Minister said he wanted to make it clear to the House that the licensed trade in Dublin did not show any objection to these hours.  The Gardaí were in constant touch with the Minister in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Garda are not the people to guide the Minister.  Deputies are in a better position to give opinions and I am conveying the opinion of the people in the licensed trade in Waterford. I am also conveying the opinion of many housewives, mothers and sisters and workers in Waterford.  The men consider the public houses should have that closing hour because the majority of the young men I meet in Waterford are working in factories there.  They have been striving hard up to recently for a 40-hour week and, having got it, they do not want to see other people working eternally.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable for the publicans to send a memorial to the Minister and ask him to meet them.  I had hoped that the Minister would give an indication that he would be prepared to meet me on this.  I think he should.  It is a most reasonable amendment.  I ask the Minister to accept it and I should compliment him if he did.  It would be an instance of democracy at work, of public opinion making itself felt through myself and my colleague Deputy Kyne from Waterford, if we, having brought the opinions of our constituents here, the Minister, having considered the matter since the Committee Stage, would say: &ldquo;I shall allow Waterford to stay in the Bill with Dublin and Cork.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2680" /> I do not see why the Minister should cut out Waterford.  On the Committee Stage the Minister said that the situation in regard to Dublin and Cork was different.  So far as he could see, the publicans in Dublin, he said, were equally divided on this matter.  Largely, the publicans in the central city areas wished to have this mid-day closing done away with for the various reasons he enumerated.  The smaller Dublin publicans, on the other hand, wished to have the mid-day closing retained because, they say, it gives them an opportunity to go for a mid-day meal, tidy their premises and so on.  Why should the Minister treat the people of my constituency differently from the people of Dublin?  According to the Minister's reasoning tonight, if the majority of publicans in a particular place want a particular thing he is prepared to meet them on it.  Now he says only half the publicans in Dublin want this but at the same time he is prepared to give it to them.  I was one of a deputation composed of my colleagues from Waterford that presented this memorial to the Minister and I was sure the occasion would not arise when I would have to come into the House and plead this.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I want to point out to the Minister because I had no opportunity of speaking on it on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he had no evidence that the people of Waterford wanted to stay in.  That was on 26th June, as reported at Column 888 of Volume 196 of the Official Report.  Tonight, the Minister said he had no evidence that the people of Dublin wanted this mid-day closing but he was quite satisfied that the publicans of Dublin and Cork wanted it and therefore he was prepared to give it to those publicans.</P>
      <P>I live in Waterford city and move about a good deal.  The debate on the Committee Stage was discussed there in various public places and my question put to different people was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Would you prefer the closing hour <Col N="2681" /> to be retained?&rdquo; It was not a case of a majority being in favour but only one man replied that what he would like was to have the public houses open 24 hours a day.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the Minister that we have factories working 24 hours a day and in a number of them the workers finish on Friday night.  They have their wages in their pockets on Saturday morning.  They do not go into town very early on Saturday morning as it is their day off.  Not all of them go into public houses but many of them do at about 11.30 or 12 o'clock. If they go in, they do not get out for the day.  They begin card-playing or something else and many of them will stay there.  I am repeating what a former colleague of mine said when he sat on the Fianna Fáil benches and he was a highly respected member of the licensed trade in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Deputy Lynch told him that he met a few people.  I met hordes of people. Every one of us who goes around as a Deputy meets lots of people.  If we do not, we are slipping.  As I told the Minister, I met one man who said: &ldquo;I am not in favour of any midday closing hour or any closing hour.  They should be open the whole 24 hours.&rdquo;  The Minister can put any weight on that he likes.  I said then at column 889:</P>
    <P>Mr. T. Lynch: May I interrupt the Minister to ask if he has any evidence that anybody in Waterford wants this?</P>
    <P>Mr. Haughey: I have, yes.</P>
    <P>That was a most surprising statement. I had a full post about it.  I had many people coming to my office about it.  I had people stopping me in the street and even coming to see me at functions and meetings about it. What evidence has the Minister that anybody in Waterford wants the pubs open from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.?  It is an extraordinary thing that the Minister could have such evidence.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that this is a most reasonable amendment.  It does not upset his Bill in any way.  He is doing this for Dublin and Cork.  Why <Col N="2682" /> can he not do it for Waterford when it is asked for?  On his own admission, only about half the publicans in Dublin want this.  He will not do this for Waterford, even though 90 per cent. of the licensed trade want it.  He says he will not do this for Waterford because he has a consensus of public opinion in his favour.  With respect, I say that he has not.  He has not made any statement as to how he obtained that, from whom he obtained it or who sent it to him or when he got it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given his opinion on amendment No. 2 about how he feels in relation to the licensed trade. He has given his opinion in relation to Dublin on amendment No. 1, that if they do not see any objection to these hours, he was prepared to meet them. The publicans in Waterford have no objections to these hours and the Minister should be prepared to meet them on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here not to put forward my personal view but to try to interpret the views of my constituency. While I know nothing about the question of the midday closing in Waterford because I live in a rural area, where it did not exist, I must admit that the consensus of opinion, in so far as I can register it, amongst the publicans in Waterford is in favour of this closing.  I must agree with Deputy Lynch that at least 90 per cent. of the publicans there feel that they should have a closing hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with Deputies Ormonde and Lynch, I received telegrams on the Committee Stage of this Bill protesting against the Minister's statement on Second Reading that it was not the view of the Waterford people.  I do not represent the consumers view but I do know the publicans' view.  The Minister might rightly ask me, as he did at a private meeting, if I could give him any idea of the consumers' view. I cannot, and I am perfectly honest about it.  I do not know what the ordinary man who takes a drink in Waterford wants.  I could not tell the House that.  In the Bill the Minister has seen fit to say that in other areas if the publicans in general decide that they should make a request to open half an hour earlier, unless they conflict <Col N="2683" /> with the State or the Church, they may be permitted and could get the extra half-hour.</P>
    <P>If he gives that concession to the publicans in the rural area, I do not think there is anything wrong with his considering the request of the Waterford publicans.  I am only trying to interpret as well as I can the views of my constituency.  I want it to be perfectly clear that so far as I am concerned this is a good Bill.  I am going to vote for it but I would suggest to the Minister that he should in all reason consider a serious amendment put forward on behalf of an organised group in the city of Waterford.  It will not interfere with anything.  There is nothing sacrosanct about changing an hour and allowing us to have this closing hour.  The Minister might well say, as I have said to the publicans in Waterford, that there is nothing to stop them closing, if they want to close, but the publicans have retaliated with the statement that they employ labour at a good trade union rate and that they will be held up to ransom in relation to the family house which employs a girl or boy who can go on and keep the place open for that hour.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister wants that.  I think the Minister has treated the whole Bill reasonably and well. It is an excellent Bill as far as I can see, even though the amendments I had hoped to see in it are not in it. The Minister should have a look at a serious request from the third city in the country.  Could he not be reasonable and say that if Waterford publicans want the hour, there is no law against it and that the position should be the same as that obtaining in Dublin and Cork?  The Minister should consider that.  I do not know how I am going to vote if it comes to an issue but I feel it would be unfair as a Waterford representative if I did not press that view on the Minister.  It is the only view I can get from Waterford so far.  I would appeal to the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking for this amendment although I am not from Waterford.  A publican wrote to me and appealed to me to support <Col N="2684" /> the amendment.  Just for that reason and apart from the fact that a good case was made, I support the amendment. I am sure that the representatives from Waterford would not advocate the amendment unless it was the will of the publicans in Waterford.  If it were not the will of the publicans in Waterford, one would be in danger of getting into serious trouble.  The representatives here must be people who express the wishes of the publicans in Waterford.</P>
      <P>If any city wants to keep the mid-day closing, the Minister should let them keep it.  There is a difference between a city and a rural area.  The rural area publicans are largely family publicans.  While the publican is at his dinner, his wife can keep the pub running.  In the city, you have none of that type of business: you have employed persons.  The situation is entirely different.  If the publicans in any city want to retain the hour, I do not see why the Minister should object, because such a differential in the daytime is not a serious departure from the principle of the Bill at all.  I see no danger at all in slight differentials in the daytime; the great danger is at night.  If Limerick is not making the case, that is Limerick's business. Waterford is making the case.  It is not a very controversial or serious matter and I think the Minister should accede to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support this amendment.  I cannot understand the Minister's attitude with regard to it.  As Deputy Sherwin pointed out, this is not a matter that should be regarded as controversial in the political sense.  There is nothing political about it.  It is a question of public representatives from the Waterford constituency coming in here and representing the views of the people concerned in their constituency.  No one in this House can doubt for a moment the words of Deputy Lynch and Deputy Kyne that the vast majority of the publicans in the city of Waterford want to maintain what is, after all, only the <i>status quo.</i> It certainly seems to me that if there is a proposal to alter the <i>status quo</i>, there <Col N="2685" /> should be a very strong case made before that is done.</P>
      <P>The House should compare the Minister's approach with regard to this question in connection with the city of Dublin and the city of Cork and his approach to it in connection with the city of Waterford.  Deputy Noel Lemass had down an amendment to abolish this midday closing in the cities of Dublin and Cork.  What was the Minister's attitude?  His attitude was that he had examined this matter. He had gone into consultation with the publicans in Dublin and Cork and they were overwhelmingly in favour of retaining the midday closing in those two cities.  Accordingly, having heard their views, the Minister decided the <i>status quo</i> should be maintained.</P>
      <P>What are Deputy Lynch and Deputy Kyne asking the Minister to do?  They have furnished the Minister with evidence&mdash;they have certainly satisfied me and I venture to suggest they have satisfied every Deputy&mdash;that the overwhelming majority of the publicans in the city of Waterford also want the <i>status quo</i> maintained.  Why does the Minister seek to upset that?  Why does he treat the people and the publicans of Waterford any differently than he does the publicans in Dublin and Cork?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why there is such a complete reversal of Government policy on this matter inside the space of two years.  I do not want to weary the House with quotations which I have already put on record, but the Minister's predecessor just two years ago dealt with this matter in the House.  He told the House it would be a retrograde step to do away with this midday closing.  He was talking with reference to a proposal at that time which sought to abolish it for the city of Limerick.  His colleague, the Minister for Lands, came into the House and told us it was the view of the authorities that this midday closing was valuable and should be retained. No less than two Government Ministers went on record in this House in fighting down a proposal from an independent body from Limerick two years ago that the midday closing should be abolished in Limerick.  The Minister's predecessor told us that this <Col N="2686" /> midday closing in the county boroughs was one of the most valuable features of our licensing legislation, a sentiment with which I fully agree.</P>
    <P>Two years later, the Minister, apparently in pursuance of a policy of uniformity I cannot understand, tells us he is going to abolish midday closing in two of the cities and retain it in two others.  The Minister has evidence, which I venture to suggest cannot be denied, put before him by public representatives of the constituency in question.  There are no politics in it.  There should be no controversy associated with it.  There is no reason at all that I can see why the Minister's approach to the Waterford. Deputies and publicans should not be precisely the same as his approach to the people of Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>In addition to what the Minister's predecessor and his colleague, the Minister for Lands, had to say on this, this question was also examined by the Liquor Commission which reported in 1957.  They dealt with the matter regarding week-day hours generally. Their recommendation, on which the 1960 Act was principally based, was that the hours of general trading should be from 10.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. all the year round, but that in the county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford the existing provision for closing between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. should be retained.</P>
    <P>What evidence has the Minister had since the Report of that Commission that leads him to suppose that an alteration such as this is desirable? What arguments has he to advance&mdash; they should be forceful arguments if he is going to alter the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; to counter the arguments put forward by two out of the three Deputies representing the city of Waterford?  In replying to this on the Committee Stage, the Minister threw it out that he had evidence that the people of Waterford wanted this change.  Like Deputy Lynch, I now ask him what is that evidence?  Will he give us proof of whatever knowledge he has in this matter?  I very strongly urge on him, in the interest of trying to get some agreement with regard to some section of this Bill, that the amendment <Col N="2687" /> proposed by Deputy Lynch be accepted.</P>

With all due respect to the last speaker, I gather from Deputy Lynch and Deputy Kyne that their plea is tantamount to being an expression of the views of the Waterford publicans and, I think, some of the Waterford people.  Waterford is a sister constituency of mine, if you like, and I am aware that the publicans in Waterford want to preserve this midday hour.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any use in waving the former Minister for Justice in the face of the present Minister on this measure.  It is quite obvious the present Minister does not even pretend to frame liquor legislation in the same way as his predecessor.  That is the responsibility of the Government and they will have to take whatever criticism there is for that.  It seems Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Justice, has a different approach to many of these matters.</P>

      <P>I cannot say whether that is good or bad.  I do not know. I object to the majority of the sections of this Bill.  It seems obvious that the Minister does not see eye to eye with the proposals contained in the Bill introduced by his predecessor.  That is his own look out.  I would ask him to listen to the plea being made by the two Deputies from Waterford and the plea put to him by the publicans of the city of Waterford.  He may have a case that there is no strong demand from Limerick.  Maybe he wants that uniformity which suggests this hour be preserved in the four county boroughs. If he is not prepared to accept this amendment might I respectfully ask him to say now that, between this and the consideration of the Bill in the Seanad, he will further investigate the attitude of the publicans and the consumers in Limerick so that he will have, at least, that sort of uniformity where the hour's break in the day will <Col N="2688" /> be peculiar only to the four county boroughs?</P>

      <P>I received a very large number of letters in connection with this Bill.  I received one letter from a publican in Waterford.  He is a supporter of either Deputy Lynch or Deputy Kyne.  I replied asking him for some further information.  After getting the second letter, I regarded him as nothing but a head case.  I took it then that he was a supporter of Deputy Lynch.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch claims to represent the publicans in Waterford.  I am surprised he has not some kind of organisation in Waterford and that somebody representing that organisation did not write to me instead of this individual publican who made utterly fantastic statements.  One was that, if the hours were extended, he would have to sell out and go to England.  He claimed he was operating the house himself with, I think, the help of his family.  As far as I know, if the hours are extended in the West of Ireland, that will keep a great many people from going to England.</P>

I am equally clear in my mind that the majority of the Waterford city publicans, for their own convenience, would be against what I am proposing.  But I am afraid I cannot agree that the matter ends there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the excellent pipeline which Deputy Lynch is from the constituency of Waterford, I have my own sources of information as to the wishes, needs, requirements and desires of the constituency.  I am quite satisfied that, apart from the convenience of the majority of the publicans, there are excellent reasons why quite a number of people in Waterford agree with what I propose.  Apart from the narrow sectional interests of the publicans in this regard, I have certainly had no protests from Waterford.  I know that Deputy Kyne in his frank and honest approach to this Bill, and it has been that throughout, is torn in this matter.  He cannot make up his <Col N="2689" /> own mind.  All he can say to me is what the Waterford city publicans want and, if he can meet their wants, he will. That is the sum total of his argument. I have information from my own sources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to what the needs and requirements of Waterford city are in this regard.  Over and above all that, I am all the time in this Bill trying to get uniformity wherever possible.  This situation was examined first on the basis of whether or not the midday closing should be abolished throughout the country and whether the degree of uniformity should be extended in this way.  The arguments in favour of abolishing it in Limerick city were very compelling.  They seemed to me to be equally compelling in regard to Waterford city.  Reluctantly I came to the conclusion that this anachronism, as I think it is, should be retained in regard to Dublin and Cork for the reasons I have given. I am not convinced, apart from a narrow sectional interest, that what I am proposing here is in any way undesirable.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he wanted to try to separate Waterford from Dublin and Cork.  Taking drink is a matter of spending money.  It is a matter of so much money per head of the population.  I am not talking now <Col N="2690" /> about tourists, I am talking about natives.  I asked the Taoiseach for details as to the amount of retail sales per head per county some time ago. Per head Dublin was the highest. Waterford came next.  Cork and Limerick were away down.  I do not think the Minister is being fair in this. The Minister says he has ways and means of obtaining information and that there is a need for doing away with this hour in Waterford.  The Minister is a Dublin man, resident in Dublin.  According to himself, he has no idea as to whether there is any public demand for the retention of this hour in Dublin city, but he has an idea about Waterford.  That is a rather extraordinary statement by the Minister. He said earlier this evening that he is in touch with the Gardaí, but they are not the people who guide him.  He says Deputies of this House are in a better position to give the Minister information.  I have conveyed to the Minister in no uncertain fashion the fact that the majority of the people in Waterford want this.  The men and women, the wives and mothers want it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must be aware of what Deputy Sherwin described as session drinkers.  The Minister is responsible for the whole set-up and the smooth running of the licensed trade.  It is very difficult for a publican, if he has reasonably good spending customers, and they come in at 11 a.m., settle down and start playing cards; they will not go away for the rest of the day.  The publican who wants to keep a well run house would like to break the party up and send the men home to their dinners.  They can come back again and, even if they do not, maybe it will be just as well.  I suggest that this is a reasonable amendment we are <Col N="2691" /> putting to the Minister and he should be prepared to meet the people of Waterford in the matter.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 28 and 29 and substitute:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  if the premises are situate in the county borough of Dublin, half-past five o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of ten o'clock in the evening,</P>
      <P>(ii)  if the premises are situate outside the county borough of Dublin, four o'clock in the afternoon or after the hour of ten o'clock in the evening or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage, I put down an amendment similar to this but it referred to the whole country.  I have changed it to this extent, that it now refers only to Dublin.  I want to make <Col N="2692" /> it clear that I am accepting the Minister's section but I am asking him to exclude Dublin from it.  The case I am making is that no one in Dublin wants opening from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Even the members of the Minister's party are aware of that and I am sure they have told him that.  We object to six hours drinking on a Sunday but the real reason I have put down the amendment is that I want to give the workers a reasonable break on a Sunday.  Whatever chance they might have with a break of three or three and a half hours, a break of two hours is no good because you cannot go anywhere or do anything in two hours.</P>
    <P>If a public house closes at two o'clock, it is after two before the employees get out and then they only have time to eat.  They certainly have no time to go anywhere if they have to be back at four o'clock.  It kills their chances of going to a cinema or to a match.  Most of the big matches are held in Dublin, not in the country.  Most of the barmen are country folk; few of them are Dublin folk.  They are used to hurling and football and are fond of these games. They like to go to the games and if they have any spare time, they play the games.</P>
    <P>If they were off for three and a half hours, it would give them a chance of getting some dinner and going to a match, seeing it, perhaps participating in it and getting back to the public house in time.  It also gives them the chance of going to a cinema and getting back in time for the reopening.  It would give them the chance to get out in the country for an hour or two, if they wished.  I believe that it would suit 100 per cent. of the employees and the publicans themselves.</P>
    <P>The public have no great interest in drinking beer at four o'clock on a Sunday afternoon.  Sunday afternoons have always been regarded as an occasion for games, for outside sports. If the opening hour were 5.30 p.m., it would encourage people to promote Sunday games but if the public houses open at 4 o'clock, it would be a killer. What the promoters of these events are afraid of is loss and even if only a certain percentage attended any of <Col N="2693" /> these events at 4 o'clock, it would give the promoters a chance of meeting their expenses.  If the public houses were shut from 2 p.m. to 5.30 p.m., it would give a chance to all and sundry to go to a cinema or to some game and the &ldquo;beering&rdquo; hours would be shortened by an hour and a half.</P>
    <P>Everyone I have approached, including all the Deputies representing the city and members of the Minister's party, have agreed with me that Dublin does not want opening from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.  How the Minister can say that he wishes to put this Bill through in the name of uniformity, I do not know.  I have agreed to uniformity regarding the night hours and will support the Minister on it because I am well acquainted with the behaviour of people in all walks of life. I flatter myself as being an expert on human nature and on the behaviour of people in various circumstances.  I was in a business where I met everybody from the lowest to the highest and I know their behaviour from long experience.</P>
    <P>I know that there are certain dangers at night and that is why the Minister aimed at eliminating those dangers by insisting that all premises close at the same hour.  That danger does not occur in the daytime and no case can be made for uniformity in the daytime.  The Minister has accepted differentials in the day hours. He has accepted opening at 7 o'clock in the morning to suit certain people attending markets.  He has accepted a differential where people may open at 12 or 12.30 p.m.  He is even accepting a differential as far as public houses being shut during the midday closing in Dublin and open in surrounding areas is concerned.  In at least five different cases he has accepted a differential.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverts to unformity at night.  I am merely asking him to agree to another differential which will not make any difference because people will not rush out of Dublin to the country at 4 o'clock in the day and even if they did no harm would be done.  People will know they have six hours to drink.  They are not in the mood in the daytime.  People who <Col N="2694" /> are out for a good or a bad time come out dolled up at night.  Night is the time for good or evil.  The Minister has recognised a differential in five different instances, in relation to the morning public houses, the closing in the city, the opening in the country, the extra half hour for publicans from 12 to 12.30 on a Sunday.  The people who are employed will not object, the publican will not object, the public are indifferent and it will suit the pioneers, the people who do not like beer, because they will say it reduces the drinking period by an hour and a half.  My amendment deals with Dublin. I have not said anything about Cork because I am minding my own business.  I am concerned with Dublin, the capital city.</P>
    <P>I am even prepared to compromise at this stage and to accept the hour of 5 p.m. or if it goes to that 5.30 p.m. If the Minister does not agree he will lose many friends in many areas let alone in his own area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked to put down my amendment, particularly by the people who work at the business in Dublin, because they are very much concerned with what the Bill purports to do on Sunday.  This section of the Bill may safely be described as, if not the most objectionable section, one of the most objectionable sections of the Bill.  It has imposed very severe penalties on the operatives, and as I said on Committee Stage, one of the most deplorable features of this Bill is the absence of a single line indicating or prescribing the minimum conditions under which workers should be called upon to operate.  If anything is crying out for that single line it is the Sunday hours of opening.  It is <Col N="2695" /> very much to be deplored that interest is not being shown in this respect.</P>
      <P>I would draw the attention of the House and the Minister to the fact that for Sunday trading public houses operate on half staff by reason of the fact that operatives get every second Sunday off.  This four to 10 opening will produce a situation where you will call on half the staff to have more breaks than they had normally.  It will create a great deal of chaos in the business.  Furthermore, it will interfere to a great extent with the family and social life of the operative and the family and social life of the customer. One does not have to stretch one's imagination to realise the effect of this. One must not lose sight of the fact that under the Bill the new hours will be: 12.30 to 2 p.m. and 4 to 10 p.m.  That means the barmen must go in before 12.30.  Most barmen will take at least 20 minutes to travel to their place of employment so if they hear half past 11 Mass they have to go straight into work.  If the public house closes at 2 p.m. they will be very lucky if they get out to their lunch at 2.20 p.m. and, having gone home to have their lunch, they are due back at 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>I am advocating in my amendment that the hours should be 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. for Dublin and Cork.  That will take care of many things.  When the customers leave the public house on Sunday at 2 p.m. they will not have the temptation to linger outside talking and perhaps wait for the public house to open again.  They will go home to lunch.  As the Bill stands we are interfering with family life and, as Deputy Sherwin says, there is something special about Sunday.  If nothing else, the working man is free not only to go to a football match or to a film but to take a walk with his family and later on to go for a drink if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also anxious to ascertain what is the Minister's case for the hours of 4 to 10 p.m.  I have not heard such a case and I think we deserve some explanation as to why these hours should be imposed on the Dublin barmen and the Dublin customers.  I regard it as an imposition on the customers having regard to the fact <Col N="2696" /> that customers have been canvassed with particular regard to what they would like in respect of Sunday hours of opening.  The Irish National Union of Vintners, Grocers and Allied Trades Assistants circularised 120 public houses in which their members are employed.  In one week they got back 12,000 signatures.  Of that number 2,249 voted for the present hours of working.  In regard to the Minister's new proposals in the Bill, 951 voted for them out of the 12,000. As regards the alternative proposal that the hours should be from 5 to 10 p.m. from June to September and 7 to 10 p.m. for the remainder of the year, 4,199 people were recorded as being in favour of that proposal.  As regards the proposal that they should operate from 6 to 10 p.m. from June to September and from 7 to 10 p.m. for the remainder of the year, 4,601 people voted for it.  There is direct evidence that the proposed new hours are not in keeping with the operatives' wishes, the wishes of the public or the wishes of the publicans.</P>
    <P>That being so, I wish to know who advocated these hours.  What is the case for them?  The Minister has mentioned uniformity.  Before I come to that point I should like to mention that a canvass was made of hotels and restaurants to ascertain how people there would like the hours to operate. There was a total of 2,677 names obtained.  Of that number 1,987 voted for the present hours on Sunday and 690 voted for the new proposals.  I should like to mention in that connection that the restaurants in Dublin that have licences will not open on Sunday so there is no demand there.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister may break away from uniformity and need not feel concerned about it or feel that he did not achieve anything by making the difference in this section because, just as he made the difference in regard to the midday hours of closing between Dublin and Cork, and the rest of the country, when he has Dublin and Cork separated in that way, I say he has the same opportunity in regard to the hours of opening. I entreat the Minister to realise that this will result in the bar worker feeling that he is tied to the job all day <Col N="2697" /> on the one day on which he does get &ldquo;a kick&rdquo; out of being off.  While he works every second Sunday, he gets some use out of the hours he has off but in this case he will not be able to make use of any hours except those before 12 noon or after 10 at night.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to have regard to matters of this kind.  I do not think it is something we should press to a vote.  As Deputy Corish said in regard to the Waterford publicans wanting to have the midday closing, I would ask the Minister, instead of having a vote, to give full consideration to the purposes behind this amendment, not necessarily fixing the hours from 5 p.m. until 9 p.m. but at something that would get away from 4 p.m.  If he said he would consider that before the Bill goes to the Seanad, I should be satisfied.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to delay the House on these amendments but I want to say that, of the two, I should prefer Deputy Sherwin's amendment, for the simple reason that Deputy Mullen's amendment would create a differential at the wrong end, a differential at the closing hour, whereas Deputy Sherwin avoids that.  From what I have heard of the views of Dublin publicans and Dublin consumers, I think the hours as proposed in Deputy Mullen's amendment are the hours which would be favoured in Dublin, but once the principle of uniformity is there and is being insisted on, then I think it is necessary for the Minister to cater for the rural areas by allowing a later closing hour than 9 o'clock.  There was a general demand and a general need for that. If that is conceded&mdash;and it has been conceded in the Bill&mdash;then I think the Dublin publicans must accept 10 o'clock as the closing hour, but that does not mean, to my mind, that they should also be tied to the same opening hour as rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to repeat arguments I made on another amendment but I do not believe that any of the dangers or evils associated with the <i>bona fide</i> trade would be recreated by allowing a differential at the opening rather than at the closing end.  Consequently, I think the Minister should consider something on the lines of Deputy Sherwin's amendment.  I quoted on an earlier amendment the very strong views of the minority report of the Liquor Commission on the question of both week-day hours and Sunday opening hours and, as I pointed out then, it was a very strong report of a very strong minority because nine members signed the minority report while 12 signed the majority report.  I quoted their views in regard to the opening hours which at that time were 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. in the cities on Sundays and the proposed hours in the majority report and, for very strong and specific <Col N="2699" /> reasons given by those who signed the minority report, they felt that even those hours were too long in the county boroughs.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, one of those who signed that was Deputy Corry.  I want to make this clear as Deputy Corry is not in the House.  I am not saying this for the sake of tilting at him in any way.  I said there were two members from this side of the House and Deputy Corry from the opposite side among those who signed this report and I am drawing attention to that to show the Minister that this is not, and should not be, a Party political matter.  It is a matter on which the views of the different political Parties as well as the different sectional groups were obtained and those were the views put up by a very strong section in the minority report.  I do not say that because somebody expressed those views five years ago, or subscribed to them, he is necessarily tied to them for life.  Experience may alter one's views but those views are on record and they should not be lightly disregarded by any Minister introducing a Bill of this sort.  They would be justification for the Minister in endeavouring to meet the viewpoints put forward by Deputy Sherwin and Deputy Mullen and of the two, for the reasons I have given, I would favour the views of Deputy Sherwin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have not really any new arguments to put forward on this matter.  On previous occasions, I have endeavoured to give my views and my reasons for these proposals.  I am still convinced that what I propose is the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I analysed this situation here pretty closely for the House and brought it down to the point where we are really only arguing about one hour, basically the hour from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays.  Deputy Sherwin might say &ldquo;half-past five&rdquo; but I think even he would be prepared to accept 5 p.m.  We are only arguing then about one hour, in Dublin between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. and, to a lesser extent, in Cork.  I have readily admitted that there is not any real public demand for opening during this hour in Dublin <Col N="2700" /> city or in Cork city, but I put it forward as something we must do, as it were, the lesser of two evils, I do not think it is a very serious evil.  All that is concerned, and Deputy Sherwin himself admits this when he says the public is indifferent, that there is no public interest involved from the point of view of the Dublin or Cork consuming public, is the convenience of the publicans and their staffs.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed my view that this is something they will be able to cope with, if we accept that it is necessary in the interests of uniformity and I seriously urge on the House that it is necessary for that reason.  Do not forget that very closely adjacent to Dublin city you have areas to which people in the not very recent past have been accustomed to travel to get drink. I think a pattern would very quickly re-emerge if we were to depart from uniformity.  If we accept that uniformity is necessary, then I think we can decide, with a reasonably clear conscience, to accept this proposal for this reason.</P>
    <P>As I said, the Dublin city publicans and the Cork city publicans are a group of people skilled in their business. They have long experience and a great deal of skill in managing their houses.  They have staff problems all the time.  Everybody today has staff problems in running a business.  I am quite certain that the Dublin and Cork publicans will be able to get over this difficulty as they have got over many other difficulties.  I do not think it would be crucial for them and I do not accept that there will be any hardships for the staffs.  They are, fortunately, a very well organised section of people, and I am quite convinced they will be able to look after their own interests.</P>
    <P>I am particularly persuaded to that point of view when I think of the early morning opening in the docks.  I want to remind Deputies that my proposal was to abolish the early morning opening in the docks and contiguous areas.  There were approximately 30 publicans&mdash;their view did not ultimately weigh with me&mdash;who were determined to fight every inch of the way against that proposal.  They <Col N="2701" /> went to great trouble to mobilise all sorts of public opinion.  They even had petitions signed over the bar counter to ensure that my proposal would not go through.</P>
    <P>Here are 30 publicans who know their business.  They are looking for an opening of three or three and a half hours every morning of the week, an additional three hours every morning of the week.  They say they are able to cope with that.  They will have no staff problems.  How then can I accept that one hour on Sunday, on one day in the week, will make a crucial and critical difference?  I cannot accept that.  The proposal is put forward by me on this basis.  It is not necessary in Dublin but it is essential for the general structure of our licensing laws and the preservation of uniformity.  It will not really cause any serious hardship to anyone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced by anything the Minister has said by way of addition.  The objection is that a pub will be open for six long hours.  For every big pub that employs staff, there are ten little pubs which are run by the owners with, perhaps, the help of one assistant.  The people in the little pubs will have to remain on their premises for the six hours.  They cannot afford to employ additional staff.  The owners and the staff are entitled to get away, if they want to get away.  Perhaps it might be said that the pubs can employ someone else but that is going to be costly and difficult.</P>
      <P>I know many publicans who will not do it but will compel the employee to work the six hours.  The porters who are the small fry will be made stay there for the six hours.  There are a large number of people who will be obliged to stay in the pub for six hours. The Minister is robbing these people of the chance of getting away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned as an argument that certain pubs in areas like the docks and the markets do not object to three and a half hours.  No one objects when there is big money to be made.  Big money will not be made from four to five or from five to six but there is big money to be <Col N="2702" /> made from seven to nine because all the fellows who cannot sleep are up in the pub at seven.  If the Minister wants information, let me tell him that probably two-thirds of the people in the pub are neither dockers nor market men.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I live beside it.  It is a well-known fact that the fellows who get too much drink the night before get up and go there in the morning. These pubs do big business so that it would pay them to get another assistant, but it will not pay the man who has to open on a Sunday where there might be only one individual there. The argument of the Minister in that respect does not count at all.</P>
      <P>Another thing is that those pubs which open at seven o'clock in the morning are situated in bleak areas. Once it goes beyond 6 o'clock, there is nobody in the pub.  Let us take the case of the docks.  After six or seven o'clock, there are not very many around.  The same thing applies to the markets.  There is no one around the markets at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock, with the exception of a few of the local people.  The market people are all gone.</P>
      <P>A large number of people will have to stay in their pubs for six hours on a Sunday.  I will not push the matter if the Minister is prepared to give a thought at least to that between this and the final Stages of the Bill.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2703" /> In page 4, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Section 14 (which provides for certain exemptions from prohibited hours) of the Act of 1927 is hereby amended by the insertion after paragraph (a)  of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>`(aa) the sale at any time at a railway station (being a station to which persons who have recently travelled or are about to travel by ship resort for refreshment) of intoxicating liquor to passengers who have recently travelled or hold tickets entitling them, and are about, to travel by ship for a distance of not less than fifty miles, or' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is, very briefly, to facilitate persons who have disembarked from cross-Channel boats and trans-atlantic liners and who wish to get refreshments outside the normal hours.  As Deputies know, boats of this nature have a peculiar habit of arriving at all sorts of odd hours.  Briefly, what is proposed is this.  As Deputies know, at the moment a traveller by train can have refreshments at a railway station, provided he has travelled or holds a ticket entitling him to travel more than ten miles.  What we now propose is that a person who has travelled more than 50 miles by boat will be in the same boat, so to speak, as the person who travels by train.  Disembarking travellers at Dún Laoghaire will be able to get refreshments at Westland Row, though the train journey would not necessarily be ten miles.</P>

He can sell it and the one ticket can last a month.  It is a joke.  You are subsidising CIE in a new way.</P>

      <P>Deputies will recall the discussion we had on Committee Stage.  The argument was strongly put forward at that time that some publicans got into serious difficulties over comparatively trivial offences.  The situation might arise where a publican would be endeavouring to clear his premises after closing time&mdash;maybe only five or six minutes after&mdash;when he would be discovered by the Guards and prosecuted for an offence.  The argument was put forward that that would not matter so much, were it not for the fact that we have a system of compulsory endorsement.  There is some validity in that argument.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of it is this.  The law at the moment is rather illogical.  It entitles a publican, or indeed a restaurateur or a hotelier, to serve drink to customers one minute, indeed one second, before closing time and, at the same time, expects him to have it disposed of on the dot of closing time. I was going to say that any drinking man knows that that provides for an impossible situation.  I think any sensible man will readily realise that.</P>

      <P>I am putting this forward to meet two points of view. First of all, publicans say there is a great deal of hardship and annoyance over this matter.  Customers rightly say they are entitled to get drink right up to closing time and the publican is in a dither endeavouring to clear his premises from that second onwards.  A lot of bad feeling arises from time to time between the publican and his customers.  That is bad from every point of view.  Here is a valuable and noble reform put forward by myself to the House proposing to allow ten minutes drinking-up time.  That will remove a lot of sting out of the argument about compulsory endorsements. The main suggestion in that argument was directed towards five or six minutes after closing time.  Deputy Burke and others instanced the sort of situation where a publican was caught in what they would regard as difficult circumstances, namely, five, six or seven minutes after closing time.  This proposal for a ten minute drinking-up period, therefore, should be generally welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has endeavoured to meet the point of view put forward by the Committee by the introduction of this amendment. I support this amendment, but I do not think it is ideal.  I do not think the Minister has really tackled the problem properly.  There are a number of people who feel that what the Minister is doing in this amendment is merely extending the opening time by another ten minutes and that the closing hours instead of being 11.30 p.m. will be 11.40 p.m.  A great number of people feel that that is rather worsening the position than bettering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view was also expressed here in Committee from both sides of the House that a period of drinking-up time should be allowed.  I understand that is the position in England.  I hope the noble gesture of the Minister is not too much inspired by what is happening across the water.  The suggestion was also put forward that if a drinking-up time were allowed, it might be as well to arrange for the closing hour to be, say, at 11.15 p.m.  I am simply <Col N="2707" /> mentioning these things.  I am not objecting to the Minister's amendment. I think it is worth while doing, and that it will alleviate the position to some extent.</P>
    <P>I take it we are discussing amendments Nos. 33 and 34 with this?  Those amendments are really on a rather different matter.  Amendment No. 33 proposes, in effect, that the district justice should have general discretion with regard to the question of endorsement of licences.  Amendment No. 34 is a repetition of an amendment proposed on the Committee Stage that, at least for offences committed within a period of 15 minutes after the permitted opening hours, discretion as to whether or not an endorsement should appear on the licence should be vested in the district justice.</P>
    <P>I want to concede that the Minister's amendment allowing ten minutes drinking-up time does to a very large extent meet the arguments advanced in favour of what is now amendment No. 34 when a similar amendment was being dealt with on Committee.  But it does not meet the arguments or, if you like, the principle enshrined in amendment No. 33.  I argued on Committee, and I argue again now, that it is bad in principle that you should have mandatory penalties.  When you have the judiciary there to administer justice and have people brought before the courts charged with an offence, it is bad in principle that the courts should be refused discretion as to the penalty to be imposed.  They are being refused discretion to a certain extent so long as it is mandatory on the courts to couple with whatever penalties may be imposed an endorsement of the licence in respect of liquor offences.</P>
    <P>The courts were allowed discretion prior to the 1960 Act.  That was the Act which took away the court's discretion on this matter.  I am suggesting in amendment No. 33 that the courts be given back that discretion.  I would simply point out to the Minister that he has not met the argument fully in this amendment.  I should like to put a couple of questions to him.  It seems to me it is obviously intended that the liquor should be supplied during the permitted hours and that there are then <Col N="2708" /> ten minutes allowed after closing to drink up.  Would the Minister consider whether it is necessary to put into paragraph (a) of the first subsection of the amendment, after the words &ldquo;intoxicating liquor&rdquo;, the words &ldquo;supplied during permitted hours&rdquo; or some words to that effect?  It seems to me to be open to the construction at the moment that liquor could be supplied at any time, even during the ten minutes drinking-up time.</P>
    <P>Secondly, with regard to paragraph (b), I find it very difficult to understand exactly what is intended.  I should be glad if the Minister would elucidate a bit.  This paragraph says</P>
    <P>For the purpose of <i>paragraph</i> (a) of this subsection a period during which the sale of intoxicating liquor in licensed premises is permitted by or under any provision of the Licensing Acts (other than section 2 of the Act of 1927) shall be deemed to be a period during which such sale is prohibited on such premises.</P>

      <P>I support the Minister's amendment and the idea of allowing this drinking up time, but I do not think he has met us fully on the question of the endorsement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself totally in disagreement with Deputy O'Higgins.  I think some of us are inclined to forget not merely the approach of the Minister for Justice at the time in 1960 but of all the members of this House.  It was essential then that the old abuses which had obtained, particularly in the rural areas, prior to the enactment of the 1960 Act should be ended.  The overriding consideration was the enormous benefit that would result to the public at large from putting an end to these abuses.  I am happy to be able to say that in my experience they <Col N="2709" /> have, in the main, been put down.  We should not do anything now to go back on that approach.</P>
      <P>Even though I concede to Deputy O'Higgins that it is rather undesirable that a district justice should not have a discretion, the overriding consideration here is the public good.  I believe that if the penalty of endorsement were not mandatory, it would, in fact, be very rarely imposed.  In 1960, the Government were trying to implement the recommendations of the Commission and the whole object was to put an end to flagrant abuses, all-night drinking, and so forth, which were rarely punished other than by fine.  It was imperative then to bring in a system under which mandatory endorsement after the first offence would bring home to the publican the lesson that, if he did not keep the law, he would lose his licence.</P>
      <P>Everybody who takes a drink and who has spoken to me about the effect of the 1960 Act is delighted that he no longer has the temptation of the shebeen.  He is delighted to be put out at the end of the period.  He is no longer a source of annoyance arriving home at three, four, or five o'clock in the morning.  I implore the Minister not to accede to the request that discretion should be given to the district justice in this matter of endorsement. I believe the 1960 provision was a good one and an essential one.  It has worked well in practice.  It has had the necessary effect.  You will, of course, have a certain number of publicans in every area who will take a risk but, mark you, after the second or third time, they realise they are in danger of losing their licences and they amend their ways.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for bringing in the ten minute drinking-up time but, like Deputy O'Higgins, I am not too pleased with the phraseology used in paragraph (b).</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I go into public <Col N="2710" /> houses every second night.  I go in about half-past ten, or a quarter to eleven, just to give my wife a bottle of stout.  I have experience of the difficulty of closing and getting people out. I have seen more rows and heard more bad language used by people whose drink was snapped off the counter.  A drink may be served at five minutes to closing time and, immediately they serve it, they are shouting: &ldquo;Drink up, drink up.&rdquo;  Only last night I saw a man leave half his pint on the counter. He got browned off being told to &ldquo;Drink up.&rdquo;  This ten minutes will enable the publican to close at a certain time and enable the customer to drink up in reasonable comfort. After that, everyone will have to get out.  There will be no excuse for the publican or anyone else.  The amendment is reasonable and I am glad the Minister has introduced it.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, it will mean, of course, that people will be in the public house until twenty to twelve. The employees and the employers will have to be there for that full ten minutes.  That is a snag.  It is a pity the Minister did not decide to make the closing at 11.15 p.m. and add the ten minutes' grace on at that point.  The last bus leaves at 11.30 p.m.  The last Finglas bus goes at 11.30 p.m. and, if you miss it, you can walk home.  It is a pity the Minister did not shorten the period and make it 11.15 p.m. closing, plus ten minutes' grace.  The objectionable feature in it is that it lengthens the period until twenty to twelve.  All the unpleasantness in the past will now be eliminated.</P>

      <P>I want to explain the phraseology of subsection (b).  The idea is to confine this ten minutes drinking-up time to the ten minutes immediately following normal public house closing time.  Section 2 of the Act of 1927 is the operative section for the purpose of laying down ordinary public house closing hours.  Hotels may serve drink up to 12 o'clock, if there is a meal with it.  I want to ensure that this ten minutes will relate only to the ten minutes immediately following ordinary public house closing hours and so it says that any period outside the normal public house time shall be <Col N="2711" /> deemed to be a prohibited period for this purpose.</P>

      <P>In page 5, line 47, to delete &ldquo;eight&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;nine&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I feel sure that the House will compliment me on these proposals.  Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage it was fairly strongly argued that the special provisions in Section 8 of the Bill for a period of special festivity would not be as valuable as they appeared if confined to one period only during the year.  Many Deputies suggested that it be broken up and different suggestions were put forward as to the manner in which that should be done.  A number of Deputies suggested that any particular town might find it needed one period of one or two days and three or four days in the other period.  My proposal is to allow nine altogether in the year and any town or locality can split that period up as they wish.  They can have the whole nine days together, or three periods of three days each, or three periods of a day, two days and six days.  They can break the nine days up in any way they wish but in not more than three periods.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 47 down to and including &ldquo;dance&rdquo; in line 50.</P>
      <P>I think we might discuss amendments Nos. 11 to 16 together.  I am anxious for the Minister to examine amendment No. 11 in particular because he might not go quite so far with me and I have put up certain alternatives.  In reply to a Question in the House on 10th July, I was told that there are 45 ballrooms licensed for dancing in the city.  Of these, only six applied for occasional licences in the past five years.  Of these six, one ballroom secured two in 1959, one secured one in 1958, one in 1959 and three in 1960 and none since then.  One applied in 1962 and failed to get the occasional licence.  Therefore as far as occasional ballroom licences are concerned, I am concerned only with three ballrooms out of 45 in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The official journal of the Irish County Vintners' Association in a leading article said that a colleague of the Minister has tabled a series of amendments which proposed that dance halls should get licences to sell <Col N="2713" /> drink without any restriction until the early hours of the morning.  This is the type of misrepresentation I have come to expect from this association.  I stopped opening their booklet for a long time because they openly expressed the view that as long as they are all right they do not care about anybody else.  This section appears to be designed to deal with one ballroom which is the target of the publican who is now in charge of this particular publication since Mr. Dwyer retired.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the position in regard to the effect of the 1960 Act on the three ballrooms referred to.  In 1958, 150 such licences were applied for and granted.  The number was over 100 for each of the next two years.  When the 1960 Act came into operation, 21 such licences were applied for in 1961 and eight were granted.  Ten were applied for in 1962 and eight were granted.  So the 1960 Act has, in effect, reduced the number of such licences from 150 to eight and this Bill proposes to reduce the number to four.</P>
    <P>The difficulty which the Minister had to deal with was the court's interpretation of the 1960 Act in so far as it said that a house dance could be a special occasion to qualify for such a licence.  I can understand the Minister's desire to deal with that situation and I think he has effectively dealt with it in Section 9 which says:</P>
    <P>An occasional licence shall not be granted for a dance unless it is held elsewhere than in the open air or in a tent, marquee or other such structure, and either it is organised as a special function for the members of a particular association or other like group...</P>
    <P>then follow the words relating to &ldquo;a substantial meal ... served to the persons attending the dance&rdquo; which I propose should be deleted.</P>
    <P>...or it is held wholly or partly on a day that, in the opinion of the Court, is a day of special festivity generally or in the locality of which the place to which the licence relates is situate.</P>
    <P>I think the matter is sufficiently covered without the words the deletion <Col N="2714" /> of which I propose.  It deals with the difficulty that has arisen over the court's interpretation which apparently was not the intention of the Minister's predecessor.</P>
    <P>I think the talk we have heard of exposing our youth to drinking all night is a lot of nonsense.  There are 45 ballrooms licensed for dancing in Dublin city and of these only three are likely to avail of the facilities I suggest should be available to them. My experience on committees running such functions for political and other purposes is that about 5 per cent. of the clientele who come to such dances come for the sole purpose of getting a drink; in other words, .35 per cent. of the people who go to dances can be said to abuse the facilities quoted.</P>
    <P>The whole principle of special occasions is recognised in this Bill and special provision has been made in that regard.  However, it is now provided that only four such occasions can arise in Dublin County Borough in any one year but a village that has a ballroom and which may have only a few hundred souls living in it will have exactly the same facilities as the whole of county Dublin.  The ballrooms in small centres that were set up during the time of tax reliefs, such as those Deputy Everett was particularly concerned about on Committee Stage will have exactly the same facilities as the county borough of Dublin.  One of the amendments, No. 13, suggests that these provisions should be related to the ballroom as distinct from the locality.  There is a ballroom in a town just outside Monaghan which gets an occasional licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one ballroom in Dublin which normally avails of such licences about once a week or maybe once a fortnight.  The point about this ballroom is that they have catering facilities and run a large number of wedding receptions.  I take it that under the provision in the Bill they cannot get a licence for a wedding breakfast that might be held in the ballroom.  Some provision could <Col N="2715" /> have been made to cover that type of situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite possibly they will not charge 5/- for it.  I referred also to the fact on Committee Stage that during the summer season in Skerries the sailing club extend hospitality to several hundred people all over the country and even from England.  They find themselves largely dependent on the income they get from this type of dance because members who are not interested in dancing go along and discuss sailing and have a drink.  I made a mistake when I said the admission price of the dance to which I referred was between 6/6 and 7/6.  In fact the admission price they charge is 4/- if the ticket is bought before the dance and 5/- at the door.</P>
      <P>In the general provisions of this Bill, we agree that special circumstances require special measures but because the special measures are taken, it does not mean we are departing from the principle of uniformity. Even if my amendment is accepted, that broad principle will not be interfered with.  That may be, as the Irish County Vintners' Association say, muddled thinking, but it is not nearly as muddled as their effort on Page 15 where Frank Webster, the sales promotion manager of Caltex appears.</P>

      <P>Whether I say anything about Section 10 will depend on how we get on with Section 9.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that a large number of charities depend largely for their incomes on this type of dance.  These charities are supported <Col N="2716" /> also by people who do not go primarily for dancing.  They will have a dance now and again but they go to support the particular charity. The dances I have in mind particularly are those for the Benevolent Fund of Irish Actors Equity which raises between £800 and £1,000 a year, the Variety Club of Ireland which raises about £1,500 a year, UNICEF which raises about £2,000 a year, the Polio Fellowship which raises about £4,000 a year, and the Inkblots who raise about £900 a year.  That is nearly £10,000 raised for charity in this way.  It has been made clear by me, by Deputy Mullen and other speakers that the worst displays of wild behaviour occur usually at the very expensive type of dances which attract what has been described as the social set and that the modest efforts have caused very little trouble.</P>
      <P>If there is a demand for licensed dances in Bray, I cannot see why that demand should not be satisfied.  May be later closing on Sunday will reduce that demand but if licensed dances are not permitted in Bray, there will be the more objectionable feature of hip-flask drinking and the young people about whom we are supposed to be concerned will not know in advance which dances will attract that section of the community who cannot enjoy a dance unless they have a few drinks. Many young people, particularly young girls, avoid dances at which there is a bar because they wish to avoid the embarrasment, perhaps, of dancing with some one who has taken a drop too much.  The position in future will be they will not know and will not be able to pick and choose. They may go along and find the dance they are attending is one of those they wish to avoid.</P>
      <P>To get back to the Irish County Vintners' Association, on Committee Stage of the 1960 Bill, Deputy Rooney read a letter from the honorary secretary, Mr. T.F. O'Dwyer, which appears in Column 986, Volume 180 of the Official Report of the 23rd March, 1960 in relation to the various motions which were passed, No. (3)  of which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2717" /> As life in the various counties and rural districts is completely different to those in the city, it was unanimously agreed that there should be a later opening for the areas outside the County Boroughs. We feel, as the traditional closing hour is 12 midnight, any earlier closing will result in shebeens, drinking in crowded homes and private cars.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Irish County Vintners' Association if they suggest that this section we are bringing in now will not result in shebeen, drinking in private cars, and, as I say, hip-flask drink.  Of course it will.</P>
    <P>There we have a safety valve, a means of letting young people decide between where drink is likely to be taken and where it is not.  Now they have no such choice.  Although up to now they may have avoided such dances, in future they will find themselves exposed to worse dangers because they are hidden dangers and people who normally avoided the licensed dance may find in effect that most drinking is taking place at non-licensed dances.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his attitude in that regard on the question of four licensed dances in a year and to be satisfied with the additional provisions he has put down as to what type of dance may be considered for occasional licenses without putting any restriction on the number.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not delay the House very long because a great deal has been said for changing the section. I should like to support Deputy Lemass in his plea to the Minister to do something about the four occasions in Dublin.  We can imagine the scramble there would be between the licensed halls in the city as to which would use any one or all four occasions.  It is absolutely ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All that Deputy Lemass has said, particularly in regard to the journal issued by the National Union of Vintners seems to be quite correct.  It appears to me that this organisation has succeeded in getting the Minister to introduce the section because ever since the implementation of the 1960 <Col N="2718" /> Act that organisation has been protesting against ballrooms being facilitated in serving drink.  I do not object to their doing that; I can quite understand the necessity for them to advocate an arrangement of that kind outside the City of Dublin where the regulations may not be enforced as they are enforced in Dublin.  We must have regard to the experience in relation to ballrooms in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is no denying that the licensed ballrooms and the public which they serve are well ordered.  The people attending them behave well.  There have been no prosecutions down the years.  There are two in particular in the centre of O'Connell Street and they have been operating for some twenty years now without complaint by the police.  That should be considered.</P>
    <P>If the section goes through as it is it will have a considerable effect on the number of people employed in those two establishments.  That should be considered.  Already submissions in that regard have been made to the Minister and I feel certain he has not quite made up his mind on the matter. I sincerely hope by the time this Bill passes through the Seanad this section will have been changed.  In addition, it is undoubtedly true that Section 9 as it now reads introduces a class restriction. It affords an opportunity to people with money to drink to their hearts' content at dances while people who just go to dances and have a drink for the sake of refreshment and cannot afford to pay for a substantial meal will be deprived of that amenity.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that licensed dances are pretty well attended.  The dances of the kind described by Deputy Lemass attract very large crowds and that is why the charitable organisations have made money from them.  That indicates the demand for that type of dance in the City of Dublin and attendances of between 600 and 800 a night are no surprise particularly at charity dances. While these attendances are high the people present are not misbehaving in any way.  If the section goes through as it is those people will be induced to find other places in which to drink. They will go where they can get drink, then go to the dance and take the <Col N="2719" /> girls away afterwards and drink wherever they like.  That would be very bad.  They can make use of the hip flask and no matter what the ballroom proprietor tries to do he will not be able to control it.  That point merits consideration.</P>
    <P>I have been pressing the Minister for some time now on this point and if he must do what he proposes, let him do it outside the city of Dublin. Let him not bring in the people whose hands are clean, who have been performing a very good service in Dublin not only for visitors but for regular patrons.  They should not be classed with the type of people who cannot control ballrooms, makeshift ballrooms, outside Dublin.  Further, I ask the Minister to bear in mind the employment aspect.  There is every likelihood of people losing employment if this section is carried because if drink cannot be served at dances a considerable number of staff will not be needed.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter seriously.</P>
    <P>Finally, would it not be possible to alter the section somewhat and allow establishments to which licences are attached to continue to operate and to serve drinks?  The Shelbourne Hotel has a ballroom attached and they are able to serve drinks but the people who frequent the Shelbourne can pay for substantial meals and everybody there is all right.  The people who go to the Metropole Ballroom cannot pay for a substantial meal.  There is a difference.  Could the Minister not introduce a restriction whereby people going to a dance of this kind, where no substantial meal is sold, should not be allowed in after the public houses close or a half-hour before the public houses close, if he wishes to regulate it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that two types of people go to dances, the type who take dancing seriously and go for the love of it and do not care about drink, and the type who go for a social evening, and who probably cannot dance.  Nearly every firm in Dublin runs a staff dance annually and there are thousands of firms in the city. <Col N="2720" /> When a staff dance is being run people of all ages and types buy tickets to help the committee.  They cannot dance and nobody would dance with them.  There is nothing as bad as a person who cannot dance and who gets up to dance.  I know that. I was a teacher of dancing.  Certain ballrooms cater for the dancer.  They are patronised by dancers who are not interested in beer or anything else, but staff dances are attended by people of all shapes and makes.  They do not necessarily want to dance; they want to sit down and have a chat.  But they want a drink and without that they would not go.  Drink helps people to be convivial and it &ldquo;makes&rdquo; the evening.  The staff dance is killed if there is no beer.  The hours might be shorter.  To include a substantial meal might make it too costly.  The ballroom might not have the facilities for serving a substantial meal.  The Minister must remember that nearly every firm, big and small, runs a staff dance every year.  Staff dances are run by the thousands.  The people who attend them are not the sort of people who go just to dance.  They will not dance.  The younger element will dance.  The Minister is killing that sort of dance.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter as I know the dance game.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister agreed on Committee Stage to reconsider this matter.  I expressed the view then that it was not necessary to have drink at a dance in order to make the dance a success.  I believe that is so. There is a number of cases where young people are concerned where their parents would object to their going to dances if drink was obtainable. While I ask the Minister to have another look at this in deference to the views put forward on Committee Stage, I want to say that, on balance, I think the Minister should not weaken his section.  He might do better to stand over it as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my own view also.  I have already at some length given my views on this whole complicated and difficult matter.  The amendments we are dealing with are <Col N="2721" /> amendments to Section 9.  Section 9 does not deal with the two ballrooms which Deputy Mullen has in mind. They are, in fact, licensed.  They are ballrooms with licences attached. Section 9 is concerned exclusively with what is commonly known as the commercial dancehall.  In other words, the premises which has no licence attached to it.  When I say no licence I mean no licence to sell alcoholic drink.  It is purely a dancehall in the full sense of the word.</P>
      <P>I stated clearly on Second Reading and on the Committee Stage what my objection in regard to these establishments is.  I think that my approach is correct.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, dancing and drinking are two separate forms of entertainment.  The tendency which has been creeping in to have drink at every dance is undesirable.  I want to restrict the number and types of dances at which alcoholic liquor would be sold.  I have gone fairly far in the concessions which have been made.  I maintain, in spite of what Deputy Sherwin says, that I am saying the staff dances.  As I know these dances, a meal is served at the annual function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <P>What I want to cater for here is in regard to a firm, factory or sports club which has its annual dance.  It is a special occasion once a year.  At such functions a meal is served.  They are covered by Section 9 as it stands.</P>
      <P>Deputy N. Lemass mentioned a point about weddings.  Section 9 deals only with occasional licences for two specific things.  In other words, dinners or dances.  There are all sorts of other things for which you might get an occasional licence.  They are not covered at all by Section 9.  A wedding is one of these things.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  You have occasional licences for racecourses.  You can have an occasional licence for any function.  Subsection (2)  is concerned <Col N="2722" /> with laying down conditions under which a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor should be granted for a dinner or a dance.  Its operations are confined to only those two types of thing.  I have thought the matter over very carefully and I still think the proposal is desirable at this stage.  We should introduce these restrictions on this ever-increasing tendency which has become evident in recent years.</P>
      <P>We are discussing a number of amendments in the name of Deputy N. Lemass.  For the reason I have given, amendment No. 11 is unacceptable and so is amendment No. 12.  I do not agree for a moment that there is anything wrong with the section as it stands though in order to be reasonable in this I would be prepared to accept the principle of amendment No. 13, not exactly in the way it is put down by Deputy N. Lemass.  If I may do so at this stage, I would be prepared to accept it provided the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; was substituted for the word &ldquo;locality&rdquo; and not &ldquo;ballroom&rdquo;. That would meet the point of view of Deputy N. Lemass&mdash;in other words, that in any area the number of dances which would have a licence in the year would be related to the premises and not to the locality.  I am prepared to accept that principle.  With the permission of the House, I suggest the substitution in subsection (3)  of the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;locality&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the other amendments of Deputy N. Lemass is to increase the number of dances in respect of which a licence would be granted.  Twenty-six is suggested.  I do not think he seriously means that.  Another amendment suggests 12 and, finally, in amendment No. 16 he suggests that we delete &ldquo;four&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;eight&rdquo;.  In other words, he wishes to double the number of special festive occasions on which we would grant licences during the year.  I certainly could not contemplate increasing the number by that much.  I think four is not unreasonable. It is meant to cater for the <Col N="2723" /> special gaia days during the year such as bank holidays and days of that kind. I thought four was reasonable.  I certainly could not accept 26 or 12 or anything of that nature.</P>
      <P>Substituting the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; for &ldquo;locality&rdquo; in subsection (3)  will mean a corresponding deletion of paragraph (b)  of subsection (7).  That would be a consequential deletion because the provision set out in paragraph (b)  would not be applicable if we substituted the word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;locality&rdquo; in subsection (3).  With the permission of the House, we could make those changes.</P>
      <P>A gremlin, apparently, has been at work in the printing works in amendment No. 7.  Deputies will note that in paragraph (b)  of subsection (2)  of amendment No. 7, second last line, the word &ldquo;applying&rdquo; appears.  Of course, that should be &ldquo;supplying&rdquo;.  In fact, &ldquo;applying&rdquo; was what was in the White Paper circulated to Deputies. I wanted to draw the printing error to the attention of the House.</P>

      <P>The arguments here are much the same.  I would like to point out, however, that in reply to a Parliamentary Question on the 17th July, 1962, I discovered there were 179 special exemption orders granted to hotels in the Dublin metropolitan area for dances at which meals were not served and 200 special exemption orders granted to restaurants for dances at which meals were not served.  We are dealing in this case with 379 such exemptions that were granted in Dublin last year, not eight as in Section 9.  Surely this was a very big cut down?

    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Minister had an opportunity of studying this?  I think it should be acceptable.  It is to meet what seems to be a defect in the Bill as drafted. The Bill as drafted does save the position of pending applications.  This amendment is to deal with the position where an application is being made for a declaration.  As the section stands at present, it would seem to require that the declaration should actually be made before the passing of the Act. The position may very well be that an application is before the courts for a declaration but that a declaration has not actually been made or possibly <Col N="2728" /> there might be an appeal from the decision of the circuit court.  If the Minister accepts this amendment, or whatever other words his advisers might think satisfactory, it would meet the situation fully in respect of applications for declarations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefit of the record, I should like to give the particulars which have given rise to this demand for a sworn inquiry.  On the evening of 23rd January last a sick infant, requiring medical attention, was brought to the Regional Hospital, Galway, by its parents.  They were asked at the pediatric unit if they had a letter from their family doctor.  They said their family doctor was not available and that was why they had brought the child in ten miles to Galway Regional Hospital, where they hoped the child would get treatment. Even with this explanation, they were told they would get no attention for the child; the doctor in charge refused to give any attention.</P>
      <P>The father of the child then called to my house and explained the position, whereupon I accompanied him to the out-patients' department of the Galway Regional Hospital.  I met the nurse in charge and pointed out that the child was in need of medical attention and that this attention was not available to him at his home and his parents, therefore, could not get a letter from their family doctor.  If they could have got the letter, the doctor would have been available; there would have been no need for the letter and there would have been no need for them to go to the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out that a doctor could have relieved the child of pain and distress had he been available. <Col N="2729" /> This is evident from the signed statements of the doctors themselves. I have statements to prove my contention. The nurse was, I admit, most helpful.  She called the doctor in charge of the particular unit, a different doctor from the doctor in the other unit. He began to examine the child.  In the course of questioning the parents he found out that the child had been discharged from the pediatric unit some days previously.  He then rang the pediatric unit to get the history of the case before treating the baby.  The doctor from the other unit came over and immediately, if I may say so, there was a &ldquo;down tools&rdquo; in the unit.</P>

      <P>The parents had eventually to take the child 17 miles where they found a doctor who treated the child and relieved it of pain and distress. I, as a parent, having seen the child, knew that the child was in need of medical attention.  As a member of the Galway County Council, I felt had a duty towards these parents.  The ratepayers of Galway are responsible for the upkeep of that hospital.  It was my duty to ensure that these parents got the benefit of the hospital, for which the ratepayers are paying so dearly.</P>
      <P>At a subsequent meeting of the Galway County Council, it was agreed that a sworn inquiry should be asked for into the circumstances of that case. The members were given the particulars. There were letters from both doctors, from the parents and from all concerned.  On that basis they agreed to call for a sworn inquiry.  It is most regrettable that at that meeting some of the members of the Minister's Party tried to turn this matter into a political issue.  Finally, one of the members stood up and said: &ldquo;You will never get that inquiry.&rdquo;  It is a strange thing that that same member at a very recent meeting of the Galway County Council could stand up, before the letter from the Minister was read, and say: &ldquo;You are not going to get your sworn inquiry.&rdquo;  I challenged the secretary of the Galway County Council&mdash;a very decent man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Further, the Minister said in his letter that there was no public disquiet.  Will the Minister now tell the House and the people of Galway where he got that information?  I know of plenty of public disquiet over that episode and other things as well that occurred in that hospital.  I should like the Minister to explain fully and explicitly to the House, particularly in regard to some of his colleagues in the back benches who were at that meeting, on what grounds he refused to hold this sworn inquiry.  I hope the explanation will be one that will satisfy the people of my city.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The first intimation we got in the county council of the alleged incidents that are the subject matter of this debate was a statement made by Deputy Coogan at a meeting of the county council.  The allegations he made came as a great surprise not alone to the members of the county council but also to the county manager who was present at the meeting.  It appeared that a period of three weeks elapsed between the time when these incidents were supposed to have taken <Col N="2732" /> place and the date of the council meeting at which Deputy Coogan made the allegations.  The county manager and the members were surprised that a public meeting should be used for the purpose of bringing a series of serious charges against the administration of the hospital and the county manager indicated in no uncertain manner his feelings about the way in which this was brought to his notice for the first time.  He agreed to have an inquiry held into the allegations and, in the absence of the resident medical superintendent, the inquiry was conducted by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking to the public.  In the absence of the resident medical superintendent, the inquiry was conducted by the lay superintendent who took statements from the parents and the people concerned.  In all, I think six statements were taken. Two were from the doctors concerned, one from the doctor in charge of the pediatric unit and one from the other doctor in the casualty section.  Two were taken from the nurses in casualty and two from the nurses in charge of the pediatric unit.  At a meeting of the visiting committee, of which Senator John Mannion is chairman, these documents were presented to the members. I said at that meeting that as the charges were made publicly, they should be refuted publicly and I asked that the documents be circulated to the members of the county council and this was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, the matter came up for discussion at the meeting of the county council and Deputy Coogan said he was not satisfied with the statements, that he was not satisfied that the lay superintendent was a man competent to take the statements and, in order to vindicate himself, and in this I agree with him, he suggested that a sworn inquiry be held.  I asked him to make a formal proposal to that <Col N="2733" /> effect and that I would second him and he did so.  The Minister has turned down that request for a sworn inquiry. I think he said in his letter that the subject of the charges did not warrant a sworn inquiry, that a sworn inquiry was a very serious matter and that it would also be a very costly matter for the Galway County Council and for everyone concerned.</P>
    <P>In actual fact, this child had a slight attack of constipation, and I understand that there are many excellent medicines readily available for dealing with that complaint.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary state of affairs that a good hospital and an excellent staff should be ridiculed publicly and made the target of this very unfair and very unjust criticism.  Anyone who has anything to do with the administration of a hospital and who helps to build up its good name does not like to see that good name and reputation destroyed by unjust and unfair allegations.  For that reason, I ask the Minister now to agree to have the sworn inquiry.</P>
      <P>If the sworn inquiry is too costly and not warranted by the facts of the case, I ask the Minister to agree to an inquiry conducted by one of the medical inspectors of his Department who usually conduct such inquiries. The good name of the Galway Regional Hospital means as much to me as it does to any other member of Galway County Hospital.  I refute the suggestion made by Deputy Coogan that any political influence was brought to bear on the Minister.  I have not seen the Minister in connection with this matter, and if I were to see him about it, I would ask him to have the sworn inquiry.  If he is not prepared to agree to that, he should have an inquiry conducted by one of the men appointed by his Department to do so.  Until we clear the air one way or the other and until we vindicate the staff of the regional hospital, the nurses and doctors involved in the case. they will be under a cloud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the medical staff <Col N="2734" /> in the hospital themselves propose to take action in the matter.  There was a meeting of the visiting committee last week at which the Professor of Medicine informed the members that such a serious view had been taken of the allegations that the matter had been referred by them to the Medical Defence Union.  For that reason and that reason only, it might be inopportune for the Minister to intervene now and hold an inquiry.</P>

      <P>When the relatives <Col N="2736" /> of a sick person find that person does not receive the attention which they believe their patient deserves, or the patient's condition merits, they are naturally annoyed and sometimes they write to me making a formal complaint. Whenever I receive a complaint of that sort, I have it very carefully investigated.  I then study the facts as revealed by the investigation and come to my own conclusion as to whether I will or will not have a sworn inquiry. I am not reluctant at any stage to have a sworn inquiry if the facts warrant it, but I do not order such an inquiry lightly.  I have to act responsibly and with a sense of proportion.  I have to remember, first of all, that a sworn inquiry may be a very expensive business.</P>

      <P>I have to remember that a sworn inquiry is a very expensive business which may cost all concerned, not only individuals but the ratepayers, for whom Deputy Coogan is solicitous here on other occasions, and the taxpayers for whom on occasion he is also solicitous in this House, a considerable sum, running perhaps into thousands of pounds.  I have to remember that it places all those concerned under considerable mental stress, that it may damage their reputation irredeemably, and that in a hospital or other similar institution it may become a source of disturbance and disorganisation which operates to the detriment of the patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that on consideration the House will agree with me that I cannot order an inquiry to be held.  I cannot ask people to give evidence on oath, I cannot adopt that procedure unless I am satisfied that the gravity of the circumstances warrant it.  What happened in this case?  A parent wrote to Deputy Coogan complaining that on the 25th January his child was very ill&mdash;the occurrence now under discussion in fact took place on the 23rd January.  The first thing about that <Col N="2737" /> letter is that it was written a month after the event.</P>

I have been very apprehensive on occasions myself just as I assume Deputy Coogan has, but it does not necessarily follow because there is a natural apprehension on the part of the parents that there is any good foundation for that apprehension.  In this case two doctors who saw that child in the Regional Hospital, the nurses concerned and the doctor who afterwards treated that child and said it was a simple case of constipation, all agreed that the child was not in need of urgent medical attention or was not in such condition that they would be justified in admitting it to the hospital.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The holding of a sworn inquiry is a serious matter.  It involves much time and trouble for those immediately <Col N="2740" /> concerned and considerable outlay of public funds may arise directly and indirectly.  Accordingly, it must be recognised that the procedure of a formal inquiry under oath is not one to be resorted to unless the matter to be inquired into is of serious consequence or has occasioned public disquiet.  On present information, the Minister is not satisfied that such is the case in the present instance.</P>
    <P>That letter was written on my direction, in the terms I directed and I saw it before it issued.  I have no apology to offer to Deputy Coogan that the sworn inquiry is not being held.</P>
