      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever may be said either for or against these Budget proposals, I think it can be said with justice and fairness that the present Budget is not an economist's Budget.  Rather it recalls those days when a Budget was regarded merely as being national housekeeping and it does not reflect the position that has come to be expected and hoped for, that a Budget is presumed to be regarded as an instrument of economic policy.</P>
      <P>The view that this is not an economist's Budget received support from the speech of the Taoiseach when he said that the Government could, if they had so wished, have brought in this year what he called a standstill Budget.  In column 1178 of the Dáil Debates of 11th April, 1962, the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>The Government were in the position that they could have produced a no change Budget, involving no votes in the Dáil, no increases in taxation, no increases in benefits for anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why that should be regarded as a statement of something that is desirable.  It can be deduced from that statement that were it not for the pressure from the farmers' groups and the pressure from those people speaking from all sides of the House for the old age pensioners, the public service pensioners and others, we would not have had in this Budget even the ungenerous provisions which are being made for the old age pensioners, for <Col N="179" /> the public service pensioners and, to some extent, for the farmers.</P>
    <P>The general policy of the economists towards derating was brought very forcibly home to us when, in the difficult circumstances we were encountering in 1956, the Capital Advisory Committee told us and advised us, with a bland unconcern for political practicalities, that we should take away from the farmers the amounts of subventions being given to them for the relief of rates and to spend that money in other forms of assistance to the agricultural industry, on the ground that the provision of these subventions to local authorities is not directly related to increased production.  The Committee went on to say that it is an historical fact that the very substantial reliefs afforded to farmers between land purchase and relief in rates have not led to any increase in agricultural production.</P>
    <P>Doubtless, those statements were strictly accurate, but anything further removed from practical politics could not be conceived.  I cannot see any Government surviving, if they put such proposals into operation.  What this Budget means is that the Government have now brought in these proposals for derating, notwithstanding the fact that if you look back on the years from 1933 onwards, you can remember the clamorous voices from the Government Benches speaking against the large farmers who were at that time pressing for full derating.  The Government, at that time, were equally loud in stating that they would never accede to these proposals because they elected to give any relief that could be given to the small farmers.  Now they propose to give relief by way of derating which at that time they considered should not be done.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that the agricultural industry should get assistance but the form in which that assistance should be given is another matter.  I think that, on reflection, the Government will come to the conclusion that they have not in fact given any substantial relief to the farmers or any lasting relief to the farming community. <Col N="180" /> Rates have a habit of going up and they will go up again.  What the farmers want is some relief from their overheads.  They want some help to increase their production and to be in a position to meet the keen competition they have to meet at the moment and will have to meet in the future. They do not want to get rid of the rates, and they will not, except for a very short time, get rid of them by these proposals.  Next year, there will be further increases in rates and further demands by the farmers, coupled with the fact that they will want additional subventions for other purposes.  The proposal to help the farmers in this way was misconceived and will be quite useless except for a short time.</P>
    <P>It would be better for the Minister to approach this problem by tackling it locally, in order to find out what is causing the ever-increasing rates.  We have created in this country what has become almost a colossal body in the local authorities.  Their staffs are increasing daily; their activities are increasing almost hourly; and their demands are ever on the upgrade.  It might have been a very good thing if the Minister had decided to examine the whole structure of the local authority system.  It has become almost the equivalent of the national Civil Service.  This small country with its meagre resources cannot afford the large national Civil Service we are carrying at present, but on top of that, we have a never ending increase in the local authority services.  Some steps could have been taken in a practical way to relieve a lot of the unnecessary expenditure by local authorities, to cut down in some way the burden of the rates instead of adopting the temporary expedient that the Government have taken.</P>
    <P>They could have done something that might be more easily achieved and could have been achieved in a shorter time than by an examination of the local authority structure.  They could have examined into what is really causing the increase in rates and how far our expensive programme on road work is contributing to that increase. I referred to that matter when I spoke on the Vote on Account and it seems <Col N="181" /> to me that we are pouring out money to an extraordinary extent on the roads.</P>
    <P>There is perhaps an even more important field in which research would have produced fruitful results.  I think it is admitted that one of the prime causes of the increase in rates is the burden of the Health Acts on local authorities.  On this side of the House proposals were put forward, with financial arrangements made public, by which that burden could be decreased. Over the years, the Government have adhered to their system which has resulted in very heavy burdens upon the local ratepayers, an ever-increasing burden and one that, unless it is arrested, will never stop.  Would it not have been far better if, during the past 12 months since the general election, when this matter of the cost of the health services was brought into the public eye and debated in public, they had had a quick look at it to see how rapid steps could be taken to reduce the impact of the health services on the ratepayers?  But, apparently, the line of least resistance was taken because that is what the derating of agricultural land is and what I think is perhaps the most serious objection of all to the present proposal is that it does what the Minister's Department looks upon with utter horror&mdash;it creates a precedent.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, it will mean more demands for increased derating, leading inevitably to complete derating of agricultural land.  That is a topic that can be, and has been over the years, discussed hotly on both sides.  The Minister and his Party apparently have changed their attitude on that, but I think it cannot be denied that however desirable derating of agricultural land might, in theory, and in some respects, in practice, be, nevertheless, it does not bring complete relief to the small farmer or anything like the relief it brings to the large farmer.  That is one indication that this Budget is not an economist's budget.  The derating of agricultural land is almost economic heresy, but whatever views they might have and however they might justify them along the lines of the speech made by the <Col N="182" /> Taoiseach justifying these particular proposals at the present time, owing to very great difficulties that agriculture is facing abroad, whatever justification there may be for that, your official economist or financier looks with horror upon any proposal for human improvement schemes such as old age pensions or the giving of relief to civil service pensioners.  And those are the two proposals.</P>
    <P>I do not object to the Minister bringing in these proposals and however economically unsound they may be I think he was bound to bring them in this year, certainly the proposal regarding civil service and public pensioners in particular and also in regard to old age pensioners and other social classes.  There was too much demand in the country for him to overlook it but if that demand had not been there we would undoubtedly have had a standstill Budget.  If that be so why the necessity for taxation?  That is the next question that obtrudes itself in any discussion on this Budget.  We had the Minister for Finance saying, and taking pride in the fact, that revenue over the past year was very buoyant. At column 1575 of the Dáil Reports of the 10th April, 1962, in introducing the Budget he said:</P>
    <P>Tax revenue was very buoyant last year and non-tax revenue also exceeded the Budget Estimate.  The buoyancy was such that it covered the excess expenditure, as compared with the Budget Estimate, of £5.3 millions on the Supply Services and £0.54 million on Central Fund Services. It was short only £700,000 of making good the Budget adjustment of £3,000,000 for errors of estimation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had not to face claims for services he has met in this Budget I have no doubt he would have come in and said: &ldquo;The Estimates are very good and the Estimates for next year may be even better but we shall stand still this year.  We are in theory only £700,000 short.  That is only the gap. That can easily be made up.&rdquo;  I have no doubt if that were the position he would have provided for overestimation not a sum of £2,000,000, as he is <Col N="183" /> providing, but something in the region of £2,700,000 to bridge that gap and we would have been told that everything was grand.</P>
    <P>But he had to have taxation.  I believe it was deliberate policy to have taxation and that even if he could have anticipated getting additional revenue next year or by various devices known to the financier bridged the gap he said existed or would exist in consequence of the proposals in this Budget, I believe he would have introduced taxation because I think this conclusion is inescapable.  From my experience I can detect the note I have heard so often in matters of this kind&mdash;&ldquo;people are asking for services; let them see, if they want the services they must pay for them.&rdquo;  Therefore, I say these proposals for new taxation in this Budget were deliberately imposed; that no effort was made by economies, adjustments or by means other than increasing taxation to meet the expenses necessary to fulfil the proposals in the Budget. It was necessary that people should be told and that it should be brought home to them in a painful way &ldquo;if you want to increase social services you must pay for them.&rdquo;  I have no doubt, in my own mind at all events, that is the reason for the additional taxation this year and not that it could not be avoided.</P>
    <P>Would it not be possible to look at the revenue as it stands at the moment or as it stood at the end of last year?  Last year they got something like £45,000,000 more than the year before.  Do not forget&mdash;and I am afraid that it is often forgotten although the effects are still being felt every day in the ever-rising cost of living&mdash;that the Government have the benefit of something like £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 which used be used for the purpose of food subsidies to keep down the cost of living. They have had £45,000,000 in the past year and almost certainly when the PAYE system comes into full operation they will get a very considerably increased yield in income tax, more than they got last year.  No account is being taken of that.  I think it has been estimated in some speech <Col N="184" /> made by a Deputy here that £2,000,000 increase in income tax revenue will accrue in the current year from the operation of PAYE, the effect of prising income tax from people who escaped the claims before this system was devised and put into operation.</P>
    <P>There is a fruitful source of future revenue if, as we are told by the Government, this country is ever-increasing in prosperity.  The Taoiseach said we are only at the beginning of it. According to his speech we had prosperity of a kind that we never had before and we are only at the beginning of it.  Why not, in the interests of increasing our export trade and of increasing agricultural production, do without taxation this year and estimate on the increased yield from income tax that will almost certainly accrue if the Government's proposition that we are in a prosperous state and only at the beginning of prosperity is in any way based on fact? Why not take a little more in over-estimation? A sum of £3,000,000 was over-estimated last year.  That was only put out of operation or anticipated operation because of two unexpected matters which arose in the course of the financial year.</P>
    <P>One was the rise in Civil Service wages and the other was that certain requirements of the farming community, amounting to over £5,000,000, had to be met.  Surely it is fair to say that those two items will not arise in the course of this financial year, so that the amount of money involved there could easily have been charged towards the increased benefits that have been given in this Budget to the farmers and the public pensioners.</P>
    <P>But apparently no action of the sort was taken.  There was a sum of £3,000,000 for over-estimation last year.  This year only £2,000,000 is provided under that heading.  I remember the discussions on the infamous Budget of 1952 when it was said that £2,000,000 was too little as a provision for over-estimation.  But look at the amount of money that was sought to be provided in that Budget of 1952. It was millions short of the colossal <Col N="185" /> sum in the Book of Estimates this year.  When you could take £2,000,000 in over-estimation when there was only £70,000,000 to be provided, what could you take when you have £140,000,000?  Surely there could be at least £500,000 extra for over-estimation?</P>
    <P>I must say I was surprised to hear the Minister for Finance say that the loss on the abolition of the entertainments duty for this year alone would be £450,000.  That, according to my reading of the Minister's speech, represents the loss in a portion of the year only.  What will it be in a full year?  Presumably, it will be something in the region of £1,000,000.  What we are doing then, in order to give old age pensioners and others 2/6d. a week, some ungenerous allowance to other public pensioners and a not over-generous provision for farmers, is that we are doing without this pretty large sum in entertainments duty.  I should like to know from the Minister what proportion of the revenue from entertainments duty was applicable to cinemas alone and what proportion was applicable to dancehalls and other operations subject to entertainments duty.  What I really want to get at is this: if the Minister is correct, and I believe him to be correct, that the cinema industry is deserving of relief, what would it cost to give the cinema industry this relief and still retain the taxation on dancehalls?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his speech just tossed aside this question of the entertainments duty.  He said it was a bad tax and always had been a bad tax and a difficult one to administer.  I do not think that I have ever heard, with the possible exception of income tax, of any tax not having been difficult to administer, but this tax to which I refer produced a fair sum of money which would go a long way towards meeting the payment of relief to social welfare classes.</P>
    <P>I think the people who go to these dances and other such functions subject to entertainments duty could well afford to continue to pay for their amusement in order to provide a subvention that would assist the old age pensioners.  Would it not have been far <Col N="186" /> better for the dancehall proprietors and the people who attend these dances to continue to pay this tax, knowing that while they were getting their own amusement, they were helping to give very much needed assistance to their rather distressed neighbours?</P>
    <P>This matter has been treated far too lightly.  The Taoiseach tossed it aside. What we are tossing aside is something in the region of £1,000,000.  I may be wrong in that figure, but if the abolition of the tax over a portion of the year is to cost £450,000, it must be in the region of £1,000,000 in the full year.  Whatever it is, we should have been told here how much the yield is in respect of cinemas&mdash;in respect of that portion of the industry which is suffering because of competition from television and other sources.  Then relief could have been given to that section, but mere difficulty of administration should not prevent the flow into the revenue of a pretty substantial sum which could have been used to meet the extra provision for old age pensioners, public service pensioners and farmers.</P>
    <P>I think we are entitled to press the Minister to say precisely what is involved. I do not want to resort to this old controversy of whether there were political motives or otherwise in the background, or to say whether this tax was abolished because of subscriptions from dancehall proprietors, but the public are entitled to know what is the real reason.  Otherwise, they will undoubtedly remain convinced that the real reasons are political and not economic.  We are entitled to know what is involved in taking away the tax from dancehalls and other amusements of that kind, what is the amount per annum involved.  Would this tax not have helped considerably the Minister's task to do justice to these public pensioners who have been having a very thin time during the past 20 or 30 years?</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would be ungenerous of me if I did not acknowledge that the Minister has done something for these people, and I do acknowledge it.  I have been interested in these people for many years.  As I said when speaking on the Vote on Account, the only <Col N="187" /> pledge I gave during the last general election campaign was that I would do all I could for them.  They have no great political importance; their votes do not count for a whole lot, and I accordingly acknowledge that the Minister is entitled to a measure of thanks for having considered their just claims, even if not as fully as was expected.</P>
    <P>However, these people are entitled to know why it is that their claims are being met only to the extent of one-third. These people will have in the back of their minds the grievance that people who can amuse themselves at dances and other forms of entertainment have been relieved of the taxation which would have made it possible for the Minister to meet the claims of the social welfare classes much more generously.  Other people who partake of tobacco or intoxicating liquor will have to pay the amount it is proposed to extend in relief to the worse off sections of the community.</P>
    <P>Again, I acknowledge the Minister's performance of his duty in giving even 2/6d. a week.  It may be criticised as ungenerous but at least it is something. The whole question of the old age pensions should be looked at again.  If the proposals of my former colleague, Deputy Norton, in the first Social Services Bill he framed, in the inter-Party Government, had been put into operation, there would have been a great easement on the taxpayers in respect of the cost of old age pensions and other costs of that character allied to contributory and non-contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>Much of the demand for increased old age pensions arises from the fact that the system is so administered as to cause hardship and create difficulties for old age pensioners.  I suggest to the Minister that he might reconsider the whole problem.  I know that to grant even 1/- a week to the old age pensioner would cost the taxpayer a very large sum of money, and 1/- is a very small amount indeed to an old age pensioner.  Under the present system, there will undoubtedly be no thanks for any Government for increasing the old age pension by 1/-, 2/-or even 2/6.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> I remember being shocked when I was not very long in the House on hearing the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Seán T. O'Kelly, subsequently An tUachtarán, introducing his Budget proposals and giving an outline of the way he proposed to find the money for the things he was doing.  I remember him saying that he was banking on balancing his Budget in a number of ways, and in particular in one way: in the administration of old age pensions, he hoped to save so many hundreds of thousands of pounds which he needed. On reflection, that appeared to be a most extraordinary procedure.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioners are entitled to a certain amount of money, subject to a means test and they are also subject to an inquisition.  I have heard it stated again and again in this House that old age pensions are not supposed to be sufficient to maintain an old age pensioner in food and lodging.  How are they to be maintained?  Quite a number of them have a gratuity or a pension from their employers of a not very substantial character from their point of view.  Once they get the old age pension, even the employer who wishes to continue to give them that gratuity or pension either reduces it or takes it away altogether because there is no use in paying it when it is only in ease of the revenue.</P>
    <P>The Minister's officials carry out a cross-examination amounting to an inquisition: &ldquo;How much did you earn this week?  How much did your children contribute to you?  How much did anyone else give you?  What have you in the bank?  Have you any pension?&rdquo; From that point of view, there is no use in the employer continuing to pay him a pension and consequently it is taken away from him.  If the old age pensioner's children contribute anything to him, it is inquired into and calculated as part of his means. All sorts of devices have to be resorted to.  The children of old age pensioners who wish to help their parents have to give them food or clothing.  There are all sorts of devices which lead to demoralisation and sometimes a certain amount of prevarication, not to talk about lying.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's officials have <Col N="189" /> their duties to perform but I also know from personal experience that the old age pensioners are subjected to inquisitions which are sometimes torture, and some of them would prefer not to get a pension at all.  If the matter were approached in a different way, there would be less constant demands for increases.  If it could be arranged that small pensions given by former employers and contributions in cash or in kind by relatives or friends, and even some little income from doing a little work, were not taken into account in assessing their pensions, they could get them in comfort without prevarication or demoralisation, and they would not be subject to constant inquisitions.</P>
    <P>The same applies, perhaps in greater degree, to widows in receipt of non-contributory pensions.  Widows whose husbands contributed from their wages can work and earn as much as they like, and get as much income as they like, but the woman whose husband did not contribute or had not sufficiently contributed before his death, which may have been untimely, has a very small sum of money to maintain herself and her children and she is not allowed to work.  I deliberately use the words &ldquo;allowed to work&rdquo; because of the fact that every penny she gets is inquired into and taken into account as part of her income.</P>
    <P>I myself know widows who have non-contributory pensions who say they cannot work and will not work because of the annoyance and misery they go through as a result of the inquisitions that are carried out. Would it not be far better to let them work as much as they like?  Is it not good that they have the industry and the desire to work to maintain themselves and their children and to better themselves and their children?  They want to avoid the constant inquisitions: &ldquo;How many days' work did you do last week?  How much did you get?  Did you get any other contributions from this, that or the other?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They throw their hats at it and say: &ldquo;We will not work at all; it is not worth it,&rdquo; and they live not very frugally but on the wrong side of the starvation line because of the fact that any money they earn is taken into <Col N="190" /> account in assessing their pension.  If an approach were made to letting these people work, if they can, to letting old age pensioners work if they can, to letting people keep the pensions they get from their former employers and the subventions they get from their children or from good-natured people, there would be at least less constant demands for increased old age pensions and there would be really less case each year for increasing pensions.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Taoiseach's speech, I certainly gathered the impression&mdash;to me, it was implicit in his somewhat cryptic statement&mdash;that the Taoiseach and the Government would dearly like to control wages and demands for increases in remuneration. At column 1790, Volume 194 of the Official Debates, having spoken of the feeling of discontent among the farming community about the rises in wages and remuneration, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>There is at least an arguable case that if the Government have responsibility for co-ordinating all the factors affecting the nation's economic progress and can influence or regulate all the other forces bearing on the country's economic health, they should also have power and responsibility in the field of wage and salary levels.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that it had never been the policy of the Government to seek or to exercise powers of that kind but is it not implicit in what he said?</P>
    <P>There is at least an arguable case that if the Government have responsibility for co-ordinating all the factors affecting the nation's economic progress and can influence or regulate all the other forces bearing on the country's economic health, they should also have power and responsibility in the field of wage and salary levels.</P>
    <P>It is arguable but quite impossible, whatever responsibility the Government may have.  In a further statement continuing this speech on those lines, he said that:</P>
    <P>the Government have a duty to <Col N="191" /> promote widespread understanding of the national circumstances, understanding of the consequences of any particular course of action that may be proposed or in progress, and an obligation to speak clearly and honestly to the people on those matters and to encourage reasonable behaviour be every section.</P>
    <P>If that is the responsibility of the Government, to see that, to put it bluntly, unreasonable demands for increased remuneration are not made in circumstances not justified, is there not an equal, if not a stronger, obligation on the Government to see, by their policy and their action, that they do not create circumstances which will give rise, or almost inevitably give rise, to further demands for increased wages or remuneration?  Will not the results here of increased taxation inevitably lead to increases in wages?</P>
    <P>Increased taxation always bears heavily on various sections of the community.  These two taxes, the taxation on tobacco and beer, were put on because, first of all, they are very easily collected and secondly, because they bear on the largest number of the community.  That is going to increase the demands for increased wages.  There is no doubt about it.  These items of drink and tobacco enter into the calculation of the cost of living, perhaps not as very serious items but ones which are very relevant and sufficiently relevant to have increased wage demands based on them.  There is also going to be increased employment necessary and, therefore, an increased burden upon the public and the licensed trade. That is not something which the Government in present circumstances should have permitted themselves to do.  They are creating conditions by this Budget which will inevitably lead to further demands for increased wages and other remuneration.</P>
    <P>There is one section of the community to whom I should particularly like to make some reference.  It is very easy, and I realise how easy it is, for me to get up here and say that this, that, and the other should be <Col N="192" /> in this Budget.  I could have spoken eloquently on the fact that this Budget does not appear to reflect the notion that the Government have any serious realisation of their responsibility in existing circumstances in regard to education, particularly in the field of secondary and higher education in modern circumstances. However, I shall pass from that and just say a few words for the particular class in the community in whom I have been most interested all the time since I became a representative in this House, that section of the community on which you cannot put a label at the monent.  It used to be known as the middle class but you cannot label it that way now because some of the middle classes are really the aristocrats of this country.</P>
    <P>I once heard a well-known patriot say that he belonged to the lower rung of the middle classes.  That section is known as the white-collar workers, which is a misnomer and certainly is not comprehensive.  I speak for all those people who are dignified by the fact that, instead of getting wages, they get a salary.  I do not think I can define them any further than that.  Why the money which they get every month is called a salary and why that differentiates them from the people getting what are called wages every week, I do not know.  They comprise that vast section of the community, the selfemployed, shopkeepers, clerks, typists, and all those people living on their savings, all that class in the community who have not got their hands out to this Government or any Government looking for subventions but asking only that conditions be created which will not make matters more difficult for them.  These people own their own houses and they have mortgages on them.  They employ every possible device to own their own houses; yet we cannot give them the little relief that would be involved in doing away with Schedule A tax, as it has been done away with in England.</P>
    <P>The Minister can correct me in this if I am wrong, but I understand that the Income Tax Commission has recommended that that tax be done away with.  It is quite unjustifiable.  It <Col N="193" /> is a big burden on the class of people about whom I am speaking.  The tax I am talking about is Schedule A on owner-occupied houses which are subject to 5/4ths for income tax purposes. The poor law valuation is increased to 5/4ths so as to produce a national income.  I described it here many years ago as the Revenue Commissioners' nightmare.  At all events, there is no reason why that little relief should not be given to them to ease the burdens placed on them over the years.  The cost of living has gone up and will continue to go up.  The cost of postage and telephones has increased.  For commercial travellers, who come within this class, the cost of their transport has gone up, whether they travel on the railways, by bus or in their own private cars.  These people try to put aside, for their old age and for their families, moneys by way of savings through insurance policies, and they find that, having spent years paying large premiums, the money they eventually collect as the proceeds of their policies has been devalued. Money is going down in value every day.</P>
    <P>The cost of coal, electricity and all the necessaries of life are going up. Very few people have any concern for that class of the community.  We have in this House many people who can speak for the farming community as the basis, as it is, of all our prosperity and on which everybody relies. The workers have trade union representatives in the Dáil and other sections of the community are represented here, but very few can speak for that class of the community who have been undergoing severe hardship during and since the war.  I am not asking for money for them by way of subvention.  I have drawn attention in this House repeatedly to the fact that, while industrialists with their tariffs and provisions for depreciation of their machinery are well looked after, those people have to rely on their health and bodily vigour as their sole machinery to keep them going and have nothing but this which is an essential part of their livelihood.</P>
    <P>It would be well if the Minister would take some opportunity of giving <Col N="194" /> some easement to that class remembering that they have not got their hands out for money.  Hardly any other section of the community is not looking for money: &ldquo;Give us something; what are you doing for us?&rdquo; The Minister knows the cry at election time: &ldquo;What did you ever do for us?&rdquo; They are only asking that you refrain from increasing their difficulties.  They got a little relief last year by way of income tax relief but all the other elements I have mentioned are pressing hard upon them and on behalf of that section of the community, whom in fact I largely represent in my constituency, I once again make an appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have already spoken like a voice crying in the wilderness about death duties.  I noticed with pleasure that the yield from death duties this year has shown a slight tendency to go down; may it go down altogether.  It would be good business for this country if we did away with these duties altogether.  At least, from the point of view of the people for whom I am speaking, I would ask the Minister to increase the relief from death duties for the savings they have accumulated with painful effort over the years.</P>
    <P>There is one last matter I want to mention.  I very much dislike doing so.  Last year, one Deputy made the basis of his speech an attack upon the misery and ruin brought on the country by the inter-Party Government.  I had not intended to speak along the lines I did at that time, but he provoked me. I dislike speaking about the inter-Party Government and what they have done because that is past history.  The reason I gave at that time was that if I did not make some comment on it, it might be interpreted as an admission.  For the same reason, I am making one or two comments on the Taoiseach's statement.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said, by way of interpolation, at column 1793, of the Official Debates:</P>
    <P>The damage that was done to this country in the last disastrous year of the Coalition Government, 1956, was not the pulling down of industrial <Col N="195" /> employment or farmers' incomes.  It was the destruction of the confidence of our people in the future of our country.</P>
    <P>That is a statement I cannot let pass. It is a statement that was irresponsibly made by the Taoiseach.  If he had taken any steps to inquire if there was any truth in that, he could have inquired from his own officials as to the basis upon which Government policy was framed at that time, and if he had any decency and candour, he would have left that out or at least noted there was no truth in it.</P>
    <P>I want to make this comment on it now.  The Ministers of this Government should realise there are no political tricks&mdash;there were at one time&mdash; now in making allegations of that sort against the actions of the inter-Party Government.  The Deputy who made that attack in this House just a few short months before the general election lost his seat.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would take a warning also. There were no political tricks in it.  He lost his seat.  It should be realised it would be far better, from the point of view of creating public confidence in this Government as well as in any Government, that Ministers, and particularly the Taoiseach, should refrain from making irresponsible statements of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the minor criticisms levelled at the Government, the main constructive criticism I could gather from so much of the debate as I have heard and from the published reports of Deputies' contributions was that the Budget did not contribute sufficiently to a setting out of what our economic policy ought to be.  I consider this Budget as a follow on of previous Budgets introduced by the present Minister for Finance.  Each of these was a balanced Budget and, therefore, very desirable in the interest of any sound economy.  But Budgets must be taken as a whole, and as a whole they show a very steady rate of progress in the economy since 1957-58.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as any Budget is expected to <Col N="196" /> analyse our economic position, to formulate Government policy and stimulate public endeavour to meet existing and future economic problems, this Budget admirably serves its purpose. In so far as it is an analysis of our present economic position it is a story of expansion, a story of growth in our national income and a story of the raising of the standard of living of our people.  I am not trying to suggest that the results in any one of these categories have been spectacular, but I repeat they have been steady and forward.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to some of the minor criticisms.  The first we had was, of course, the alleged small amount this Budget was able to contribute to existing social welfare benefit rates.  In particular the criticism was made that enough was not given to old age pensioners. If we examine that criticism, in relation to the performance of those who made it <i>vis-á-vis</i> what is being done in this Budget, we see that much of the criticism was made with tongues in cheeks.  What has been done this year compares more than favourably with what was done in the whole term of office of each of the Coalition combinations of Ministers for Social Welfare and Ministers for Finance.  It compares more than favourably with what was done by Deputy Norton and Deputy McGilligan when they were Ministers in the first Coalition Government and by Deputy Corish and Deputy Sweetman in their whole term in the second Coalition Government. For example, the net increase given to old age pensioners in the whole of each of these two three-year terms was 2/6d., compared with the single yearly contribution this year of 2/6d. in the same direction.  If I break down the figures for non-contributory old age pensions, there has been 8/6d. in increases since 1957 against 2/6d. by Deputy Corish in his full three-year term of office and 2/6d. by Deputy Norton in his full period of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I always give the Minister credit for being truthful, but if he examines those figures he will find they are not right.  In 1948 there was an increase and in 1951 there was <Col N="197" /> an increase.  Both of those increases are more than the figure the Minister has mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected. Unfortunately, I have had these figures extracted for me, but I shall have them checked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1951 Budget, there was another 2/6d.  Perhaps the Minister and I will both check and whoever is wrong will apologise.  Is that not fair enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It was suggested that with £8,000,000 extra revenue, more might have been done, but it was conveniently forgotten that this £8,000,000 had to take into account a figure of £5½ million, representing the eighth round salary increase given to public servants generally, as well as the rates relief for farmers and other necessary increases given in this Budget.</P>
      <P>I want to deal mainly in the course of what remarks I have to make with the general economic position and the general employment position that obtains in the country compared with what it was when the last Coalition left office.  Deputy Costello has just objected to remarks made by the Taoiseach when he referred to the effects that the last disastrous years of the Coalition had on our economy. Whether the Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; or not, I do not think anybody can deny that from 1955 onwards, for three or four years the economy was going downhill at a very steady rate.  In the winter months of 1956-57, the weekly figures on the unemployment register were in the region of 95,000, sometimes exceeding even that figure.  That figure has been steadily reduced and now stands at something over 50,000.  There had been a steady decrease year by year since 1958.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> With regard to these serious effects on our economy, I might be permitted to quote from an independent source which described these years as a depression.  That is the report set out in the economic survey by the Organisation for European Co-operation and Development in the current year.  It refers to these three years as years of depression.  I refer to paragraph 19 on page 12 of this report, as I say, from an outside authority, an authority with no axe to grind and no internal political point of view to put forward in this country:</P>
    <P>By 1961, the number of workers in manufacturing surpassed the previous peak in 1955 so that the decline due to the three years of depression after 1955 had been more than made good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>They came in half way through that period, but, as I have said, the country was steadily on the decline: emigration was rising; unemployment was at its peak.  It is not easy for any Government to arrest a trend of that nature, much less to reverse engines, but I think we succeeded admirably in stopping that trend and reversing the direction in which the country was going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you accentuated it and that paragraph 16 of the same report shows how you accentuated it.  I do not want to interrupt the Minister rudely.  What you did was deliberately to bring down the public capital programme from 1957-1958 and that is what accentuated it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's word.  There was a shortage of capital moneys.  The local authorities were unable to fulfil their capital programmes. However, my colleague, the Minister for Local Government, can deal more knowledgeably and with greater authority with that subject than I can.  In regard to the trend that had started in 1955, right in the middle of the Coalition term, one would normally expect that in their second year of office, the fruits of their policy would begin to have effect.  The fruits of their policy did begin to have effect but in the reverse direction, as far as our economy is concerned.</P>
      <P>With 95,000 on the unemployment register and with other difficulties confronting our businessmen, our manufacturers and our farmers, it was not easy to reverse that trend, but it was reversed and particularly since 1958 when the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> was published.  I do not think it can be repeated too often that the rate of growth of our national income at that time or before that time was about one per cent.  A target was set in that <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> which envisaged an increase of two per cent.  In the result, there has been an average increase of over 4½ per cent. since then.  Unemployment has gone down considerably but what is more important, employment has been on the increase.  Again I refer to an independent report, that is, of the OECD which in the passage I have just read has substantiated that fact when it refers to the increase in manufacturing employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reading from paragraph 19, table 5, which shows that from 1955 to 1958, there was a decline from 191,000 to 183,000. From 1958, there was a steady increase up to 197,000 estimated in the current year.  The overall figures for employment, that is, including <Col N="201" /> agriculture, have admittedly decreased since then.  However, what I am trying to establish is that we are going in the right direction.  A series of balanced Budgets have produced that result and there is no reason why a continued rate of growth in the population which has been on the decline so seriously will not be maintained and that we will not be able to take up that increase in gainful employment.</P>
      <P>The latest figures available to the OECD observes indicated that in 1961&mdash;I quote from paragraph 22 at page 16 of Economic Surveys by the OECD&mdash;jobs were being created outside agriculture &mdash; most of them in manufacturing&mdash;at the rate of about 13,000 a year, or 10,000 more than the estimated decline in the agricultural population.  The report says:</P>
      <P>As a result, net emigration fell to 25,000, or a figure equal to the natural increase in the population. If the number of new jobs created can be maintained at about this rate, Ireland can look forward to a rising population.</P>
      <P>It gives me the greatest of pleasure to be able to indicate to the House that the expectations are that the number of new jobs can be so maintained. The number of proposals for new industries before An Foras Tionscal at the present time indicate that, arising out of these proposals, new jobs of that order will be provided. I am also happy to say that the number of new proposals coming forward, and their size, have been on the increase.  Therefore, we can look forward to a steady attraction of new industrial activity to the country in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert to the population trend, the figures that OECD published in March of this year were slightly out of date and it is satisfactory to note that the most recent figures indicate an even better picture still.  They refer to a net emigration of 25,000 for the year under review but, if we take the 12 months between February 1961 and February 1962, the net emigration figure was down further to 22,500.  Therefore, the net increase in <Col N="202" /> population was some 3,000 or 4,000 in those 12 months.</P>
    <P>As far as industrial output is concerned, there has been a rapid increase in industrial production.  It was evident in 1960 and it has continued through 1961.  For the year 1961, base 1953 equalling 100, the output of manufacturing industry was 134 compared with 123.5 in 1960 and 114.8 in 1959.</P>
    <P>The industrial employment figures show that the average number of persons engaged in manufacturing industries was estimated as exceeding 155,000 in 1961 as compared with less than 150,000 in 1960&mdash;a net increase of over 5,000 and, as I said, unemployment declined from the disastrous figure I mentioned already&mdash;95,000 in the winter months of 1960.  These figures, of course, decreased steadily with the growth of seasonal employment starting in February, perhaps, of 1957, but since then, there has been a steady decline and that has been continued as between this year and last year, when, at the end of February, 1962, there were 56,500 on the unemployment register as compared with 60,000 at the end of February 1961.</P>
    <P>The reason I give these comparative figures is to indicate the steady rate of growth to which I referred at the outset of my remarks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, in his short statement after the Budget was introduced, made a specific criticism in relation to readaptation of our industry.  He said that too little was done and too late.  I cannot remember now whether that was in his speech in the House or in his speech on television.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough&mdash;&ldquo;Too late and too little&rdquo; rather in that order, I should say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Incidentally, the Deputy used October as the date of the establishment of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  He asked whether it was October and I nodded acquiesence.  I have since checked and the truth is that the Committee was set up immediately our application was made for membership of the Common Market in July and, in fact, there was already an embryo committee in existence <Col N="203" /> for some weeks.  However, I do not know to what extent his remarks about &ldquo;too late&rdquo; would be affected by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Two years still too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>However, if we take &ldquo;too little&rdquo; as being the main point or one of the main points of his criticism, he said the giving in this Budget of a mere £100,000 to help industry was far too little.  That in itself is too sweeping a criticism.  This £100,000 was the sum estimated to cover the initial allowances for industrial plant and equipment being raised from 20 per cent. to 40 per cent. and on industrial buildings from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent.  That was a very rough estimate. It could have been only a shot in the dark.  I can assure the Deputy that if industrial firms modernise their buildings and their plant for the improvement of their existing lines of production, the Government will be very happy to meet whatever is the cost.</P>
      <P>But, over and above that, the Committee on Industrial Organisation in their interim report made a recommendation much more than just that, which the Government very readily adopted and which was not perhaps a proper subject for the Minister to announce in his Budget Statement. They recommended loans with waiver of interest payments and deferment of capital repayments over a period of five years towards the financing of re-equipment of industrial undertakings within their existing spheres of activity.  The Government readily agreed to accept that recommendation and it will be fully implemented.</P>
      <P>These provisions will, it is believed, provide a great stimulus for industrial firms to re-equip their existing plant. The waiver of interest for five years and the deferment of capital repayments for the same period will be, I suggest, a tremendous fillip to industrial firms to modernise factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, the Committee recommended that the Industrial Grants Act be amended so as to enable An Foras Tionscal to make <Col N="204" /> available grants for industries which make a switch of activities within their organisations.  A &ldquo;switch&rdquo; could be interpreted in many ways.  If I may give a simple example, if an industry produces three main lines of commodities&mdash;let us call them A, B and C&mdash;and if they decide that they are better equipped to produce commodity A more economically than commodities B and C and that these latter two commodities may be doubtful ones in Common Market conditions, then, if they decide to replace their plant and machinery by which they have been hitherto producing commodities B and C and bring in new plant to concentrate on the production of commodity A, grants will be made available to them.  That is a simple illustration of what a switch is, but, of course, there may be many degrees of switch.</P>
    <P>Again, as the House is aware, this interim report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation was published on the day preceding the Budget.  It was made available to the Government a couple of short weeks before it was published.  But, nevertheless, the Government acted quickly, and expeditiously, and were able to announce that these recommendations had been accepted.</P>
    <P>In so far as economic policy should have been planned by the Budget, and in so far as up-to-date problems should have been solved, I think this Budget has met the situation very admirably.  Deputy Costello referred to the Taoiseach's speech and he implied, in relation to one extract from it, that the Taoiseach advocated the regulating of wages by the Government. The implication was, Deputy Costello said, that the Government would like to control wages.  I want to take this opportunity of assuring Deputy Costello that that is not, and never was, the intention of this Government.</P>
    <P>There was a time when it was thought the Government might have to give consideration to the wage situation. During the war years there was a certain degree of control exercised over wage increases.  To allow wages to have increased without proper regard <Col N="205" /> to the effect on the economy would have been disastrous in the post-war years.  It is not the intention of this Government to control wages.  The policy of this Government is that wage levels should be agreed between employer and worker and should have regard to the interest of the economy. Increases should be granted to workers in relation to increases in productivity in order that conditions of inflation, harmful to the economy, will be avoided.</P>
    <P>It was the Fianna Fáil Government who were responsible for the Industrial Relations Act of 1936.  That is more or less our charter for the settlement of industrial disputes.  Naturally, there were certain stresses and strains and suggestions have been made recently that the position ought now to be reviewed because of some rather serious disputes which have taken place, disputes that were the subject matter of Labour Court investigations and recommendations not accepted ultimately.  The Government immediately set about a review of the Industrial Relations Act, urging all the time that workers' organisations and employers' organisations should take a major part in whatever review would be undertaken and in whatever recommendations would emerge.  It was very gratifying to learn that our promptings in that direction had been accepted and, as the House is aware, a conference has now been arranged between the representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and representatives of the Federated Union of Employers.</P>
    <P>The Government are prepared to give every possible assistance, but the Government hope that this body will act objectively and independently, without help from the Government, in producing a formula which will, at least, lay the foundation for the manner in which wage negotiations will be conducted and agreements made in future.  I have every confidence that there will be goodwill on both sides. I know there is goodwill.  I have every confidence that the conference will produce something really worthwhile in the interests of happy labour relations in the future and, above all, in the <Col N="206" /> interests of our advancing economy. The Government are prepared to give whatever assistance is necessary, but that assistance will be confined to, perhaps, economic statistical advice.</P>
    <P>The Government are also prepared to give clerical and other assistance of that nature to help bring the initial conference, at any rate, to a successful conclusion so that some machinery will be provided in which negotiations can be conducted successfully and effectively. Deputy Costello's interpretation of the Taoiseach was really, I think, a hypothesis.  I do not think it was fair of him to impute to the Taoiseach that it was the intention of the Government to control wages.  The intention of the Government is far from that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello also spoke of the position of salaried workers.  He referred to clerical workers and the self-employed and to the fact that he, perhaps, represented them to a great extent in this House.  Many interests are represented in this House.  Workers' interests and farmers' interests are represented.  Many can claim to represent other interests, among them the interests of the white collar workers. It is the hope of all of us that we may ease the particular burdens of those whom we represent.  The increases in taxation for which provision is made in this Budget cannot, I think, despite what Deputy Costello says, have added much to the burdens of white collar workers.  It is true that the white collar worker will have to pay 2d. more for his packet of cigarettes, 1d. more for his pint and, if he drinks a half-one, 1d. more also.  I do not think Deputy Costello is really serious in his suggestion that we have imposed a heavy additional burden on these classes. These white collar workers are not represented by organisations and they are, therefore, the care of every Deputy in this House, just as much as, or, perhaps, more so, than they are the care of Deputy Costello.  It is the claim of every one of us who represents them to some degree that we ensure that their burdens are not added to, so far as that can be avoided.  I suggest most of these people are glad to make whatever sacrifices they are called upon to <Col N="207" /> make in order to provide increased benefits for social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>I have indicated what the position is by the figures I have quoted.  First of all, there has been a succession of balanced Budgets, a realistic appraisal of our economic needs.  The Government have been able to show a record of a steadily improving economy each year, declining emigration figures, a position in which net disemployment on the land has been more than compensated for by the creation of additional industrial jobs.  We have reached the stage we have been striving to reach, the stage in which our net emigration figures have been exceeded by the natural increase in our population. It is the intention of the Government that jobs will be available to provide not only for that present increase but for every future increase.</P>

      <P>It is not necessary for any member of my Party to spend any length of time answering the feeble arguments put forward in support of this Budget.  Various Government speakers have been asking us to give <Col N="208" /> them credit for progress which they say has been made in the past few years.  They have been appealing to us to recognise the progress which the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> has brought about in the past few years.  They even quote figures and various booklets to support their arguments.</P>
      <P>We cannot ignore the plain facts of the matter.  Booklets published by banks and big industrial concerns make good reading from the point of view of Government policy.  However, when rural Deputies return to their constituencies and see at first hand the real situation they know what weight can be given to such publications.  For some years past, emigration and unemployment have been at a high level.  I cannot understand how any Fianna Fáil Deputy can allege that the country is in a prosperous position, that we are going in the right direction, and ignore our emigration and unemployment figures.  Surely that demonstrates a complete disregard on their part for the human element in the economy?</P>
      <P>When we in the Labour Party examine the economy of this country, or of any country, the most important aspect is population.  We can say that the economy is sound when we note that the population is increasing, that more people are at work and that the standard of living of that increasing population is rising.  We feel that the attitude of the Government is materialistic when they judge the progress of the economy merely on production figures and the balance of payments position and completely disregard the reasons for which we are here.  We are elected by the people to make this country such that it will benefit each and every one in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can speak of the problems because I see them every day of the week. Take my constituency of Kilkenny. At a meeting of Kilkenny Corporation about a fortnight ago, I would say that the most prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party on that body declared that business in the town in the present year could not be <Col N="209" /> worse.  He said, to use his own words, that the small shopkeepers of the town had their backs to the wall.  I agree with him in that remark. Unemployment and emigration throughout that constituency have never been as bad and money has never been as scarce.</P>
    <P>At after-dinner speeches, and on other occasions, Government speakers have painted a gloomy picture of what we could expect in this Budget. They sought to give the impression that the whole cause of the gloom was the eighth round of wage increases. Other sections of the community got increased incomes over the same period and nearly all of them got a larger percentage than the workingclass population.</P>
    <P>Over the same period, company profits went up 12 per cent. and bank profits went up 13 per cent.  It is not surprising that the banks in their various annual reports, especially in those issued early this year, sing the praises of the present Government. That is easy to understand, when they make such a big profit in one year and when we consider that most of the forecasts of difficulty ahead were because of the eighth round increase, which represents 7.3 per cent.  It is interesting to note that the increase so far in the eighth round in two years, 1961 and 1962, barely exceeds the percentage increase in company profits in 1961 alone.  In these same speeches, Ministers and other people took the opportunity to lecture the workers on productivity.  They were told they must produce more.</P>
    <P>Since 1948, the output per worker has increased by 50 per cent.  While the actual real earnings of the worker have increased by only one-third.  The increase in income under the eighth round has been matched by a similar increase in productivity.  Only three or so years ago, there was the same talk about the round of increases that was going on at that time.  All kinds of forecasts were made similar to the ones made earlier this year but quite the reverse was the case.  We are not alone in this country as regards wage increases.  Other countries on the <Col N="210" /> Continent, particularly those with which we will be in competition if we, are admitted to the European Economic Community, have increased the wages of their workers considerably and by a far greater percentage than we have done in this country.</P>
    <P>Only a few minutes ago, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that the extra taxation in the Budget was intended to offset the cost of the increases to civil servants and other Government employees.  It was even said last night that people were clapping the Government on the back for the way in which they had found the money to pay these increases.  When we consider that under the eighth round of wage increases the amount of increased taxation collected under PAYE will be about £5,000,000 and that the cost to the State of the increases to civil servants, Gardaí and Army for 1962-63 will be about £6,000,000 it will be seen that the eighth round has been a great benefit to the Minister for Finance in framing the Budget and not, as he and his colleagues try to make out, a serious handicap.</P>
    <P>Considerable stress has been laid on the fact that the Labour Party voted against the increased taxation to provide increases for social service recipients.  We voted against that taxation because we did not believe it was being levied in a just manner and because we believe it is unnecessary to a great extent.  Last year the British National Institute of Economic and Social Research segregated the taxation in sixteen European and four other countries, including this country. This country was among the three who took the least from people with incomes of over £1,000 to £10,000 a year.</P>
    <P>In the last two Budgets, substantial relief has been given to the people with the higher incomes, those with over £2,500 a year.  It is a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  The Minister for Finance takes pride in the fact that indirect taxation is very successful and gives the impression that he will gradually shift from direct to indirect taxation.  This would hit hardest at the poorest section of the community.  It would mean that the rich man would pay the same amount <Col N="211" /> of taxation as the poorest old age pensioner in the country.  That is why the Labour Party are opposing and will oppose taxation of that kind.</P>
    <P>We have also been criticised by the Minister for Finance for voting against, as he alleges, the 2/6 for the old age pensioners.  We voted against it because we did not think it adequate to meet the needs of these people.  I am inclined to doubt the Minister's method of approach to deciding how much should be given to these people. How does he decide that the amount to be given is sufficient?  Speaking in Enniscorthy the other night he said he thought the amount given was sufficient because another Government at another time did not give as much.  I do not think that is the way the Minister should look at the matter.  He should look at the needs of these people at the present time which are different from what they were in 1948, 1952 or 1953. To judge an increase as good because it is better than what was given then shows the narrowminded way in which the Minister approaches this problem. He should judge the increases to be given on the needs of these people at the present time.</P>
    <P>If he had done that instead of going back and giving a little more than was given many years ago and then telling us what a good fellow he is, the old age pensioners would have got more than 2/6.  I hope that these increases will not be taken into account in calculating what amount of home assistance these people will get from the local authorities.  Some of them get 5/- in home assistance and I hope this 2/6, when they do get it, will not be deducted from that amount.  I hope the same will apply to the Old IRA pensioners who are under a very strict means test.  I hope it will not be given with one hand and taken away with the other.  I shall concede to the Minister for Social Welfare that there are various administrative difficulties in trying to get books and other matters adjusted so that this increase may be paid on 1st August next, but I do not think there would be any administrative difficulty in paying a double week's benefit or a lump sum of, say, £3 on <Col N="212" /> 1st August to cover the period during which these people must wait for the increase.</P>
    <P>Since I came to this House, I have heard much from the Government side about a certain Government that took 1/- off the old age pensioners almost 40 years ago.  I do not want to go back that far.  I am dealing with the present, but I maintain that the present Government have emulated that action.  They said it was a very niggardly thing to do at that time but the fact is that it has also happened in 1962.  It may not be as obvious, but that 1/- a week is being taken off from 10th April until 1st August.</P>
    <P>The old age pensioner must pay a few extra pennies each week for cigarettes, and for a pint&mdash;if he takes one &mdash;and again, if he writes a few letters to daughters or sons in England or America, it costs a few extra pennies. It all adds up to 1/- a week of which those old people are being deprived until 1st August.  It is bad enough that they must wait to get the 2/6d. but in the meantime it is very niggardly that this 1/- should be taken from them, just as niggardly as the action denounced by Fianna Fáil speakers when they spoke on the Fine Gael motion this year.</P>
    <P>We are not satisfied that the country is in a sound position.  We cannot agree with the Government on that while human beings are living in conditions that are below what should be considered normal.  Only last week at the Christus Rex Conference in Galway an appeal went out to restore the human element to the economy, to put back man in his proper place in it.  That is the purpose of our existence, so to order our economy that all our people will have an opportunity to earn their livelihood and use their initiative so that our population will increase and the standard of living rise at the same time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going on to discuss the Budget itself I want to refer to a matter raised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in respect of which I challenged him at the time. It is, perhaps, well that I should put the facts on record in relation to the <Col N="213" /> matter as the Minister and I agreed whichever of us was wrong would subsequently withdraw.  Here are the facts and, when the Minister has the opportunity of reading them in the Dáil debates, I have no doubt that being, as I believe, a man of honour he will come into the House and apologise.</P>
      <P>He was referring to social welfare benefits and old age non-contributory pensions and he suggested that the increase that was being given in this Budget was the same as the total increase that had been given in either of the two periods of the previous Governments.  The facts are quite simple.  They are these: Fianna Fáil was in office for a long period.  No change was made by Fianna Fáil in old age pensions at any time from the time they came into office in 1932 until they went out in 1948.  Old age pensions remained at exactly the same level in that period with the exception that during the war years they introduced a supplementary allowance of 2/6 in the rural areas.  I am not absolutely certain but I think it was something more in the urban areas.  It is with the rural areas I am concerned in Kildare and hence it is the rural figures I have in front of me.  In 1947, when Fianna Fáil went out of office, in rural areas the old age pension remained at 10/-, the figure at which it had been since 1928 before Fianna Fáil came into office with the addition of the 2/6 supplementary allowance.</P>
      <P>The inter-Party Government came into office in 1948 and consolidated the temporary allowance of 2/6 into the pension and, in addition, gave in the 1948 Budget an increase of 5/- in the old age pensions in rural Ireland.  In the Budget introduced by Deputy McGilligan in 1951&mdash;and for which Fianna Fáil subsequently disclaimed any responsibility&mdash;the old age pension was further increased by another 2/6. It was again increased by 2/6 by me in 1955.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving out the benefit that there was in the element of consolidation of the temporary allowance into the permanent pension, counting that as having been there or being there, in the two periods of inter-Party Government <Col N="214" /> old age pensions for rural Ireland were increased by 10/- a week.  Now, let us look at the picture of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke for Fianna Fáil.  In 1952, Fianna Fáil increased the pension by 1/6; in 1957 by 1/- and in 1959 by 2/6; in 1960 by 1/-; in 1961 by 1/6 and now a further 2/6 increase is proposed in this Budget.  A very simple sum in arithmetic adds up those increases to 10/-.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is, therefore, that in so far as rural Ireland is concerned, the total of the increases in old age non-contributory pensions between the two Governments in the period since the war has been exactly the same in each case&mdash;10/- including this Budget.  Those are the facts.  They are unassailable and are there on the records for anyone who takes the trouble to go back over the figures.  I have no doubt the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he verifies those figures, will find they are correct and that he will come back into the House and withdraw the suggestion he made a few minutes ago.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to go into detail or to go back on history, but the Minister mentioned certain figures which require to be corrected for the record.  He purported to bolster up his allegations with a quotation from Paragraph 19 of the OECD Report.  The difficulties of 1956 arose, as we all now know, from three things.  First of all, there was the worsening in the terms of trade &mdash;the manner in which the price we could get internationally for the goods we were producing went down while the price we had to pay for the goods we imported went up.  The second thing was the fact that savings declined substantially&mdash;the rate of savings and the savings themselves.  The third thing was that there was an increase in incomes in 1955 which was not matched by an equivalent increase in production.  I shall have something to say later in relation to the Budget itself and to its lack of any contribution towards encouraging an increase in savings to become effective this year.</P>
    <P>In so far as the third point I have mentioned is concerned&mdash;the fact that the increase in incomes was not <Col N="215" /> matched by an equivalent increase in production&mdash;we had no less a person than the Taoiseach himself saying that was one of the fundamental causes of the difficulties experienced in 1956 and that the same thing was prevalent in the economy at the present time.  I do not want to go into that at this stage. I may do so later on.  But the absence of any real income policy in relation to production is apparent and I do want to say that while those were the causes responsible for the commencement of the difficulties of that year, it is abundantly apparent now that the improvement in our balance of payments and international trading position which arose and had arisen, as the Minister for Finance admitted, in May of 1957, was not taken advantage of.</P>
    <P>It is undoubted&mdash;I do not want to minimise it or deny it in any way&mdash; that the difficulties in 1956 in our international trading position meant that a restrictive policy had to be adopted here to offset them but where the vital mistake was made was when the restrictionist policy was not lifted as soon as the international payments position became balanced in 1957, as the Minister for Finance has acknowledged. Instead of the restrictionist policy being lifted as the OECD Report made clear, it was accentuated by the Fianna Fáil Government after they came back to office.  It was accentuated partly because they had belittled the problem.  They said during the election campaign that they would wave a magic want and lift all restrictions, but when they came back the people found they had no magic want and that none of the restrictions was lifted.  The result was that the resurgence of confidence which had begun when the new policy on imports was announced in 1956 disappeared.</P>
    <P>If we look at the public capital programme, we will see it was deliberately depressed in 1957, 1958 and 1959 by Fianna Fáil and that there was that deliberate depressing of the economy by the Government which made it impossible for the economy to get any resurgence immediately after <Col N="216" /> we had got equilibrium in our balance of payments, as the Minister for Finance has admitted we had achieved in 1957.  I absolve the Minister for Industry and Commerce from any attempt deliberately to lie&mdash;I do not think he is that sort of man&mdash;but I think he is too naïve and, perhaps some of his less honest colleagues put before him some of the figures he has used to prove his case.  They prove exactly the opposite.  They prove why it was that our difficulties were accentuated in 1957 and 1958.</P>
    <P>Cork Corporation, of which the Minister for Industry and Commerce was a member, was admitted, by a deliberate policy by me, to drawings from the Local Loans Fund, and the amounts spent by Cork Corporation on housing in each of the three years from 1955 were, for the record: 1955, £702,158; 1956, £729,948; 1957, £758,585.  That was the last year I was responsible for, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce pointed out. Then Fianna Fáil came back, and this is why I referred to Table IV of the O.E.C.D. Report.  We find, as a result of the Fianna Fáil administration, that in their first year the amount made available to Cork Corporation fell to £638,986.  In the second year they depressed it to £512,663 and they have depressed it still further every year since.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce will refresh his memory he will find that the figures I have given are the correct ones and that the position is as the OECD Report made clear&mdash;that the reduction in the public capital programme by Fianna Fáil accentuated the difficulties and made it so difficult for the economy to revive after Fianna Fáil got back.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Lemass was at this time in the Dublin Corporation.  I will admit that he was at that time a rather brash youngster who did not know what he was talking about and was, perhaps, being fed on statements and figures by people who were trying to mislead him.  However, the fact was that when Deputy Noel Lemass was saying as a councillor and, I think, as a Deputy, that the Corporation were not getting enough money for housing, they were, in fact, getting £1,500,000 <Col N="217" /> more than they received in the first year after Fianna Fáil came back. Again, the figures are worth putting on record.  In 1955, Dublin Corporation got £4,622,195; in 1956, it was £4,041,587, and in 1957, it was £3,625,694.  Then there is the change in policy to which the OECD report refers.  In 1958, the figure fell to £2,165,045 and it went down to £1,847,956 in 1959.</P>
    <P>Equally, other figures are there to be seen, but, as I say, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have an opportunity again of reading these figures in the Official Report, and can verify from his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, that they are correct, truthful and accurate. I hope that, having done so, he will not repeat, as I believe he did innocently today, two falsehoods in relation to non-contributory pensions and housing expenditure.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy T.F. O'Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on 10th April, I mentioned in my opening remarks that I was an unrepentant supporter of the Health Act.  I was speaking as an individual member of a Party and as one who took an active part in endeavouring to secure the passage through this House of the 1953 Health Bill.  At that time, I said I felt it was a step forward towards providing the medical services which the people of the country need.  Everything I have <Col N="218" /> learned since then satisfies me that it was indeed a step forward, and one in which I am very proud to have taken an active part.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion when speaking on this Estimate, I said that much of the criticism which comes both by way of discussion and by way of articles in the newspapers arises from the fact that many, if not almost all, of the critics are ill-informed as to the conditions of the Health Act and the privileges and rights that can be secured under it.  The principal offenders are members of the local authorities.  One would believe that they had never read through the provisions of the 1953 Health Act because of the confusion in their minds about the groups of people who are served by the various sections of the Act.  It is quite common to hear county councillors and members of health authorities in general, and even some Deputies, informing people that they are entitled to medical cards if they have incomes of less than £800 per year.  Of course that is completely wrong, just as it is completely wrong to say that unless you have a medical card, you will get no service under the Health Act.</P>
      <P>As we know it since 1953, the Health Act covers the total population of this country in a rough percentage of 30 per cent, medical card holders, 55 per cent, middle income group, who are either people with a lesser income than £800 per year or with a valuation of farm land of £50, and then there is the upper group of 15 per cent, roughly who are over those figures of £50 valuation or £800 per year income.  We are all pretty clear about the first group, that is, the medical card holders.  We are all pretty clear as to what entitlements under the Acts are theirs, and theirs free, with certain exceptions where portions of the Acts have not as yet been brought fully into force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Parliamentary Questions tabled yesterday by, I think, Deputy O'Higgins and answered by the Minister illustrate the point about such things as hearing aids.  It does not necessarily follow that because <Col N="219" /> you hold a medical card, you are entitled to a hearing aid.  If you are a holder of a medical card and can prove your need of a hearing aid, it can be supplied by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with the various defects as I see them in the Act, I should like to deal with just one part of a problem that appears to be arising in the country.  I refer to the parades by agricultural ratepayers and farmers that have taken place during the past year, mainly in connection with the demand made by the organisations that the cost of the Health Act should be a national charge rather than a charge on the rates.  I should like to be recorded as emphatically rejecting that request.  It would be deplorable if the moneys required for the Health Act should be levied through forms of taxation rather than as it done under the present system of party through taxation and partly from rate contributions.</P>
    <P>I would instances my own constituency, the city and county of Waterford, where prior to the 1953 Health Act and after its implementation, the standard of the health services given there was as high as it is in any part of Ireland.  Unfortunately, there are other areas which, because of their desire to keep down the rates, failed to provide the money necessary for that high standard of service.  If a change took place and they became a national charge, we would have the Minister announcing in the House that a certain sum of money would be earmarked for the health services of the country as a whole, and it would result in the Minister being forced to devote to these backward areas, which in the past failed to give these services for economy reasons, the major portion of the money.</P>
    <P>The result would be that the counties and areas that had the foresight and the good sense to provide first-class equipment and services for their people would have to do with a lesser amount of money until the backward areas were brought up to the national level.  It would also mean that the control of the services given by the local authorities in their own areas <Col N="220" /> would have to pass out of the hands of the local representatives and into the hands of the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that if that did happen, the Minister and his officials would enforce a much higher standard than obtains in many places, but I would regret the fact that the local authorities which are in close contact with the people in their constituencies would be deprived of the right to look for services and would have to depend on the sanction or implementation of the services from a higher authority.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that the medical card holders who are, as I said, approximately 30 per cent. of our community, taken by and large, receive a first-class service but my complaint about the issue of medical cards is not that medical cards are not given to those who deserve them but that there is no uniformity on the question of deciding what standard of income or circumstances govern the issuing of medical cards.  In the case of County Wicklow the County Manager has set a standard which is considerably higher than the standard set in my own county, Waterford.  Again you have the system adopted by some groups of managers that where a person is bequeathed or inherits an old brokendown motor car from a friend, and uses that car to take his wife and family to Mass, the mere fact that the car is registered in his name is taken as proof that he is not entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>For instance, a labourer in a small country area in my constituency earning under the minimum which is accepted by the County Manager as the amount of money that would qualify him for a medical card received an old car from his brother who had returned from America and purchased the car during his holidays. He handed over the car to his brother when he was going away.  Because the man realised the value of the car to his wife, to take her to Mass in wintry weather, he gave up drinking and smoking to provide the money required to cover the cost of third party insurance, the tax and petrol. If he had not done that, if he had <Col N="221" /> continued to take a drink as he was entitled to do, or if he had continued to smoke, as he was entitled to do, he would have enjoyed the full benefits of a medical card but because he tried to behave as a reasonable person and endeavoured to help his family the fact that that car was registered in his name was taken as complete proof that he was not entitled to a medical card.</P>
    <P>I also know of a fish merchant who was struggling to make a living on £3 or £4 a week and whose net income was proved to be less than £5 10s. a week.  He had to use an old, dilapidated van to earn his living but the fact that that van was registered in his name deprived him and his family of the most valuable thing he could have, that is a medical card.  I feel that the administration is faulty because of the fact that all power is vested in the County Manager.  It is quite obvious that in a big county, say, Cork, or Tipperary, or Waterford and Kilkenny, which is governed by one County Manager, it would be a physical impossibility for the Manager to examine the various cases.  He must from necessity rely on the report of his home assistance officers.  When these officers have come to a decision you have the right of appeal to the County Manager but in practice you have no appeal at all because you can appeal to the County Manager who will send back the papers to be reinvestigated to the very same people against whose decisions you are appealing.  Is it at all likely that they will condemn themselves and admit they were wrong in the first instance?</P>
    <P>I know of cases where people entitled to medical services free, who could not by their lawful means provide the services for themselves or their families, were deprived purely on a personal basis in small country areas because of the fact that they had a disagreement with the local home assistance officer.  The Minister should consider some right of appeal to the Department which would give him the right to send an investigating officer to examine such cases if he was satisfied that a case had been made by the person putting forward the claim.  I am <Col N="222" /> satisfied that there is a blatant misuse of the power vested in some relieving officers.  I am satisfied that there are people holding medical cards who are not entitled to them and that people are being refused cards who are not entitled to them.  When I endeavoured, as a local representative, to see the register of names of those entitled to medical cards in the local authority of which I was a member, I was told that it was a privileged document and that even a member of the local authority was not permitted to see it.  I feel that is carrying the secrecy of medical services to an extreme and is an action which tends to cover up corruption, or maladministration at the least, in an area.  Local authority representatives are entitled to know who is getting medical services and who is not so that with their intimate knowledge of the circumstances of people in their area they can decide whether there is, in fact, as I suggest, maladministration.</P>
    <P>I have recently discovered, in connection with the issue of medical cards, a new system which has apparently been used in some local authorities and that is the grouping of families together on the one medical card.  I am well aware that the father holds the card which covers his wife and all members of his family under 16 years of age but a new system has developed where individual members of a family who are over 16, who are persons of responsibility in their own right but who are still living in the same house, are being grouped.  That to my mind is depriving numbers of individuals in families over the 16 years age limit of rights that they formerly held.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to investigate the reason for the alteration in the issue of medical cards and the effect it has on people who formerly qualified and who are now being deprived of medical cards by the adding of the various incomes together and showing an average income that would justify the withdrawal of the medical card.</P>
    <P>There are circumstances&mdash;and the Minister will tell me that the Act specifies what these circumstances can be&mdash;where two people are receiving the same income.  One man might be <Col N="223" /> paying a rent of £1 or 25/- a week, whereas the other might be occupying a council house or cottage at 5/-. Both receive the same income.  It would appear that they are issued with medical cards on their income alone without any question of what rent they pay or their particular circumstances. I know of a case where a man paying up to 30/- a week rent was refused a card because a man living next door, or quite close to him, who only paid 5/- rent, was refused. The basis for that was that their income was over the level the county manager had decided would qualify them for a card.</P>
    <P>I suggest county managers are not operating the Health Act in the spirit in which it was framed.  It was said that county managers could ignore income and take the particular circumstances of a family into account. My experience has been, however, that the county manager fixes a level of income and that, except for extreme cases of hardship, no other circumstances are taken into account.  Representations made in connection with dependants, for instance, who strictly speaking are not in the same category as children, are practically always ignored.  I am saying to the Minister that there should be a right of appeal to him so that officers of his Department could investigate alleged cases of hardship.</P>
    <P>I should like now to make some comment on this outcry in regard to the cost of the health services to the rates.  One would think from all the shouting about the increased cost since the Health Act came into force that the health services were confined to the medical treatement of people who are ill.  Apparently it is forgotten that we, as a Christian country, have an obligation to provide for the disabled, the blind and so on.  We have an obligation to provide through disability benefit, home assistance and blind pension, for those who from their own means are unable to secure a livelihood for themselves.  We have to maintain our county homes for those who have no place else to seek shelter.  These things account for a <Col N="224" /> good proportion of the Health Estimate.  Surely nobody will suggest we should neglect those people? Surely nobody will suggest we should go back to the days of Oliver Twist and simply provide them with a Poor House?</P>
    <P>The cost to the rates of the health services provides the cheapest form of health insurance possible.  For the amount each individual must pay in rates in respect of health services, no insurance company or group scheme could provide anything like the benefits available.  I have before me the cost to my own local authority of maintaining patients in their institutions. The average cost is at least 50 per cent. higher than the sum charged to persons in the middle income group. The maximum charge for such a person is 10/- per day.  If that person had to maintain himself in his own home, an estimate of 2/6d. per day for breakfast, 4/6d. for dinner and 2/6d. for tea would practically account for the 10/-.  But, in addition, he receives in hospital medical services from a doctor, and from a specialist if necessary, he gets extras, he gets the best nursing attention, plus food and shelter&mdash;and all for 10/- a day.  That is the maximum charge.  Therefore, any middle income group person who has the misfortune to fall sick is well served for the amount of money he has to pay through his rates.</P>
    <P>Most middle income group people do not realise that, if they were not covered by health services, a single illness might cost them £100 or £200. It would take years to pay a sum like that through the amounts paid in rates for the health services.  I have found that some middle income group people do not avail of the services of the dispensary doctor, although some of them do.  I do so myself.  As a private patient, I prefer to go to the dispensary doctor.</P>
    <P>Outside doctors are usually connected with some private hospital or nursing home.  If a person goes to them, he very often finds that in an emergency he is sent to one of these hospitals or homes which have no contract with the board.  In some cases, <Col N="225" /> the doctor sends the person to hospital at once and he is put into either a semi-private or private ward without his knowledge or the knowledge of his relatives and without their knowing what that means.  Very often, that middle income group person finds on discharge that he has to face a bill of £30, £40 or £50.  He would not have that bill had he the knowledge to insist that he should get public ward treatment, which would be just as effective and just as good in every way, except that he would not have the privacy of a private or semi-private ward.  There should be a responsibility on people in charge of hospitals that, when a person is entering, either he or, if he is not capable, somebody on his behalf should be told clearly that if he enters a private or semi-private ward, he is doing so at his own request and will be responsible for the special charges that can arise.</P>
    <P>In regard to the people in the upper income group&mdash;the 15 per cent. of our people over £800 or with a valuation over £50&mdash;they, too, are entitled to health services.  Should they have long and expensive courses of treatment, it is within the law that the county manager may exercise his right as agent of the local authority and give considerable help to the families of such people.  However, I feel it would be well if the income of that balance of 15 per cent. were completely ignored.</P>
    <P>It should be possible to include all the people in the country willing to accept medical services and treat them equally.  It is true it would mean an increase in costs.  It is unfair that the white collar workers in the city, a typical civil servant or bank clerk with a family and with heavy commitments in respect of housing, education and so on, with an income of £800 a year, are now forced to enter the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme and at the same time have to contribute through rates to give benefits to all the middle income group and lower income group people in their area.  Voluntary health insurance is an excellent idea, but if your family history is bad, if your medical record prior to joining is such that the Voluntary Health Insurance <Col N="226" /> people feel you are not a good risk, you can be turned down.  Even though you were accepted last year, if you had a recurring attack of some illness, just when you wanted medical insurance cover would be the very time you would be told your policy in regard to that particular coverage would not be renewed.</P>
    <P>There is a failure in that part of voluntary health insurance.  I would prefer to see a system whereby all the people in the country would contribute a fixed amount each according to his means by some method, plus a contribution from central funds raised by taxation.  That would meet everybody's medical requirements without this souldestroying problem of a means test.  It has worked effectively in Great Britain, in France and other countries.  It is quite true we are a small country, that we shall never be able to reach the high standard of other big industrial countries, but in so far as this country can provide, money spent on the preservation of the health of the people, in giving to the people the best medical services we can afford, is money well spent.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there is a Select Committee of the House sitting to consider this problem and to make suggestions to the Minister.  I am a member nominated by my own Party.  I believe much more will be done at that Select Committee than in discussion here in the Dáil, but I am simply putting forward a view of the problems as I have met them as a layman deeply interested in health problems for over 20 years in public life. More good work will come from the findings of that Committee, if implemented by the Minister, than from discussion on Estimates such as this which can be useful only to the extent of giving the Minister the feeling of how the Act is being administered throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for me to neglect appealing to the Minister in connection with the salary scales and the conditions of those I describe as the Cinderellas of the medical profession, the nurses.  I am aware that the Minister is sympathetic, but I would again appeal to him, in view of the fact that <Col N="227" /> nurses in general have refused to avail of their rights as a trade union organised body to enforce their demands by methods which have been successful in other walks of life.  Nurses look upon their work, not as a job but as a vocation.  Because of their idealism, they have neglected to secure advantages for themselves to which they are justly entitled.  Because of their honesty, they should receive the sympathetic consideration of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Practically all organised labour are now on a 45-hour week.  If anyone is entitled to a 45-hour week surely it is those who labour amongst the ill, those who labour in contagious circumstances? I would suggest to the Minister that he should use his good offices with the local authority and voluntary hospitals to see that the nursing staffs are given adequate compensation for the wonderful services they give.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the dispensary doctors in my area.  They are excellent people.  Though often run down and abused, they give an amazing service when you consider the terms of their appointment mean that they must be available to all of the lower income group, both night and day.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to thank the Minister personally for the way he has received any complaints I have forwarded to him.  At all times, I have received a courteous acknowledgment and later a full explanation in regard to the various matters on which I made representations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Minister is asking for almost £8 million to complete his programme to the end of this financial year is sufficient indication of the efforts he is making to ensure that all the people will have an adequate health service.  Much has been done in the past to help the ordinary people in times of need and of ill-health to secure the necessary medical attention.  It is a great step forward that by virtue of the fact that medical cards have been issued and funds made available, people in the lower and middle income groups can approach hospitals with the confidence <Col N="228" /> that their ills will receive attention. It is a far cry from the days not too long ago when very often patients were refused in hospitals and when, even in Dublin city, patients died in the corridors while the physicans were arguing as to what amount of fees they might extract before any operation was performed.  It is a good thing to see that approach is on the way out, and the Health Act is responsible for seeing to it that these people at least will get a fair deal.</P>
      <P>Much money has been spent, and is still being spent, on the improvement of hospital accommodation all over the country.  It is badly needed because in recent years people have become more hospital-conscious.  They will more readily go into hospital and avail of the facilities provided for them. There may be reasons for that, one of the reasons, I think, being that they now have confidence in the staff employed in these hospitals.  If these people could be encouraged to go into their local hospitals, the expenses arising from the administration of the Health Act could be tapered down considerably.</P>
      <P>I have the fear that some dispensary doctors are prone to send holders of medical cards into hospital almost immediately they contact them rather than attend them in their homes.  If such a tendency were discovered in any area something should be done about it because it is one of the things that would put up the cost of the health services.  I am not suggesting that such practice is widespread but I do make the suggestion for what it is worth that it has happened in some areas.</P>
      <P>Very often, patients are sent from rural areas to hospitals and institutions in Dublin City when they could be equally well catered for in local institutions. I do not blame the patients for this state of affairs because very few patients in a rural area would have any contract with physicians in the city. There, again, it is probably the dispensary doctor who is responsible for having patients sent to city institutions. The local authority has no knowledge whatever of the matter until the bill comes to them and then, of course, there are the usual complaints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> While a great outcry has been made in recent years about the cost of the health services the fact should not be overlooked that mental hospitals, home assistance and other items are now included in the services under the Health Act and as such are presented in the local estimates, thus showing an increase out of all proportion which is not a real increase, as has been explained to us very convincingly in this House by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, some months ago.</P>
    <P>Another point that I should like to put forward with regard to dispensaries is the question of the appointment of dispensary doctors by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  In many areas the system has worked well but at the same time I suggest that very often the best approach is not made.  Where there is a family a member of whom has been the local doctor for generations, they know the history of everybody in the area and the adjoining parishes.  A very important factor in diagnosis is family history. There are occasions when people would get a better service from a doctor who was from the locality and who was willing to stay there.  When a stranger to the locality is appointed he may remain for a year or two and then move off, whereas the local man would remain.</P>
    <P>I should like also to refer to the rehabilitation of T.B. patients.  Fortunately, the incidence of tuberculosis has declined and many sanatoria are now being used for other purposes and beds are becoming available. Every effort should be made to get ex-T.B. patients back to work.  In my constituency recently I endeavoured to get a position as caretaker in a technical school for an ex-patient. I ultimately succeeded but it was a very hard fight.  I am glad to say that politics were not involved.  There should be a more Christian approach to this problem and everything possible should be done to ensure that suitable positions would be made available to ex-T.B. patients so that they would not be cast aside but would take their rightful and lawful place in society.</P>
    <P>There is not a great deal in all the <Col N="230" /> talk about the health services being made a national charge.  I also have seen many people marching during the year in connection with the health services who at the same time had had bills reduced and had secured medical cards.  It is not a very reasoned approach to this very important subject of health.  I cannot see the virtue in the argument that a man with 10 or 12 in family should have to pay through taxation for the health services on the same footing as a single man with a big farm of land and no dependants.</P>
    <P>So far as the health services in general are concerned, they are very good and we are going definitely in the right direction and everything possible is being done within the limits of our resources to see that the health services are improved from year to year.</P>
    <P>Some of the services are operated through the national schools, for instance, the ophthalmic services for children.  It is very important that defects of vision should be attended to early in life.  The same applies to deafness.  While there seems to be great sympathy for the blind or semiblind there is not very much sympathy for the child who is deaf. In many cases deaf children have to attend national schools and suffer serious handicap.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be complimented on his efforts for mentally handicapped children.  There is also a need to have something done for imbecile children.  A member of a large family may be mentally handicapped and it is difficult for the parents to get that child accommodated in an institution. The presence of such a child in a normal family may affect the other children.  Everything that can be done within reason to provide for mentally handicapped children should be done.</P>
    <P>The dispensary doctors throughout the country are giving a good service and are very attentive to their patients. In the hospitals in general the staff are courteous and efficient.  The only fault that can be found is the scarcity of staff.  Local authorities must realise that in order to maintain staff it will <Col N="231" /> be necessary to ensure that they are properly remunerated.</P>
    <P>Before concluding.  I should like to stress that it is very important to get it across to medical card holders and to the ordinary people that in many of the local hospitals the health services provided are as good as, if not better than, those available in the cities. There is no reason why patients should rush headlong up to Dublin when the same, or perhaps better, services are available in their own areas, in centres convenient to their relatives.  A change in the present practice would reduce the cost of the health services considerably.  Because of the successful operation of our health services, life expectancy has improved considerably. People have grown more health conscious.  We shall always, of course, have sickness and our present health services operate to bring relief to sufferers as quickly as possible. Every individual in the community benefits, and not just one section.  The sick can now be fortified in the knowledge that no trouble will be spared to restore them to health.  Well-qualified practitioners and nurses are available. There are excellent hospitals in which everything humanly possible to restore the sick to health is being done.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I listened with interest to Deputy Kyne's contribution to this debate. The burden of his complaint seemed to be that in regard to free insurance cards.  I was surprised to learn that he had been refused permission to see the medical service register in his own county.  There may be some reason&mdash; it eludes me, I confess&mdash;for that refusal.  On the face of it, I cannot understand why a local public representative should be denied information of that type; it is not information which one could really characterise as confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to free insurance cards, I think there will inevitably always be trouble under the present system.  We, in Fine Gael, believe they should be abolished altogether.  It is a question now of applying a means test to too many people at too low a level.  When <Col N="232" /> you apply a means test at that level to too many people, it is inevitable that you will have too many complaints. The test we in the Fine Gael Party would advocate is a test at a higher level&mdash;£50 valuation and an income of £800.  At that level, one would be dealing with a smaller number of people and, in effect, segregating those who would come under a compulsory insurance scheme and those who would be free to remain outside it.  A test at that level would cause much less trouble generally and much less annoyance to public representatives than the system in operation at the moment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne made one allusion here which led me to think that he believes that doctors shanghai&mdash;if I may use that expression&mdash;patients into private beds in hospitals.  Most patients who go into private rooms know pretty well in advance where they are going.  But there is another side to the picture and it is one about which I can speak from personal experience, an experience of which, I am sure, Deputy Kyne is unaware.  A great many patients in public institutions, in which there are private or semi-private bed facilities, come in as private patients and go out as public patients.  They are private before they get treatment and, after treatment, a number of them seek grading as public patients.  They want to have the best of both worlds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kyne also referred to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board rejecting some applicants.  They are acting within their rights in doing so. This organisation is a non-profit making organisation.  It receives no subvention from the State or any other source.  All it has by way of finances are the contributions made by its members.  The organisation must make ends meet.  If they accepted anybody and everybody, they would quickly become insolvent.  Consider the case of a man who suddenly discovers he has a rupture, decides to join the Voluntary Health Organisation in order to get treatment, pays one year's contribution, and, after treatment, opts out of the Organisation, the Organisation having paid all his expenses in the meantime.  If that were to be the <Col N="233" /> method of operation, the Organisation would break down very quickly.  Of necessity, they must insist on screening applicants.  That is the only way in which they can survive financially.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister in relation to his attitude to cigarette smoking.  I do not know whether or not he has given sufficient consideration to the matter, but he has adopted the attitude that cigarette smoking does not affect public safety or public morality: anything that results from excessive cigarette smoking is in the nature of a non-communicable disease and he has, therefore, no function in the matter.  I think he has both a function and a responsibility in the field of preventive medicine.  It has been pretty clearly established that cigarette smoking is a very important factor in the causation of lung cancer. While I do not expect the Minister for Health to conduct a therapeutic control of anti-smoking drugs, or anything like that, I think it would be within his functions to institute an educational campaign of a preventive nature to induce young people to avoid developing the smoking habit.  It is easier to do that than to stop the addicts.</P>
    <P>As regards our consultant specialist services, it has always struck me as rather peculiar that, while we speak of specialists, we have in large measure failed to advert to the primary divisions of consultant medical practice. All over the world, the three primary divisions of consultant practice are surgery, medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology. In this country, however, up to the present, we have hybrid appointments, appointments in which one man acts as both physician and obstetrician. The training and discipline which these men undergo in order to qualify in their respective fields are to some degree opposed.  One becomes either one or the other.  If a choice has to be made and only one man can be appointed, I should prefer to see posts filled by consultant physicians, leaving obstetrics and gynaecology to be handled in a general fashion for the moment.  By insisting on appointing a man who is supposed to do a little in both fields, probably you ultimately get the worst of two worlds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> I know that in the regional hospitals physicians are being appointed as such, but I think that all over the country there has been too much of a drift to the hybrid appointment of physician <i>cum</i> obstetrician.  I would allow the gynaecology to be handled by reference to Dublin centres and the local surgeon, if he has gynaecological ability, and appoint a physician, as such, rather than continue with the type of appointment which has been created here and which I do not think obtains anywhere else.  Admittedly, you have such kinds of appointments in central Africa but, in 1962, I think we should move towards the three primary divisions of consulting medical practice.  That matter should be attended to before we start talking about ear specialists, eye specialists, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is amazing to recall that we have had 40 years of native Government before we thought fit to appoint anaesthetists to our county institutions. For a number of years, an odd institution did have a local doctor giving anaesthetics.  However, the practice obtained here, and it was thought fit in the eyes of the Custom House, that a newly-qualified doctor could come down to local institutions and be trained there as a house surgeon, as an assistant, as an anaesthetist, by the surgeon in charge&mdash;and his experience perhaps, of anaesthetics may only have been to hold a mask with a few drops of chloroform on it on one maternity patient during his fortnight's apprenticeship in the Coombe.  I am glad to see that more up to date thinking has at last manifested itself in the Custom House in this respect&mdash;but it took 40 years to do it.  Forty years: I wonder by how many millimetres the blood pressure of the various surgeons up and down the country must have gone up during that time, working under appalling conditions, all because the gentlemen in the Custom House could not modernise themselves.</P>
    <P>I have doubted, and I still doubt, the wisdom of appointing regional orthopaedic specialists at this stage. After all, orthopaedics as a speciality in the bigger centres of population <Col N="235" /> nowadays largely consists of fracture work and where you have big centres of population, most fracture work and traumatic surgery is nowadays passed into their hands.  In view of our geographical situation, it is difficult for any regional orthopaedic man to give immediate service on these lines.  I should have thought that before we had gone on to the stage of appointing regional orthopaedic specialists it would be better if the money were spent in providing assistance to the existing county surgeon.</P>
    <P>I believe the modern surgeon who is appointed in our various hospitals should be quite capable of handling the ordinary fracture material that comes into them.  Here, you have, so to speak, a duplication of service.  At the same time, the existing men have to do a 24-hour service, in many cases.  There is great difficulty in getting locums and in getting registrars and it is happening that the surgery has to be done by people of sub-standard level.</P>
    <P>We have more hospital beds here, in proportion to our population, than any other country.  Yet, as regards mental deficiency, we have only about one-fifth of our requirements.  It is true, I believe, that a certain redundancy is occurring now in T.B. beds. I suggest that the Minister might be able to utilise some of these institutions if they can be adapted for the treatment of mental deficiency.</P>
    <P>As regards special hospitals or specialist hospitals, I think that here, also, we have perhaps been moving in a doubtful direction.  I am not against specialisation but the general tendency everywhere is to get away from specialist hospitals.  It is generally conceded that it is far better to establish a specialist unit in a general hospital than to establish a specialist hospital, not alone in the interests of economy but in the interest of the continuing education of the specialist himself.  It is desirable that any specialist should remain in as close medical contact as possible with his colleagues and that he should not begin to view doctoring through the narrow window of his own speciality. With increasing specialisation, there is <Col N="236" /> that increasing danger and tendency.</P>
    <P>There is the further point that, by establishing special hospitals, you have to duplicate all the auxiliary services. For example, a regional hospital was built in Limerick.  Subsequently, a very expensive maternity hospital was built in Limerick city: the regional hospital was about a mile or so outside.  The building of that hospital was sanctioned by the present Minister for Finance.  There was no difficulty, as far as I could judge, in building a simple annexe to the existing regional hospital.  Everything was laid on &mdash;matron, nurses, office services, almonery services, pathological laboratory, X-ray laboratory.  The various ancillary services and consultants were all there under one roof.</P>
    <P>It seemed quite ridiculous, economically and administratively, to start to build another institution from the ground floor up.  It was as if you had a hotel and decided you had not enough room and, instead of building a wing, you said: &ldquo;I shall go down the street and build one up from the ground and I shall have the same staff, all duplicated.&rdquo;  As there may be more building in the future, we should try to avoid mistakes of that nature.  To my mind, that was a cardinal error of judgment.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister said our future development in hospitals would be on the lines of modernisation.  I agree with him.  I think there is an awareness of the necessity to shut down some of our smaller fever institutions. They are quite unnecessary.  The smaller ones, in the ordinary course of events, are not functioning most of the time and, in the event of an epidemic, they are too small and too ill-equipped to handle it.  Some of our district hospitals are of very doubtful functional utility.  When there is a proposal to close down one of them there is an outcry from the public but the public should be educated to understand that our attitude with regard to the question of hospital beds is that we have too many beds and that we should have fewer and better beds.</P>
    <P>I recognise that when a new institution is built it provides a certain <Col N="237" /> amount of employment but you inevitably find that the existing institutions are as full as ever.  There is no difficulty about filling hospital beds. Personally, I would not give any particular doctor the number of beds he would ask for and if I had a choice of institutions to work in I would prefer one with a large number of beds.  There would be less trouble. From the point of efficiency and of the economic administration of such institutions the number of beds should be kept as low as possible.</P>
    <P>We shall have to face up to the fact that we have too many beds for our requirements.  I believe that up and down the country we have excess activity in outpatient departments in rural areas.  That is understandable. Most of the medical people working in country hospitals have been trained in Dublin or in British cities where the patient can get a twopenny or three-penny bus and attend the hospital as often as he likes as an outpatient.  When discharged they often come back month after month.  That has been the pattern for years in these islands and a lot of our medical men have been trained on these lines.  I do not think we appreciate the heavy expenditure there is in having ambulances running up and down the country bringing in these patients for review, as they call it.  I find that there is a queue on special outpatient days.  Surely to bring back a simple appendix or hernia case to look at the scar is causing quite unnecessary expense?</P>
    <P>Some two or three years ago, the allowance per day to private institutions for those who opted to go there was 12/- per day.  The present Minister reduced that to 8/- and he has now recently increased it to 11/6d.  The patients who went into private institutions on that basis saved money for the rates.  Hundreds of them have been so treated and there is no institution that can do it for 8/- or 12/- a day.  I think it was a wrong thing, from the point of view of the ratepayers, to reduce that small allowance of 12/- to 8/-. Bringing it up again to 11/6 does not alter that position because the 11/6 now is worth much less than the 12/-was then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> I would also like to offer my objection to the charging of income tax on the voluntary health scheme.  The voluntary health scheme does relieve the rates and if people want to join that scheme, they save money for the ratepayers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I would ask the Minister for Health to make representations to the Minister for Finance in that regard.  The Voluntary Health Board is a non-profit making concern and helps to cut down the cost of the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>Our hospital accountancy system is, in my opinion, rather antiquated.  I have inquired into this costing system and the cost per patient per bed per day and the way they arrived at the figure shows that their accountancy system is archaic.  There is a hospital accountancy system in Britain and considerable research has gone into the manner in which the big book of accounts is presented each year.  We are extremely backward in that respect and there is much to be desired in our system of hospital costings.</P>
      <P>As regards public health services proper&mdash;I am alluding now to the medical officer of health and his department&mdash;it is not so many years since the first MOH was appointed in this country.  I can remember it&mdash;I believe it was in Wexford. The functions of the MOH department, as I have always regarded it, were largely sanitation and control of infectious diseases.  They were appointed as full-time salaried officers and, from the beginning, appeared to be the favoured sons of the Custom House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Perhaps not the Minister, but the Minister is not the entire Custom House.  In so far as they are more akin <Col N="239" /> to the established civil servants M.O.H.s may have something more in common with them than the average professional doctor outside.  There has been an undue tendency for public health services to depart from purely public health matters and to become engaged in what we might call clinical medicine.  That is understandable because all these men are primarily trained as doctors and that is their first law and even though for economic, social or any other reasons they may have become public health officials a number of them retain a hankering to do clinical doctoring.  I feel clinical doctoring should be left to those who make it their lifework and that the proper field for the public health services, the officers and their staffs is preventive medicine and sanitation.</P>
      <P>I can recall, in the early days, when the first medical officers were appointed, they had hardly enough work to do.  Now if you go into one of their departments you find a tremendous amount of activity: secretaries busy and typewriters hammering &mdash;everything and anything except patients.  They have established themselves as T.B. specialists, V.D. specialists, child specialists and maternity clinicians and, in many cases, they are doing the work which the local medical people were doing before and could still be doing.  It would seem that Parkinson's Law has raised its ugly head in the Health Department as in many other civil service departments. It is, I think, undesirable and unnecessary to build a third clinical arm here. We should concentrate on doctoring and leave it in the hands of the general practitioners and institutional consultant type of people and not have this third man who is half-practitioner, half-specialist and ultimately an inbetween individual trying to make a groove for himself.  There is plenty for them to do in the field of public health and preventive medicine without too actively invading the clinical field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the infectious diseases allowances were introduced even these were used by the public health authorities to put undue pressure on patients to <Col N="240" /> have them come under the public service.  Even patients who were being adequately diagnosed and treated were visited by officials from the public health department and told: &ldquo;You will get your T.B. allowance if you leave such a doctor and come to us but otherwise you will not get it&rdquo;.  I think that is objectionable, bad professionally and bad ethically.</P>
    <P>I have always felt we are getting very doubtful value from our school medical inspections.  My view is that the inspection of children of schoolgoing age, desirable as it is, would be far more suitable and carried out far better if left in the hands of the local doctor who knows the family history and the relatives, and who may have brought the child into the world and who would have a personal follow-through interest in the child who may on different occasions, have been a patient of his.  To bring in a doctor from a public health clinic thirty miles away to one school today and another tomorrow and another still the day after, introduces a very diversified and impersonal attitude in the matter.  Yet this method of inspection seems to have been put into operation here largely in imitation of what exists in Britain.  So far as we are a rural community and have a different geographical set up from Great Britain I think we have carried imitation of British public health services too far. We are not economically able to afford that kind of duplication because that in effect is what it means in a large number of cases.  Even such simple matters&mdash;or what should be simple matters&mdash;as vaccination against poliomyelits or BCG vaccination have been cornered and set up as a speciality.  We had a situation the other day when three motor cars had to drive from Clonmel to Cashel to inoculate three people against poliomyelitis. That seems a little daft.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the increased cost of drugs.  The figures I took from him were £176,000 in 1956-57 and £392,000 in the current year. The cost of drugs will become an increasing headache to every Minister for Health everywhere.  I welcome the institution of a national formulary. <Col N="241" /> Economies could be effected that way. Perhaps, it is a pity it was not introduced a little earlier.  It has been operating in England for many years. I think it will serve a good purpose here.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the combined purchasing list. The combined purchasing list is drawn up with a view to effecting the purchase of commodities at the lowest possible price and, as regards drugs, the local authorities try to come to agreements with suppliers for drugs at prices as low as possible.  But complaints have reached me that the pharmaceutical houses, in their efforts to get these contracts, which are of great advertisement value, are overreaching themselves and then recouping themselves off private people and the chemists find it impossible to buy drugs for retail purposes at anything near the same price as these houses are prepared to supply them at to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>If a patient is in an institution and the doctor gets into the habit of prescribing a particular drug, he puts, perhaps, a number of patients through his list and the prescriptions usually follow, but from the point of view of advertisement and propaganda to secure that type of contract, these firms are understandably making every effort to secure these contracts, but I am told that in their efforts to do so they are, in effect, recouping themselves off the private consumers up and down the country.</P>
    <P>We are in the position that we are largely in the hands of drug firms outside the country.  In fact, in the field of anti-biotics, particularly the broad spectrum biotics, the tetracyclines, the supplies largely come from American manufacturers or from the manufacture of an American patent and a tremendous amount of the cost of these drugs goes into sales promotions.  Much less than the public realise goes into the actual research work.  We are handicapped in this country in that respect and I do not know of any solution to it, but it is the headache of any Minister who is trying to produce an economical health service to try and secure modern drugs at reasonable <Col N="242" /> prices from outside the country&mdash;from countries over which we have no control.</P>
    <P>There has been some attempt made here to establish native industries on these lines but I do not know with what success.  I think the difficulty here is the biological assessment of these drugs.  The testing of drugs bacteriologically presents no difficulty but I do not think we have the technological set up here to investigate most modern drugs biologically. Neither have we much in the way of development for the manufacture of drugs, particularly in the sense of the more complicated modern drugs.  I wish to quote from an article published in the Irish Medical Journal by Professor Paul Gannon in April, 1960. He says:</P>
    <P>At present it is known that some drugs are imported into Ireland from countries such as China, via West European firms which act as re-exporters.  The identity of these firms may be established but it is next to impossible to locate the true country of origin.  Neither the exporter nor the true country of origin may carry out bioassay or exact chemical estimations on products for exports.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister's attention has been drawn to that or not.  It seems potentially serious if it is as detailed there.  I do not know what controls we have as regards imports of drugs here or what measure of control we have over houses which profess to manufacture drugs here.  It is possibly true to say that most manufacture here consists of the mixing of ointments and tablets from chemicals already imported in bulk and it is possibly also true to say that only well established houses are prepared to set up subsidiaries here really equipped to produce a worthwhile pharmaceutical range of drugs.  Even those find themselves occasionally running into difficulties.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister, when he comes to reply, what the existing position is as regards the pharmaceutical industry here.  Have there been any recent developments or <Col N="243" /> are we getting down to a worthwhile basis as regards the manufacture of drugs here?  A number of years ago, in our drive for economic self-sufficiency, it was decided to make catgut here.  The catgut was finally processed in a small private house in Cambridge Road.  Immediately a tariff wall was built around this catgut and we all had to pay an extra percentage on any British, American or German catgut we imported.  The amount of employment given in that small industry was negligible.  Catgut is made from sheep's intestines.  We did not use even Irish sheep.  We brought them in from Scotland because producers of Irish sheep preferred to have their offals sold for the manufacture of sausages and so on.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The years 1961-62 and 1951-52 are not so very far apart, and what happened in 1951-52 could be repeated in 1961-62.  I am adverting to what happened then so that there may not be a repetition in 1961-62.  I was dealing with the shortcomings of the pharmaceutical industry that was established here, and which cost those who used its products a considerable amount of money and, because the patients were forced to use these products, considerable distress because they were inferior products.  All the remonstrations possible from the Medical Association and from doctors generally were made, but to no avail.  If that happened in 1951-52, it could happen again in 1961-62, and protestations from me to the Minister will be met by the rebuttal that it is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce, just as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has told me.</P>
      <P>No matter what legislation or regulations we may implement, no medical services can ultimately come to proper fruition without the fullest co-operation between the Department of Health and the Minister and the doctors up and down the country who are doing the job.  In no field of endeavour is that co-operation so necessary.  I believe that in no field of endeavour has a Department so much to gain by advice from the men in the field than in the practice of medicine, for the very simple reason that the majority of the advisers available to the Minister are not, and in many cases have never been, in actual medical practice.</P>
      <P>I see that the Minister is now in difficulties with the architects.  A couple of years ago, the IMA were wrecking the Health Act.  I can only hope that he will get so involved with the architects that, for a change, he will leave the Irish Medical Association alone.  I appeal to him again to try to secure in the coming months, when we shall be discussing health matters before the Select Committee, some <i>modus vivendi</i> between himself and the IMA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be the only civilised country in the world in which such a <Col N="245" /> ridiculous situation obtains of a Minister refusing to meet the representative association of one of the oldest professions in the country.  I can easily recognise the shortcomings of the doctors, just as I can recognise the shortcomings of the Minister.  I can realise that sometimes he might say: &ldquo;Those are an awful bunch of so-and-sos.&rdquo; Let him say and think that, and let him have all the rows he likes, but for heaven's sake, let him, like a good athlete, leave it on the field or at the debating table, and not carry it in his head morning, noon and night as something he cannot live without.  It is not good for the public health services and ultimately I do not think it is good for the Minister's health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were merely an historian interested in the process of Parliamentary democracy, one could get great value out of the fact that the great national debate on the question of the health services which started about ten years ago, is, it seems to me, drawing to a close in so far as the Minister and the Government have established the Select Committee, to which Deputy Hogan referred, to examine the health services and recommend to the Government the types of services which they think we should have here.  In the light of that, it seems that the wisest place to pursue the debate is at the meetings of the Select Committee.  Therefore, I do not wish to deal at great length with the general medical services.</P>
      <P>However, I am slightly concerned about the previous speaker's contribution in regard to a relief in the means test.  If the main Opposition Party believe that we should continue with a means test, I do not think we have progressed very much further in understanding the single greatest element in the establishment of adequate, efficient and equitable health services.  I do not think it matters very much whether one puts the amount of means at £300, £400, £500, £600 or £700&mdash;the existence of the means test is the one great factor which prevents the health services from being efficient and equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact, I would go so far as to say that I have no real quarrel with the <Col N="246" /> existing health services and I think I can say, generally speaking, that the public have no great quarrel with them, except those people who cannot avail of the services under recent health schemes.  So far as the general services are concerned, the services which are administered under the recent Health Acts, there is not very much wrong with them for those who are eligible. The great complaint of those people who are outside the income group and who believe they have a right to those services is that they are being wrongly denied them by virtue of some calculation or miscalculation by the particular health authority.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago, in 1951, I discussed with some members of the British Labour Party the matter of the means test which at the time was being debated with considerable intensity. The case they made was that of course they were ideologically opposed to the means test, but their greatest objection was the stupidity of it and the administrative cost of it, as well as the difficulties of administering it in an equitable way, and the appalling administrative machine one has to maintain in order to decide whether the rural or city dweller is eligible or when he ceases to become eligible.  The means test is a great source of irritation in families.  When a person receives overtime or a daughter gets an increase in wages, or somebody gets a bonus or a legitimate increase, then he or she prices himself or herself out of the free health service.  The whole thing is completely undesirable.</P>
    <P>Nobody has ever explained to me why there is this extraordinary doctrinaire adhesion to this idea of a means test.  Why must there be a means test? I did not understand why there should be.  We have shown in our own free health services&mdash;we do not need to go elsewhere&mdash;that we can achieve the objective which I think is our common objective no matter to what Party we belong, the objective of getting equitable, efficient health services.  I am referring to the services operated under the infectious diseases regulations, diseases treated in the fever hospitals and the tuberculosis services. There may be complaints here and <Col N="247" /> there but, broadly speaking, they do give a service which has shown its worth.  The very fact, I suppose, that Deputy Hogan can say that we can close down our fever hospitals is in its own way proof of the wonderful efficiency of the infectious diseases regulations.  The fact that there were free services made available under them is a wonderful proof of the efficiency of the service and the free no means test service.  We are now closing down our sanatoria one after the other.  These are tremendous achievements due practically entirely to the fact that we have had free no means test services for infectious diseases.  It has been suggested that the great improvement is due to the fact that we have had wonderful advances in drug therapy in relation to tuberculosis and fevers but there are countries in which they do not have free services for these diseases where there has not been a remarkable reduction in the morbidity and mortality rates because the sick public have not had access to these wonderful drugs and consequently the morbidity and death rates have continued to be just as high.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not fair to give the credit entirely to the advances which have been made in various chemical and therapeutic methods.  We must give credit where it is due and that is that if a person falls sick he can be treated and have no worry about doctor's bills.  It always astonishes me that the medical profession should oppose this approach to medicine because a doctor should not have to worry about whether the patient can afford to be ill over long periods.  The patient worrying about whether he can afford to be ill over long periods.  The doctor should be in a position to be glad that he has these wonderful drugs at his disposal and that he can treat his patient as a private patient or give him single room status or place him in a big ward merely depending on his medical needs.  That is the only thing a doctor should want in his medical practice and which the medical profession should look for and in making representations to a lay man, such as the Minister, they should not need to <Col N="248" /> concern themselves or bother to concern themselves with whether the Minister can find the money.  All they should say is &ldquo;We think this is the way we can best treat our sick and if you provide these facilities for us we can guarantee that we will get those who fall sick out again in the shortest possible time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think people will have to start moving with the times.  I think the Minister is in a very fortunate position now because there is a much better understanding of all these problems than there was in the past.  In the first place, he should have less opposition from the members of the medical profession than he had in the past, from the general body of doctors at any rate.  The hierarchy may still make rude noises at him but he need not bother about that very much because the general body of dispensary doctors and practitioners and working surgeons and physicians are changing rapidly in their attitude.  Many of them have experience of the national health service in Britain and are primarily interested in their medicine and surgery and anxious to look after their charges under reasonable financial conditions with a reasonable return for the energy and time which they have put into the study of their profession.  Most of them would be very happy to know they could begin to work in an organisation in which they would be able to treat the person who was sick with the best possible medical care and send the bill to the Minister or the local authority and let them look after it instead of pestering the unfortunate patient who has enough worry in that he is out of work and has no income coming in.  That is sufficient worry without putting on him the additional cost of medical or surgical care which is a great worry to so many people at present.</P>
    <P>I was very deliberate when I was in the Department to make no attempt to spend money on the dispensaries because I hope the day will come when we will be able to do away with them and compensate the men who have been appointed to these posts and worked so long under their conditions of service.  I hope it will be <Col N="249" /> possible to do away with them and create a free no means test health service on the same lines as we have operating under the infectious diseases regulations.  Implicit in that is a free choice of doctors.  I believe, as I have said, that there will be very much greater sympathy for the Minister in his attempts to provide such a service. I think also that during the ten year period in which this great national debate on health services has gone on we have had a wonderful opportunity to educate the public.  The public now know that radical changes are needed and they are pretty clear about the types of changes they want.  The Minister is going to find himself in a much more satisfactory position than virtually any of his predecessors in bringing in the quite considerable changes which are needed in the health services.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen reports of certain difficulties arising in connection with compensation for the use of land for mining purposes at Tynagh, County Galway.</P>
      <P>Under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 and 1960, the holder of a prospecting licence is given the right to enter on the land described in the licence and to carry out certain operations, such as drilling or boring, in search of minerals.  The question of compensation is involved only in respect of damage or nuisance arising from such operations.  Land owners and licence holders may agree on the amount of compensation but, in the absence of agreement, a procedure is available under the Act by which the issue may be referred to the Mining Board which is an independent statutory body.  If agreement is not reached in the case which the Deputies have in mind the question of compensation can be submitted for independent determination in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> The present position in regard to the mineral deposits at Tynagh is that they are being explored by Irish Base Metals Ltd.  under the authority of a prospecting licence.  As this is a private concern it would be inappropriate for me to make any statement in regard to any plans which they may have for the exploitation of the mineral deposits at Tynagh.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce this: supposing the owner of the land and the owner of the prospecting licence do not reach agreement and extensive damage has already been done to the land land and is now being done to the land and they apply for arbitration, is there any provision whereby the prospecting company is required to deposit with the Minister a sum adequate to meet any possible arbitration award which may be made under the Acts referred to by the Minister?  Is the Minister aware that on a previous occasion, the details of which I brought to the notice of his Department, a mining company did enter upon lands, did considerable damage in the course of their lawful activities under the Minister's licence and, when the time came for arbitration, the company had left the country?  While the possibility of an award subsisted, the person against whom the award would be made was gone.  Can the Minister give these people any assurance that the mining company will be required to make a deposit with him in a sum sufficient to provide against any award that the Mining Board might make subsequent to arbitration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will remember that this particular aspect of the granting of prospecting licences was discussed at length during the passage of the 1960 Bill through the Dáil.  I cannot say whether it is as a result of that discussion or as a result of previous experience, but there is provision whereby the Minister can attach to any licences the condition that certain sums be deposited in advance of the issue of prospecting licences.  That condition is imposed in respect of companies whose resources may not be known to our Department <Col N="257" /> but is generally not attached to companies about whose <i>bona fides</i> and about whose standing we have knowledge.  Generally speaking, a deposit is required unless the company is of such high standing or has assets already in the country.  That has been done on almost every occasion on which a licence has been issued recently.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. I understand that the investigations at present being conducted in Britain are at an experimental stage.

The Broadcasting Authority is paid a grant equivalent to the total of the receipts from radio and television licence fees less expenses of collection and any expenses on prevention of interference with radio and television reception incurred by the Post Office. In 1962/63 it is expected that these expenses will amount to £145,000 as compared with gross receipts of £1,020,000 from licence fees.

      <P>The enrolment of pupils at the school has increased recently and the provision of additional classroom accommodation arises.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 53, 54 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>The question of a pardon for a convicted person arises only where it is shown that the person was wrongly convicted, that is to say, that he was not guilty of the offence or offences of which he was convicted.  There has been no such case in relation to convictions by the Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>As regards mitigation or remission of penalties, the position is that there has recently been a general amnesty under which 24 prisoners convicted by the Special Criminal Court (as well as five others convicted of similar offences by the ordinary Courts) were released, the balance of their sentences being remitted.  Before that, there had been three individual cases where the balance of sentence was remitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from penalties that may be imposed by the Court, Section 34 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, provides, in substance, that any person convicted by the Special Criminal Court of scheduled offences automatically forfeits any employment under or pension from the State, a semi-State body or a local authority and is disqualified for a period of seven years from the date of conviction from holding any such employment. Accordingly, all Government Departments have been notified by my Department of the names of the persons convicted and their attention has been drawn to the provisions of Section 34.  Each Department was also <Col N="278" /> asked to arrange to convey this information to the semi-State bodies or local authorities with which it is concerned.</P>
    <P>This notification was, of course, an ordinary administrative act which was necessary to enable Departments and other bodies to discharge their obligations in the matter.  These obligations, as I have indicated, are statutory&mdash; they arise from the terms of the section itself and not from the notification that emanated from my Department.</P>
    <P>The duty to give effect to the section rests with the particular Department, semi-State body or local authority that may be concerned and, apart from the issue of the notification mentioned, I have no function in the matter. Accordingly, my Department's records do not show with certainty how many persons were affected. They do show, however, that the list of convicted persons includes three employees of semi-State bodies and one employee of a local authority.  All four were amongst those who got the benefit of remission of balance of sentence. It is unlikely that there are any others.  I am not in a position to say if there is any case where a pension is affected but no such case has come to my notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nearly thirty organisations or bodies have made representations or passed resolutions calling for changes in the present opening hours. I should say, however, that some of them did not suggest any specific alternative and in other cases it would be a matter of opinion whether the changes suggested would mean additional hours or merely different hours.  In some cases, too, the representations were concerned primarily or entirely with extensions for holiday resorts.</P>
      <P>Of the bodies concerned, about a dozen were local authorities (including four county councils) and, of course, their resolutions on the subject are public knowledge.

Nevertheless, I do not think that I would be justified in naming the organisations or bodies concerned without their consent, as it is, I think, in the public interest that any organisation should be able to express its views to the Minister on a confidential basis, whether those views are for or against any change in this or any other law.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I moved to report progress, I was putting down for the record the facts in relation to certain matters to which advertence was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the knowledge that the Minister undertook to come into the House and apologise if the information he had given to the House was inaccurate.  However, he will have the opportunity of reading that information and I trust he will be as good as his word.  It cannot be denied that up to the period of the war, the Fianna Fáil Party had done nothing in relation to non-contributory old age pensions, that during the war, in rural Ireland, a temporary allowance of 2/6d. was given, in addition to that old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even giving Fianna Fáil the credit for that temporary allowance and making it permanent as was done not by Fianna Fáil but by the inter-Party Government, it is only now in this Budget that they have succeeded in bringing the figure of increases provided by Fianna Fáil to old age pensioners in rural Ireland up to the figure <Col N="284" /> of increases provided by the inter-Party Government in the two periods in which they were in office.  I said before I reported progress and I repeat now that these were the figures: up to the eve of the Budget, Fianna Fáil had brought in increases only to the extent of 7/6d. and with this increase now of 2/6d., they have reached equality with what was done by the two inter-Party Governments in that respect during their two periods of office.</P>
    <P>In view of the statement made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; I have no doubt himself misled by the figures he was given&mdash;it is well that the truth should be put on the record and the details are, of course, in the remarks I made earlier.  Similarly, it is desirable to repeat particularly for the benefit of Deputy MacCarthy, who is now here, the figures in relation to housing expenditure for Cork Corporation, because again the Minister for Industry and Commerce was inaccurate in his recollection in that respect. The facts are that in each of the three years in which I was responsible, Cork Corporation received more money from the Government for housing expenditure than they have received in any single year since, that in the last year about which the Minister for Industry and Commerce spoke, the expenditure of Cork Corporation on housing of the working classes and under Small Dwellings Acts loans was £758,585.  That was reduced in the next year of Fianna Fáil administration to £638,986 and again reduced in each of the two following years to just £500,000, a reduction of approximately £250,000.</P>
    <P>Again, I have no doubt that when the Minister for Industry and Commerce goes to verify the figures, as I hope he will verify them, he will find that my figures are correct and that his recollection was incorrect.  Perhaps Deputy MacCarthy will also take the opportunity of going back to see if these figures are right.  If he can show me in any way they are wrong, I shall have great pleasure in withdrawing them, but I know they are the correct figures.</P>
    <P>There has been since then a campaign of fraudulent misrepresentation, <Col N="285" /> deliberately created in the first instance by the present Minister for Agriculture, then Minister for Local Government, and other Deputies on that side of the House who did not go into the accuracy of the figures.  They took what he produced instead of getting figures correctly from the records.  These are the correct figures and I may say for Deputy Sherwin's benefit that the figures in relation to Dublin Corporation show exactly the same ratio as the figures I have mentioned for Cork Corporation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall explain the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell the Deputy what the circumstances were. The circumstances were that Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe were clamouring all over the country that there was no money to be got.  The facts were that in those years they were getting over £1,500,000 more money than they were given by Deputy Dr. Ryan.  Deputy Noel Lemass and Deputy Briscoe deliberately went out on a campaign to prevent people erecting their own houses under the Small Dwellings Acts.  They said the same amount of money was not being provided and in fact, as I said earlier, in 1955 and 1956 over £4,000,000 was provided and in 1957, £3,625,000.  In the first year Fianna Fáil came back the amount was £2,165,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us deal with the remainder of the country because there may be Deputies in other areas who may equally have been misled.  In 1956-1957, Local Loans Fund issues over the whole country were £10,998,000. In 1958-59 and again the following year, they had come down to £6,500,000.  I admit freely in the case of the country Local Loans Fund issues were not needed to the same degree, because in many rural areas at that time the housing drive had provided the accommodation that was necessary for the moment.  I make no comment whatever as to whether sufficient was being provided or not. I think in relation to outside areas perhaps there was a very definite case to make that the housing needs for the moment had been met.  All I want to <Col N="286" /> make clear is that the amounts provided bear no relation at all to the facts and figures indicated in good faith, but with wrong information, by one of the Ministers of the Government.</P>
    <P>One of the things noticeable about this Budget when it was introduced by the Minister was the lack of all planning. In any Budget, it is clear that we want to do something more than a mere exercise in arithmetic.  We want to do something more than merely provide the Minister with the money that comes in, on the one hand and goes out, on the other.  Budgets should have a plan running through them to influence the trend of economic affairs in the right direction, but the peculiar thing about the Budget to which we listened just before Easter was that there seemed to be no plan at all in it.  There was no overall instruction as to the manner in which the Minister wished to influence the trend of economic affairs.  The Budget should be one of the main instruments by which that trend is influenced, but I cannot find any sign of purpose, or any sign of direction, or any real indication from the Minister that he has any ideas constructively to help in pointing the way in which our economic affairs should be directed.</P>
    <P>All of us will accept that the main overriding consideration in our economic affairs at the moment must be the influence the Budget will have on the preparations we must make for our entry into the Common Market. In that connection, I think the record of this Government is lamentable. Before I go on to deal with the Common Market fully, I should like to know why no direction is given in the Budget with respect to the Common Market.  The Minister did make a reference in the end of his speech to the possibility that there might be revenue difficulties ahead in relation to our conformity with conditions in the European Economic Community.  That is in direct contradiction of one of the papers published by the Economic Research Institute. I think it was that by Mr. Nevin in which he said that one thing that was quite clear from the nature of our <Col N="287" /> tariff and customs duty schedule was that we would not have very much difficulty in relation to the operations of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to reconcile the two approaches.  My understanding of the difficulties is that they arise more from the fact that we obtain an appallingly high percentage of our national tax revenue from one single commodity, tobacco, and that we are exceedingly vulnerable, far more so than any other country, to any change there may be in the smoking habits of the consuming public.  The Minister correctly said in his Budget Statement that he had to advert to the possible changes in the smoking habits of the people because of the medical reports and that they might have a great effect on his revenue.  I think it would be true to say that it is that difficulty of taking so very much, about 25 to 26 per cent, of our central Government revenue from one single item that causes the anxiety to which the Minister referred at the end of his Budget speech.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Common Market, I do not see in this Budget any evidence at all of a plan or a scheme or even a genuine desire to mark the direction in which we should go.  I know that £300,000 is set aside for industrial reorganisation, but is there anything in the Budget to assist agriculture this year more than any other year?  Is there anything in the Budget that will help agricultural marketing? We know the fiasco there was in relation to £250,000, the windfall receipt of 1957, which was assigned to agricultural marketing improvements. That money was all spent without any new markets being obtained and without any improvement in marketing methods being achieved.</P>
    <P>A very useful little booklet was published the other day called <i>The Exporters Review</i> which gives information in graph form.  I find that the graphs implant the information much more firmly in my mind than the reading of statistical tables.  I know that some other people do not like graphs but they always bring things home more clearly to me.  It is quite <Col N="288" /> clear from that booklet and the information in it that the real increase in our exports in 1961 over 1960 was in the agricultural field, that the increase in the manufacturing field was of virtually little consequence compared with that in the agricultural field.</P>
    <P>The increase in the exports of live animals was from £44,000,000 to £55,000,000 and the increase in the exports of foodstuffs from £43,000,000 to £55,000,000, compared with an increase in the exports of drink and tobacco of a couple of hundred thousand pounds.  The increase in manufactured goods, excluding drink and tobacco, was from £32,500,000 to £34,600,000.  We have got to have exports to live and survive as an economically viable entity and yet agriculture and live animals, which did give us that additional increase in 1961, have not received any incentive, any job in the arm, to ensure that there will be an increase in production.</P>
    <P>We hear very often from the Government benches about the great things promised and carried through in their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion.</i> In relation to live animals, we know that cattle must be the mainstay of that section.  We know and are glad to see that there has been an increase in pig and sheep populations but it is not with the pig or the sheep that the real fundamental basis of the economy will lie.  It will lie with cattle and that is quite right.  The objective of policy was set out on page 50, &ldquo;to increase cow numbers progressively to at least 1,500,000 by 1964&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, we know that there has been only a trifling increase, that we are miles and miles away and have no hope whatever in the two years to 1964 of reaching that target, no hope of acheiving the objective set out on the same page of adding 50,000 heifers per annum to our breeding stocks.  In that really fundamental part of the effort to expand our economic future, the vital sector of it, the cattle sector, there has been an abysmal failure. Either the Government did not mean what they said when they published this in 1958 or else they must admit that they failed in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> There has been no real upsurge in that line which could bring us any hope for the future in relation to the volume of output from the number of cattle.  Why then did not the Minister in this Budget, when dealing with and considering certain aspects of agriculture, do something to get that desirable objective?  Why was he satisfied merely to have the objective laid down in 1958 and forget all about it in 1962 when it appeared clear that the hope that by drifting along we could get to that target was utterly futile?  In agricultural production, that is the main sector in which we are likely to find in the EEC that there is a real opening for us.  In regard to that opening there has been complete failure both in Government policies up to this and in this Budget to provide any incentive towards arriving at the 1,500,000 cows which we need in order to be able to build up our stocks adequately to take advantage, in the first place, of the fact that so many more acres of land have been brought into production and, in the second, adequately to take advantage of the modern knowledge that the land can carry more than was formerly the case.</P>
    <P>It is an unhappy fact that the basic number of cows has stayed static or virtually static all through the years. The only reason we have more cattle in recent years is because of the success in reducing the death rate of young cattle through modern medicine and through the new look given in that respect to veterinary approaches by the Department of Agriculture by Deputy Dillon in 1948.  We know the position as it was then and the change that has been brought about in reducing the mortality in livestock since then with the aid of modern methods and the intensive approach by the veterinary profession to the problem.  But there is nothing in this Budget to get over the hump; nothing to get us to the position of being able more adequately to meet the challenge of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Deputy J.A. Costello referred this morning to the first report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee in that regard.  Without going into any arguments about the amounts available or <Col N="290" /> anything else, it is perfectly clear that the provision of the amount provided by the Minister for Finance in the form of a calf subsidy would have had a far better effect on national productivity and would have had it in a manner that could not be challenged by any other country as subsidisation of exports and unfair dumping.  The Minister failed to do that.</P>
    <P>In regard to agricultural exports we must, for the remainder of this year, face considerable difficulties.  I think everybody agrees, and, in fact, the sample census published from January makes it clear, that there were fewer cattle in the country at that time.  More cattle were probably exported in the first quarter of this year than would normally be exported because of the effect of the subsidy ending on 31st March.  Yet, in spite of that acceleration and, perhaps, anticipation of exports in the first quarter of this year we find domestic exports were virtually the same as in the corresponding period last year.  I do not know if the Minister has reason to believe that they will hold up to the same figure but it seems quite certain they will not provide that buoyancy necessary to offset the impact of additional imports.</P>
    <P>Additional imports were slight in the first quarter but if the change in the terms of trade, which was so apparent up to the end of November, were to continue I am afraid the Minister would find himself in considerable difficulty and would very much regret that he had not done something more positive to assist agriculture in the Budget by means of the incentive rather than by taking what has been described as the easy way out.</P>
    <P>In the years that lie ahead I think we shall find that the greatest tragedy is the manner in which the Government have failed to take adequate steps in time&mdash;let me stress that&mdash;to equip ourselves for Common Market competition. This morning the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that my criticism of the Budget was that the steps taken in the Budget were too little and too late.  I corrected him then and I correct him now.  I think they were too late and too little.  The &ldquo;too late&rdquo; is far more important than <Col N="291" /> even the &ldquo;too little&rdquo;.  I think the Treaty of Rome was signed on the 25th March, 1957, as far as my recollection goes.  As far as we can see, no step whatever was taken by the Government in relation to preparation for our possible adhesion to the EEC until June or July of last year.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to answer this one simple question: Will he put on the Table of the House any directive that he or the Government gave to any State company to prepare the way for a possible adherence to the EEC by this country between the time his Government came into office in March, 1957, just before the Treaty of Rome was signed, and the Budget date this time last year?  Will they make available the terms, the directives they gave to any State company in that period, showing they were alive to the possibilities?  Then the public will be able to judge.</P>
    <P>I venture to say from all the inquiries I have been able to make that not until this time last year did the Government even give a thought to the possibility that Britain and, therefore we, might join the European Community.  I believe what happened was that the Government thought it was not only unlikely but impossible to contemplate that Britain would join the EEC and accordingly no steps were taken.  I believe that the rush at the very end, in June of last year was because they suddenly found all their concepts were shattered and they then had to do in a very short space of time what should have been done over the years.</P>
    <P>I know there is at least one Statesponsored body&mdash;the reason I mention State-sponsored bodies is that I am judging the attitude of the Government in relation to these bodies as their general attitude in relation to the problem as a whole&mdash;which was told before we left office in 1957 to start thinking in terms of looking for European markets in the belief that there would be a wider concept of Europe in the years ahead.  So I ask what directives were given by the Government to think ahead, once the <Col N="292" /> Treaty of Rome had been signed after Fianna Fáil came back to office.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, little or nothing was done until this time last year and then a hurried patchwork quilt had to be prepared.  Certain high officials of the various Departments, for whose competence I have the highest admiration, were locked up for a week-end to try and make good for the Government their failure to anticipate a political decision, as it was.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce and I referred this morning to the Committee on Industrial Organisation, the Report from which is published at Paper 6,510 of February last.  Every lead, every word of that report, accentuates the tragedy that this or some similar Committee were not established long before they were.  In the first page alone I note this sentence: &ldquo;New arrangements like development councils or industrial research associations might be worth examination.&rdquo; Of course, they might it the Government had done their duty in preparing the country for the Common Market.  Not only would it be worth examination in February, 1962, but the examination would have been concluded and we would have known where we stood.</P>
    <P>The report states that action was urgent for three reasons and this again bears out the tragedy it was that some body like this Committee had not been put in charge of considering the problem long before.  Paragraph 13 of the report says: &ldquo;Any additional State aid should, therefore, be introduced as soon as possible and we recommend accordingly.&rdquo;  Why?  Because of the delay in the starting of the consideration of this problem.  Again on Page 13, the Committee refer to the urgency of what they call a crash programme of re-equipment.  Why?  Because the Government slept while all their neighbours were re-equipping and re-tooling at a rate that may, unfortunately, have repercussions here for many years ahead.</P>
    <P>Again, in the last paragraph of the report, the Committee say that the Revenue Commissioners should examine the practicability of a <Col N="293" /> scheme.  It is highly desirable that the Revenue Commissioners should examine the practicability of a scheme but it is not on the eve of our entry that this should have been examined. It should have been examined when the Treaty of Rome was signed.  In such an event the examination would not be merely continuing now but would have been concluded and the necessary action would have been taken.</P>
    <P>The whole of this Committee's report&mdash;and they do make certain worthwhile suggestions&mdash;is underlined by their acknowledgment and acceptance of the fact that they themselves realise they have been put into the position of being too late on the scene and they have had, on that account, to indicate a crash programme.  To do what?  It is a crash programme to rescue industry from the failure and the ruins of the Lemass policy which is written into the first sentence of this Committee's report: &ldquo;In their present state, many Irish firms and industries could not survive freer competition from imports&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Lemass policy was one of ensuring, whether by assistance of high protective tariffs or limited quotas, that there would not be that competition which alone, perhaps, in any industry or in any sphere of life, provides the urge to improvement, the urge towards ensuring that industry moves ahead all the time rather than that it should stand still.  There must be attempts to improve technical training at all levels. Are we not leaving it very late to improve our technical training at this stage, on the eve of our access, six months after the Government applied, and rightly applied, to join the European Economic Community?</P>
    <P>I have referred already to the phrase about things that were worth examination. The same applies in that respect but when one reads this report, there is one thing that stands out in it in every page, that is, the sense of urgency the members of that Committee felt about getting things rectified and made ready.  This was not intended to be a political report; it was intended to be a realistic report about the necessity <Col N="294" /> for industrial action to fit in with new conditions in Europe.  I am afraid that even since that report was published, there has not been enough determination, or a lead given by the Government, to ensure that the country as a whole, and industry in particular, will be able to prepare for the very considerable strain there will be in ensuring that tariffs are cut down to the common level by December, 1969.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, and indeed I think the Minister for Finance also, in his speech or perhaps on the radio&mdash;I think, in his speech&mdash;said that if industry took up more of the benefits from the Budget than would cost the Central Fund more than £100,000, the Government would be very glad.  I say that the incentives are too small and the Government's own estimate of those incentives is that they will cost only £100,000.  That is the Government's estimate, and the only incentive they have provided in the Budget for industry to meet the challenge of the Common Market is something that will cost £100,000.  I did not put it at that and we on this side of the House did not put it at that.  The Minister and the Government did, and that small estimate is the only thing they are doing.</P>
    <P>That is their estimate of what it is necessary to do.  That is their estimate of the urgency of the crash programme of re-equipping and remodernisation even in the Budget.  A fortnight after the Budget, certain of the incentives announced to enable industry to meet the Common Market challenge still are not known and cannot be obtained.  The bodies through which they are to be distributed and administered have not yet got all the information necessary from the Government to disseminate to the public.  At least I am assuming that.  If they had got the information, they would disseminate it, but they are certainly not disseminating it, and the only assumption I can make is that they have not got it from the Government.  The urgency of the matter is such that I am sure that those who are to administer it would announce immediately <Col N="295" /> that the information had been made available to them.</P>
    <P>As I say, one of the tragedies is that it has not been brought home by the Government&mdash;and it is their duty as the leaders of the country to bring home&mdash;to industry and industrialists the essential nature of the task we have to undertake to increase productivity, if we are to succeed in increasing our standard of living. Indeed, I saw an article the other day written by a certain industrialist in the kept paper of the Minister for Finance and his colleagues in which this gem appeared:</P>
    <P>If it is the policy of the country to increase the standard of living without taking productivity into consideration, well and good.</P>
    <P>I should have thought it would have been obvious&mdash;I see a certain Deputy has come into the House&mdash;to anyone with any intelligence that you cannot increase the standard of living without increasing productivity, unless we discover, suddenly, overnight, a whole lot of new national resources.  As that person is one of those who were responsible in another sphere for losing some £2,000,000 of the taxpayers' money, perhaps I should not judge him by too high a standard of knowledge.</P>
    <P>Again, the Budget provides nothing in the nature of new incentives towards savings.  I said earlier today &mdash;the Minister was not here but I think he would not disagree with me&mdash; that the difficulties in 1956 were caused by three things: the change in the terms of trade, the decline in savings, and the fact that production did not equate to the increase in incomes in 1955.  In relation to the latter point, the Taoiseach himself has said that he is worried about the same situation applying now, following last year.  He put that on record.  Since last November, only one month's terms of trade have been published, that is, the December figure.  Probably the Minister has a later figure than I have, but the April <i>Economic Series</i> published only the December figure.  Up to last November, the terms of trade were <Col N="296" /> gradually worsening for us month by month.</P>
    <P>There remains the third question, that is, savings.  Savings have been excellent, but to ensure that there is not the same combination of all three again, it would have been highly desirable had the Minister in his Budget done something to accentuate and improve savings and the incentives towards savings.  The Finance Act, 1956, I think, provided help for the small saver by ensuring that the first £25 of a certain income that was received would not be liable to tax.  An extension in that respect in this Budget would not have cost very much and would have been a worth-while pointer along the right road. It would also have ensured that the volume of savings would not merely stay up, but would increase and offset any difficulties there might be in that respect.</P>
    <P>While I am talking about that, may I refer particularly to the Third Report of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  At page 18, paragraph 47 it states:</P>
    <P>that the taxation Commission should be asked to report as a matter of urgency on the possibility of encouraging enterprise by changes in taxation and of increasing tax incentives for the investment of savings at home, for the investment at home of past savings now held overseas and for the attraction of foreign capital.</P>
    <P>As far as I can remember&mdash;I stand to be corrected by the Minister if I am wrong&mdash;I have never seen any report of any action along that recommendation since that time.  As I say, I stand to be corrected because it is very easy to check a document and see what a document says.  It is not always so easy to make a negative search that there has not been anything since. But I cannot see any evidence that in relation to saving that recommendation of the Capital Investment Advisory Committee has been put into operation.  If I am wrong I shall be glad if the Minister will correct me and indicate what it is and the effect it has had.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="297" /> I had intended to make some reference to the urgent necessity there is to have an incomes policy here, an incomes policy, which, of course, means very much more than merely a salary or wages policy, but, perhaps, in view of the fact that at the moment it might be taken as referring to something else, I will defer comment in that respect to the Finance Bill when we all hope that the present difficulties in that respect will have been overcome. I do not know whether I should mention this in relation to the Minister or whether it would be more a matter for the Taoiseach but bearing in mind that our whole economic fabric must be coloured by and dependent on our approach to the European Economic Community, does the Minister for Finance not think it is desirable that there should be a revised issue of the White Paper put before the House on the 30th June last year? We have since then had the agreement in relation to agricultural policy in the Community and the lines laid down which the policy is going to follow. We have had the revision in respect of the initiation of the second period in January of tariff reductions and there have been some further considerable additions since then.  I do not think it is right that the country should be left in the position of depending for its information entirely on newspapers and on publications by the Irish section of the European movement or similar bodies.  There should be a factual revision of that White Paper and it should be published pretty soon.</P>
    <P>I differ with certain of the analyses drawn there.  Some of them are, in my opinion, not as clear as they might be because, for example, one can always take different approaches to the manner of estimating the price of products as to whether they are ex-farm or ex-factory.  But leaving that to one side, I pay tribute to the manner in which that White Paper was produced through the incompetence of the Government at such dreadfully short notice but now that we have had a year in which there have been considerable further movements it is desirable that there should be a new publication <Col N="298" /> and a revised up-to-date publication to show what has happened since then.</P>
    <P>I should like also to have heard from the Minister what his anticipations are in relation to costs in the year ahead. After the war we had a type of inflation which arose from the pull of excess demand: shortages of goods for a considerable time afterwards and money chasing which resulted here in a pull on external assets to some degree.  That is not the present position. The present inflation, if it is going to arise, and certainly it looked very definitely a couple of months ago that it was certain to arise, is more a cost push inflation, as it has been called, an inflation that is arising because of internal factors in cost and because those internal factors in cost have not been met by productivity.  The desirability of some authentic forecasting in that respect is quite obvious to everybody. That is not a matter in which taxation can provide any offsetting remedy because, while taxation could provide an offsetting remedy in relation to the consumer purchasing power, it is the salary and wage before taxation that is the operative factor in a cost push inflation and where we are going to go in that respect will very vitally govern our efficiency and our competitiveness in the new Europe.</P>
    <P>Some people have said from time to time that some form of inflation is the price of growth, that you cannot have stability without economic stagnation. The Minister for Finance in his Budget speech in one place expressed the hope that people would keep prices stable and take their benefits and their improvements otherwise.  Virtually every government in Europe, and almost in the world, has expressed that hope and all have had to abandon it long, long ago and we are likely to be getting back to one of the earlier stages of Keynesian theories saying that we will not have some economic growth without some consumer spending and pushing demand in that way.</P>
    <P>The Minister in reply to a question of mine on the 29th of March acknowledged that in 1962 in central taxation he had taken a greater proportion of gross national product than in any <Col N="299" /> year since 1953.  I accept what the Minister has said from time to time that it is not the amount that is actually collected in taxation that matters so much as the rate of the percentage of gross national product.  As the Minister himself said on the 29th of March and the 5th of April, this last year he took more in central taxation, expressed as a percentage of gross national product, than had ever been taken in the past ten years.  A higher slice of the gross national cake was taken by the Government.  I do not think that is anything of which any Minister for Finance should be proud.  The increase from 18.6 per cent. in 1961 to 19.6 per cent. in 1962, and particularly bearing in mind it was the first time in those ten years that the percentage taken by the Government of gross national product ever rose over 19 per cent., is something which, to put it mildly, is unfortunate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to make this reference, because of certain matters, raised by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in relation to employment. The booklet <i>Economic Statistics</i> made it clear, in Table 16, that the number of persons at work in the main branches of non-agricultural activity, even in 1961, is less than it was in 1955 and 1956.  We have heard from time to time comments from Ministers that there was a decline in agriculture all over the world and that they should not therefore be blamed for the decline in the number of people employed in agriculture.  But it is to non-agricultural activity I am referring, and the increase there has been in 1961 over 1962 is in sharp contradiction to the promise made by Deputy Lemass, as he then was, in 1955 and repeated by him in 1956 and on several occasions that if only Fianna Fáil were allowed into office, they had a plan, a scheme and a policy properly drawn up which would ensure they would provide 100,000 extra jobs within a period of five years.</P>
    <P>That has been denied both by the Taoiseach himself and by the Minister for Transport and Power.  It is suggested that they were only proposals, that it was not a policy, that <Col N="300" /> it was never something on which the Taoiseach really relied.  I do not know anything about the inner workings of the Fianna Fáil mind or of the workings of the mind of the Taoiseach, as he now is, when he was producing that document, but it is not what was in his mind when he was producing that document which matters.  What matters is the representation he made to the country and the manner in which he got the country to believe. The manner in which he got the country to believe was perfectly clear when he spoke at Listowel and said that Fianna Fáil had published proposals to reduce emigration and to create the same conditions of full employment as obtained in Britain and other European countries.  That was on 13th February, 1956.  Again, in Cork&mdash;I cannot remember whether Deputy MacCarthy was in Cork city at that stage or in a rural constituency: no; I beg your pardon; it was a by-election, but no doubt Deputy MacCarthy was aware of what his colleagues were saying in that by-election in Cork city&mdash;they made it clear that the new Fianna Fáil plan proposed an increase over five years of 100,000 in the number of new jobs. I do not see anything about &ldquo;tentative proposals&rdquo; and &ldquo;possible suggestions&rdquo;&mdash;two expressions used by the Government since they got there.  They told the country that they had a firm, categorical plan, and it was on that basis that they put these representations to the people.</P>
    <P>We are told now that, apart from agriculture, there is an upsurge in employment.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce on television used figures for manufacturing industry alone, as he told me here today; but he got his questioner to put it to him that it was employment in all aspects of national living.  The questioner, we know, was at one time a Fianna Fáil candidate, so he must be in on the secret.  But, in fact, it is not only in agricultural employment there has been this catastrophic reduction.  There has been a slight increase this year, but in non-agricultural employment we are not back to anywhere near the 726,000. There were 710,000 in 1961.  Yet, according to the calculations made by <Col N="301" /> Deputy Lemass, as he then was, we should be, on that basis, at over 800,000 people so employed now.  That is quite apart from the fact that at that time Fianna Fáil never made it clear that the numbers engaged in farm work were, in their opinion, likely to decline, as they have declined during the six years they have been there.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Opposition and talking about emigration, they always said that passenger movement indications were not of any value.  I remember a certain elderly stateman, who has now travelled to other spheres, saying from that bench there that the passenger movement figures were not any real guide to emigration at all, that of course there was plenty of emigration and that the fact there was a decrease in passenger movement&mdash;not merely a decrease but an end of emigration in that year&mdash;was simply nonsense. Now the passenger figures are quoted as gospel&mdash;they are better than the Bible&mdash;to give an indication.  I think they are some indication, but only an indication, but what I cannot understand is that equally an indication is the number of people who apply for new jobs in England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion of the Government now is that emigration was reduced to such a degree in 1961 that our people were not going and they quoted the passenger movement figures in support of that.  I want to know why they say that as against 1959 when more Irish men and women in 1961 applied for new insurance cards in England than applied in 1959.  I know people change their jobs&mdash;we all do.  They changed them in 1959 as well as in 1961.  All the Government's boasts and statistics are of no avail until they explain why more people applied for new insurance cards in 1961 than applied in 1959.  The Government admitted there was heavy emigration to England in 1959.  That was part of their case&mdash;that there was emigration in 1957, 1958 and 1959 and that they had now improved the position to such a degree that they alleged the natural increase in population had beaten <Col N="302" /> emigration.  If they admit that there was heavy emigration in 1959, why is it in 1961 that the number of people seeking new insurance cards in Britain was higher than in the year in which they admit there was heavy emigration?  One has only got to travel the countyside, to see the number of homes shut up, to see the number of young people who have gone.  You speak at chapel gate meettings to audiences preponderantly in the higher age group, higher age group children and very thin in between middle-aged.</P>
      <P>That is not the way to build up a healthy, thriving community.  Certainly, we shall not build it up by pretending that our problems have been I cured, by trying to hide our heads in the sand and by neglecting to do anything about our problems until it is much too late to do it efficiently and efficaciously, as the Government did in relation to the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this is a good Budget.  I do not propose to dwell on all its facets and details.  I listened to the arguments for and against the Budget.  It reflects very clearly the financial position of the country.  It indicates the confidence of the Minister for Finance in the buoyancy of our revenue.  It indicates his desire to leave money to our producers and wage-earners to spend in their own way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was light on taxation and that is as I should like to see it. It is easy for Deputies to ask for more benefits and, at the same time, for less taxation.  I was appalled, on Budget Day, to see Fine Gael and Labour vote against the provisions to meet the benefits proposed to be given to the most deserving sections in our community.  The increase of 2/6d. per week from August next is not tremendous but the very people who have moved motion after motion here to improve social benefits voted against the increase.  Did they hope to precipitate a general election?  One wonders what the reason was for their action.  They would have defeated the Government if they had got the support of all of the Independents.  However, <Col N="303" /> in addition to the Government, there were three responsible Independents. They voted in support of the Government because of their confidence that the Government will legislate fairly for the advancement of the country.</P>
    <P>I shall never be able to understand why the Labour Party, in particular, voted against the proposed increases. I cannot understand why the Fine Gael Party criticises rates relief to farmers.  One can recall many elections which they fought on similar tickets and similar promises.  One wonders whether they have any regard to comparisons with other countries and one wonders about their sincerity when they talk of the position of our farmers if we join the Common Market.  The Opposition must be aware that there is total derating of land in other European countries and that this is a form of indirect benefit to the producers.  Indeed, the Government may have to look more and more to this form of aid to provide an incentive to our farmers to produce more and to take advantage of whatever opportunities may be available in the event of our joining the Common Market.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> Our farmers deserve well of this country and of every Government which will ever sit here.  Our farmers have always played their part confidently and well.  I am quite sure this Government would have liked to see the farmer get more but when all of the benefits given to agriculture are added together they come to quite a sizable bill.  The total aid now given to farmers approximates £35,000,000 which is not an inconsiderable sum. I am sure it compares quite favourably with the aid given to agriculture in other countries.</P>
    <P>There was much talk about the eighth round increase from the Labour benches.  I heard the argument advanced that production has matched the increase.  I would ask Deputies who hold that view to examine carefully what brings about equality in this regard.  Do they consider that the added production is a fair comparison of equality so far as the eighth round increase is concerned?</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 8th May, 1962.</P>
