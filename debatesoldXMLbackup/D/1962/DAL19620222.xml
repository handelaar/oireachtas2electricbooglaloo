      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Moran)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £91,700 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1962, for salaries and expenses in connection with forestry (No. 13 of 1946 and No. 6 of 1956) including a grant-in-aid for acquisition of land.</P>
      <P>When I was introducing the Estimate for Forestry for 1961/62 last July, I informed the House that agreement had been reached with the trade unions concerned to increase the basic wage rates of forestry labourers by 7/6d. a week with effect from 1st April, 1961, and that provision to meet the extra expenditure involved would probably have to be made in a Supplementary Estimate later in the year.</P>
      <P>The effect of the increase in the basic wage rates is the primary reason for the Supplementary Estimate now before the House but some unforeseen excesses are also anticipated on other heads of expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the items in order, an additional sum of £28,000 is required on <Col N="557" /> Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;to meet the cost of increases in remuneration granted since the original Estimate was framed and of additional staff which it has been necessary to recruit.</P>
    <P>On Subhead C.2&mdash;Forest Development and Management&mdash;the Supplementary Estimate provides for additional expenditure of £214,100 on Parts (1), (2), (4) and (5) of the subhead but this amount is offset to the extent of £90,000 by savings on other parts of the subhead, to give a net requirement of £124,100. The over-expenditure on Subhead C.2 is entirely attributable to increased expenditure on labour.  The additional sum being provided for labour in the Supplementary Estimate is £149,000.  On heads of expenditure other than labour, a net saving of £24,900 is expected.  Of the anticipated excess on labour, £84,000 is due to the increase in basic wage rates to which I referred earlier and the balance is attributable to the provision of employment on forestry work at a higher level than expected when the Estimate was being prepared.  When I was introducing the Estimate I told the House that it was framed in the expectation that the average employment level for the year would be approximately 4,700 men.  In fact, the average number of men employed to date has been 4,778 and for the full year the average will probably turn out to be about 4,800 men.</P>
    <P>Despite set-backs due to weather conditions in some areas and the disruption of normal forest operations at a number of centres because of the severe storm damage suffered during the year, work on most forestry operations has been progressing satisfactorily and I expect that the planting programme of 25,000 acres for the year will be fully accomplished, making this the third successive year in which such a high level of planting has been attained.</P>
    <P>The small excess anticipated on Subhead C.3&mdash;Sawmilling&mdash;is primarily due to higher labour expenditure arising from an increase in the wages of sawmill workers.  On Subhead F&mdash; Agency, Advisory and Special Services&mdash;the anticipated over-expenditure <Col N="558" /> arises from the employment of the services of a firm of industrial consultants in connection with the incentive bonus scheme for forestry workers for a longer period than originally expected.</P>
    <P>On Subhead G&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;provision is being made in the Supplementary Estimate for an income of £43,000 in excess of the amount provided in the original Estimate.  Market conditions for all classes of material have been very favourable during the year.  The pulpwood market has been maintained and the increasing volume of material of sawlog size becoming available has commanded a ready market.  Production of transmission and telegraph poles has continued at a high level. Total income for the year is now expected to reach £585,000, almost £130,000 higher than the record level achieved in 1960/61.  There is every reason to believe that the markets for the produce of the State forests will continue to expand and that progressive increases in the allowance for appropriations-in-aid in the vote for Forestry will be possible in future years.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Estimate, the first thing that strikes one is that it is, in the main, an Estimate to enable the Minister to meet the cost of increased wages. <Col N="560" /> Every section of the Forestry Department is concerned in it and one would be in order in offering a few remarks as to the operation of the Forestry Department as a whole.  Yesterday Deputy Mullen asked the Taoiseach a question with regard to forestry and the reply given seemed to me to be an indication that the be-all and end-all of forestry policy in this country is to plant 25,000 acres every year.  If the State is to acquire 25,000 acres of land every year, and we may assume that they will do that, if there is not a change in policy, over 20 years, it means that of the 12,000,000 acres of arable land available in this country, the State will own a considerable portion.</P>
      <P>I am not directly opposed to afforestation, provided the land acquired by the State for that purpose is land suitable for forestry and I am glad to see a considerable improvement in the policy of the Department compared with what it was some years back. Some time ago, the Department acquired all the land they could lay hands on, regardless of whether it was suitable for forestry or not, and it all went into the statistics as land acquired for forestry.  I am glad to see that they are now going for higher land, second-class land and marginal land.</P>
      <P>At the same time, I do not think it is satisfactory that we should have a policy for the acquisition of 25,000 acres of land every year.  That land is coming into the ownership of the State. It means that the Department is making a big encroachment on the land that is available to the individual. It may be very difficult to get private individuals to take up and afforest land. There may be good reasons for that but I have frequently suggested to the Minister for Lands that the Forestry Department should take over land, plant that land and subsequently lay it off when they have developed and planted it.  It could be laid off to private individuals or to local authorities and the Department could act in an advisory capacity, have a controlling interest over it and see that it is properly attended to.  The State should not acquire such large quantities of land and hold it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> The system I have suggested is adopted in practically every country in Europe.  We are adopting a mentality that is detrimental to our national interests, that is that the State should take and keep control of everything. We must have experts controlling forestry development but the Minister should consider that aspect of it seriously.  If the policy is to be continued of acquiring 25,000 acres of land annually, in a generation or so the amount of land owned by the State will be phenomenal.  We are a private enterprise economy here and we ought to live up to that.  I do not see any hope in the reply given by the Taoiseach that we are living up to it.</P>
    <P>The State owns considerable forests now and the State is practically the biggest single marketing organisation in the country.  There are many people in a small way who own sawmills throughout the country and who are endeavouring to buy small quantities of timber.  It may be more economical for the State to sell an entire forest of a couple of thousand trees at a time but an opportunity should be given to the smaller people to purchase what they require.  There is a considerable amount of public money invested in afforestation and therefore the Forestry Department owes a certain duty to the public.  A smaller sawmill owner who wants to buy only 50 or 100 trees should be given an opportunity of tendering for that number.  I have in my pocket a letter from a constituent saying that, owing to being unable to acquire timber, he will have to close and let his employees go.  It does not seem to me that the State would lose very much by selling those small amounts of timber but in any case they would be helping those concerned to buy timber to keep their local little industries going.</P>
    <P>In regard to the overall policy on forestry, I am brought back to consider the heavy territories the Forestry Branch have at their command.  I should like to have from the Minister an indication of policy.  The State forests must now be maturing in many cases, after forty years of our own government, as also must many of the forests acquired from private individuals and there should be <Col N="562" /> considerable sales of timber in the future.  Have the Government any intention of setting up auxiliary industries? The timber accruing from the 25,000 acres planted annually should gradually dispose of the need for the import of thinnings and transplants. Is the Minister satisfied that this timber can be readily absorbed within the State itself where there is a limited market?  I feel that timber is not available to those who wish to sell it wholesale and I want to get from the Minister a reply to the question: Is it intended to set up auxiliary industries in association with forestry?</P>
    <P>I have in mind the Black Forest and the Vosges&mdash;two of the biggest southern European forestry centres&mdash; and associated with them are innumerable small factories making furniture, etc.  I gather those were originally inspired by the forestry departments of the countries concerned and were subsequently opened for the investment of private capital and turned back into private enterprise ventures utilising timber owned by the State.  I should, perhaps, clarify that.  The State does not actually own the timber in those cases but they have a system, to which I have already referred, by which they hand back on lease those forests to individuals and municipalities.</P>
    <P>Those are points I should like the Minister to consider.  If I have been critical it is only because I hold certain definite views.  I do not want the forestry officials to think that I am necessarily attacking them but I feel that over the years forestry policy is not sufficiently directed towards private enterprise and I am still a wholehearted supporter of a private enterprise economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point that pleased me in the Minister's speech is that he told us that this year's appropriation for the Vote will be about £580,000 because&mdash;I am speaking from memory and subject to correction &mdash;in 1948 when the inter-Party Government took over Forestry, the total Estimate for that year was much less than the receipts from Forestry this year.  That is a very satisfactory advance when we are considering a Supplementary Estimate such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="563" /> I should like the Minister to give us some indication of what the outlook is now that we have attained the 25,000 acres a year planting target. Have the Government or the technicians of the Department been considering whether that is too much, too little or just enough?  That target was set about ten years ago and it is certainly to the credit of the Department's officials that it has been achieved because the planting of 25,000 acres a year may seem very simple but for those engaged in it, the purchasing of land is a slow and tedious operation. So is the raising of the necessary transplants, the draining, the fencing and the laying of roads and various other operations connected with Forestry.  It is all very well for us to talk of 25,000 acres a year or 100,000 acres a year but I say that our forestry officials&mdash; and I speak with experience of Scottish foresters, the British, the Swedes and other forestry people in other countries &mdash;can take their place with the best in the world.  They are certainly much better than many that I know of and I want to take this opportunity of saying so in the House.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying, perhaps he would tell us whether we are to stick at the 25,000 acres, neither increasing nor reducing it from now on?  There has been a good deal of nonsensical talk, to which I would advise the Minister to pay no attention, to the effect that the time has now come to hand over some of the State forests to private owners.  If he does that he will kill forestry here once and for all.  We know quite well what private enterprise will do with the forests if they get them&mdash;root them out and plunder them and leave the ground a litter of stumps and rubbish. There will be no talk of replanting. In my opinion the State is the only suitable body and I am even ruling out State-sponsored bodies such as the E.S.B.  The machinery set up and in operation at present is the most suitable method of establishing a sufficient acreage of forest here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke of industries connected with forestry.  Would <Col N="564" /> the Minister tell us what cubic footage is extracted from the forests each year?  The fact that the Minister says he hopes to rake off £585,000 from sales of timber of various kinds indicates that a pretty large cubic footage of timber is coming out of the forests at present.  It would be wise to examine whether the utilisation of the raw material should be left to private enterprise or whether the State should take part in it.  I want to put my cards on the table openly.  In 1956, I think, I visited Sweden to get information on the establishment of pulp mills for the utilisation of the vast quantity of timber due to come out of our forests now and in increasing quantity as time goes on.  I still hold that, without damaging in any way the pulp mills owned by private enterprise, the State is the only proper authority to establish pulp mills to use that timber.</P>
    <P>I want to put this on the records of the House: I should not like to see the day come when, the State having gone to a great deal of trouble and expense, using the taxpayers' money to establish forests, it will be possible for <i>cartels</i> and combines to be private pulp mill owners and the only means of using the products of our forests.  In other words, I do not want the forests established by the forestry people and the politicians to become the prey of a ring, an unscrupulous ring, which would take over the timber and give their own price for it&mdash;a thief's price&mdash;the Minister having no option but to hand it over.  While private enterprise and industry might be able to handle our resources of timber, and so on, perhaps it might be no harm to keep in mind the establishment and running of pulp mills by the Minister and the Forestry Section of the Department.</P>
    <P>A great silence has fallen over the private planting scheme.  That is one branch of afforestation I should like to see going ahead.  All concerned are to be highly commended, and every inducement should be held out to encourage small plantings.  Even the planting of half a statute acre, or one statute acre, by people with small <Col N="565" /> holdings would be of great benefit.  It would be of value as a shelter and in various other ways, apart from beautifying the country.  There are many holdings which have an acre or half an acre which is not much use for anything but timber.  The Minister might tell us what is happening in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister taking such an interest in forestry.  That is a big improvement since the time when he described my humble efforts as the planting of bushes.  Perhaps he can throw his mind back to the time when he used to go around Mayo, having the life of Reilly telling the people I was planting bushes.  Now there is no greater forestry enthusiast than he. I should not be surprised if he came down to Mayo in the State car with a big Scotch fir on either side of the car to show that he was leading us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Certain things happened in Claremorris a short time ago but perhaps it would be more merciful to draw a veil over the whole thing.  As I said, our forestry officials deserve the very greatest credit for the magnificent way in which they have risen to the occasion.  It should not be forgotten that the 25,000 acres we are planting each year represent a strip of country a quarter of a mile wide from Nelson's Pillar to Galway Bay.  That is no mean achievement. Planting 25,000 acres in bits and scraps all over the country and trying to take into account the areas where there is lack of employment, suitability of the land, representing a ribbon of country a quarter of a mile wide extending from Nelson's Pillar to Galway Bay, in one year is no mean achievement.  They have a right to be proud of it and this House and the people of the country have a right to be proud of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be assumed that the money asked for by <Col N="566" /> the Minister is required for the purposes set out in his opening statement. We approve of this expenditure.  The employment which forestry gives to more than 4,700 men is, naturally, a big advantage to the economy of the country.  It is also pleasing to note the recent very welcome improvement in the wage levels of the ordinary worker.  In fact, it is regrettable that the improvement was not greater. Having regard to the increases given to other categories of workers, an increase of 7/6d. was rather small. However, it is to be hoped that, in the not too distant future, further adjustments in the wages of forestry workers will take place.</P>
      <P>In the course of his statement, the Minister indicated that afforestation is moving along smoothly so far as achieving its target of 25,000 acres per year is concerned, and that for the past three years they have attained their objective of planting 25,000 acres each year.  I should like to know from the Minister whether it is likely that that target will be reached in the years to come, because I am doubtful if land for afforestation will become available to that extent.  Indeed, I am rather surprised that during the past few years no adjustment in the price of land to be acquired for afforestation has taken place.  Having regard to present money values, the maximum price allowed by the Department of £10 per acre is, in my opinion, entirely too small.  I am hopeful that when the Minister presents his main Estimate later on in the year, there will be an upward trend in that price level. Everyone knows that land of any reasonable fertility is worth much more than the maximum price of £10 per acre allowed by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the acquisition of land, it must be admitted that the Department was rather fortunate in acquiring land cheaply in some districts. I think that a good deal of the land acquired was bought from people who wanted money urgently and had to sell portion of their land in order to get money.  I know a number of individuals who had to part with land which they required themselves in order to have some capital.  I doubt <Col N="567" /> if in future years we shall be able to buy land for the small prices which the Department paid for it during the past number of years.</P>
    <P>As I said, we were bargaining at an advantage.  I suppose we were entitled to buy it at the lowest price possible. I do not disagree with the policy that the officials of the Department buy land as cheaply as possible, but, at the same time, we must be fair and just.  I am very anxious that the Minister should review the question of the price and increase it.  It is surprising how long it takes the Department to do some jobs.  The former Minister has commended the Department and its officials for the great work they are doing and I do not want to take from that in any way, but, at the same time, I think they are moving slowly in some ways.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate why I have put down Questions in this House during the past seven or eight years about the proposed acquisition of an estate in West Cork.  I refer to an estate of more than 820 acres in the Dunmanway district.  We have been told by the Minister and by his predecessor, Deputy Blowick, that active measures are being taken to acquire this estate and that it is hoped that acquisition will be effected in the not too distant future.  That seems to be the usual reply over the years.  In actual fact, the Minister told me in 1960 that the acquisition of this estate would be finalised in the month of August of that year.  That is almost two years ago but of course the Minister happened to be wrong because August, 1960, came and August, 1961, came and still there was no progress made in the acquisition of this big estate in Dunmanway.  I am rather worried about this because I have had repeated representations from workers in that district who feel that if this land were acquired in the near future, additional employment would be provided for them.</P>

      <P>I wonder would it come within the ambit of the Estimate I referred to the system of recruiting workers?  Possibly the Minister would say that there is nothing about that here, either, but all that is incidental to this £91,700 we are asked to pass today.  It has been mentioned that this money is to improve the rates of wages and other items and I think it is not out of order to comment again, as I have already done on a number of occasions, on the recruitment system operated by the Department of Lands.  I have stressed time and again that the employment of workers should be on a fair and impartial basis and that each man is entitled to a fair opportunity of getting any State employment provided in the locality.  It was laid down here in relation not only to this Department but to other State Departments, particularly those giving special employment such as the Department of Local Government, Office of Public Works and the Department of Finance, that workers recruited for State employment should be recruited through the labour exchange and that the most deserving applicant in the exchange should get first preference, if he was otherwise suitable.  That is a very simple procedure. In other words, say, the man <Col N="570" /> in receipt of the highest unemployment assistance in a particular exchange should be entitled to first preference for any employment provided in that area if he is deemed to be a suitable worker.  Of course, the Department of Lands seem to be getting over that by asserting that &ldquo;so-and-so is not a suitable worker&rdquo;.  I am surprised that men whose capacity for work is well above the average and whose entitlement to work, by virtue of the position they hold at the labour exchange&mdash; which is quite evident from the fact that they are the highest on the list&mdash; have been passed over.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his officials should in fairness and justice ensure that whenever employment with the Department becomes available in an area, a fair system of recruiting labour should be applied.  By doing so, they will have the goodwill of everyone because if a worker complains that he did not get employment which he thought he should get but it is pointed out to him that the right of those employed in preference to him is greater, then he will be satisfied, but when you have a position obtaining where possibly you have a single man without dependants getting preference over a married man, you are bound to have difficulties and resentment and bound to have trouble for everyone concerned.  I am hopeful that for the ensuing year the Department will endeavour to have a fair, just and impartial system of recruitment established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indeed pleasing to note from the Minister's statement that the annual income level has now reached a figure of £585,000.  We all hope this figure will increase as the years go by.  Members who have addressed the House on this question have mentioned that there are and should be good possibilities of establishing industries based on our afforestation works.  I represent a constituency where there is a large acreage of land already planted and, I am sure, a reasonably big acreage available for planting and indeed a large acreage of trees which have matured or are nearing maturity.  I wonder then would it be in order to assert that our part of the country would be quite a suitable place to establish an industry based on <Col N="571" /> the products of our forests, in view of the substantial acreage of timber in the Cork South-West constituency.  The Minister knows the extent of the acreage in that area and possibly with local co-operation, which I have no doubt would be forthcoming, a good case could be made for establishing an industry based on our forestry products in Cork West.  I have no doubt that other parts of the country, particularly the big afforestation centres in the West, could lay similar claims.  I hope that will be considered by the Department's advisers.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the number of people interested in the very desirable work of private planting is insignificant. In Cork we made every effort to try to get people interested in it. I thought the grants made available were reasonable: £20 per acre, £10 payable without delay and £10 deferred payment.  Unfortunately, as far as I can judge, the people do not seem to be interested in it.  Whether or not increasing the grant would make them interested, I do not know; possibly it would.  I can appreciate also the difficulty of finding money to increase all these State payments. However, the Minister should again make it known to everybody that it is his desire that people should avail of the grants available for private planting and become more interested in it.  As well as increasing the wealth of the country, private planting could be of great advantage to the individual farmer in that it would have a beautifying effect on the land contiguous to his residence; and I think that we, as the premier assembly of the country, should renew our plea to the people to avail themselves more of these grants.</P>
    <P>I conclude by voicing our support of this Supplementary Estimate which should meet with the approval of every Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the speakers from the other benches in expressing our appreciation of the work of the Minister and his Department which enhances the beauty of our country and increases the <Col N="572" /> productivity of land that in the past was very infertile.  There is, however, some criticism now that the portions of the land being taken could be more usefully employed in rough grazing and so on.  That is a matter on which the Department's officials will, no doubt, exercise their own judgment. At the same time, we cannot overlook the fact that along many of our roadside glens there are stretches of land which were denuded of trees during the last war, and, indeed, the previous wars and that have never been replanted.  They are growing the bushes to which Deputy Blowick referred a while ago.</P>
      <P>There is also a criticism that the prices being offered now are not in keeping with present circumstances and that the land being taken is somewhat more fertile than when lower prices were being offered.  That may be so.  I am sure that, as time goes on, the Department will take cognisance of these changing factors.</P>
      <P>Another criticism is that too many trees of the same variety are being planted, the variation of fir and so on. These trees have very rapid growth, and I think the Department were very wise in planting a very large proportion of them in their early programme. But now there is a feeling that it would be wise to consider the matter anew and to plant other trees for which a market may be available.  I refer especially to ash for hurleys for our national pastime in the schools and various clubs throughout the country. When the late Deputy Seán Moylan was Minister, a big proportion of ash was planted for that purpose.  We must consider that the market is available and that for the root and two or three feet above it in respect of each portion shaped into a hurley, 10/- or 12/- is paid.  These hurleys are very expensive. The rest of these useful trees is then available for other commercial purposes. I would ask the Minister to see to it, particularly in those counties where hurling is extensively played, that a good proportion of ash trees would be planted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taken generally, the Department is now dealing more expeditiously with land offered for afforestation.  In the <Col N="573" /> past&mdash;and I presume at present as well&mdash;there have been difficulties of title and other matters of that kind, which may have impeded the Department in the acquisition of suitable land.  At the same time, I think we can all be satisfied that the Department is working very efficiently, that it has come up to a good average of planting and that it is keeping in mind the establishment of industries which will avail of the clearing of the forests and the trees when they come to maturity &mdash;all to the general advantage of our national economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. T. O'Connor Mr. T. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the various points raised here by the different speakers, if there is any criticism at all, I think it is of the slowness of the programme.  I think we should have reached the target of 25,000 acres at least 20 years ago.  Had we done so, we would have stopped the drain of population from the backward areas. If we had followed an intensive programme of forestry away back in 1925, or even in the 30's, we would have reached the stage now when it would not have been necessary for our population to take to the emigrant ship. After all the work put into this gigantic programme, any suggestion that we should hand over forestry to private interests must be opposed with all the force possible.  We can see from the response from private interests to appeals to plant trees that they have no great interest in that regard at present.  You cannot make commercial interests become interested in planting trees because of the long time they have to wait for a return from the money invested.  Certainly, the State are the only people equipped and if there were private interests who could deal with the matter, you would still have the State exploiting it and you would be only running two enterprises against each other for timber production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy to note that in my county people in mountain holdings are prepared to hand over tracts of higher mountain regions from which, heretofore, they had very low returns. They now see the advantage of getting employment for two or three men out of the house and the added benefit of <Col N="574" /> getting a rather reasonable return in wages.  They are now prepared to hand over holdings which, heretofore, they held on to.</P>
    <P>I agree with the previous speakers who said that we should now begin to look to the time when we should be able to pay a bit more for the land we acquire in view of the rising valuation of everything.  That would, as well, bring more of the land that we need into afforestation.  However, I do not agree that we should hand over any land that we have acquired.  The State should, in my view, hold on to the land they have for all time.  It gives continuous employment in the areas concerned and can be looked upon as a little industry in the rural areas where such enterprises are so necessary.</P>
    <P>One Deputy raised the point of the possibility of selling timber in smaller lots.  I do not think the Department should have any great difficulty about offering trees in small parcels of 250 and certainly under 500.  It would give a chance to the smaller man in the area concerned to avail of this timber.  The Department are to be congratulated on the efforts they have put into this excellent scheme of reafforestation and we can only hope they will keep on with the good and useful work.  In a short number of years we should not only be able to meet our entire requirements but possibly have a good quantity available for export.</P>
    <P>As regards the type of trees most suitable for planting in this country, it is well known that we can successfully grow only a number of varieties and still get a return within a reasonable time.  Some trees do not thrive so well here.  The spruce variety seems to be the most suitable and the quickest coming to hand.  I should like to repeat, in conclusion, that this is a very good industry and to point out that in my own county, at least, there will be considerable parcels of land becoming available in the higher mountain regions.  With the acquisition of these we can look forward to the day when we shall see large tracts coming in to give valuable employment <Col N="575" /> to people living in poor holdings who could not hold out except for the availability of some form of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with some of the Deputies who spoke but certain points were made with which I do not agree.  One thing we must admit is that the Forestry Branch are doing really good work all over the country and, at the same time, giving much needed continuous employment to a number of men.  The main problem that arises in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim is in connection with the acquisition of good land for forestry beside small, reasonably good holdings which turn out to be uneconomic because of their size.  Such farmers would be very grateful if the Forestry Branch could see their way to give them even a portion of that good land, lying beside the uneconomic holdings to which I refer.  It would enormously improve the value of and the returns from such holdings.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I have made representations to the Forestry Branch on behalf of this type of person but I have never met with any success.  If we are sincere in our efforts to help the small farmers it would be good policy, in cases where parcels of good land were acquired, to hand over portions of that good land to small farmers living on uneconomic holdings nearby. I have in mind instances of the existence of this problem in Kiltyclogher and elsewhere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the position is now but last year <Col N="576" /> or the year before I was told there was a considerable amount of timber lying in the woods, that there was a set price laid on it and that one could not buy it below that price.  I was told that, consequently, most of that timber rotted.  To my mind, in an area where timber could be used profitably, the Forestry Branch should be disposed to sell any such timber at whatever price they could get it for rather than let it decay.  Recently, a circular was sent to the Leitrim County Committee of Agriculture saying that the Department would always consider representations about particular persons or cases.  I would ask the Minister to see that the suggestion in that circular is carried out particularly, as I mentioned already, in the case of small farmers living beside parcels of good land acquired by the Forestry Branch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that the Forestry Branch are doing trojan work throughout the country.  Already, much of the wastelands and bare mountain tops have become well covered with forests.  Such forests were removed in olden days by alien Governments.  It is heartening to see the success being achieved in this sideline to the country's economy.  We have in the Forestry Branch an excellent body of skilled workers from the very top down to the lowest paid manual labourer.  The suggestion made that the Forestry Branch would hand over to local authorities or some other bodies strips and parcels of plantations would, if adopted, be a retrograde step because I feel that the care of forests in their infancy, and, indeed, until they become mature, is a job for skilled personnel.  Away back years ago, when plantations were set, very often sufficient attention was not given to the subsequent care of the trees and, after 60 or 70 years' growth, they failed.</P>
      <P>Some reference has been made to the acquisition of land.  Indeed, some people seem to be rather worried that we will reach the stage of acquiring and planting 25,000 acres per year; they may possibly be under the mistaken impression that, at that rate of planting, the 12,000,000 acres of arable land in the country will be put under trees.  It would take a very long time for even half that acreage to be planted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> There should be no fear whatever that the rate of planting is too rapid.</P>
    <P>It must be appreciated, too, that afforestation gives employment directly and, indirectly, in the subsidiary industries deriving from it.  However, in the mountainous areas in the west, and in the backward districts where there is poor land, the Department of Agriculture has in recent years been providing fencing grants; these grants enable sheep farmers now to pen their sheep and not have them roaming at will over the vast commonages.  This may possibly lead to more difficulty in the Forestry Branch acquiring more land.</P>
    <P>I suggest that in some of these areas it might, perhaps, be possible for the Forestry Branch to work out a scheme of strip plantations, running, if you like, like ladders to the top of the mountain, with sheep grazing in between.  I do not know how feasible that would be, but it could be tried. It would help not alone the small farmer in ensuring his sheep were properly fenced but it would also provide shelter and protection and improve the grasslands on which the sheep graze.  That is something the Minister might consider in the light of the fact that he is now coming to the target of 25,000 acres per year; he might now examine the position in more detail and see what further improvements can be made from the point of view of afforestation in general.</P>
    <P>Someone referred to the selection of different types of trees.  Selection is a very important factor now.  There are quick-growing trees which are used in the chipboard and pulping factories. It may be essential now for the Forestry Branch to concentrate on certain types of trees in areas adjacent to these factories to ensure an ample supply of chipboard.  There is, I know, a growing demand for Christmas trees. I do not know how the Forestry Branch handles that.  I think there is a fair return.  If thinnings are used to supply Christmas trees, that should represent a saving.</P>
    <P>So far as the overall picture is concerned, it is a very rosy and a very bright one.  Indeed the Minister and his Department, and all concerned, <Col N="578" /> deserve the thanks and congratulation of the nation for putting our country once more under trees, returning it to some semblance of the picture it presented in bygone days when vast forests covered the land, and putting it in a position in which it can supply not only home needs but actually enter competitively into the export market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any money spent on the extension of afforestation and the employment of forestry workers is money well spent.  Judging by the debate today, it would appear more or less that all the experts in forestry, and in everything else, of course, are to be found amongst the Opposition Parties.  It is rather strange that the people have not found that out in the past 30 years and put them into power to implement the schemes they say they would implement if they were in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious that the Minister should get on with the schemes as rapidly as possible.  At the same time, I do not like unfair criticism, and I want to be fair to the Minister.  No matter how little he did, he would still be doing more than some of those who went before him.  I want to ask him now to turn his mind to the west where, so far as I know, there is a problem from the point of view of acquiring substantial tracts of land.  Although the Minister's experts may tell me trees will not grow in the west, it is remarkable that they grew there in the past, long before any of us were born and long before many of our ancestors were born.  If they grew there then, I see no reason why they should not grow there now.  It is strange to read the views of these experts and to be told that the Forestry Branch have no use for lands in certain areas in Mayo, for instance. I do not know on what facts they base these views because, as one travels through the wildest areas in Mayo and looks at any place where an Englishman or a foreigner lived, one sees plenty of trees.  It is strange that trees do not grow around the Irishman's house.  The only conclusion I can come to is that they were not sown to grow.  Surely trees are not so selective in their attitude that they <Col N="579" /> would grow around the Englishman's house and refuse to grow around the Irishman's house.  But that seems to be the fact.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when he is travelling not only through his own constituency but mine, which adjoins it, to take that fact into consideration, because it is a fact, no matter what the experts may say.  The facts are there and the expert view does not appear to be related to the facts. Indeed, we find that the man who is regarded as an expert on bogs is a man who came from far away from the bog. I am afraid it is the same with regard to trees.  But the Minister will see trees growing in the west where they were planted to grow.  The only question that arises is that of protecting them from sheep and cattle, or other animals.  There can be no question at all that, if they are planted, they will grow.  If the Minister takes over land in that area, he will provide considerable employment&mdash;he will have no trouble in acquiring land&mdash;and every year of growth means more employment, and more employment means keeping more people off the emigrant ship.  Any assistance I can give the Minister in any way in acquiring land will be gladly given.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any great dispute about the price of land in the area I represent.  We usually succeed in solving these problems, as the Minister will find out if he examines into the activities of Bord na Móna and the grassmeal company.  I should like him to consider that, despite the acreage taken over already, there are still tens of thousands of acres there to be acquired.</P>

      <P>I agree.  I shall not pursue the point any further, but I would ask the Minister to try to give as much employment as he can to workers in the area.  In the State forests in the Newport area and in the Glenamoy experimental station, he has a good example of what can be done <Col N="580" /> even on the worst land in that area. I ask him to leave no stone unturned in seeking to put as many people as possible into employment in the west.</P>

      <P>Since this is a Supplementary Estimate, I propose to be brief.  There is one matter I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister in connection with subhead G.2, forestry development.  First of all, I should like to say that a certain situation has arisen in my constituency in connection with forestry development and I should like to bring it to the notice of this House.  In west Roscommon, we have a large number of very small holdings ranging from £3 to £7 valuation. In one area alone in west Roscommon, Drumfad, there are approximately 300 holdings under £5 valuation.  To a man in the midlands or the south of Ireland, that valuation must seem very small indeed.  I am sure it would be the view of farmers in other parts of the country, indeed even in the west, that it would be an impossibility for any smallholder in those areas to eke out an existence not to mind give the normal comforts or amenities to his family.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the land in that locality was, I thought over the years, suitable for afforestation.  After repeated urgings on my part to the Forestry Section, they decided to start forestry operations in that locality. Naturally enough, in the initial stages, it was difficult to get the consent of the smallholders to part with their precious little bit of land.  It took many efforts on the part of the local clergymen and other interested persons to persuade the people that afforestation would be of long-term benefit to their families, in addition to giving much needed employment to them in the present.  As a result, a certain amount of land was made available over the past few years for afforestation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Forestry Section co-operated excellently with the local people in the planting arrangements and a nice green blanket of forestry is beginning to stretch in that very desolate and poor area.  The local people are now beginning to realise that this will be <Col N="581" /> of immense benefit to them.  One of the reasons why the local people were persuaded to part with their land was that it would mean employment for them.  When I visited that area last week, I checked on the figures in the exchanges and there were over 100 men drawing unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit.  Some of those men are in the Minister's county of Mayo.  Of that number of 100, I should say that 60 per cent. are married men with families ranging from one to six or seven children living on those holdings of £4 to £5 valuation.</P>
    <P>On the very same day as I checked on the number drawing social welfare benefits, I found the Forestry Section had moved large machines into the locality to carry out the initial preparation for planting.  I am not in any way opposed to the idea of machinery being used when it is an economic proposition and when it does not displace labour in the manner in which it is intended to displace it in this desolate, neglected area.  On the one hand, the Department of Social Welfare paid out last week, perhaps, £150 to enable families in that area to keep body and soul together.  On the other hand, the Forestry Section have brought their whole drainage machinery, these huge juggernauts, into a locality where there is plenty of labour available at a reasonable rate.  I want an undertaking from the Minister before this discussion concludes that those machines will be withdrawn forthwith.</P>
    <P>Up to the present in that area, 290 acres, approximately, have been planted.  The ground has been prepared by labour; the planting was done by labour.  It was only in the extreme corner of one area, a rocky spot, that a machine was used.  If it was possible to carry out this afforestation programme up to a week ago by utilising local labour, I cannot understand why this decision was taken to move in the machinery.  I inspected the locality last week and found that the machinery is now moving into an area which was used for tillage up to four or five years ago, an area where there is no justification whatever for using machines. <Col N="582" /> Somebody may say that machines are more efficient than manual labour for drainage purposes.  I do not think so, in areas such as this.  Proper hand work with experienced supervisors has produced excellent results all over the country and it has produced excellent results in the Cloonfad area up to last week.</P>
    <P>I hope the forestry people will expand in this area in a big way.  However, the Minister knows and all the Ministers who were ever in office know that one of the essentials for afforestation is the goodwill of the people in the locality.  If there is no goodwill, there will be no forestry.  I am urging the Minister to put on his thinking cap in regard to this matter.  He comes himself from an area where holdings are small and from which there has been a great deal of emigration.  I am sure he is anxious to see things done efficiently and at the same time, to see that work is given to the people in the locality.  There will not be goodwill if there are 30 or 40 men standing outside the barracks on a Wednesday or Thursday to sign on and seeing machinery passing by them going up to do the work which they should be doing and which they are anxious to do.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be too hard or to go to the extent of saying the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing but the Department of Social Welfare are paying out funds where there is no work available while the Forestry Section is sending in machinery where labour is available.  I will not accept from the Minister any suggestion that I am living in the past when I say machinery in a locality such as this is not necessary.  I am as anxious as anyone to see efficiency and smooth operations in forestry but it does not take a lot of brains to realise that using machinery in an area where first-class labour is available is non-sensical.</P>
    <P>This problem can be solved very easily by continuing the methods which are in operation even today.  Those machines have not been assembled with their drainage equipment yet.  That would be a simple solution and it would meet with the goodwill of all the <Col N="583" /> people in the locality and would mean greater co-operation in the future in regard to making plenty of land available. I urge upon the Minister to tell the Forestry Section to take out these machines straight away.</P>
    <P>On afforestation generally, I want to reiterate what I have said here for years, that money spent on afforestation is well spent.  It was never more necessary than now.  It was never more necessary than now to plant and to increase the rate of planting from the present 25,000 acres, to get forestry operations going in a far bigger way for this reason, that if we are exposed to the harsh wind of competition from European countries in the areas where smallholders are at present, they will be wiped out unless there is a sideline for them.  There is no greater safeguard for their security on a small holding than the development of a good afforestation programme in the vicinity.  Apart from stabilising the population in the smaller holdings, the future benefits to the State will be immense.  Any time the Minister comes into this House seeking sanction for further expenditure on afforestation, he can take it that he will have my goodwill and assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the wonderful advance that has been made in afforestation.  To have reached the 25,000 acre mark is a great achievement having regard to all the snags that the Minister, his predecessors and the Department had to overcome. The acquisition of land for afforestation in various parts of the country presented difficulties.  A farmer who had grazing rights on mountains and other places, naturally, did not want to lose those rights, did not want to lose his livelihood.  All these considerations had to be borne in mind.  Being a democratic State, the rights of the individual could not be interfered with.  Many difficulties have been overcome and wonderful progress has been made and will continue to be made.  The State has succeeded in doing a good job and I have no doubt that even greater progress will be made in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> I have often in this House appealed to small farmers and large farmers that in the national interest they should become more tree conscious. If a farmer planted only one tree near his home every year our people would come to love trees more.  Deputy Leneghan said that only certain people in Mayo had trees around their homes, that the Forestry Section had stated that this part of the country was not suitable for trees.  It is up to the people of the Deputy's constituency to prove to the Forestry Section that they can grow trees. Our people should become more tree conscious.  In my own constituency of County Dublin, where the land is bad and poor, I have tried to encourage people, especially those living in South County Dublin, to grow at least a shelter belt around their homes.</P>

      <P>I should like to take this opportunity to appeal to our people to become more tree conscious and to plant trees wherever possible and, where feasible, to grow a shelter belt near their homes.  In that way they would be beautifying the country and doing a great national service. They would show the Minister and his Department and the nation that they regarded afforestation as a great national asset.  I hope the people will give every encouragement to the Minister in charge of forestry at the moment.  I wish him luck.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>My speech will be short because Deputy Leneghan has said everything that I had intended to say.  I congratulate the Minister on the good work he is doing in connection with forestry but I am disappointed with the amount of land in North Mayo that has not been attended to.  I refer particularly to the Erris, Achill, Curraun and Ballycroy areas.  These are poor areas comprising infertile land and bog and they are areas where there is no employment.  The Minister might concentrate on getting something done in these areas.  They cannot be so unsuitable.  As Deputy Leneghan has pointed out, trees have grown around <Col N="585" /> houses in various parts of this area. The Minister should try to get more planting done in those areas.  Afforestation is the only source of employment available for those areas.  I am quite sure that trees will grow there.  As Deputy Leneghan has pointed out, trees have been grown in valleys and around houses and I am sure it will be possible to grow trees in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister might consider acquiring compulsory powers to take over land such as commonage.  In the areas that I have mentioned commonage exists to a considerable extent on which 30 or 40 people may have commonage rights.  Some of these people have gone away and cannot be traced and acquisition is held up. Where there is difficulty in tracing the owners and where the owners have left the place the Minister should use compulsory powers to take over the land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a word on this Supplementary Estimate in relation to a few points which concern me as a representative of one of the congested areas in which there is a good deal of forestry activity at the moment, Donegal.  The Minister is to be congratulated on the overall success of afforestation in the country as a whole. As previous speakers have pointed out, we have now reached the stage where Deputies representing rural areas find representations coming from a direction different from that in the past.  I remember when all my efforts were directed towards getting the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands to move in and acquire lands in order to get suitable blocks for afforestation purposes.  Now we frequently have representations deploring the acquisition of land which is required for <Col N="586" /> sheep grazing or other purposes.  That is an indication that the afforestation programme is moving sufficiently rapidly to justify all the hopes centred in it at the beginning.  We have reached the stage when the Minister should take a second look before deciding to acquire large tracts in areas where such acquisition might create hardship although the land may not be immediately necessary for productive purposes.</P>
      <P>There should be more flexibility in the Department's attitude towards the question of exchange.  It may be possible to effect an exchange of a piece of rough grazing for a more fertile parcel of pasture land which is being taken over by the Department.  It may not be entirely the function of the Forestry Section but they could perform a very useful service by paying a little more attention to assisting persons who are anxious to retain their holdings and to improve them.  That could be done by giving the more fertile parcels included in the land being acquired in exchange for rougher grazing in the adjoining tenant's holding which was not being acquired. In that way, I feel they would not merely be doing a good job towards afforestation but would also be assisting towards making better holdings for the adjoining tenants.  I do not think it could be levelled against them as a general complaint that they acquire land in competition with local purchasers.  My experience is that they are reasonably flexible in the matter of surrendering holdings they are about to acquire, if they have not gone too far in the matter of acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometimes, local would-be purchasers of land are prone to hang around to see what price the Forestry people are prepared to offer.  They then move in and offer a few pounds more, in the hope of having the market price fixed, and acquire the holding. For that reason, I think the Forestry people are inclined to be circumspect and sometimes to suspect the <i>bona fides</i> of purchasers of that kind.  There are many genuine cases where local holdings might be acquired by existing tenants anxious to augment their <Col N="587" /> holdings or to improve them by acquiring part of holdings sold to Forestry.  I am sure the Minister would favourably consider allowing a little more flexibility in the matter of permitting the Forestry Section to be ready to exchange small parcels of suitable land with adjoining tenants who wish to improve their own holding.</P>
    <P>In the matter of employment on parcels of afforestation land dotted throughout the country, in the winter time, when unemployment is highest, the Forestry Section should concentrate on having the fullest possible employment during that period.  Sometimes I feel disappointment in relation to areas where land is taken over and the local unemployed expect that a considerable amount of employment will be available quickly.  I appreciate that certain development work has to be done.  I appreciate that the squads engaged in the initial operations must, of necessity, be rather small.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the maximum numbers are employed during the winter season when unemployment is at its height. I trust that the development of forestry will be so arranged as to be able to consume the greatest possible number of unemployed at that particular period.  It is not always possible to do that because certain work has to be done in suitable season, particularly during the planting season.</P>
    <P>I have often felt that if maximum employment were given on all these different afforestation schemes throughout the country during the winter time, it would go a long way towards absorbing the surplus unemployed, the list of whom is at its highest peak in the winter.  In that way, forestry would contribute a great deal to the solution of unemployment in the rural areas at a time when it is most needed.</P>
    <P>I want to stress particularly the point regarding the swapping of suitable pieces of fertile land for less suitable portions that existing tenants may like to have carried out.  Anything the afforestation people can do in that respect would be very well worth considering and would be a very good job, indeed.</P>
    <Col N="588" />
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the anxiety of Deputies, particularly from the west, in trying to get the Forestry people interested in their part of the country.  With increased activity on the part of the Forestry Section, we in Wicklow have now met another problem.  We have been the pioneer county in afforestation.  We now find ourselves with a number of forest centres which cannot expand any further because the land is not readily available.  In recent years, numbers of men have been laid off because the plantable reserve is not there.</P>
      <P>I also know that due to the increase in activities and the increase in the planting rate, there has been a change of policy in the Department, particularly with regard to nurseries.  Where, formerly, we had five- or ten-acre nurseries in most forestry centres, I understand the policy now is to have larger nurseries in the 50- and 60-acre bracket. I strongly urge on the Minister that, if at all possible, in areas where plantable land is not available and where there is a good forestry tradition, we should try to acquire land suitable for nursery purposes so that the labour dispensed with, if forestry land is not available, could usefully be employed in such nurseries.  I understand that the running of these nurseries is highly technical.  In all parts of County Wicklow, we have men with years and years of experience of that work.  It is a pity that their services should be dispensed with and that the Department should lose the years of experience that have been gained in County Wicklow in that field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind my own part of the county, South Wicklow, an area between Ballinglen and Aughrim centres.  A large-scale nursery would certainly solve the problem down there. If such a nursery were established, I have no doubt that there would be, ready-made there, skilled labour, with years of experience in that field, which would make a nursery of that kind economic.  I realise that the Minister has other problems with regard to the acquisition of land in other parts of the country.  However, if a serious effort were made to establish a number of nurseries in County Wicklow, in particular, <Col N="589" /> it would help to solve our forestry problems and the problems we are likely to be confronted with in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, in the first instance, to express my appreciation generally to the House for the way in which the Supplementary Estimate has been received and to express my thanks on my own behalf and on behalf of my staff for the references that have been made generally to the work of the Forestry Division.  While it is true that the debate on this Supplementary Estimate has largely centred around increases of wages under the different headings, many matters of interest have been raised, some of which might more appropriately have been raised on the general Estimate.  So far as I can reasonably cover the matters raised, I shall do so.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde was anxious, and this point was made by others, to know what our policy was as far as the planting programme was concerned and whether the target of 25,000 acres a year was the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of our aims.  I do not wish to put any limit on planting but let me, from my experience and from what I know the position to be, sound a note of warning.  I think that if we are to maintain a steady rate of planting of 25,000 acres a year over even the next ten years, we shall be doing extremely well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are planting now at the highest rate in ratio to our population of any country in Europe.  However, just as in the Land Commission, the easiest portions of our country to come into the forestry machinery have already been planted and the longer we go on, the more difficult it will be to keep the forestry machine geared to meet the national programme.  The average size of the plots coming in for afforestation are getting smaller year by year.  That is not peculiar to this country but the House will realise the immense amount of land necessary to maintain a programme of 25,000 acres per annum and at the same time, to maintain the desirable planting reserve.  The House will appreciate <Col N="590" /> the very big effort required to maintain that programme.</P>
    <P>It is true that in certain areas which were not traditional forestry areas, there is more forestry activity now. Deputy Leneghan mentioned North Mayo and the west.  The work on forestry in recent years has been more and more towards the west and last year approximately 44 per cent. of the total programme took place west of the Shannon.  There is probably a greater potential in the west of what has come to be regarded as forestry land, mountainous and other areas formerly regarded as unplantable.  It is hoped to intensify the tapping of these areas as time goes on.  Notwithstanding that potential, I want to say that from the indications before us, we shall be doing extremely well if we are able to maintain steady progress at a planting rate of 25,000 acres per annum.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputy Esmonde has his own view on the type of land that will be planted.  I want to make clear to the House that the Forestry Division do not plant agricultural land.  Where a substantial acreage of land is taken over, there is an assessment between the Forestry Division and the Land Commission and if a portion of the land taken over is agricultural land, it is handed over to the Land Commission. I do not think the view held by Deputy Esmonde on this issue is generally shared by Deputies.  As far as his view about State ownership of forestry is concerned, I am quite satisfied that my view that this is a job that can be done only by the State is generally shared.</P>
    <P>There are a number of national projects that can be undertaken only by the State and everyone is now satisfied that afforestation is one of them. Private enterprise here has not done very well as far as afforestation is concerned. That is partly due to our general makeup of farm construction. We have not, as they have in Britain, very many large estates left which comprise large amounts of woodland. We have not that general pattern here and while we have urged private planting, the amount carried out has been remarkably small.</P>
    <P>When speaking of private planting, <Col N="591" /> let me say that although progress in that respect was very small before we started the intensified campaign, there has been an increase from approximately 500 acres per annum to an average of over 1,000 acres now.  On paper, that is an increase of 100 per cent. but it is really infinitesimal compared with the national programme. The small blocks of land that are available to the private planter can never be dealt with by the Forestry Department.  These are the areas that we have been trying to get the owners to plant.</P>
    <P>The intensified campaign has not only made our people more forestry-minded but it has a healthy effect in inducing co-operation in getting land for the State Forestry Department, in getting the co-operation of the various local bodies and other parties to persuade common owners to come together and offer comparatively large tracts of land to the State and, I am still confident that, with the grants that are available in the private sector, this increase will continue and that throughout the various counties it will show different results as the time goes on.</P>
    <P>The point was made by some Deputies that in selling timber at the forests, the small man is not catered for.  This, in the main, is not correct. There are local arrangements whereby farmers can be supplied at the local forestry centres.  Where it is feasible, it is the endeavour of the Department to make small lots available.  In some cases, it is not possible to do this where there are substantial stands of timber coming to maturity and being knocked down.  There it is more desirable that one firm should deal with the lot.  It is most desirable from the Department's point of view and from the economic point of view that the one firm, preferably an experienced one, should deal with the lot, both from the point of view of not doing damage and also of living up to their contracts.  Generally speaking, I am assured that the small demands from the man who wants small lots are met and that he gets his opportunity to purchase.  If there is any particular case or complaint on this issue and if <Col N="592" /> it is brought to my notice, I shall try to have it dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick and some other Deputies made suggestions about the Department going more into the commercial or manufacturing side of the business.  I do not share their views except where such a procedure might prove necessary in the national interest.  Up to now, private enterprise seems to be able to deal with the output of our forests.  I think they will be in a better position to do so and to plan ahead very shortly because we have been working on a survey which was long overdue to know exactly what the potential output will be.  This survey is in course of preparation.  The field work has been done and we hope in a very short time to be able to forecast the output of different types of timber say in three years, five years, seven years and so on.  This information will be available to private enterprise and, as in other countries, I have no doubt but every confidence that people experienced in the business will gear themselves for the job of dealing with the potential output we expect as our forests mature.</P>
    <P>In fact, the chipboard development has been based and started on the potential of thinnings coming from our forests and that type of hardboard industry, I am satisfied, will be developed to meet the output and we shall be able to give a fairly accurate estimate of what the output will be as the years go on.  Should it transpire that any particular section of the output is not marketable here, then the Department would have to consider what should be done in those circumstances but where private enterprise is able, economically, to handle the output from the forests, I think that job should be left to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Blowick to state the cubic footage now coming from our forests.  Taking it all in all over the last year, the approximate cubic footage sold was 4.3 million.</P>
    <P>As far as going away from State forestry here is concerned, some suggestions were made that forestry should be handed over to some board or other <Col N="593" /> organisation but I think we all appreciate that we have now gone beyond the point of no return in this matter and that the only people geared to deal with national forestry in the large way in which it is now being handled are the State organistion that we have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick suggested that I was very unfair to him some years ago in talking about him planting bushes and that I was antagonistic to forestry. That is simply not true.  I criticised Deputy Blowick for pretending to be engaged in afforestation when, in fact, he was only buying rabbit wire.  The figures of the national programme under his direction show that in 1948-49 the acreage planted was 7,736; in the following year it was 7,393 and it was only in 1950-51 that it went up to 9,300 acres.  There is some difference between that and the 25,000 acres of planting that is being achieved now over a number of years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy suggests that wages should be adjusted. They have been adjusted from time to time.  Under the Forestry Division practically all workers are members of trade unions and I think this matter should be left to the unions concerned who are quite capable of dealing with it.  They are in negotiation on these issues with my Department at present.</P>
      <P>When Deputies say that the price of land acquired for forestry purposes is too low, let them remember that in the vast majority of cases the transactions are voluntary.  Practically 99 per cent. of the acquisitions have been on that basis and the people who are selling the type of land coming to the Forestry Division are, in my view, the best judges of their own business.  This is a costly operation from the State's point of view and the economics of the whole question must be considered. Of course the price of land is one of the fundamentals in assessing the whole forestry programme and its expenses.</P>
      <P>It is correct to say that in some places there has been some slowness on the acquisition side.  The reason for that is very simply the fact that the Department was not geared for the job and the programme now being carried out and which has been carried out for some years past.  There was, I know, a time-lag between inspections and offers in certain areas.  That is now being eliminated and the complaints of time-lags of two or three years between offers and acceptances will, I hope, now be a thing of the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases, it is true that there was also a considerable time-lag in the acquisition machine on the title side.  We have endeavoured to clear up that bottleneck also, and in commonages where small amounts are involved, a very simple procedure is prescribed.  The Chief State Solicitor has now been directed to dispense with <Col N="595" /> the charge on equities in dealing with titles of this kind, and to accept statutory declarations as to occupancy over a short period of years.  I am now satisfied that that bottleneck has been relieved on the title side, and that the long and frustrating delays that formerly occurred in their elaborate investigations of title, where comparatively insignificant sums of money were concerned, have been dispensed with.  This also will have an overall effect in quickening the acquisition machine, and that is very necessary in view of the tremendous amount of land that now must come in, in order to maintain the national programme.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept what Deputy Murphy had to say about the employment of forestry workers.  In forestry, as in every other business, the forester must be allowed to exercise his discretion to accept what he considers the most suitable type of worker.  I know that we all should like to see a system whereby the man with the highest rate of unemployment assistance is taken on first but sometimes, unfortunately, it turns out that he may not be the most suitable type of worker.  That can happen.</P>
    <P>I believe, however, that, in the main, there is satisfaction with the method of employment.  There will be the odd case where hardship may occur, but, generally speaking, they try at least to take the men from the highest dole level from the employment exchange.  If they find them satisfactory, they try to maintain them, just like in every other type of business or undertaking but if, after trial, men are found to be unsuitable, and if the labour force is being reduced, the people with the highest output or the best workers are naturally kept on.  Indeed, since the incentive bonus scheme was adopted, this system is more intensified because men now just are not prepared to carry what I would call an inefficient man on their team.  It affects their earnings as a whole, and they themselves more or less select the gang to work with them, once they are established at a forest.</P>
    <P>On the question of employment, it <Col N="596" /> has been mentioned here, although some cases may create hardship, that it is desirable that constant employment should be provided for a certain labour force.  I think it is undesirable, if it can at all be avoided, that there should be perhaps 50 men working a forest for four or five months, and then a lot of them laid off.  It is far better by planting planning and work preparation planning to have constant and continuous employment for a force of perhaps one-third or one-half the number.</P>
    <P>It is also true that in this work the men acquire skills as they go ahead and the best opportunity and the best prospects of providing more constant and continuous employment are for the Department to endeavour to build up a large plantable reserve that allows them to plan ahead.  That is good economics and it is good for continuity of employment.  I believe that if we are to get to the stage whereat we shall have a reasonable plantable reserve, there will probably be less complaints such as we have in the House from time to time about letting off men in particular areas. Of course, men cannot be kept on if they cannot be gainfully employed in forestry, as in any other business.</P>
    <P>The question of the quality of land was also raised by Deputy MacCarthy. I think I have already dealt with that matter.  I have not, however, dealt with the question raised by that Deputy, and a number of others, including the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, that is, the question of pressure on the Forestry Section to give bits and pieces of land to local farmers.  This is a question on which I have received a considerable amount of representation, and about which I have been under a certain amount of pressure since I came into the Department.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that, generally speaking, it is not the job of the Forestry Section to relieve congestion, That is the job of the Land Commission. While it is natural to expect that where a State Department has land in any particular area, if some of it adjoins the land of local farmers, they would be anxious to get it, I <Col N="597" /> believe, however, that is a trend which must be generally resisted by my Department.  It is, as I have said, difficult to maintain the intake of land which is needed for the national programme. I have also said that when a considerable block of land comes to the Forestry Section, there is an assessment of that land between the Land Commission and the Forestry Section as to its uses, and the agricultural portion is invariably given to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter which may not occur to Deputies, that is, the question of forestry management.  I know it would be nice, and possibly handy, for some local farmer to get a right of way across forestry property or, as has been sometimes put to me, to give a piece on the side of a hill to a local farmer which he considers arable by his standards and which he says he needs badly, and that this would do a particular job for him; but technically forestry cannot be managed in that patchwork way.  There are many difficulties; there are trespass difficulties, questions of ingress and egress; and there is the fire hazard that arises if that practice is indulged in.  Practically speaking, it is a practice that must be discouraged and resisted by the Forestry Division.  I want to make that quite clear, while, at the same time, saying that where there is any sizeable portion of land taken in, the arable portion is handed over to the Land Commission where there is any question of local congestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy also made the point that too many trees of the same variety are being planted.  That, perhaps, was inevitable in our circumstances and particularly as certain types of pine, pinus contortus, and sitka spruce of certain species, are suited to our land and climate.  It was also, I am sure, necessary for the Forestry Division to consider the economics of the matter and at least to establish something that would give a return in a reasonable time for the vast amount of money from the tax-payer that is invested in this business.</P>
    <P>I agree, however, that we are in a <Col N="598" /> position to take another look at the matter now and outside the question of amenity planting, my Department are considering, where suitable locations are available, the planting of some hardwoods.  It is not, in fact, correct to state that hurleys have been forgotten.  There have been ash plantations specifically to meet the demand by the people interested in having a supply of hurleys available.  Indeed, more ash has been planted over the past few years than has been the case for a number of years.  We are having another look at the feasibility of planting commercial hardwoods.  The time of their return would of course be much longer but we shall now be in a position, considering the amount of the other species planted, to strike a reasonable national balance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dolan made a very interesting point in connection with the planting of mountain areas.  He is of the view that the new fencing grants available from the Department of Agriculture may make it more difficult for my Department to get land in these areas.  I feel that he has some logic in it and indeed I have already had the experience of people being reluctant to hand over to the Forestry Division land which they otherwise would hand over because there is now the possibility of fencing off their neighbour's sheep.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that both sheep raising and afforestation have successfully gone hand in hand elsewhere. The Crofters Commission in Scotland have been particularly successful in this line of procedure.  Deputy Dolan referred to this as strip planting but they have found in Scotland that in the mountainous areas where they have handed over suitable and strategically placed strips of that type of land to the Crofters Commission for afforestation and to the British Forestry Commission, the farmers or crofters concerned were able in some cases to quadruple the number of sheep they were able to run on these ranges, not-withstanding the decreased amount of run available.</P>
    <P>Our people should take a lesson from what has been achieved there and <Col N="599" /> I believe that if the grazing farmers in mountainous areas realise these possibilities, they will not fear the Forestry Division getting interested in their lands.  Rather would they be inclined to co-operate because everything I have learned about this matter indicates that forestry in these areas will not alone be good for the Forestry Division but good also for the sheep grazers concerned.</P>
    <P>In connection with the fears expressed by Deputy Leneghan about the planting of North Mayo, it is true that part of that county was rejected on grounds of exposure and unsuitability. It is also true that much is being and has been learned from the experimental station at Glenamoy and from the work going on at Neifin Beg Forest.  It is now clear from the experiments in Glenamoy that there is reasonable hope of successful planting in some of the wild, windswept areas there and there are in fact places being considered for acquisition in that part of the country now that would have been turned down and would not have been considered a short ten years ago.  There is still a very large potential for afforestation in that part of North Mayo, in the Erris area, and I am grateful for the Deputy's offer to cooperate in every way to get these large commonages into the acquisition machine of my Department.  There are of course some areas on the exposed part of the coast and they, I feel, could not be planted at this time.  Perhaps as time goes on and as the experiments at Glenamoy and Neifin Beg continue, the Department will be in a position to deal with these in some years to come because this is a matter about which nobody can prophesy.  All the experts who were very rigid on these issues, as I have said a short ten years ago, have had to more or less eat their words, so that it is a question of the experience being gained from these experiments&mdash; wind exposure and exposure to the sea &mdash;and as the experiments progress, then more and more of the land now regarded as unplantable will, I believe, be planted.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Brennan referred to the <Col N="600" /> question of nurseries.  In former times there were in use small nurseries scattered throughout the country.  Many of them were unsuitable according to modern technical requirements. The practice now is to endeavour to acquire suitable land of 50 or 60 acres or even more, land that would not only lend itself to mechanisation but would have the particular soil condition necessary for nurseries.  I am advised by the technical men that it is not an easy thing to get land suitable for nurseries.</P>
    <P>I should like Deputies to appreciate that today we need 35 million plants a year to deal with our 25,000-acre planting programme.  That gives Deputies some idea of our nursery requirements.  Planting on such a large scale requires not only an abundance of plants of the right type, but also species that are particularly suitable. We can no longer take a chance on setting poor and indifferent plants. That is why, in view of the magnitude of the programme, the nurseries have had to be reviewed and the best soil conditions and the most suitable nurseries provided.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that some of our nurseries have had to be closed down, particularly if it was not possible to absorb the men concerned into the local forestry centre.  From my experience of the few cases with which I am familiar, I can say the men who were employed in the nurseries were absorbed into other work in the Forestry Division.  However, I would like Deputies to appreciate the new requirements and how essential it is now, in view of the vast planting programme, that we would have the best type of plant produced in the conditions most suitable for our needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan raised a question about Cloonfad.  This matter was brought to my notice during the past weeks.  I happen to know the clergyman who is so vitally interested in forestry development.  He comes from my own county.  I have endeavoured to find out as best I can what substance there is in this complaint.</P>
    <P>On this question of man versus <Col N="601" /> machine I want to make it quite clear that there is no bias in my Department towards machinery.  Indeed, the contrary is true.  I have gone around to the different forestry centres and I have found that the foresters and the men on the spot, generally speaking, have a bias the other way and incline to the view, particularly in regard to drainage, that, depending on the terrain, a better job can be done by experienced men.  Before dealing with this specific matter raised by Deputy McQuillan, I want to make it quite clear that there is not, in fact, a bias toward mechanisation generally in the Forestry Division.</P>
    <P>As far as I can ascertain from the reports before me, which I carefully examined, the only plot concerned at Cloonfad, in regard to where this complaint about mechanisation was made, is in the townland of Cuilkeen.  My report states that this plot comprises only 45 acres.  Of that 45 acres, my technical advisers tell me, 37 acres must be mechanically ploughed or otherwise the ground would be completely unplantable.  I am also informed that the remaining seven and a half or eight acres are capable of being worked by hand, but are, however, intermixed with the 45-acre plot. Therefore, if machines had to come in at all to deal with the preparation of 37 acres out of 45, it would be impossible for them to operate without dealing with the odd few acres remaining capable of manual working.  If the assessment of the situation I have received is correct, even if the seven acres were manually dealt with, it would mean just one week's work for five men.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I know that of the total area planted in the Cloonfad area this year, it would have been quite impracticable to deal with two-thirds of it without mechanical ploughing. Generally speaking, mechanical ploughing is used only where essential, and I would like to kill this belief&mdash;it is not generally held but it is held in some quarters&mdash;that mechanical ploughing is being used by the Department solely for economic reasons and to oust manual labour.  I am satisfied taking the whole picture that, but for <Col N="602" /> mechanical ploughing, the labour force would now be substantially less than it is, because a large percentage of the land planted would be incapable of plantation but for mechanical ploughing.</P>
    <P>That is the factual assessment of the complaint I received and which Deputy McQuillan voiced here.  In case there could be any mistake I have directed a senior officer to have a look at the situation, the <i>locus in quo</i> to see if a wrong assessment could possibly have been made.  Everybody is human and mistakes can be made, but I must say from my experience in my Department the assessments made by the men in the field who send in reports are generally correct.</P>

I have stressed the difficulties I forsee in maintaining this very large national planting programme of 25,000 acres.  May I now appeal to every Deputy, in his particular <Col N="603" /> area, to endeavour to co-operate with my Department in inducing common owners to come together and put at the disposal of the Department the large stretches of common which, in nine out of ten cases, are now unused by the vast majority of owners and which are therefore going to waste throughout the countryside?</P>

It is not an important point, but you are not in fact changing all the titles to the title &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, because in the Second Schedule, the short title for the Prohibition of Subinfeudation Act is the Statute Quia Emptores, 1290. There is no uniformity in the use of the word &ldquo;Act&rdquo;.  I think the term &ldquo;Poynings' Law&rdquo; preserves an historical tradition and this is a desirable thing, unless some serious reason can be advanced to the contrary.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy did not hear what I said in my Second Reading speech.  May I repeat part of it on this point:</P>
      <P>The Second Schedule contains certain English statutes which are regarded as having been applied to Ireland by Poynings' Act, 1495. Perhaps a few words about that Act would be appropriate.  Poynings' Act is one of a series of Acts passed by the Parliament convened by Sir Edward Poynings, Lord Deputy, at Drogheda in 1494-5.  This Parliament was called to assist the Lord Deputy in his task of reducing Ireland to &ldquo;whole and perfect obedience&rdquo;.  The terms &ldquo;Poynings' Act&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poynings' Law&rdquo; have been employed ambiguously both by historians and lawyers.  Sometimes they are applied to the whole series of statutes passed at that Parliament, sometimes to one of those statutes &mdash;Chapter 4 of Henry 7 (Ireland)&mdash; which provided that no Irish Parliament was to be held until the proposed legislation had been sent by the Lieutenant and the Irish Council to the English Council and returned under the English great seal; at other times, they are used to indicate the statute Chapter 22 of 10 Henry 7 (Ireland).  The latter is the statute to which the present Bill refers and to which the short title Poynings' Act, 1495, is assigned, putting an end to the ambiguity so far as legal usage is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

Are we to take it now that the title &ldquo;Poynings' Law&rdquo; is to disappear from our language and that the statutory title henceforth will be &ldquo;Poynings' Acts&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is mistaken. I want now to raise a matter of detail. In the First Schedule under the year 1634, reference is made to &ldquo;10 Charles I, c.15&mdash;Maintenance, champerty and embracery; application of English statutes&rdquo;.  We give that the short title of &ldquo;Maintenance and Embracery Act, 1634&rdquo;.  Why is champerty left out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What puzzles me is that it is set out in the title of the Act &mdash;Maintenance, champerty and embracery. That is how it is designated in the English statute.  If it does not refer to champerty, then why is champerty in the second column at all?</P>
      <P>Thirdly, while it may be desirable to bring the titles of statutes up to date, it seems to me that the Minister, in going through these ancient titles, might have selected some which could, with propriety, be repealed and removed from the Statute Book altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it that, when the Minister returns to the charge, he will consider it unnecessary to retain on the statute book 2 George I, c. 16, which he now describes as the &ldquo;Packing of Tallow Act, 1715&rdquo;? There are two Acts: the Servants Act and the Packing of Tallow Act.  However, if the Minister tells me this re-entitlement of Acts is the first step in a general procedure for removing a large number of them from the Statute <Col N="607" /> Book, I am prepared to accept that, but it seems to be a rather roundabout way of undertaking the task.  Why you should not put in a Fourth Schedule repealing all these obsolete statutes, without going through this performance, I do not know.  However, if the Minister tells me he has been advised this is the better way, I am prepared to accept it; but it seems to me to be a left-handed sort of way of going about it.  I still do not understand why the Minister has not included the word &ldquo;champerty&rdquo; in the 1634 reference in the First Schedule.  I should like the Minister to tell me why champerty is mentioned in the second column if, in fact, the Act has no reference to champerty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

There is no reason why it should not go into the Short Title, but, if one wants to make the Short Title short, one naturally omits a word which is really redundant.  Champerty comes within the ambit of the word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to say &ldquo;tut tut&rdquo; to the Minister for Justice. The Minister tells me that, in a statute referring to maintenance, reference to champerty is unnecessary.  Now, some people have alleged against the Minister for Justice that he is a little too facile, too ready to make an answer off the cuff, without strict attention as to whether or not it is wholly correct.  I have defended him against that charge and said that I have always found him to be both accurate and careful.  I am now discovering that he has more than one foot of clay because he has told me reference to maintenance covers champerty, and <i>vice versa,</i> but I find in the Short Title prescribed under Schedule Three, the Maintenance and Champerty Act of 1275.  But that is not all.  Later on, I find the Champerty Act of 1305. Even more astonishing still, I find a separate Act&mdash;the Maintenance Act of 1326.  So the explanation the Minister was gracious enough to offer in respect of the matter raised on the First Schedule with special reference to 10 Charles I, c. 15 does not seem to be as simple as he thinks.</P>

      <P>First of all, in 10 Charles I c. 15 we had of necessity to have the two words &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; and &ldquo;embracery&rdquo; in the Short Title. Because of the particular provisions of that statute, the word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; in the context could be taken to cover champerty.  We are, therefore, justified in omitting it from the Short Title.  When we come to the 1275 statute, that statute deals specifically with maintenance <Col N="609" /> and champerty separately.  It distinguishes between them.  It is, therefore, logical to describe it as we have done.  When we come to 3 Edw.  I and 1 Edw. 3, these are separate Acts dealing with champerty and with maintenance individually.  The justification for using maintenance and champerty in the Short Title of 3 Edw.  I is the construction of that statute which, as I say, deals specifically with both separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill will codify, and in some respects amend, parts of the present enactments relating to pharmacy. Section 2, which will specify the classes of persons who may keep open shop for the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions and the sale of poisons expresses again, with but a few changes, the present law on the matter, the basis of which is the Pharmacy Act (Ireland) 1875. I should explain that, before 1875, a legal monopoly in keeping open shop for the sale by retail of medicines was vested in licensed apothecaries. There were comparatively few of these and great inconveniences thereby arose to the public in many parts of the country.  The object of the 1875 Act, as expressed in its preamble, was &ldquo;to enable persons who, although they do not desire to practise the art and mystery of an apothecary, desire and are qualified to open shop for the retailing, dispensing and compounding of poisons and medical prescriptions, to keep open shop for the purposes aforesaid&rdquo;.  Under this Act, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland was established and the pharmaceutical chemist as known to-day was created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1875 Act was amended and extended in 1890, particularly by the establishment of a grade of registered druggist, qualified to deal in poisons but not in the compounding of medical prescriptions. A further amending Act in 1951 visualised the eventual disappearance of this grade of registered druggist but established a further <Col N="611" /> interim grade known as &ldquo;dispensing chemist and druggist&rdquo; to which such druggists as passed a special examination in dispensing were admitted.  The tangled provisions of all these existing Acts are to be replaced by Section 2 of the Bill, and, in addition, the section will make two changes in the present law.</P>
    <P>The first of these relates to medical practitioners who are neither pharmaceutical chemists nor licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall.  Under Section 30 of the Act of 1875, such a medical practitioner, if he had passed an examination in pharmacy to obtain his medical diploma, has the right, equally with apothecaries and pharmaceutical chemists, to keep open shop for the sale of poisons and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions. There seems to have been considerable doubt, however, as to what an examination in pharmacy entailed.  It has been generally held that medical practitioners who were not apothecaries did not, in fact, take such an examination in the course of their studies and, because of that, the right to keep open shop never became a reality for them. Speaking as a layman, I must say that it does not seem to me likely that the ordinary medical practitioner could, in the course of his much wider course of studies directed to a different end, be trained to anything like the same extent as a full-time pharmaceutical chemist in the techniques and skills required for the efficient practice of pharmacy.</P>
    <P>All things considered, therefore, there does not seem to be any good case for retaining this special provision.  Under the terms of Section 2, I am proposing that it should be removed; but in order to ensure against the deprivation of any legal rights which existing medical practitioners might, in fact, feel that they have, it is provided under the section that any medical practitioner who became qualified or who began his medical studies before the commencement of the Act, and who, in order to obtain his qualifying degree or diploma, has passed or passes an examination in pharmacy, will have the right to keep open shop for the sale of poisons and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> The other change clarifies the position of limited liability companies in the retail pharmacy business.  These companies may continue in the business; but only on the basis that each shop or pharmaceutical department will be managed by a pharmaceutical chemist or other authorised person, as defined, in the wholetime employment of the company.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill will provide for a more adequate measure of protection for the titles under which persons legally engaging in pharmaceutical business normally operate; the titles or descriptions under which they conduct their shops or business will also be afforded the full protection they require.  This, I think, is both reasonable and necessary; for if, on the one hand, we provide that pharmaceutical chemists and allied classes must surrender certain liberties in subjecting themselves to a fairly stringent code of ethical behaviour; if the State, for the protection of the public, compels pharmaceutical chemists and other persons concerned in the compounding, dispensing or sale of medicines, drugs or poisons to be registered in appropriate categories and to pay fees for such registration; if it imposes on such persons certain onerous obligations; and if we expect pharmacists through their Society to provide for the training and examination of candidates for examination; then, in my view, we must ensure that their exclusive right to engage in pharmaceutical business is adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Section 4 re-enacts in an expanded and more explicit form a provision in the 1875 Act which empowered the Pharmaceutical Society to make regulations for the examination of persons wishing to become registered as pharmaceutical chemists.  This power to hold examinations has hitherto been taken as covering all the normal matters which go with the holding of examinations&mdash;such matters as the organisation and conduct of courses of training prior to examination, the appointment of lecturers and teachers in connection with the courses, and the granting of certificates to persons who take the courses and pass the examinations. While this may be a reasonable <Col N="613" /> assumption, I think it is better, as the opportunity has presented itself, to put the matter beyond doubt by specifically providing for all these matters.</P>
    <P>We come now to a number of miscellaneous provisions which, unlike those in Sections 2, 3 and 4, are not&mdash; or are not altogether&mdash;in the nature of codification of the existing law, but make a number of rather important changes.</P>
    <P>Section 5 will give the Pharmaceutical Society power to register pharmaceutical chemists trained and qualified outside the State.  This will empower the Society to make arrangements with pharmaceutical societies in other countries for the reciprocal registration of properly qualified pharmacists.  A similar right already exists in the case of medical practitioners, dentists, nurses, and opticians.  The reason why it does not exist in the case of pharmaceutical chemists is largely a matter of history. The lack of this power has caused difficulty from time to time where licentiates of the Pharmaceutical Society here who go abroad are refused registration, and consequently are debarred from practice as pharmaceutical chemists, on the grounds that pharmaceutical chemists qualified in those countries coming to Ireland are not entitled to registration and practice here.  The recognition of any foreign pharmaceutical qualifications under reciprocal arrangements would be in accordance with regulations to be approved by the Minister.  In this way, uniform standards would be maintained in the pharmaceutical profession here and no danger would arise of the dilution of the profession by inadequately trained practitioners from abroad.</P>
    <P>Section 6 contains a further innovation&mdash;this time in relation to the Society's power to charge fees.  To enable its significance to be appreciated I should first of all explain that there is a distinction between licentiates of the Society and members of it.  A person becomes a licentiate of the Society when he has passed the Society's final examinations and paid the requisite registration fee; hereafter, he remains a lifelong licentiate, with the right to <Col N="614" /> practise, without payment of any further fee.  A <i>member</i> of the Society, on the other hand, pays an annual membership fee and, as a member, becomes entitled to certain rights&mdash;particularly in relation to the domestic government of the Society&mdash;in addition to those which he has as a licentiate.  Under the Act of 1875, the Society has power to charge certain fees&mdash;for examination, licence and registration&mdash;but only <i>members</i> of the Society are obliged to pay annual subscriptions.  The existing powers will be re-enacted under Section 6; but, in addition, a new provision is included, to allow the Society to charge an annual fee for the retention on the Registers of the Society of the names of persons who, for example, are licentiates, but not members, of the Society.</P>
    <P>At present, I understand, there are about 1,100 pharmacists who are members of the Society and these pay an annual fee of 4 guineas.  A further 1,500 pharmaceutical chemists have not chosen to put their names forward for membership and are not therefore obliged to pay this annual fee.  The Society, however, accepted responsibility, not merely for granting diplomas and maintaining registers of authorised and qualified persons, but also for regulating the training of candidates for diplomas, laying down appropriate courses of study and providing these for pharmaceutical students.  In latter years the increasing expense of retaining the requisite academic staff has made it impossible to keep the courses on a self-supporting basis; so they have been provided only at a substantial cost to the Society and its members.  These courses are intended primarily to ensure that only adequately qualified persons will be engaged in the compounding and dispensing of medical prescriptions. But by providing them and insisting that they must be followed by intending pharmacists, the Society operates to maintain the status of the pharmaceutical profession as a whole; and indeed to safeguard the livelihood of every individual practising pharmacist. It would be unfair, therefore, to continue the existing situation; for in it the whole of the financial burden involved in such praiseworthy activities <Col N="615" /> falls only on those licentiates in pharmacy who are sufficiently interested in the prestige and development of their calling as to become members of the Society.  In my view equity demands that the cost of maintaining the status and competency of their calling should be borne by the general body of the licentiates of the Society; and that, as this burden is a continuing one, every person who is anxious to continue in the appropriate register of authorised persons should pay an annual renewal fee in respect of each registration.  There is nothing novel in this requirement.  It is imposed on the members of many professions and trades.  Dentists, for example, pay an annual registration fee; so do solicitors, registered opticians, registered patent agents and others in similar categories where the practice of a profession, business or calling is reserved to persons holding specified diplomas or qualifications.  Subject to approval by the Minister for Health subsection (3) of Section 6 of the Bill will accordingly make provision for levying such fees as may be necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill will provide that the Pharmaceutical Society will henceforth be able to confer higher titles on persons registered by it.  This is in accordance with a similar right which the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain possesses.</P>
    <P>In Section 8, it is proposed to give statutory effect to an agreement which has been reached between the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Apothecaries Hall on the question of the registration of the Hall's licentiates as pharmaceutical chemists.  The present legal position is that, under Section 22 of the Pharmacy Act of 1875, licentiates of the Hall, upon application and payment of the appropriate fee, become entitled to such registration.  Now, whatever may have been the reasons for this arrangement at a time when the practice of pharmacy was still in its infancy and the apothecary had, for close on a century, held the field as the sole statutory holder of the right to carry on retail trade in medicines, and whatever may have been the force of the <Col N="616" /> argument in favour of its retention before the time when the training of pharmaceutical chemists became the well-considered discipline that it is today, there appears to be general agreement that there is no need for its retention now.  The Society and the Apothecaries Hall discussed the whole question in detail and the Hall has agreed upon the cessation of the right &mdash;on the clear understanding, however, that the entitlement of its licentiates to keep open shop for the sale of poisons and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions would remain unimpaired.  This agreement will be given effect to by Section 8.</P>
    <P>It will be provided in the section, by way of a saving clause, that any existing licentiate of the Apothecaries Hall who has not yet applied for registration as a pharmaceutical chemist may do so before the end of 1963; students of the Hall who have already registered, or will have registered before the end of the present year will likewise, in due course, be given the opportunity to become registered as pharamaceutical chemists.  In this way, the rights of existing licentiates and of persons who registered with the Hall in good faith will be preserved.</P>
    <P>Section 9 makes a minor change by providing an alternative of a fine for the present penalty of imprisonment for falsification of a register kept by the Society.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for consequential repeals of sundry provisions of the early Acts and Section 11 for the construction, collective citation and commencement of the Act.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for Second Reading.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be accepted by our side of the House. I am glad to learn that a measure of agreement in relation to the terms of the Bill has been reached between the Apothecaries Hall and the Pharmaceutical Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 4, there is now a very great extension envisaged in the educational responsibilities of the <Col N="617" /> Pharmaceutical Council.  The Council is now given an ethical and an educational control comparable with that of a Medical Registration Council in importance.  It would therefore seem desirable&mdash;perhaps not in this Bill but at some stage soon&mdash;that the constitution of the Council should receive examination.  At the moment, the Council is largely composed of those interested in the retail side of pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Pharmacy now, and increasingly in the future, will be involved not only in industry but in research, in public health and on the educational side. It would appear desirable that qualification for membership of the Council will require examination.</P>
    <P>I am told that, at the moment, any member of the Pharmaceutical Society who is engaged in teaching is disqualified from membership of the Council.  That appears an anomaly. With the great increase envisaged in the responsibility of the Council, it would seem desirable that a change should be made.</P>
    <P>I notice that there is provision for the charging of fees which, presumably, will lead to a revenue to be devoted to educational purposes.  I should like to raise the question of the State's responsibility in this matter. It appears desirable that, if a school of pharmacy is to be encouraged to grow, the State would have some responsibility to make a contribution towards that education and research. It does not appear desirable that the only way in which research and education can take place is by a poll tax on those who are registered&mdash; particularly when I see that the fees are not specified but will eventually emerge in regulations.  It appears not a completely desirable provision.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (1) the normal carry-over of millable wheat by flour and wheatmeal millers on 1st September of each year since 1945, (2) the estimated carry-over of millable native wheat at 1st September, 1962, and (3) the levy payable on a surplus above 280,000 tons of 20,000 tons of native wheat based on the price obtained at home and abroad for unmillable or surplus wheat from the 1958 to 1961 harvests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear what the Deputy means by &ldquo;normal carry-over of millable wheat&rdquo;.  While the licensed millers aim at a carry-over of about two months' supply of native wheat on 1st September each year, the quantity actually carried over depends on the quantity and quality of wheat of the previous years' production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> The quantity of native wheat to be carried over on 1st September, 1962, will depend mainly on the demand for flour during the current cereal year. The best estimate which can be made at this stage indicates that the carry-over will be in the region of 50,000 tons.  If, however, the decline in flour consumption continues, the carry-over could be substantially greater.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the average loss incurred on the disposal of surplus millable wheat of the 1958 and 1960 crops the levy required to meet the cost of disposal of a surplus of 20,000 tons is estimated at 2/- a barrel.  The levy per barrel would of course be higher if the surplus exceeded 20,000 tons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has seen a protest from the National Farmers' Association in which it is stated that the farmer's income is to be reduced still further by the imposition of a levy for the disposal of millable wheat in excess of 280,000 tons dried as against 300,000 tons dried in 1961; and if he will make a statement on the matter having regard to the general dissatisfaction with the price paid for wheat and the fact that growers suffered great losses last season.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no change in the declared policy of the Government, which is to guarantee farmers a price for millable wheat for 75 per cent. of requirements.  There is, in fact, no dissatisfaction with this price.  In 1958, it was decided, as a result of consultations with the growers, to introduce the levy system under which losses on the disposal of home-grown millable wheat in excess of 75 per cent. of requirements would be met by the growers themselves.  At that time, 75 per cent. represented approximately 300,000 tons.  Since then, there has been a substantial fall in flour consumption, mainly because of the increased use of other food and food products, with the result that 75 per <Col N="628" /> cent. of annual requirements now represents, at the most, 280,000 tons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said nothing of the kind.  In all the replies I have given to the supplementary questions and to the principal question, I have pointed out, first of all, that I have no responsibility whatever for the allocation of these contracts. That is the position, and that has always been the position, but when I was invited to do so, I have expressed a personal opinion, not knowing anything about the background as to why decisions of this nature were made. The opinion I have expressed, when asked to do so, as to why the Company tended to give contracts adjacent to the concern is that, after all, production of sugar is a competitive business, and even if the State and the community have fostered it down the years, that is surely no reason why those charged with the responsibility of running it efficiently should not consider the question of cost, competition, price levels, and all the rest.

      <P>Members of the Board are jointly responsible for the conduct of C.I.E.  They are also responsible under the 1958 Act for seeing that C.I.E. becomes economic and there is nothing in the Act which suggests that every particular section of C.I.E. operation need bear the same profit or loss.

      <P>A number of Deputies are raising matters which relate to the general relationship of State boards to the Minister and to members of the Dáil.  The best reply I can give to the House is to ask Deputies to read my general statement on the matter at the conclusion of the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power in which I set out as clearly as I could the responsibility of the Minister in relation to the general supervision of State companies and also the extent to which State companies must be allowed to carry out their duties from day to day without interference.  I must make it quite clear that if State companies were to submit to pressure groups of various kinds on matters decided upon by the Board it would only give rise in the long run to the uneconomic running of these companies and the making of decisions in one way which would have the result of penalising some sections of the community in order to benefit others.</P>

Will the Minister further agree that it was made quite clear by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce when making a case in support of the Transport Act of 1959, that every opportunity would be afforded to representative bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of whether State Boards should yield to pressure groups to alter a pattern of cross-subsidisation as between one section of service or production and another, to alter for example a particular service in operation in connection with the Sugar Company or with other State companies, relates to the fact that the cost of commodities or services must vary from area to area. If a tradition were to be created that members would be able to bring pressure to alter general patterns of working, it could result of course in all the services being uneconomic and in the long run mean that for every person who benefited somebody must <Col N="639" /> suffer.  State companies must be allowed to carry on their activities from day to day.  On the occasion of the Estimate I take very great trouble to answer as many questions as possible on general matters affecting State companies and it seems to me that is the time when these matters should be discussed.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputies are referring to my speech at a recent function of the Federation of Irish Industries.  What I said was that the Committee on Industrial Organisation is carrying out a comprehensive survey of the industrial sector directed towards industrial reorganisation in the context of the Common Market and that the surveys would bring to light facts in particular and facts in general about our industrial set up.  I expressed the view that we should, no doubt, be told by the Committee that some industries are strong and that the <Col N="644" /> Common Market could provide them with the opportunity for which they have been preparing; that others will be shown to be not so strong but to have been making real efforts to improve their viability and to be likely to use the balance of the transitional period to good advantage; that there may be some whose future is not good despite genuine efforts on their part but which would be deserving of Government help; and that there would be likely to be others which would be shown to have sheltered behind protection without attempting to make themselves more competitive and for whom no sympathy need be expected from the Government.  To any such I made an exhortation that they should try to re-adapt themselves while there is still time.</P>

Thus, a person with a farm of £20 valuation in each of two counties gets the full primary allowance on each farm.  Where a man is employed on holdings in one occupation in different counties, the employment allowance may be claimed as if he had been employed exclusively on one holding.</P>
      <P>Legislation on the lines suggested by the Deputy would involve a net loss of agricultural grant to most farmers having such holdings, since any increase in employment allowance which they might gain would, in most cases, be more than offset by the loss of the second primary allowance.

      <P>I am informed that in the areas referred to, Dublin Corporation charged a rate of 2/- in the pound in respect of water supplied by them in pursuance of agreements entered into by the consumers to pay an extra charge of 9d. in the pound over and above the one shilling and threepence limit authorised by the Dublin Corporation Waterworks Act, 1861.  The extra charge was intended <Col N="658" /> to meet the cost of production and distribution of water, which has greatly increased since the limit was set over a century ago.  A number of consumers have refused to pay the extra charge and the Corporation have not found it possible to enforce payment.

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have issued a statement to local rating and road authorities for their information in <Col N="663" /> considering their estimates, that the rate of recoupment from the Road Fund for the maintenance of main roads is being increased from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent., partly to compensate these authorities for the termination of the Estate Duty Grant and partly to provide further assistance in respect of main road upkeep.  The road authorities directly affected by this decision are the county councils, the county boroughs, the borough of Drogheda and Dún Laoghaire and the urban district of Dundalk.</P>
      <P>Urban districts generally will receive 10 per cent. increase in the grants made available to them last year and will also be compensated out of the Road Fund for the loss of their shares in the Estate Duty Grant.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position to announce the full details of next year's allocations shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the ten per cent. will not compensate for the increased expenditure by local authorities on roads because of the increased costs of wages and materials?  In view of the fact that the Minister insists on the local authority finding the money before he will sanction such increases, will he take steps in this year's Budget to compensate them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never suggested the ten per cent. increase is for the <Col N="664" /> purpose of meeting additional costs.  It represents an increase in grants for a job which has to be completed and which is now far from being completed, namely, the improving of our roads. Compensation for wage increases varies from county to county.  So do the actual extra amounts granted to each county vary in relation to the grants we shall allocate.  The latter part of the Deputy's supplementary about compensation is over my head.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will set up a transport research unit to undertake the scientific study of all aspects of traffic and transport problems, with particular emphasis on investigation of road safety measures throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the Dáil Debate on the Committee Stage of the Road Traffic Bill, 1960, in the course of which the matter raised by the Deputy was discussed at length.  As I indicated then, I do not propose to set up a research unit as such on the lines suggested. I have, however, established a separate Road Traffic Section in my Department, whose chief objective at present is the bringing into operation of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as quickly as possible.  As part of their day-to-day work, the officers of this Section study every aspect of the road traffic problem; at this stage in particular, in the course of implementing the Act, they must of necessity carry out a full investigation of specific aspects of road safety, according as they arise on the various regulations to be made.  For example, comprehensive regulations are being prepared on the subject of the construction, equipment and use of vehicles, including their lighting.  This involves research and also consultation with various interests having specialised knowledge in the matter, as well as publication of the draft regulations in advance so that bodies interested in them can make any suggestions <Col N="665" /> they think appropriate.  In connection with the framing of speed limits under Part IV of the Act, in addition to the built-up area speed limit, speed limits for particular classes of vehicle, particularly buses and heavy lorries, are being considered.</P>

      <P>As regards the road factor in accident causation, there is a working arrangement whereby the Garda advise road authorities of road sections with bad accident records.  My Department have framed standards for road improvement which are designed to reduce accidents and improve traffic flow.  Road equipment such as traffic signs helps to reduce accidents and the regulations on that subject are constantly under review.  In the last year amending regulations and an order were made on this subject.</P>
      <P>Special investigations are also undertaken, where such are considered desirable, for example, into the causes of particular types of recurring accidents or into the value of different kinds of road safety propaganda.</P>

This is a question which must be decided having regard to all the circumstances of the individual case.</P>

      <P>It would be quite impossible to furnish an answer to the Deputies' Question as framed, because of the wide diversities between the social security schemes in the two countries. I should, perhaps, mention that there are also wide diversities between the social security schemes of the countries now forming the European Economic Community, and the Regulations on social security which have been adopted by the Council of the Community recognise these differences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to say that the Treaty <Col N="668" /> of Rome entails the establishment of parity in social services.  The provisions of the Treaty on social policy are contained in articles 117 to 128, and are dealt with in paragraphs 73 to 75 of the White Paper on the European Economic Community which was laid before the Dáil on the 30th June, 1961.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the first part of the question is concerned, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to his previous question in November last in which it was indicated that these pensions, in common with other social assistance payments, were increased as recently as August last; that this was the third succesive year in which increases were granted and that they have, in fact, been increased no less than four times since 1957.  So far as the second part of the question is concerned, the answer is in the negative.  The abolition of the means test for non-contributory old age pension would not bring any advantage to the vast majority of non-contributory old age pensioners, over 90% of whom already qualify for the maximum rate of pension under the existing means test, and would involve payment of pension to well-to-do people who are not in need of assistance from the State.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>Forestry statistics are not kept on a constituency basis and it would involve disproportionate expenditure of official time to extract information on the basis sought by the Deputy for the Meath and Westmeath areas.</P>
      <P>In regard to County Kildare, the total acquired at County Kildare Forests up to the 31st March, 1961, was 6,037 acres, of which 5,176 acres had been planted by that date; there are 60 men currently employed.</P>
      <P>From the 1st April, 1961, to date, 184 acres were acquired in the county.  At present, possession is about to be taken of 5 areas totalling 81 acres in the county and there are 16 cases involving a total of 829 acres in which agreement has been reached on price and title is in course of investigation. Seventy-one cases with a total area of 2,100 acres are the subject of negotiations or are at various earlier stages of investigation.</P>
      <P>It would not be possible to estimate when all or any of these areas might be acquired by my Department nor is there any basis on which an estimate could be made of the likely employment pattern consequent on these various acquisitions.</P>

      <P>Would it be possible for the Department, when developing these areas, to co-operate with Bord na Móna who lay off quite a number of men in the winter time?  If the Department could do development work during the winter months, it would greatly relieve the unemployment that occurs in Timahoe and Ballivor.</P>

      <P>Several areas have been considered for acquisition for State Forestry purposes in this part of County Mayo in recent years but many of these areas have had to be rejected because of poor soil quality and extreme exposure.  It may be possible to review a number of these areas in due course when more knowledge of the problems associated with planting on similar peat areas is available as a result of the work being done at Glenamoy and Nephin Beg centres.</P>
      <P>At present, definite acquisition prospects in the Erris area are confined to an area of 1,800 acres at Glenturk Beg, of which it is hoped to take possession next month.  There are a number of other cases at the preliminary stages of investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>A vacancy for subpostmaster is usually advertised at the office at which the vacancy exists and at neighbouring offices.  Applicants are interviewed and the premises offered by them are inspected usually by the local head postmaster who furnishes a report to headquarters.  The report and the applications are considered by a selection board consisting of senior officers of the Department.  In each case the board recommends not more than three applicants as suitable for appointment and I appoint one of the recommended applicants.  Some vacancies are filled by transferring the office to a close relative of the former subpostmaster provided that certain conditions are satisfied.  These conditions are that the applicant is suitable, that the office has been in the family for several years, that it has been well conducted and that the Department is satisfied that no more suitable candidate is likely to be forthcoming if the vacancy were advertised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential qualifications for appointment as a postmaster are that the person be 21 years of age or over, <Col N="682" /> be of good health, character and financial standing, and be able to offer suitable premises for the office. These are minimum requirements and other factors which are taken into account depending on the size and importance of the sub-office business are the person's standard of education, his ability to provide any assistance necessary for conducting the business of the office and his likely aptitude for the work.  A good knowledge of Irish is required for sub-offices in the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Persons in certain occupations are not normally eligible for appointment as subpostmaster.  These include rate collectors, home assistance officers, court officers, Gardaí Síochána, publicans and several others.</P>

These rules and regulations are still in existence and these appointments are made according to those rules and regulations and according to the delegated power the selection board got from the Minister.  I am bound by those rules and regulations and according to them, I make every appointment and have made every appointment since I became Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

The Labour Party are entitled to get the Authority to fix some proportion for the different Parties.  We recognise that each Party is not entitled to the same number of speakers but we have asked the Television Authority to fix some proportion in relation to the different Parties.  I attended a meeting last night at which a letter was read out from the features or programme officer saying he never heard of any proposal about fixing proportions, although the Minister knows that that has operated in the case of election and Budget broadcasts, and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the visit of the Scandinavian group who prepared the Report to which the Deputy refers, I have been having investigation made as to what re-organisation of the College might be necessary, particularly in the section concerned with design, so that the College might be in a position to play the fullest part possible in meeting future requirements.</P>
      <P>As one of the steps towards this end I have in fact appointed a visiting Professor of Design, of high standing, from the U.S.A. before the issue of the Report in question.  It is the intention that this expert will serve in the College for a year and will then furnish his views and recommendations on the College requirements in the matter of design teaching.  I would prefer to await this report rather than take precipitate action on view resulting from what was necessarily a very brief visit to the College.</P>
      <P>It is also to be borne in mind that the Scandinavian Report itself recommends, not the consideration of the College of Art in isolation, but as part of a complex re-organisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

      <P>Slane is one of a number of garda stations listed for early replacement. A site for the erection of a new station was acquired in January of this year and the Commissioners of Public Works expect that the new building can be provided within the next eighteen months.  The garda personnel at Slane have permission to reside out of station and, taking all the circumstances into consideration, expenditure now on improvements to the existing premises, estimated at £500, would not be warranted.</P>

      <P>It is quite unrealistic to expect that there could be any traffic-plan which would eliminate all congestion from the city centre at rush hours.  The volume of motor traffic is constantly increasing, whereas the streets that have to carry the traffic were for the most part planned long before motor vehicles were invented.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, much has already been done in the last year or so in the way of re-routing traffic, the creation of one-way streets, the elimination of parking and so on.  There will, I think, be general agreement that these measures have led to a noticeable and substantial improvement.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will state in respect of each of the last five years the number of applications for political asylum (a) received and (b) granted, stating the names of the countries from which asylum was sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No statistics of this kind are kept but, perhaps, a statement on the matter would help to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> In regard to political asylum, it is necessary to distinguish between those whose life or liberty is in some positive danger by reason of persecution in their own country and persons who, often no doubt for good reason, dislike the regime under which they live but whose position may be no different from that of millions of their countrymen. Again, it is necessary to distinguish between a request from a person who is fleeing from his own country and who, if refused admission at the frontier, is thereby compelled to return to his own country, and a request from a person who is already in a free country and who merely seeks to move from that country to another one.</P>
    <P>Because of our geographical location, we have extremely few requests for political asylum from persons claiming that their life or liberty is in particular danger in their own country and who are in a position that refusal of their request would result in their being compelled to return to their own country.  I should make clear, perhaps, that even in such a case there can be no guarantee that asylum will be granted, though it is the practice to grant it where the applicant's story is believed to be genuine.  The application may be rejected either because there is no reason to believe that the applicant is in any danger or because there is good reason to think that it is not a <i>bona fide</i> application but one pre-arranged by the authorities of the country from which he pretends to be seeking asylum.</P>
    <P>Apart from that category, which, of course, is the one which is generally thought of in the context of appeals for political asylum, we in this country get from time to time applications from or on behalf of persons in one or other of the following categories:</P>
    <P>(a) persons living in some country whose freedom is restricted,</P>
    <P>(b) persons who normally live in such a country but who have left it ostensibly on a visit to some other country and who would prefer not to return, and</P>
    <P>(c)  persons who have permanently left such a country but have not been resettled elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="701" /> In dealing with persons in these categories, it is necessary to bear in mind that this is an emigration country and that, with all the goodwill in the world, it is impossible for us to accept even a significant fraction of those who, given the chance, would no doubt seek to come here. Relative to our resources, our record in this respect has been very good, but it would be unrealistic not to recall the difficulties we had in finding suitable outlets for the Hungarian refugees some years ago and, indeed, it was necessary, in the end, for the great majority of them to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It is necessary also to bear in mind in this context that there are no physical restrictions on travel between Britain and this country and the number of visitors to Britain is such that if we were to allow to remain here anybody who, having entered Britain, crossed from there, alleging that he did not like the regime in his own country and wanted what he called &ldquo;political asylum&rdquo;, we would, of course, immediately have on our hands a problem completely beyond our resources.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's suggestion.  The present rating qualification for jury service in Dublin is £18, and produces about 21,000 jurors, each of whom is required to serve once every three years.  The effect of raising the rating qualification to £30 would be to reduce the number of jurors to about 6,000, each of whom would have to serve more frequently than once a year.

      <P>For some years past, photo-copying work for the Land Registry has been done on a machine provided for the joint use of the Land Registry and of the Public Record Office, and the arrangement has in general worked satisfactorily.  In view of an increase in the volume of business in the Land Registry, a number of proposals relating to working arrangements, including photo-copying arrangements, are at present being examined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will introduce immediate legislation to relieve the Incorporated Law Society of the obligation of contributing £530 annually to the Council of Law Reporting in view of the fact that, while the Law Society undertook that liability in return for concessions granted by the Solicitors Act, 1954, subsequent legislation has imposed additional <Col N="705" /> annual outlay of £500 on the Law Society which was not contemplated in 1954.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The obligation to contribute to the Council of Law Reporting was undertaken by the Law Society as part of an agreement the broad effect of which was to confer substantial financial benefits on the Society.  On present information I am not satisfied that there has been such a material change in the total effect of the agreement as would justify a modification of particular provisions.</P>
