      <P>I am informed that the application in question was made on 5th February, 1962, and that a decision was taken on 20th March, to grant an allowance from 1st April.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the members of a health authority have power under section 4 of the City and County Management Act, 1955 to direct a county manager or chief executive officer to refrain from suing persons for health service charges imposed under section 15 of the Health Act, 1953 where it appears to the members of the health authority that an inordinate number of persons are being sued in relation to the practice prevailing generally throughout the country; and if the members of a health authority may direct a manager not to sue persons for health service charges without the prior consent, by resolution, of the health authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Both of the issues raised by the Deputy involve the question of requiring the County Manager or Chief Executive Officer to proceed in a certain way in the discharge of his functions.  If the members of a health authority were to take action on the lines suggested in the question there might in consequence be an appeal to the Minister for Health under Section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  Having regard to the fact that I might in the future be called upon to discharge this appellate function, it would not be proper for me at this stage, to express a view on the points raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a tobacco firm has advised its customers that the Government this year imposed restrictions on the clearance of tobacco leaf from bond to a level less than the average for 1961; whether this is so; and, if so, the date on which, and the reason why, the restriction was imposed, and the authority for imposing it.</P>

      <P>On the 1st March last, I made an Order directing the Revenue Commissioners to restrict deliveries of tobacco leaf to the quantity which appeared to them to be reasonable having regard to the circumstances. This was a precautionary measure in view of the approaching Budget and was taken under the powers conferred on me by Section 18 of the Finance Act, 1939.</P>
      <P>In carrying out my direction, the Revenue Commissioners controlled deliveries by reference to deliveries over the previous twelve months and in the corresponding period last year. The restrictions will cease as from tomorrow.</P>

The Minister, apparently, has been informed it is the same as last year: in fact it is less.  Would the Minister indicate the circumstances?  Are they that he intends to impose extra duty on tobacco and, if so, does this not amount to a Budget leakage in advance?</P>

The number of cows (including in-calf heifers) has increased from 1,296,100 in 1956 to a record figure of 1,417,800 in 1961, i.e. by about <Col N="1514" /> 10 per cent., notwithstanding the effect of Bovine T.B. eradication measures.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the fact that the Committee on Industrial Organisation has been set up for the purpose of making a critical appraisal of the measures that may require to be taken to adapt Irish industry to conditions of more intensive competition in home and export markets, to undertake an examination of the difficulties which may be created for particular industries and to formulate positive measures of adjustment and adaptation. As the Deputy is aware, the interim report of the Committee has been published today.</P>
      <P>The rhythm of tariff reductions which will apply in the event of Ireland's accession to the Treaty has yet to be determined.  As regards Item (3) in the Deputy's question, I am not aware of any suggestion to make such an adjustment in relation to the internal tariffs.  The dates quoted by the Deputy suggest that the proposed acceleration to which he is referring is that of the movement to the common external tariff.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 39 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A claim for an increase in salary <Col N="1527" /> in respect of unestablished Local Agents was recently discussed at a meeting of the Departmental Council in my Department under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  That Scheme provides that the proceedings at the Council must remain confidential until a decision has been reached on any particular claim.  A decision on the particular claim here in question has not yet been reached, and until it has, I am precluded by the terms of the scheme from making any comment on it.</P>
    <P>Unestablished local agents last received a pay increase on the 15th December 1959, when a pay increase was given to the whole Civil Service. There are no officers in my Department who have not received a pay increase since 1934.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the managers of national schools to arrange their school time-tables in accordance with the Rules and Regulations for National Schools.  Under these Rules, the school-day may consist of a single meeting during which a midday interval of one half-hour may be allowed, or alternatively, of two meetings with a midday break of more than one hour.  In view of the extent to which local wishes should prevail in a matter such as this I do not propose to recommend to managers generally that one system rather than the other should be adopted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The present vocational school building at Westport was completed in 1934.  The building contractor was Mr. P.J. Kelly, Westport.  The County Mayo Vocational Education Committee propose to erect a new building to replace the building referred to and I have given approval to that proposal.  The planning of the new building has not yet been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the Committee's decision to erect a new school building is that the existing building has become structurally unsafe and, in the opinion of the Committee's architect and of the Department's Building Inspector, is not capable of being made sound at any cost.  According to the expert advice which the Committee received from their architect and from a firm of consulting engineers who examined the building, the defects which have appeared are attributable to a general differential settlement of portion of the building, for which it is not possible to ascribe any single cause.  Factors which might have contributed are (i) shrinkage of the sub-soil (ii) additional <Col N="1540" /> weight imposed on the surrounding ground by the erection of a heavy reinforced concrete building at the rere (iii) movement of water in the sub-soil under the foundations (iv) lack of uniformity in the bearing capacity of the ground water under the foundations.</P>

      <i>Economic Growth in</i> 1961</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1961, for the third year in succession, the momentum of economic advance was maintained.  The volume of national production is estimated to have increased during the year by 4½ per cent.  The cumulative increase over the three years 1959 to 1961 was almost 15 per cent. as compared with only 8 per cent. for the years 1950 to 1958.  The rate of growth in 1961 appears to have been at least as good as that of a number of more industrialised Western European countries.</P>
      <P>Our first concern must be to maintain a satisfactory rate of increase in national production.  To sustain our present rate of growth, we must in particular continue to follow sound budgetary and monetary policies, promote higher savings and investment and try to secure that national production is not anticipated by advancing incomes.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Balance of Payments</i>
      </P>
      <P>Despite a widening of the trade gap and some disimprovement in the terms of trade, the balance of payments for 1961 showed a surplus of £1 million. The expansion of the economy during the year took place, accordingly, in conditions of external stability.  It is worthy of note that over the past five years external receipts and payments on current account have been balanced.  External reserves have risen and will serve as a support for future productive development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exports in 1961 amounted to £180 million as compared with £153 million <Col N="1560" /> in 1960 and £131 million in 1959. Agricultural products accounted for the bulk of last year's increase.  Cattle exports rose by £10½ million of which store cattle accounted for £6½ million. The increase in exports of attested store cattle reflects the success of the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme and is a welcome reversal of the downward trend experienced since 1957.  Another substantial increase was in exports of carcase beef, which rose by £6 million.  Exports of butter and bacon, carrying, of course, substantial subsidies, were also higher Industrial exports of many kinds, in particular, textiles, clothing, footwear, dressed leather and machinery, continued to expand.</P>
    <P>Imports increased by a greater amount than exports with the result that the gap in merchandise trade widened by £7½ million.  Most of the increase in imports consisted of capital equipment and materials for the continuing industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>The increase in the import excess was offset by a substantial rise in net invisible receipts.  Net receipts from tourism, travel, etc., went up by over £3 million while net income from investments, profits, etc., was almost £3 million higher.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Production</i>
    </P>
    <P>The main impetus to the growth in national production still continues to come from the industrial sector.  The volume of production in manufacturing industries rose by 8½ per cent. in 1961, following increases of 8 per cent. in both 1959 and 1960.  The rate of increase in 1961 was among the highest in Western Europe and, indeed, the total increase of 27 per cent. over the three years has been surpassed by few Western European countries.</P>
    <P>All the major industrial groups shared in the expansion in 1961.  Large increases were recorded in chemicals, engineering, clothing and footwear, food, and paper and printing.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agricultural Production and Incomes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Agricultural output in 1961 pursued the steady but moderate upward course of recent years.  Net agricultural output increased by about 6 per cent. in value <Col N="1561" /> and by 2 per cent. in volume.  Farm incomes rose during the year by £8 million.  As some running down of stocks took place, there was a greater increase in farmers' cash incomes, which rose by £10 million.</P>
    <P>An important factor in the increase in farmers' incomes in 1961 was the expansion of agricultural exports to which I referred earlier.  Exports of live cattle, beef, butter and bacon increased in total during the year by £19 million. Despite heavier imports of live animals than usual, the substantial exports of cattle and meat resulted in a reduction in the cattle stocks which had been built up in earlier years, particularly 1959.  The livestock enumeration of January, 1962, recorded an estimated decline of 112,000 in cattle numbers as compared with a year earlier.  On the other hand, it was satisfactory to note that the number of milch cows and heifers in calf had increased and that both pig and sheep numbers showed a marked rise.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Formation and Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>Gross fixed capital formation went up by £15 million in 1961 to £102 million, thanks mainly to heavier investment in factory building and larger imports of machinery and equipment.</P>
    <P>Total savings increased by £9 million to £68 million.  The value of the physical increase in stocks in 1961 being £7 million less than in 1960, the rise in monetary savings was of the order of £16 million.  The National Loan in November and the recent Electricity Supply Board issue were both oversubscribed.</P>
    <P>The increases in savings and fixed asset formation in 1961 were welcome. The first report on the Irish economy of the new Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has just been published, makes the comment that a major structural weakness in the economy in the post-war period has been the low level of capital formation, which has represented a much smaller percentage of national production than in the rest of Western Europe.  In 1960, for example, the percentage of national production devoted to the creation of fixed capital assets in this country was 13 as compared with 21 for the countries of the <Col N="1562" /> European Economic Community combined. The increase in investment in 1961 merely raised our percentage to 14.  There is obviously room for a great improvement in the level of capital formation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment</i>
    </P>
    <P>The industrial expansion in 1961 resulted in the creation of additional employment.  The number of persons at work in transportable goods industries in the December quarter was 5,400 higher than a year earlier and 15,100 greater than in the December quarter of 1958.</P>
    <P>Total employment outside the agricultural sector as estimated in April, 1961, was 10,000 higher than in April, 1960.  As the fall in the number employed in agriculture in the same period was some 4,000, net employment rose by 6,000.  This is the first time for several years that the working population has significantly increased. The evidence since April is that employment in industry has risen further.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Unemployment and Emigration</i>
    </P>
    <P>During 1961 both unemployment and emigration continued to fall.  It appears from the net passenger movement figures that less than 27,000 emigrated in 1961, while for the twelve months ended February, 1962, the figure was of the order of 22,000.  As the natural increase in the population is approximately 26,000, these figures suggest that the decline in the population has at last been halted and that, if the recent trend continues, it will begin to rise.  A rising population would have an important stimulating effect from the psychological and social, as well as from the economic, points of view.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Earnings and Prices</i>
    </P>
    <P>Earnings in 1961 showed a significant rise mainly because of the eighth round of wage and salary increases which got under way during the year. In December, 1961, hourly earnings in transportable goods industries were almost 11% above those a year earlier; the increase in weekly earnings was about 8%.  These figures do not reflect the full impact of the recent round as awards have continued to be made in the early months of 1962.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1563" /> Costs have been affected, as shown in the recent upward trend in prices, following a period of stability.  The quarterly consumer price index as averaged for the year 1960 was at the same level as in 1958.  In 1961, however, consumer prices rose 2.7% while the mid-February, 1962, figure registered a further increase.</P>
    <P>It is no part of Government policy to stop anyone from getting the full reward he has earned for his output. On the contrary, the aim of national economic policy is to ensure, by better organised and more efficient use of productive resources, that real incomes and living standards will be progressively raised.  A question might legitimately arise about the timing or amount of particular rounds of wage and salary increases and, indeed, about taking out the whole of the benefit of increased productivity in the form of more money rather than lower prices.  On the whole, however, it must be acknowledged that the rise in the money earnings of industrial workers over the period from 1953 to the beginning of the eighth round, when converted into real terms by allowing for the rise in living costs, was matched by an increase in productivity, that is, in output per person.</P>
    <P>But when we examine the eighth round, we find ground for some concern because the percentage increase in money incomes is higher than the percentage increase in national production. The inevitable consequence is the rise in costs and prices, which is already apparent, and the likelihood of strain on the balance of payments. There is also the necessity for higher taxation to meet the increased cost of public services and to lesson social tensions and inequalities.</P>
    <P>How much more sensible it would be that money incomes should keep in line with national production.  Then prices and costs would not be pushed up, as they are being pushed up at present with risk to our economy at a critical time.  We all know how difficult it is to reverse these upward movements in the level of costs and prices.  It would be much better to <Col N="1564" /> avoid them by ensuring an even upward progress of income and productivity. In this way prices and costs would not be disturbed.  When income increases run ahead of productivity, their real value is necessarily reduced by price increases, so that the gain for the individual is in part illusory, while, for the economy, the disimprovement in its competitive position is unfortunately real.  I have on many occasions emphasised the desirability of using productivity increases to bring about a reduction in prices, especially where our goods are not at present competitive in export-markets. This is all the more desirable as we face the severer competition involved in membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>The difficulties created by the size of the latest round of income increases will be eased provided further claims for increased incomes are deferred until national production has expanded sufficiently to make them possible without another rise in prices. Neither the current rise in prices, due to incomes outrunning production, nor such increase in taxation as may be necessary for the reasons I have mentioned, should justify any demand for a further increase in incomes.</P>
    <P>It is well that there is a growing realisation, in Ireland as elsewhere, of the need to establish a more orderly relationship between increases in incomes and increases in productivity. Some time ago the Irish National Productivity Committee issued a unanimous statement of the principles which should determine the division of the benefits resulting from increased productivity. Subsequently, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers agreed in principle on the establishment of a National Employer/Employee Conference which would meet annually to discuss wages policy in the light of the overall economic position.  I understand that the first meeting will take place soon and I wish it success.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has announced that the industrial relations machinery is being reviewed.  But institutional developments, while desirable, will not be successful unless all concerned <Col N="1565" />&mdash;employers and employees alike &mdash;not only recognise the nationally damaging effects of income increases which endanger competitiveness and external stability, but are also determined to ensure that these will not occur in future.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for 1962</i>
    </P>
    <P>The present year should see a further substantial rise in national output, although the increase may not be as high as in 1961 and may, as I have said, be accompanied by a deficit in the balance of payments.  Last year's rate of increase in agricultural and industrial exports may slacken while imports will probably show a further substantial rise as a result both of the continuing expansion in economic activity and higher purchasing power resulting from the general increase in money incomes.  It will be necessary to watch the situation carefully to ensure that no obstacles of our own making are placed in the path of our economic advance.  If there is co-operation by all sectors of the community in saving a large proportion of their higher incomes, in increasing production, raising efficiency, and generally putting the national interest above sectional interests, we may anticipate another year of progress.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Later Prospects</i>
    </P>
    <P>Looking further ahead, one has to consider how the five-year Programme for Economic Expansion, which came into operation in April, 1959, should be reshaped as it approaches its term in order to meet the circumstances likely to confront the Irish economy from 1964 on.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic Programme</i>
    </P>
    <P>Preliminary work has started on the preparation of the Second Programme. Background information is being collected and the progress achieved under the current Programme is being analysed.  The Economic Research Institute has been requested to study the conditions as to output, employment, investment, external payments, and kindred matters, which would be required by different rates of growth of the economy.  It will not be possible, <Col N="1566" /> however, nor would it be reasonable, to prepare even the provisional outlines of the Second Programme until the negotiations regarding our application for membership of the European Economic Community have advanced to the point at which the conditions of Ireland's entry are established and the adaptations which will be required in industry, agriculture and other sectors can be assessed with some degree of precision.  The industrial surveys which are being conducted under the auspices of the Committee on Industrial Organisation, and the corresponding surveys which are being made in the agricultural field, will provide the necessary groundwork for a considerable part of the new Programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>European Economic Community Membership Application</i>
    </P>
    <P>The future turns so much on the question of what our relationship will be with Britain and the European Economic Community that a few words on current developments in this context will not be out of place.</P>
    <P>In my Financial Statement last year I touched on the consequences for us of the establishment of the European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Association and of any eventual coming together of these two groups.  As the House is aware, there have been major happenings in this field during the past year.  Britain, our principal export market, and Denmark have applied for membership of the EEC and Norway is expected to do so shortly.  Three other countries &mdash;Austria, Sweden and Switzerland&mdash; are exploring the possibility of becoming associated with the Community.</P>
    <P>Ireland applied for admission as a member of the Community last July. A first meeting with Ministers of the Governments of the member countries of the Community took place in Brussels on 18th January at which this country was represented by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The member countries have now requested that a meeting be held on 11th May between their Permanent Representatives in Brussels and senior officials of the <Col N="1567" /> Irish Government for the purpose of obtaining, in preparation for a further ministerial meeting, clarification on certain points of an economic character arising out of the Taoiseach's statement in Brussels.</P>
    <P>These further meetings should clear the way to actual negotiations with the member countries.  The Government&mdash;and the various interests throughout the country which will be affected&mdash;are anxious to know as soon as possible the terms of Ireland's membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>Assuming that satisfactory terms of admission to the Community are negotiated, enough is known at present to enable the general outline of the new environment for agriculture and industry to be discerned.</P>
    <P>For agriculture, there is the prospect of a market protected from outside fluctuations in which stable prices, eventually to be aligned, will rule. These are very considerable advantages which could aid the development of our agriculture.  There are, however, limiting factors which it would be short-sighted to ignore.  The agricultural production of the Community is already such as to meet a high proportion of the needs of the area and is capable of rapid expansion to meet increased demand resulting from higher incomes and a rising population. The levels at which the prices of various products will be aligned within the Community are not yet known.  Furthermore, the Community, while protecting itself from outside fluctuations, cannot close its frontiers with the rest of the world if its external trade is to be maintained and expanded.  These factors, the significance of which varies from commodity to commodity, serve to remind us that adjustments in the pattern of our agricultural production will be necessary to enable us to exploit those openings which will show promise of most profitable expansion.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, once the necessary level of competitive efficiency has been reached by our industries generally, there will be free access to a vast and expanding Community market, moderately protected <Col N="1568" /> against the rest of the world.  In this market, development will be based on the economic allocation of resources and the growth of large-scale production under conditions of competition. Transition to this environment will necessarily involve changes in the pattern and structure of Irish industry.  The range and scale of production will need to be adjusted to a &ldquo;home&rdquo; market many times larger than that to which we have been accustomed.  This does not mean, however, that there will no longer be room for the small firm; efficient small units, both as suppliers of finished goods for consumer markets and as manufacturers of parts required for a more elaborate production system, continue to thrive in the Community.</P>
    <P>I have outlined only the principal factors which will determine the reorganisation to be undertaken in the more important sectors of our economy.  Ultimate responsibility for this task rests with agricultural and industrial producers themselves.  Major decisions will, in general, have to be guided by the conclusions to be drawn from the work of the Committee on Industrial Organisation and the parallel studies and surveys being carried out in the agricultural sector, including industries based on agriculture. I can assure the House, however, that the Government will lose no time in taking any measures, or giving any assistance, which may be necessary to facilitate the process of adaptation and adjustment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Recommendations of Committee on Industrial Organisation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Committee on Industrial Organisation has recently presented an interim report recommending the provision by the State of certain general forms of aid towards adaptation of industry to meet Common Market conditions.  The Committee has made it clear that the prime purpose of its recommendations is to encourage industry to undertake the necessary measures of adaptation in the shortest possible time.  The Government have decided to proceed on the basis of the Committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The principal recommendations are directed towards the important problem <Col N="1569" /> of the adaptation of industry to more competitive conditions.  The Committee proposed that the initial allowances for tax purposes in respect of expenditure on industrial plant and equipment, at present 20 per cent., and on industrial buildings, at present 10 per cent., should be doubled, i.e., increased to 40 per cent. and 20 per cent. respectively.  The Committee also recommended provision through the Industrial Credit Company Limited of loans on special terms for industrial re-equipment.  The loans would cover a proportion, to be settled in each case by the Industrial Credit Company, of the expenditure involved and would be granted only where that Company is satisfied that there is a definite prospect that the re-equipment project will make the undertaking fully competitive.  The special terms recommended are waiver of interest and deferment of capital repayments for up to five years.</P>
    <P>The Committee also suggested a concession designed to encourage joint action by industrial enterprises in such fields as production and marketing. The proposal is that, where two or more enterprises set up a new joint industrial enterprise, each parent enterprise should be enabled to charge against its profits for tax purposes its share of any losses incurred by the joint enterprise in the first five years of its existence.</P>
    <P>Provision will be made for the taxation concessions in the Finance Bill.  The Industrial Credit Company will be asked to make the special loan facilities available and discussions will be initiated on the terms and conditions on which the requisite capital will be provided for the Company.  As these facilities are designed to encourage industry to modernise and adapt itself to conditions of freer trade, they will not, of course, extend to loans covering normal replacements and renewals.</P>
    <P>The Committee also made recommendations regarding industrial grants, technical assistance grants payable by the Department of Industry and Commerce, and marketing grants payable by Córas Tráchtála.  The recommendation regarding industrial grants, which related to certain projects <Col N="1570" /> involving development of existing industries, will be dealt with in amending legislation which will shortly be introduced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The extent and conditions of an improvement in technical assistance and marketing grants are being considered in consultation with the Committee.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that reorganisation of production for greater efficiency would still be an essential condition of national progress even if the European Economic Community had not come into being.  It is made more urgent by the existence of that Community and our desire to become a member of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has already announced that any forms of State and made available as a result of the Committee's recommendations would be granted in respect of measures of adaptation taken on or after the 14th December, 1961.  Effect will be given to this decision.  As these aids are aimed at quick results, they should clearly have a limited period of currency.  I propose that the taxation incentives should apply to expenditure on equipment, plant and buildings, and to joint enterprises formed, up to 31st March, 1965, and that the special re-equipment loans should be available in respect of projects approved by the Industrial Credit Company up to the same date.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II. CAPITAL BUDGET, 1961-62</P>
    <P>The outturn on Capital Account last year is shown in Table II of the Tables in connection with the Financial Statement.  It will be seen that the capital requirements of the State and other public authorities came to £57.2 million as compared with the Budget estimate of £55.5 million.  This close correspondence of the totals occurred despite variations under individual headings.</P>
    <P>The more notable increases were £3 million for agriculture, mainly for guarantee payments on fat cattle and beef exports, over £800,000 for grants and credits for industry and almost £500,000 for television development. <Col N="1571" /> Items on which expenditure fell short of estimation included Irish Shipping and the Electricity Supply Board, the reduction in each case being due to delays in the incidence of payments. Building and construction work was short by £600,000 of the £14.4 million estimated; but this variation is not significant having regard to the size of the total and the diffused nature of the expenditure.</P>
    <P>Progress with bovine tuberculosis eradication has been such that it is expected that, with the exception of five counties in Munster and one in Leinster, the country will be completely attested by the end of this year.  I would urge on all concerned the desirability of co-operating fully in bringing this expensive, but necessary, scheme to completion as rapidly as possible.</P>
    <P Just="Center">III.  CAPITAL BUDGET, 1962-63.</P>
    <P>When I introduced my first Budget in 1957 I said, with regard to the public capital programme, that I believed that the aim should be not a reduction, unless that should be forced on us by the inadequacy of public support, but rather a reshaping so as to make the programme more directly productive.</P>
    <P>In my first two years of office as Minister for Finance a sum of £10.55 million was devoted to agriculture, representing 13% of public capital expenditure for those two years.  In the following two years the capital provided for agriculture increased to £23.18 million, representing 24½% of the total.  This percentage is maintained for the two years 1961-62 and 1962-63 combined.</P>
    <P>In the case of industry, taking grants and credit together, capital expenditure in the first two years of the six-year period since 1957 was £3.35 million, representing 4.2% of the total public capital programme in those years.  In the following two years expenditure was equivalent to 7.9% of the total public capital programme, while for the last two years of the period the amount devoted to industry has reached a total of £17.1 million or 14% of total capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>Table VI of the Financial Tables <Col N="1572" /> shows the main headings of capital expenditure this year in the form set out in the White Paper on Economic Expansion.  It will be seen that expenditure is expected to reach a level of £66.88 million or £9.64 million more than the outturn for last year.  Expenditure shows an increase under every heading except agriculture and broadcasting. There is a decrease under the latter heading because development works by the television authority are nearly completed.  In the case of agriculture the decrease is due to the termination of the temporary scheme of guarantee payments on fat cattle and beef exports which was designed to accelerate progress in eradicating bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>The increase in the case of fuel and power takes account of increased expenditure of almost £3 million by the Electricity Supply Board, mainly on generating plant and new high tension lines.  I may say that it is intended to make provision during the present session for the completion of the rural electrification scheme.</P>
    <P>An extra £1.1 million, bringing the total to £3.5 million, is intended for telephone development.  The high demand for telephones continues and is a reflection of increased economic activity and higher living standards.</P>
    <P>The enlarged telephone development programme and the increase in other works of a capital nature for which the State is directly responsible, such as forestry, bovine tuberculosis eradication and airports, have caused the rise in the number of State employees in recent years.  Every effort is being made to ensure that capital works are efficiently and economically carried out.  This is a field in which outside management consultants can make a useful contribution.  Two firms of consultants have been engaged in the Office of Public Works and their efforts have already resulted in more economic purchasing arrangements for stores and machinery, including expensive drainage equipment, and the integration of architectural and administrative functions in a manner which yields better planning and control of building work.  A management consultant has also recently <Col N="1573" /> concluded an assignment in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands and has been able to bring about substantially increased productivity on work in connection with forest development and management. The benefit is being shared by the workers who participate in the incentive bonus scheme.</P>
    <P>The provision for industry this year is higher by £1.93 million; £1½ million goes towards the cost of the new nitrogenous fertiliser factory and there is almost £600,000 more for industrial grants.  Also, for the first time, provision of £½ million is being made for Cómhlucht Siúicre Éireann.  It is expected that the Company's plans for food processing will soon reach the stage at which the Government will be asked to provide additional share capital.  The provision is conditional on the necessary legislation being passed and covers only investment in fixed assets.</P>
    <P>The provision made for building and construction shows a substantial increase.  Housing, sanitary and miscellaneous services account for an extra £2¼ million.  This increase is due partly to increased costs but it also reflects a higher demand for loans and grants for private housing, a resurgence of local authority housing in a number of areas, particularly Dublin, and heavier expenditure on water supply, sewerage and miscellaneous services.  These developments are both an indication and a consequence of the rise in national living standards.  It is, however, necessary to keep an eye on the resources available and also, as I mentioned last year, to avoid the creation of peaks of intense activity which might be followed by slack periods.</P>
    <P>The capital outlay of Córas Iompair Éireann will increase by £1.4 million this year to £2.5 million.  Over £½ million of this sum will be devoted to hotel development works and the balance is attributable to acceleration of the railway modernisation programme.</P>
    <P>The Government is reinforced by the views of the OECD in its belief that increased investment of a productive <Col N="1574" /> kind is in the national interest.  The increased public capital programme for the current year has been approved on this basis.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IV.  SOURCES OF FINANCE FOR CAPITAL BUDGET.</P>
    <P>Table III of the Financial Tables shows the resources which were availed of by the Exchequer to meet capital requirements in 1961-62.  The resources expected to be available towards the capital requirements of this year are set out in Table V.</P>
    <P>Last year, the support from the public towards the financing of capital expenditure was generally up to expectation.  The largest single contribution came from the fully-subscribed 6 per cent.  National Loan in November which brought in £16.9 million.</P>
    <P>Net receipts from the savings banks and savings certificates amounted to £5 million as compared with £4.2 million in 1960-61.  Prize Bonds continued to attract subscribers and, allowing for encashments, brought in £2.4 million, much the same figure as in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The confidence which I expressed last year in the growing public support for Exchequer Bills has been justified by an increase in issues of £2.8 million during the past year and the stage has now been reached when consideration can be given to the question of issuing Exchequer Bills more frequently than once a month. I am also considering the possibility of issuing tax reserve certificates to serve as a tax free temporary investment for persons or firms wanting a convenient means of providing in advance for tax payments.</P>
    <P>This year's capital programme is bigger than last year's and still greater support from the community will be needed to finance it.  The money required for national development should, to the greatest possible extent, be provided by our own people. During the coming year the Savings Committee propose to intensify their drive for new savings and I am confident that, with incomes generally higher, there will be an encouraging <Col N="1575" /> response from the public.  The country is, indeed, indebted to this voluntary committee whose services are so generously given for the common good.</P>
    <P>A natural result of the growth of public capital investment for some years past is the higher debt charges that have to be met from taxation.  We cannot, as I said on the Vote on Account, have capital development without paying for it.  We must, however, continue to make every effort to minimise the cost by pursuing the policy of favouring productive investment. In this way increased debt charges can be more nearly matched by increased revenue.  The voted capital services will need to be examined critically from time to time to ensure that there is recourse to borrowing only for such items as are truly of a capital nature and provide assets for the continuing use or benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>Last year the net charge for the service of debt in the Central Fund and Supply Services, allowing for the interest and dividends received from State loans and investments, was £21.5 million.  Of this total, £10 million was sinking fund intended for the redemption of debt.  This is a substantial amount but it can only be regarded as being fully applied when the current budget is in balance.  Since the current budget has, in fact, been balanced over the last four years as a whole, one can say that a total sum of £36 million has been set aside effectively in that period for redemption of the public debt.</P>
    <P Just="Center">V.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1961-62.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Outturn</i>, 1961-62</P>
    <P>Tax revenue was very buoyant last year and non-tax revenue also exceeded the budget estimate.  The buoyancy was such that it covered the excess expenditure, as compared with the Budget estimate, of £5.3 million on the Supply Services and £0.54 million on the Central Fund Services.  It was short only £700,000 of making good the budget adjustment of £3 million for errors of estimation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> The excess expenditure on Central Fund Services, apart from the Road Fund transactions which merely balance the intake of revenue from motor vehicle duties, was caused by the high level of interest rates on temporary borrowings.</P>
    <P>When dealing with the Vote on Account, I adverted to the two principal factors which upset the budget allowance for the Supply Services. These were the pay increases, which cost an extra £2½ million in the year, and the large supplementary amount which had to be provided for agriculture. Some £5½ million of this supplementary estimate was for losses on the disposal of 1960 wheat and price support for butter and bacon exports.</P>
    <P>The net result of the variations in current expenditure and revenue was a deficit of £708,000.</P>
    <P>It might, perhaps, be argued that, if there had not been a substantial net reduction in tax rates last year, the deficit would not have arisen.  I do not think, however, that there is good ground for calling in question the tax policy which has been consistently pursued in recent years.  Its soundness is amply borne out by the revenue buoyancy stemming, not from increases in tax rates, but from increased national output and earnings promoted by the economic and fiscal policy of the Government, including the progressive reduction of direct taxation.  Over the last four years, reductions have been made in direct taxation rates which are now costing the Exchequer upwards of £5½ million a year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Expenditure and Taxation Levels</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year I commented on the level of State expenditure and taxation in relation to national production, pointing out that the rise in State outlay since 1957-58 had been more than matched by the rise in national production. That statement still holds good. State expenditure chargeable against revenue has risen by 18½% in the last four years whereas the value of national production has increased by nearly 21%.  The proportion of gross national product at market prices absorbed by all taxation, central and local, is about 22%, which is not high <Col N="1577" /> by international standards.  Tax receipts retained for general Exchequer purposes, excluding road tax which is used exclusively for the benefit of road users, represent 16.9% of national production and are at virtually the same level as in the past three years.</P>
    <P>By reference to international standards the proportion of our tax revenue taken in direct taxation is low. So also, so far as comparison is possible, are our rates of direct taxation. This point is significant in the context of our application for membership of the European Economic Community. The disincentive to effort and enterprise which direct taxation can represent has been very much reduced by the adjustments of recent years. More important still, however, is the position which now obtains so far as industrial profits are concerned.  The Irish rate of tax, that is, income tax and corporation profits tax, on companies is now 41.7%.  This compares with 53.7% in Britain, 50% in France, 51% in West Germany and 47% in the Netherlands.  In addition, Irish companies enjoy complete remission of tax on profits attributable to increased exports.  Further, in most Western European countries moneys paid by a company by way of dividend come out of profits subjected to tax and are normally taxed again in the recipients' hands.  In Ireland, not only is the dividend not charged again to income tax in the hands of shareholders but, where exports relief applies, an appropriate part of the relief allowed to the company is passed on to the shareholder and, in addition, relief may be granted under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, as amended.  Another less obvious point is that most Continental countries take as taxable income the increase in the net worth of a company from year to year and thus automatically tax capital gains.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Commission on Income Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>I might, perhaps, at this point refer to the reports of the Commission on Income Taxation.  I expect shortly to receive the Commission's seventh report which, I understand, will be their final one.  The Commission will then have completed the valuable service <Col N="1578" /> which they undertook over five years ago.  I gladly take this opportunity to pay tribute to the fine public spirit of the members in discharging with such care and attention this long and complex task.</P>
    <P>The Commission's first report was concerned with the method of collecting income tax charged on salaries and wages; and it led to the introduction of the Pay As You Earn system.  The Government's views on the recommendations in the second, third and fourth reports were given in the White Paper on Direct Taxation published last year on Budget Day.  The fifth report, on co-operative societies, and the sixth report, on simplification, were published during the course of 1961. While I have studied these two reports with some care, I would prefer not to take decisions on the recommendations they contain until I have received and considered the Commission's final report which I expect will range over a wide variety of matters.  The Government's comments on the recommendations in the fifth, sixth and seventh reports will be set forth in a White Paper which it is hoped to issue before the 1963 Budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Progress with tax reforms and simplification</i>
    </P>
    <P>On decisions announced in the White Paper last year, I have the following progress report to make:</P>
    <P>First of all one taxpayer, one charge:</P>
    <P>The idea here is that each taxpayer should normally be sent a single composite notice of assessment to income tax each year and a single demand later to cover the full income tax charged.  This proposal will, as indicated in the White Paper, be implemented as soon as practicable after the delivery of electronic equipment about September, 1963. Considerable headway has already been made in preparing for the new arrangements which will then come into effect.  These will involve radical changes in the whole income tax organisation, a comprehensive review of which is being conducted at present. The use of the electronic computer <Col N="1579" /> and the concomitant reorganisation of the income tax staffing will, it is expected, result in administrative saving and at the same time increase administrative efficiency.  It should also help to ease the strain of work in tax offices.  It has, in fact, been necessary to increase the Revenue staffing somewhat to cope with the extra work on Pay As You Earn but the additional expense involved has, of course, been amply recompensed in the form of increased revenue intake.  I should like to acknowledge that the fact that the new system has operated so smoothly from the start is due mainly to the wholehearted co-operation received from employers and employees alike.</P>
    <P>Surtax decentralisation:</P>
    <P>Surtax liability has up to now been computed in the Special Commissioners' Office at Dublin but, under the decentralisation arrangements now being made, this will in future be a matter for the local income tax offices.</P>
    <P>Collection of surtax from remuneration:</P>
    <P>In last year's Finance Act a section was included for persons chargeable to surtax who are within the ambit of Pay As You Earn.  It enables them, as from 6th April, 1962, to have their surtax collected in conjunction with their income tax.  Many surtax payers are availing themselves of this facility.</P>
    <P>One form of return for income tax and surtax:</P>
    <P>The Finance Act, 1961, also provided for a single return of income by individuals which would suffice for the purpose of both income tax and surtax.  The new forms of return are now being issued from the various tax offices.  The forms themselves have been recast and simplified.  I am confident that taxpayers will find their forms easier to understand and to complete than in the past; and I may say that in this matter the Revenue Commissioners have given effect to one of <Col N="1580" /> the recommendations in the sixth report of the Income Taxation Commission.</P>
    <P>Consolidation of Income Tax Acts:</P>
    <P>Considerable progress has been made in preparing for the consolidation of income tax law.  It is my opinion, however&mdash;and in this I am of the same mind as the Commission&mdash;that there should be revising legislation before a consolidating Bill is introduced.  Accordingly, I am having legislation prepared which will provide for contemplated reforms, will eliminate archaisms and deadwood, will remove flaws and in general simplify the code.  Work on these amending provisions will be pressed forward and I hope to introduce an instalment of them before next year's Budget.</P>
    <P>Stamp Duty Volume:</P>
    <P>The compiling of a comprehensive volume on Stamp Duty law is nearing completion and it is hoped to send the material for printing within the next few months.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VI.  CURRENT BUDGET, 1962-63 &mdash;DETAIL.</P>
    <P>As the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure shows, revenue this year is expected to increase by over £8 million at existing tax rates.  Tax revenue accounts for most of this increase, namely, £6 million.  The remainder is attributable to motor vehicle duties, Post Office receipts and radio and television licences but the increase under these particular heads is, of course, matched by corresponding increases in related items on the expenditure side.  Interest on Exchequer advances, as might be expected, also shows an increase.</P>
    <P>In estimating the yield from tobacco this year, it has been considered prudent to allow for the effect of published medical opinion and to assume a reversal of the upward trend in cigarette consumption.  Account has also had to be taken of the full-year cost of reliefs in income taxation given last year.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure, as compared <Col N="1581" /> with last year, is up by £8.2 million. Of this increase, Supply Services are responsible for £5½ million and Central Fund Services, including the Road Fund, for the balance.  The principal items accounting for the increase in Supply Services were explained in connection with the Vote on Account. Debt service is responsible for the bulk of the increase in Central Fund Services but payments to the Road Fund on foot of motor vehicle duties also show an increase.</P>
    <P>This year, for the first time, the Central Fund Services contain no reference to local taxation grants.  I explained on the Vote on Account that the disappearance of this item is balanced by increased expenditure on the Supply Services.</P>
    <P>On the White Paper figures the gap between revenue and expenditure is £745,000.  To this I must add the first year's cost, estimated at £100,000, of the taxation reliefs which I am conceding pursuant to the recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation.  I must also add provision for the increased pay recently awarded to Secondary and Vocational Teachers.  This widens the gap to £1,305,000.  There are, however, obligations of a social nature which I must also take into account.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The position of pensioners was debated by Dáil Éireann on 21st March last and a Government resolution was adopted to the effect that pensions proposals should be considered in conjunction with the budget, when they could be related to the taxation required to implement them. I indicated that the Government were sympathetically disposed to pensioners and I promised to examine, when preparing the budget, what increases could be given to them.</P>
    <P>The pensioners concerned fail broadly into two categories, public service pensioners and social assistance pensioners.  As regards public service pensioners, it was acknowledged in the debate that the pensions awarded to civil servants, gardaí, army personnel, teachers and officials of local authorities had not been adjusted as <Col N="1582" /> frequently as had the pay of serving personnel.  Acts were passed in 1950, 1956, 1959 and 1960 which enabled certain increases to be given but these did not extend to all pensions and the increases given did not compensate fully for the rise in the cost of living. I have had an estimate made of the cost of raising service pensions to take account of post-war movements in the cost of living, with special provision for persons who retired earlier to bring them into line with their post-war colleagues, and I find that the cost would be approximately £1,300,000.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer position precludes acceptance of a commitment of this order for service pension increases.  I propose, however, to set aside £450,000 this year to cover increases for the various classes I have mentioned as from 1st August next.  The full-year cost will be £675,000, which is half the cost of bringing pensions into line with the present cost of living.</P>
    <P>In distributing the increases I propose to give priority to those longest retired and to bring all pensioners who retired before the pay revision of 1st November, 1955, up to the level of their equivalent colleagues who retired with the benefit of that pay revision. When introducing the necessary legislation later I shall give full details of the increases proposed.  There will be some increase also in military service pensions and special allowances. The cost is included in the sum of £450,000 which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>The social assistance pensioners comprising the second broad category are old age pensioners, blind pensioners and widows.  Persons on unemployment assistance should also, I think, be considered.  It was made clear in the debate on the pensions motion that the adjustments which have been made in post-war years in social assistance pensions have more than kept them abreast of the cost of living.  The last three Budgets in succession have provided increases amounting, in all, to 5/- a week.  An increase in pensions calculated to compensate solely for the <Col N="1583" /> rise in the cost of living would amount to about 1/- a week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>And £20 a week to the High Court judges to cover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government believe there is general agreement that social assistance recipients, particularly old age pensioners and widows, should not be confined to an increase strictly related to cost of living considerations. They feel that this section of the community should be allowed to share in the general increase in national prosperity and I am providing over £1 million this year for improvements in social welfare.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to raise non-contributory old age, blind and widows' pensions by 2/6d. a week.  The personal rate of unemployment assistance and the allowance for an adult dependant of an unemployed person in both urban and rural areas will each be increased by 2/6d. a week.</P>
      <P>It is proposed, further, to increase the child dependant allowances associated with non-contributory widows' pensions and unemployment assistance. As a special measure the rates will be raised to the level of those at present payable in respect of child dependants under the contributory schemes.  As a result of the increase in the personal rates and those of dependants, a married man in receipt of unemployment assistance in an urban area with, say, three children will receive an extra 12/6d. a week.</P>
      <P>The increases in social assistance rates will, of course, require legislation. It is intended that they will take effect from the beginning of August next and it is estimated that they will cost the Exchequer £825,000 this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have also under consideration the improvement of the contributory insurance schemes.  This, too, will require legislation and it is intended that the new rates of contribution and benefit will come into effect at the beginning of January next. The details have not yet been settled, but I think it proper to make a provisional allowance of £200,000 for the <Col N="1584" /> State contribution for a quarter of the year.</P>
    <P>An increase is also warranted in two kinds of allowances administered by the Department of Health which are of a social welfare nature.  These are the allowances for infectious diseases and disablement.  The cost of increasing the infectious diseases allowance by 2/6d a week for a person without dependants and by 5/- a week for a person with an adult dependant would be about £50,000 in a full year and the cost of an increase of 2/6d a week in the maximum rate of the disabled person's allowance would be about £90,000 in a full year.  Half of the cost of increasing both allowances would be borne by the Exchequer.  I propose to set aside £50,000 as the Exchequer cost of increasing the allowances as from the beginning of August next.</P>
    <P>The various improvements in social welfare payments and pensions which I have detailed are estimated to cost the Exchequer over £1½ million in the current financial year.  The Deputies who recently supported the pensioners' cause will, I hope, give practical effect to their support by voting for the extra taxation required.</P>
    <P>

    <P>As Deputies are aware, there has been an organised campaign in recent months for a huge transfer of income to farmers.  While I do not propose to comment in detail on this claim, some of the basic issues raised are relevant in the context of the budget.</P>
    <P>Let me say at once that the Government have the greatest sympathy for farmers in the difficulties they have encountered in recent years and are keenly aware of the importance of a sound agriculture to the well-being of the national economy.  We have given practical evidence of this in the form of increased State aid for agriculture. While comparisons are affected by the choice of base date, it is true that, if one takes 1953 as the base year, the average farmer's income has not gone up as much as the industrial worker's although his output, in terms of volume, has gone up slightly more.  The reason is that agricultural prices have, on average, risen very little in the past nine years <Col N="1585" /> in comparison with the rise in other prices.  When the circumstances are examined, it is clear that workers in industry&mdash;certainly up to the recent round of wage and salary increases&mdash; obtained no more than was their due by reference to their increased productivity. As I have said already, there is a disparity between the rate of increase in money incomes represented by the eighth round and the recent rate of increase in productivity. With this reservation, however, no sector of the community has received in recent years more than the increased value of its output.  If farmers' incomes have risen less in recent years than their physical output, it is because the price, or value, of what they produce has, here as in other countries, lost ground relative to the value of other things.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to realise that there are practical, as well as equitable, limits to the transfer of incomes from one sector of the community to another.  There is no undistributed share of national income.  At any given time national income is already divided between the various sectors of the community.  National income is, indeed, the sum of the several incomes already earned by the different sectors.  A claim by any sector for a bigger share of the national income can be met only if some other sector or sectors bear, voluntarily or compulsorily, a cut in what they have already received. Economic growth is, however, best served if those who are expected to produce more are allowed to retain what they earn, subject to general fiscal policy.  There would, therefore, have to be very strong grounds of social and economic necessity to justify compulsory surrender by any sector of any large part of what it has already earned by its productive effort.  It must be recognised, moreover, that big compulsory transfers, whether effected by raising prices or taxation, would meet with a resistance which would express itself in the form of counter-claims for higher money incomes, leading the economy into inflationary chaos.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, the fact cannot be overlooked that taxpayers are already contributing to a substantial re-allocation <Col N="1586" /> of national income in favour of agriculture.  State aid to agriculture has risen from less than £5 million in 1938-39 to £13 million in 1953-54, £26 million in 1960-61 and over £37 million in 1961-62&mdash;when, admittedly, there were exceptional factors.  The figure for the current year of almost £30 million is equivalent to 5 per cent. of national income, which is several times the corresponding British percentage. Taking into account the high proportion of our population which is engaged in agriculture, it is obvious that the taxation needed to transfer to farmers sums of the order of magnitude recently advocated would be quite impracticable and could be justified neither on economic nor social grounds.</P>
    <P>There are serious difficulties, also, about the alternative course of raising agricultural prices.  One-half of sales off farms is exported and increased production has almost all to be sold abroad.  The prices realised for exports are not within our control and, in important cases, require the support of subsidies.  If we increase domestic prices and so stimulate production for export, we run the risk, which experience shows to be a real one, of prohibitive anti-dumping measures against our subsidised exports.  Moreover, it would obviously be unwise to raise prices before we are admitted to the European Economic Community.  For some products, our home prices appear already to be rather high by European standards, though for others, particularly beef, they seem relatively moderate.  We cannot yet predict what the price level for various commodities will be in an enlarged Community. Indeed, the chief agricultural advantage of membership may be a higher measure of certainly in regard to prices and markets rather than any marked rise in the general price level.  Our interest, therefore, lies in keeping any competitive advantage we may have so that we may be able to realise fully the agricultural opportunities of membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>I consider, therefore, that whatever transfer of income can be made to farmers this year, within the bounds of equity and practicability, should be <Col N="1587" /> financed by general taxation and should help the general body of farmers by reducing expenditure with which all are burdened.</P>
    <P>The effect on local rates of contributions to various public charges, such as health services and roads, has lately been the subject of complaint.  It would, however, be inappropriate for me to say much on this subject when the whole question of local finances and taxation is under review.  A Select Committee of Dáil Éireann is examining various aspects of the health services, including arrangements for meeting the cost of the services and the question whether any alternative arrangements might be made.  This Committee is to report before the 30th November next.  Moreover, the Economic Research Institute is engaged in a preliminary study of local taxation and finances and interested Government Departments also have the matter under close examination.</P>
    <P>It is, however, relevant to say that State grants now contribute more than rates towards the expenditure of local authorities.  Indeed, for every £2 in rates collected by county councils, the State contributes over £3 and thus already bears the greater share of the cost of rural services.  The State contribution here to local authorities is proportionately as high as in Britain.</P>
    <P>I consider that the right way in which to help farmers generally this year is to give them further relief from the burden of rates and to do so by increasing the Agricultural Grant rather than by interfering with the present allocation of the cost of services.  The sum which I am allocating for this purpose&mdash;£2½ million &mdash;is substantial in itself and is one which, because of the Exchequer position, requires a corresponding imposition of additional taxation.  This sum will be used to increase the present relief from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. on the first £20 of all valuations; to grant a new allowance of 25 per cent. on all valuations above £20; and to reduce the lower age-limit for employment allowances to 16 years.  As a result, the State will be paying well <Col N="1588" /> over half of the rates on land and the net rates payable by farmers will be reduced below the 1956-57 level.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tractor Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>Representations have been made regarding the tax on farm tractors. While the standard rate of taxation for ordinary tractors is £31 10s. per annum, reduced rates of 5/- and £8 apply at present to farmers' tractors, depending on the uses to which they are put.  Where a tractor is taxed at the 5/- rate, it is illegal to use it for road transport, except for its own necessary gear and farm implements. With an £8 tax, a tractor owner can transport his own agricultural produce and requisites for his farm, and he is also entitled to carry similar commodities for other farmers, provided that he does not accept reward.  He is allowed, however, to receive reward for the haulage of another farmer's milk to and from a creamery or a separating station, and he may, under certain conditions, also use his tractor for the transport of another farmer's livestock to and from an auction, mart or fair.  It is intended to reduce from 1st July next the £8 tax to £2 10s. at an estimated cost to the Road Fund of £100,000 this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Petrol for Agricultural Tractors</i>
    </P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of tractors, I would like to refer to the repayment of duty of 1/1¾d. a gallon which is allowed for petrol used in agricultural tractors and farm machinery. This scheme has always been open to abuse and constant vigilance by revenue staff has been necessary to minimise the risk of evasion of duty. It was possible to justify the continuance of the concession as long as it represented a significant aid to the agricultural community but the great majority of agricultural tractors are now run on diesel fuel.  In fact, I do not expect the total repayments this year to exceed £30,000.  On the other hand, the concession is becoming increasingly uneconomic to administer, the cost being disproportionate to the dwindling benefit derived by the farming community.  I recognise that the withdrawal of this relief without any <Col N="1589" /> prior warning might cause some hardship and so I am giving notice that the concession will cease at the end of this financial year.  No repayment will; therefore, be allowed in respect of petrol purchased or used after 31st March, 1963.</P>
    <P>Reviewing the Exchequer deficit at this point, I find I have a figure of £5,330,000 to contend with and I am afraid I have to add to this before considering the amount to be raised by additional taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Entertainments Duty</i>
    </P>
    <P>During the year I continued to receive strong representations about the burden of the entertainments duty. Deputies have also referred to this subject in the House.  When this tax was originally introduced more than 45 years ago it covered the whole range of spectator entertainments. Over the years, however, numerous exemptions were introduced, each with its own justification, and now the scope of the duty is virtually restricted to cinema shows and dances in the cities and larger towns.  There is, therefore, some justification for the claim that the duty now discriminates against these particular forms of entertainment. Apart from that, however, it has been put to me that, despite substantial tax concessions allowed in recent years, the impact of television on attendances, combined with rising costs, is creating an increasingly difficult situation, particularly in the cinema business.  It has been stressed that these developments threaten the livelihood of many persons who would find it difficult to secure alternative employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these representations are well founded and that there is no practical alternative but to abolish the entertainments duty completely. The cost of doing this with immediate effect would, however, be too high in the present budgetary situation.  Accordingly, I have decided to terminate the entertainments duty with effect from 1st October next.  The necessary provision will be made in the Finance Bill and the cost to the Exchequer in the current year will be about £450,000 I sincerely hope that <Col N="1590" /> the disappearance of this tax will ease the problems of the interests concerned and will minimise the danger of disemployment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The proposed abolition of entertainments duty widens the difference between current revenue and expenditure to £5,780,000.  Even the deduction of £2 million for errors of estimation leaves me with a gap of £3,780,000.  I propose to bridge it by moderate increases in taxation on two forms of spending which, however attractive, are not part of essential living costs&mdash;drink and tobacco.  It would, I consider, be inappropriate, for economic and other reasons, to reverse the policy of reducing direct taxation which has contributed towards the notable improvement in national production in recent years.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Beer</i>
    </P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the consumption of beer is at its highest level for 10 years and bearing in mind that the duty has remained unaltered for the past 5 years, an increase in duty equivalent to a penny on the pint does not seem unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I propose, therefore, to increase the duty on beer by £1 11s. per standard barrel.  This increase will apply to both home-produced and imported beer and is expected to yield £1,350,000 this year.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Spirits</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of duty on spirits have not been altered for 10 years and consumption is now higher than it has been for some time past.  Accordingly, I propose to raise the duties on spirits by the equivalent of 2d. a <Col N="1591" /> glass.  I expect this to yield an additional £650,000 this year.</P>
      <P>I propose also to take this opportunity to simplify to some extent the present complex structure of the customs duties on spirits.  As matters stand, the rates for spirits imported in bottle are, in most cases, 1/- a gallon higher than the rates for similar spirits imported in cask.  Moreover, the rate for spirits made from grain&mdash;gin, for example&mdash;is 1d. a proof gallon more than the rate for other spirits, such as brandy.  Both of these differentials have survived since the turn of the century and have long since ceased to serve any useful purpose.  In any event, the amounts are quite insignificant in relation to main rates of duty of over £9 a gallon.  In settling the new customs rates, therefore, I propose to abolish these differentials.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Tobacco</i>
      </P>
      <P>As regards tobacco, I propose to increase the duty by the equivalent of 2d. on the packet of 20 standard size cigarettes.  This increase would ordinarily add over 2d. to the price of the ounce of all classes of pipe tobacco. Pipe smoking is, however, under less of a cloud, if I may use such a metaphor, than cigarette smoking and, partly for this reason, I have decided not to put any extra impost on the hard-pressed variety of pipe tobacco, which accounts for almost 90% of all the pipe tobacco consumed in this country.  This type of tobacco is at present rebated to the extent of 10d. per ounce and I propose to increase this rebate to something over 1/- per ounce in order to avoid the necessity for a price increase. Allowing for the cost of this increased rebate, I expect to obtain an additional £1,700,000 this year from the increase in the tobacco duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concession whereby tobacco manufacturers receive a rebate of 5d. a lb. on their clearances of leaf is confined to firms which are in Irish ownership and control.  This restriction was imposed when the original scheme was introduced 30 years ago as the relief was designed to help the small native firms to compete with their large rivals. In the intervening years one of the <Col N="1592" /> Irish firms, encouraged I would like to think by the rebate scheme, has expanded its business to such an extent that it can no longer be regarded by any standards as a small firm requiring protection.  I am happy to say that the directors of this firm have acknowledged that this is so and have agreed that the existing concession is no longer essential to its well-being and that the withdrawal of the rebate would not damage its competitive position.</P>
    <P>I have decided, therefore, to terminate the rebate scheme in its present form and to substitute a system of relief which will be universal in its application but will at the same time ensure the continuance of the necessary relief for the small firms.  In future all manufacturers will receive a rebate of 1/6d. a lb. on the first 50,000 lbs. of leaf cleared from bond.  These changes will save the Exchequer about £80,000 a year and at the same time will substantially increase the help given to the small firms.</P>
    <P>In effect, this completes the budgetary arithmetic, as the net result of the changes I have announced is to bring in revenue sufficient to meet the deficit of £3,780,000 which I mentioned earlier.  There are, however, a number of matters, affecting the Finance Bill rather than the Budget, which I would like to mention before concluding.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Interest on Tax Arrears</i>
    </P>
    <P>As a corollary to the introduction of tax reserve certificates, which will yield interest on advance payments of tax, I want to have interest charged on arrears of tax.</P>
    <P>Under Pay As You Earn employees must bear their tax liability before receipt of pay.  I do not think it right that business or professional people, or those whose income comes from investments, should suffer no disadvantage in withholding payment of tax after it becomes due.  Delay exceeding nine days in paying over to the Revenue the tax deductions made from employees each month involves employers in liability to an interest charge of 1 per cent. for each month or part of a month.  The yield from this interest charge is, I am happy to <Col N="1593" /> say, quite insignificant.  There are, however, many non-employees who, despite the activities of the tax collectors, are dilatory about discharging their tax debts and I propose that they should have to pay interest on all tax not paid within three months of the due date, the interest to run from that date.  The rate of interest I have in mind is ½ per cent. for each month or part of a month.  I should, perhaps, make it clear that, where there is an appeal, the tax does not become due until liability has been determined. The interest charge will apply to all arrears of income tax (other than Schedule E tax), of surtax and of corporation profits tax and will be effective as from 1st January next.  I shall later move the necessary Financial Resolution.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Evasion</i>
    </P>
    <P>It is, as I have said earlier, my hope that worthwhile administrative saving will come from the projected reorganisation of the tax service that will be associated with the introduction of an electronic computer.  This will assist in making an intensified drive towards the detection and charging of any tax liabilities which may now be eluding the net.  What I have particularly in mind are business and professional incomes as well as fees and commissions.  It would be quite indefensible to permit persons with such incomes to escape with an inadequate contribution to the Exchequer when salary and wage earners are bearing their full share of the burden.  The revenue staff to deal with these matters has been strengthened and it is intended that action should be taken without delay against evaders.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Profits Tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will provide for continuance for a further 3 years of the exemption from Corporation Profits Tax which has hitherto been granted to certain concerns, including public utility companies.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Non-Deduction of Income Tax&mdash; Agricultural Credit Corporation Securities</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under existing law, interest on debentures, debenture stock or <Col N="1594" /> certificates of charge issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, Limited, may be paid without deduction of income tax; and the interest is assessable to tax in the recipients' hands.  The Agricultural Credit Act, 1961, enabled the Corporation to borrow on foot of other types of securities such as bonds.  The Finance Bill will contain provisions under which interest on any such securities will be payable without deduction of income tax in the same manner as interest on debentures, debenture stock or certificates of charge.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Abolition of Minimum Duty</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present a minimum charge of 1/- is payable on dutiable parcels coming from the United Kingdom or Canada and of 2/6d. on dutiable parcels from other countries.  These charges are not applied to gift parcels or to goods in passengers' baggage and I propose, as an administrative economy, to abolish these minimum charges and concurrently to obtain authority to waive small amounts of duty where that can safely be done.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Implications of Membership of EEC</i>
    </P>
    <P>As this is the first budget to be introduced since we applied for membership of the European Economic Community it is appropriate that I should refer briefly to what the consequences for the revenue may be.  Obviously, the receipts we derive at present from protective customs duties will dwindle as our tariffs on imports from Member States are reduced.  Further loss of revenue will result from modifications which it will be necessary to make in our revenue duties.  In the years ahead, therefore, we will inevitably have to look for fresh sources of revenue to make good these losses.</P>
    <P>Apart from this domestic revenue problem we must also bear in mind the great importance the European Economic Community attaches to the question of harmonising the taxation systems of the member States.  All the present member States of the Community have general sales taxes or turnover taxes of one sort or another. Almost all the other countries of Western Europe also employ some form of general sales tax or purchase tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> In these circumstances I have thought it well to ask the Revenue Commissioners to study the technical questions which would be involved in the adoption of various forms of broadly based taxes on expenditure.  I want to make it clear, however, that no decision on the principle of such a tax has been taken by the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Brussels Tariff Nomenclature</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Brussels Nomenclature forms the basis of the common external tariff of the European Economic Community and has been adopted not only by Western European countries generally but also by a large number of other countries.  A provisional concordance of the Irish customs tariff with the Brussels Nomenclature was prepared last year and copies placed in the Oireachtas Library and elsewhere for reference purposes.  This document has no legal basis.  It is intended during this year to transform our tariff definitively into the Brussels Nomenclature and to issue it with statutory effect.</P>
    <P Just="Center">VII. CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>The present financial year is, in a sense, one of transition.  We hope that during the year the question of our membership of the European Economic Community will be decided. Until we know the conditions of membership it would be unwise to make any significant change in our long-term plans.  In general, therefore, the existing Programme for Economic Expansion will be continued; it has not yet run its course, it has been proved sound, and its objectives are in line with those of the <Col N="1596" /> Treaty of Rome.  The immediate need is to concentrate on the preparations that obviously must be made to fit the various sectors of our economy for the much keener competition&mdash;and greater opportunities&mdash;that lie ahead. We have to do our best to maintain the recent improved rate of growth of national production, with its beneficial effects on employment, trade and living standards. We are trying in this budget to achieve these aims.  We are also arranging for the improvement in real national income to be extended to classes who cannot contribute to it by their own efforts&mdash;pensioners and social assistance beneficiaries.  For social reasons, also, we are transferring, through taxation, part of the income of other sectors of the community to the farmers, as they have been unable for some years past, for reasons largely outside their own&mdash; and Government&mdash;control, to gain as much of an increase in incomes as other producers, although their increased output in difficult times has been a considerable achievement and has benefited the national economy.  A further rise in public capital expenditure is also being provided for.</P>
    <P>In all this, care is being taken not to jeopardise the improved economic trends of recent years.  It will be our constant aim to maintain these trends by sound budgeting, by advancing towards greater efficiency, and by being ready not merely to accelerate development when the opportunity offers but also to correct in time any adverse influences.  On this basis, we may hope in this decade to see a progressive improvement in the living standards of a rising population.</P>

    <P>* When considering the Liabilities Statement at 31/3/62 alone it should be borne in mind that there is double reckoning in the totals to the extent of £53,111,000 representing the investment in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and in Exchequer Bills of the proceeds of dollar borrowings, the balance in the National Development Fund (Winding-up) Account and of part of the balances of the National Loans Sinking Funds and the Savings Certificates Fund (Principal Reserve Account).  This is offset in the Assets Statement where the balances on the American Loan Counterpart Fund, the National Development Fund (Winding-up) Account, the National Loans Sinking Funds and the Savings Certificates Fund (Principal Reserve Account) include the Funds' investments in Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer and Exchequer Bills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Those Deputies opposite who found themselves in the unfortunate position of having to acclaim the Minister for Finance as he sat down should have realised that during his speech the Opposition would be able to judge by their features and not by their applause at the end.  Of course, it is quite understandable that they were completely befogged.  They were befogged in the first place because the Taoiseach so far abused his high office and the Minister for Finance so far abused his high office months ago as to stump the country telling it that there would be a tale of woe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were hoping that we in Opposition would fall into the trap&mdash;because it was a Party trap and nothing else&mdash;of following them in that <Col N="1627" /> respect.  When the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance quite deliberately went out and said months ago that, without buoyancy, there would be much higher taxation, they were doing it for one of two reasons.  I leave the Taoiseach himself to be the judge and to admit to the public which reason was the true one.</P>
    <P>Either, as the event has turned out, he and his Minister did not know the first thing that was happening about revenue, either they did not know that revenue was buoyant, either they did not know that inevitably there would be an improvement in revenue because the eighth round was last year injected into the community or&mdash;and I suspect the second is the real reason&mdash;the Taoiseach was deliberately flying a Party kite because he hoped that, by preparing the country for a tale of woe, when it appeared that there would not be such a dreadful weight of woe today, everybody would say what a grand fellow he was.</P>
    <P>While that may be good Party tactics, it is very bad national tactics indeed.  There are many people who, in the past few months, might have taken other measures to stimulate their business and to stimulate employment if they had thought we were riding on an even keel.  But, the very threats issued by the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance inevitably must have had the effect of preventing certain people from taking the action that otherwise they might have taken to improve conditions.</P>
    <P>It was obvious that there would be an increase in buoyancy in revenue. I wonder, however, how many Deputies opposite realised that when the Minister for Finance stood up here today he was able to count, without raising a finger, on an additional £8,000,000 in the coming year&mdash; £6,070,000 on ordinary tax revenue and the balance on non-tax revenue and motor vehicle duties.  He could count on £8,000,000 additional revenue with which he could make adjustments.</P>
    <P>Allowing for the fact that apparently he made no effort whatever, when introducing the Supply Services, to carry out the proper function of Minister <Col N="1628" /> for Finance, even then, after making, as he says himself, the normal adjustment of £2,000,000 for errors of assessment, he had a balance of £1,250,000 or, in rough figures, the amount he has given away to the old age pensioners.  Without lifting one finger, he had £1,250,000, even though he failed completely to make any effort to control the cost of the Supply Services, as was demonstrated beyond question here on the Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>It is not without reasons that the Minister is receiving that extra money. In the past year, the Minister took out of the pockets of the people a higher percentage of the gross national product than was taken since 1949-50&mdash; and even before that, so far as I know, but I have not gone back farther than that.  A higher percentage of what everyone in the country has had to work for has been garnered by the Minister for Finance in the past year, 1961-62, and, as far as I can make a quick calculation, will be able to garner in this year, than ever before in the past 12 years.  He garnered a higher percentage in all that period in respect of taxes on expenditure.  He garnered a higher percentage in respect of taxes on income and on capital&mdash; going back to that period, with the exception of a couple of years when Deputy MacEntee was Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder, in those circumstances&mdash;when the percentage of the product for which the people throughout the country have to work is being taken to a greater degree by the Minister than by any Minister for Finance before&mdash;that we should have the buoyancy in revenue to which I have already referred.  In that circumstance, what was needed here beyond all question was a proper incentive Budget but there is no sign of any incentive to anything worthwhile in this Budget.</P>
    <P>Let us look at our trade situation. We know from answers given last week in the House that there was an improvement of £28,000,000 in our trade position last year.  That is purely the result of the world price position compared with 1957, that our import excess was down by <Col N="1629" /> £28,500,000, but we have this year for the first time a prognosticated view by a body that is not a partisan body, a body that is prepared to make an ordered appraisal of the position.  Let us look at the sample industrial survey made by the Economics Institute and we find that in the first quarter of 1962, to which the Minister made no reference in his Budget statement, exports are going to be lower in 37 per cent. of the cases, lower by twice than the number of cases in which there is going to be an improvement.</P>
    <P>We find also that orders in the first quarter of this year are 42 per cent. lower than they were in the first quarter of last year.  We find that there is not a single firm which feels that it has not a sufficient stock of finished products.  We find that there is not a single firm, according to the sample survey, that feels that its plant and equipment are inadequate for the production it will attain during this year.  There is not, unfortunately, a single firm which feels that its employment content is inadequate.  On the contrary 16 per cent. of them feel that their employment is excessive.</P>
    <P>In that picture, we have a Budget which fails completely to produce any real incentive.  The recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation to which the Minister referred to-day and which he has indicated he is going to implement, are recommendations that are made much too late.  Time and again from this side of the House, we, in this Party, made it clear that we felt it was urgent that there should be a proper appraisal and that there should be new incentives to make certain that our industries would be put in the position of being able to compete in Common Market conditions and so protect the livelihood of our people employed in them.</P>
    <P>We got yesterday the report of the Committee on Industrial Organisation, a report which is clearly the epitaph of the failure of Deputy Lemass's policy which, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he operated over the years and which was designed so that many Irish firms and industries could not survive freer competition <Col N="1630" /> from imports.  Right through the whole of that report, it is clear that the members of that Committee realise and appreciate that the Government have been doodling in not dealing with this matter on the basis of preparing this country as a whole for entry into the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to agriculture is exactly the same.  We see no sign of any real incentive towards greater agricultural production or any attempt to ensure that those who are engaged in that industry can hope for future improvement.  Even if we take two examples about which we have often heard Ministers shouting, ground limestone and farm buildings, two matters in respect of which it is generally accepted that there must be a substantial improvement if we are to be able to achieve any increase in production, we find in each of those that last year the Ministers concerned failed completely to reach the average of the three years which they so often decried, the three years in which we were in office.  In these three years, we were able to provide more ground limestone than the average of the five years during which Fianna Fáil had been in office.  Never since the time we were in office have as many people applied for farm building grants.  Again the average for the three years we were in office exceeds the average of the five following years when Fianna Fáil were in office.  Yet the Minister for Finance smugly considers that in the situation in which we are, it is not necessary to give any incentive in either of these important respects.</P>
    <P>We shall have further opportunities of considering in greater detail the exact taxation imposed in the Budget and the exact remissions made.  I know that the Minister in his statement today referred to the competition of television with the cinema, and correctly referred to it, but he rather slid over making any reference to the dance-hall proprietors about whom we heard a good deal in this House six or seven years ago.  I do not know what the Minister will say in justification of that remission which will cost something just under a million pounds a year.  We are all aware that certain cinemas are entitled <Col N="1631" /> to some compensation against the impact of television but we shall be interested to hear what the Minister will say in justification of the remission to the dance-hall proprietors who apparently have waited eight years for their pay-off.  They hitched their wagon to his star eight years ago.</P>

      <P>Any Deputies on this side of the House who were watching the faces of the Deputies opposite will realise what they felt, as Deputies on this side of the House feel and as the country will feel, when they learned that out of the increased national income last year, and out of what they were led to believe by Fianna Fáil, a mere increase of 2/6d. is all that the social service classes and the pensioners are to get.</P>
      <P>I wonder exactly how those Deputies opposite will feel when they realise that they are sitting behind a Minister who proposes to charge a rate of no less than 12 per cent. per annum to taxpayers in future, one per cent. per month?  Does that not put the Minister in the money-lending or usury class?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he is a taxpayer. I am delighted to hear that the other taxpayers will have to pay only six per cent, or one half per cent. per month, but one per cent. per month is 12 per cent.  If we cannot agree on that simple arithmetic, it is a poor situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all understand that the Minister is an adept at one thing.  He wanted to bring in a red herring because he realised that the 1d. on the pint of beer was coming immediately afterwards and he did not want to have any reference to that, if he could avoid it. <Col N="1633" /> As far as I can ascertain, last year was the first year we went back to the 1953 consumption of beer.  Now beer has got a smack by way of extra tax that is to be paid by those who can least afford it, with the result, no doubt of a cut-back ultimately on those who have barley contracts.  The same will apply in the case of the whiskey tax which will have much the same effect.</P>
    <P>I frankly admit I cannot understand at short notice the difference between the Minister's figures for one sort of spirit and another, but that will keep until another day.  We would have been interested to know the amount by which the Minister had estimated tobacco consumption would be cut back by reason of the scare.  Last year, 25 per cent. of total tax revenue came from tobacco; this year, I think with the increase, we shall not be any lower but probably higher.  To put it mildly, that is a most unhealthy state for any country&mdash;to be depending so much on one commodity in respect of which public taste might change very simply.</P>
    <P>At Question Time, we had some interjections about housing expenditure. Let me put on record again that housing expenditure, and the Local Loans Fund issue for it provided in the Budgetary Tables that have been circulated, do not even yet amount to the sum paid for that expenditure in 1956-57.  While it does represent a welcome improvement on the amount the Government made available in the past four years, it still has not gone up to the point at which it was in 1956-57.</P>
    <P>It is not really in respect of all these things that the public will ultimately judge the failure of the Government. That failure is contained in the report of OECD, the failure to live up to the promise made by the Taoiseach when, on this side of the House in 1956, he said that if only Fianna Fáil were given the chance, they would provide within five years 100,000 new jobs for our people.  At the end of that period&mdash; because the Minister has been there for five years&mdash;all he can say is that instead of more employment, there has in fact been a reduction in employment <Col N="1634" /> on the figures given by OECD, of 34,000.</P>
    <P>Instead of 100,000 more, there are 34,000 fewer people employed today than when Fianna Fáil took over the reins of office.  Not merely that but the Minister, the House and the country should remember that in that period the number of our people who have gone away to seek the work promised them here by Fianna Fáil in that 100,000-job manifesto, is 250,000, the flower of our young people.  No matter what the Minister may say, more people, more Irish men and women applied in 1961 than in 1959 for new employment cards in England, and it has been admitted here by Fianna Fáil that, in 1959, emigration was runing at the rate of 50,000 a year, so that, obviously, if more applied in 1961, there was more emigration than in 1959.</P>
    <P>If that is the record of which the Government are proud, nobody else in the country is proud of it.  Everybody will realise that the Budget does nothing to ease the situation, nothing to improve the lot of our people in a permanent and genuine way.  On the contrary, it is merely a stop-gap device by people who, as the Committee on Industrial Organisation says in its sphere, are always too late in everything they even try to do.</P>

      <P>At this point in the discussion on the Budget, I am concerned only with the actual proposals made by the Minister.  I think it should be said straightaway that if this Budget was designed in an attempt to satisfy the needs of certain sections of the community, it has proved a dismal fiasco.  If it is intended to satisfy what seem to have been the demands of certain of the Independents, I can now understand why it was necessary for the Government Party to send for Deputy Briscoe to come back posthaste.</P>

      <P>The people were entitled to expect more from this Budget.  None of us was impressed&mdash; and the Minister's Party were not impressed&mdash;by the type of political <Col N="1635" /> trickery we saw displayed in the gloomy speeches made since January, chosen to give the impression that the country could not afford to do a great deal for, say, certain of the social welfare classes or State pensioners, knowing, as Deputy Sweetman has said, that the revenue has been buoyant and that the indications are that the taxpayers next year will contribute considerably more than they contributed in 1961-62.</P>
      <P>We had discussions recently in the House on pensions generally and on social welfare benefits, and we were told, as usual, to wait for the Budget. Some people made the modest demand of 5/- extra for the old age pensioners. I think most people in the Dáil and in the country really believed that, in the 1962 Budget, a genuine effort would be made to uplift the standards that applied to the old age pensioners for the past few years, but here we see in the Minister's proposal the usual thing trotted out&mdash;an increase of 2/6d. for the old age pensioners, the widows and the orphans, which will be paid from August next.  There is another increase of 2/6d. for unemployment assistance, in certain cases, from January next.  We are entitled to ask&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no question of retrospection for the social welfare classes, but, as the Minister was reminded here today, there was retrospection in respect of people who are employed by the State to whom it is proposed to give increases of £600 per annum retrospective to November last. In any case, the proposal in this Budget is to devote this year a sum of £1 million to those in the social welfare classes.  Apart from the present inadequacies of the old age pensions&mdash;and particularly the widows' pensions and blind pensions&mdash;there are other factors which should have induced the Minister to make a real effort on this occasion to do a little better than the usual 2/6 for the social welfare recipients. Another factor in this matter of increased social welfare benefits is the fact that a big part of the old age pensions has been transferred to the workers and employers, that is, to the contributory insurance scheme.</P>
      <P>We have heard boasts in recent years, and especially in recent months, about the rise in the national income. We were told by various Ministers last year that for the first time in a long time we had a surplus in our balance of payments.  National production, we are told, has increased to a considerable extent.  I think we are entitled to ask the Government to devote to social welfare a reasonable percentage of the tax revenue.  They have not done that since they came into power in 1957.</P>
      <P>In 1960-61, expenditure on social welfare was £26.2 million and tax revenue stood at £114.9 million.  The amount devoted to social welfare in that year was 22.8 per cent.  This year, if my calculations are correct, it will be about 20 per cent.  People are under the impression that we devote a colossal amount of money to social welfare. Some critics of social welfare say we devote too much to it, but the trend in the Fianna Fáil Government has been to decrease the percentage of tax revenue paid on social welfare as the years go on.</P>

      <P>The Minister proposes this year that approximately £27,000,000 will be spent on Social Welfare.  People seldom have regard to other types of expenditure in the State which are not subject to criticism. It is of interest to note that £20,000,000 per year is paid as interest on the national debt.  We are prepared to pay that sort of money to banks and people who dabble in money but all we can afford for Social Welfare benefits is £27,000,000.</P>
      <P>In part of his speech, the Minister says:</P>
      <P>The Deputies who recently supported the pensioners' cause will, I hope, give practical effect to their support by voting for the extra taxation required.</P>
      <P>I want to tell the Minister that so far as we are concerned, we do not think that devoting approximately £1,000,000 out of indirect taxation to the tune of approximately £4,000,000 is the proper way to treat the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans and other pensioners and consequently we do not propose to vote for this increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not prepared to support a Budget that gives a mere £1,000,000 out of £4,000,000 collected from indirect taxation.  This seems to me to be another attempt by the Government or the Minister to make an attack on the workers who recently got an eighth round wage increase.  We have heard some critical comments, if not from the Minister, certainly from the Taoiseach in recent months.  A substantial portion of this taxation will be paid by the ordinary folk.  The recent eighth round of wage increases meant to workers an increase of anything from 15/- to £1 or maybe 22/-or 23/- per week.  I suggest that the tax proposed here will take from their wages very many shillings per week.  I shall not attempt here now to say how many in the case of the average worker but, in respect of beer, tobacco and increased contributions, at least some shillings which he has won for himself in the last round of wage increases will certainly be taken from him in the proposals contained in this Budget.</P>
      <P>Workers must remember&mdash;I do not know whether the House appreciates it or not&mdash;that the Minister also proposes to increase the insurance stamps.  It will be remembered that there was an increase about two weeks ago which we were told was to pay for contributory old age pensions, whereas we knew from experience that portion of the increase demanded from the workers at that time served no other purpose than to relieve the Exchequer of some of the expenditure in respect of the payments of both contributory and non-contributory old age pensions.</P>
      <P>Many people are inclined to believe &mdash;and many Ministers are inclined to believe&mdash;that the eighth round increases were responsible for a certain amount of disruption.  The opinion in the country is that the increases which were given to civil servants recently put a very heavy burden indeed on the Government, but, as was pointed out to the Minister for Finance last week, the income tax that will be collected on the increases given to workers during the present year will offset approximately the increases to civil servants for a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1639" /> It has been given as a figure by the Minister for Finance that £6 million would be necessary to finance the recent increases to the civil servants.  It has further been reckoned that a sum of £5 million by way of income tax will be paid into the Exchequer by the workers and so offset to a great extent the increases that have been given to those employed in the Civil Service and who got the increases recently.</P>
    <P>I honestly thought that the Minister would, indeed, introduce a social welfare Budget this week.  In view of the improvements which he and his colleagues have boasted of in recent years, he certainly could have examined the case for an increase in children's allowances, especially in respect of larger families.  If this Budget had demonstrated that a fair and equitable proportion of the taxes to be raised would be devoted to the needy sections, we would have no hesitation in saying that we would support the Government in the proposals which they are putting before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know.  The Minister can have his own opinion.  He should know the Labour Party by now and know that we are not prepared to support the type of Budget which he introduced and which we believe is not fair and just to the social welfare classes.</P>
      <P>The Minister in the course of his speech referred to unemployment and emigration.  Again, there seems to be the impression in the country that the problem of unemployment and emigration has been solved.  I do not know what figures Deputy Sweetman quoted but I want to give the Minister and the country some other figures with regard to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would imagine from the boasts of the Fianna Fáil Party that industries are springing up in every single parish but when we ask for precise information from the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to the number of new factories and jobs created we are not told the figures that are sometimes spoken about outside church gates and <Col N="1640" /> from election platforms.  The year 1955 is supposed to have been a bad year so far as industry is concerned if we are to believe the speeches made by those in the Fianna Fáil Party.  In 1955 there were 1,181,000 people in employment.  In 1961 there were 1,119,000. That is a difference of 62,000.  In effect, that means that as compared with 1955 there were 62,000 fewer persons in employment in 1961. The Minister may say these figures are out of date but as far as any of us knows they have not changed substantially.  It would not be unreasonable to say that even now as compared with 1955 there are 50,000 fewer in employment in this country.</P>
    <P>I gather from the Minister's speech and from some of his colleagues that the problem of emigration does not constitute such a big problem as it did some years ago.  He says that the latest figures show that emigration in February stood at about 22,000 and that that was offset by the natural increase in population but I think the Minister, the Government and the country have a problem so long as there are 22,000 or 24,000 people emigrating from this country in 1961 or 1962.</P>
    <P>There were no proposals by the Minister to give any real incentives to industry with a view to creating new employment or maintaining existing employment.  The skimpy reference&mdash;because skimpy it was&mdash;to the possibility of our becoming members of the Common Market was something that certainly was not expected in his Budget speech.  If our application is successful and if we find ourselves in the Common Market within the next six months, I suggest that we have not done much to prepare for such entry.</P>
    <P>There are many old industries in this country which need financial incentives.  I suggest that what is proposed for them in this Budget will certainly not ensure in some cases that employment will be maintained at its present level or that there will be any increased employment.</P>
    <P>I want to say on behalf of my Party that we are sadly disappointed at the proposals the Minister has made in this <Col N="1641" /> Budget.  We believed that in view of all the circumstances something would have been done to give at least the old age pensioner, the widow and orphan, the blind person and the unemployed some decent standard in their weekly allowances so that thereafter increases would be related to an increase in the national income or the cost of living. We find now that despite the money available to the Minister by way of buoyancy of the revenue and by way of increased taxation, he hands them merely a few crusts which they may gnaw on for another while until the thought comes to the Government to give them something really worth while.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the Government have not decided to change their attitude since 1932 towards the one class in which I am very interested, that is, the small farmers. This Budget makes it abundantly clear that the campaign to exterminate the small farmers is in full swing.  At the same time the Minister, cunningly, through his Budget speech, tries to give the impression that there is to be some relief for the small farmer.  He is giving a certain amount of extra relief in rates on the first £20 valuation on land.  He is increasing the agricultural grant from 60 per cent. to 70 per cent.  I just worked out how that would affect the average type of small farmer along the West coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the case of a man with a £10 valuation.  In Mayo, the farmer with a £10 valuation last year would have paid £11 6s. on his land, after the agricultural grant had relieved his rates to a certain extent.  This year, he will pay £8 12s.  The farmer with a valuation of £10 gets £2 14s. extra relief in his rates by this Budget.  That is the amount of help the Government consider sufficient to stop the eroding flight from the land that is taking place and will continue to take place after this Budget, where complete townlands are clearing out and leaving, in some cases, not even one house inhabited out of eight or nine in particular townlands. I could give the names of several villages of from twelve to eighteen houses in Mayo where only one house <Col N="1642" /> remains inhabited.  The same applies to other counties.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put a penny on the pint, twopence on spirits and twopence on cigarettes.  In view of the recent medical findings concerning the damage cigarettes have been doing, I have nothing whatever to say to that tax. Although a smoker myself, I feel compelled to assist in stamping out cigarette smoking, if at all possible, or at least to divert cigarette smokers to the pipe for the sake of their health.</P>
    <P>I want to come to another aspect of relief for farmers.  The Minister has graciously reduced the £8 tax on agricultural tractors to £2 10s.  In the parishes I am familiar with in the West there are about 20 tractors to the parish.  Therefore, this means a relief of about £100 to 20 tractor owners for a full year.  Neither must we forget the remaining few owners of petrol tractors.  They are being deprived of the rebate they got on petrol to the tune of £30,000.  Therefore, of the amount given by the Minister in the reduction of the tax on agricultural tractors, £30,000 will be paid by the unfortunate farmers who happen to have petrol tractors.  I regard that kind of tricking as nothing but an insult. The Minister cunningly tried to convey to the farmers that they were getting enormous reliefs.  The Minister must know that some of the figures that have been given by himself and his colleagues are completely wrong and misleading. He has spoken on the question of unemployment and emigration.  He said:</P>
    <P>It appears from the net passenger movement figures that less than 27,000 emigrated in 1961, while for the twelve months ended February, 1962, the figure was of the order of 22,000.</P>
    <P>Yet the British Overseas Migration Board in their seventh report tell us that 67,598 Irish men and women applied for new work cards in England last year.  Where does the truth lie between these two statements?  Both cannot be true.  Seeing the toll emigration is taking all over the country, I know that at the very least the Minister's figure of 22,000 is far from the <Col N="1643" /> truth.  I am prepared also to concede that the British figures may include some duplication and might be wrong by a figure of 10,000.</P>
    <P>What we should remember, however, is that this Budget shows the determination of the Government to wipe out completely the farmers under £20 valuation.  Their day is gone.  It seems the Government are preparing for a mass influx when we join the Common Market.  The average price of agricultural land in this country is from £80 to £100 per statute acre, while the comparable price in Germany, Holland and Belgium is from £500 to £540 per statute acre.  Seeing the way these people have been scourged with wars and upsets of various kinds for many years, the very moment we join the Common Market and there is free movement, there will be a wild influx of these people to buy the holdings from which a Fianna Fáil Government have forced our own people to England, America and Australia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>With all the talk about the buoyancy of revenue, is a half-crown a week the best the Minister can do for the most helpless section of our people?  Most of it will be taken back by other increases in the Budget. It is the old Fianna Fáil practice of giving with one hand and taking back with the other.  Such a miserable increase is an insult to the old age pensioner.  If the inflow of money to the Exchequer is as buoyant as it is supposed to be&mdash;and there is a certain amount of buoyancy&mdash;we should deal <Col N="1645" /> more generously with the old age pensioner and the widow and orphan.  I support every word Deputy Corish said on this subject.  It is shabby, and it should be beneath any Government to deal with our old aged people in that way.</P>
      <P>In the last few words of the Minister's speech, referring to the farmers, he said:</P>
      <P>... they have been unable for some years past, for reasons largely outside their own&mdash;and Government&mdash; control, to gain as much of an increase in incomes as other producers, although their increased output in difficult times has been a considerable achievement and has benefited the national economy.</P>
      <P>The farmers are supposed to have had last year an increase of £8,000,000.  If that is so, why has the Minister decided to give them concessions?</P>
      <P>At page 4 of his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Agricultural output in 1961 pursued the steady but moderate upward course of recent years.  Net agricultural output increased by about 6 per cent. in value and by 2 per cent. in volume.  Farm incomes rose during the year by £8 million.</P>
      <P>He let the cat out of the bag because, further on, he said:</P>
      <P>... the substantial exports of cattle and meat resulted in a reduction in the cattle stocks which had been built up in earlier years, particularly 1959.  The livestock enumeration of January, 1962, recorded an estimated decline of 112,000 in cattle numbers as compared with a year earlier.</P>
      <P>That proves beyond yea or nay that the farmers are now being compelled to live on their capital.  They have to sell their capital stock and the Minister blandly describes that as an £8 million increase in their income.  If cattle stocks keep declining year by year as a result of the way farmers are being treated, how long does he think our exports will stand up to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, it is clear, particularly as far as the small farmer of £20 or £25 valuation is concerned, that Fianna Fáil have made up their <Col N="1646" /> mind that the sooner this type of farmer is banished from the country the better.  This Budget is going one further step along the road. The farmer whose valuation is over £25 is getting some relief.  If the farmer over £25 valuation cannot live surely the man under £25 cannot live?  It means that more and more houses throughout the country will be closed.  The country towns will also suffer because the people there cannot make a living unless the population of the countryside remains.  The countryside is becoming more deserted day by day and this Budget is doing nothing to improve that situation.  In fact, the few things contained in it to help the farmers are nothing short of an insult.</P>
    <P>The Minister has tried to convey the impression that the farmers' demands are based on greed or on envy of their luckier brothers who are able to get increases in their incomes or wages. That is not the case.  There has been a fierce outcry amongst the farming community against the high rates.  As I have said often before, and it is worth repeating, the farmers never objected to paying while they had it but the farmers' situation is desperate because they have not the wherewithal to meet their bills.  Some of that decrease of 112,000 cattle for last year will continue next year and the year after and in a year's time if the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dr. Ryan, is there, he will have a very different story from what he had this time.</P>

      <P>Over the past 40 years at this time of the year very serious problems of State have had to be faced by Ministers for Finance.  The various occupants of that office have, over the years, treated the House to comparable speeches of inept platitudes and political clichés.  The speech to which we have listened today is in similar vein, the only difference being that today the Minister for Finance is facing the most serious position that has ever faced this country, I suppose, since the Act of Union, if it is not even more important than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances the Minister has provided us with this completely unimaginative and inept speech.  These proposals are merely a measure of the <Col N="1647" /> failure of the Minister and his Party over the years to create anything like prosperity in Ireland.  The speeches I have heard on every occasion I have been here over the past few years and any speeches I have read, have all had the same content: &ldquo;Prosperity is just around the corner.  We are facing a new upsurge in the life of the country and the welfare of the people is only a matter of a very short time.&rdquo; While we have listened to those speeches and while the public have read those speeches over the last 40 years a great number of our people have had to leave the country because they could not find work here due to the policy of successive Ministers for Finance and of successive Governments.</P>
    <P>If I am being unfair may I say that we have heard recently, from the Government benches of all places, that suddenly the brake has been taken off, some impediment to prosperity, to the expansion of our economy, to an increase in our national income has been removed, some deadweight has been lifted off the body politic of our society which has allowed the Taoiseach to come forward to supply the nostrums, to create this society bursting at the seams with prosperity and which we are now told we are living in today. Could any member of the Government Party please tell us the name of the impediment?  Why is it that he received support from the Government Party over all these years if he was that great obstruction to progress and prosperity?</P>
    <P>Let us assume that that is an overstatement of the position.  What has happened in the five or six years? Each year we have been presented with a rosy spectacle, the Minister for Finance telling us about the prosperity around the corner, how well we are doing, that exports have been increasing, production going up, that the worker was never better off.  With all that rosy talk, in spite of all the reiterated promises of prosperity, there was a net drop of three per cent. in the number of people in the country.  Throughout the whole <Col N="1648" /> history of several of the separate Governments over the last 40 years we have never had less than between seven to 10 per cent. of the people unemployed in addition to a continual rate of emigration starting at 16,000 a year and recently running between 40,000 and 50,000.  All the time there has been a failure on the part of successive Ministers to understand the problems that were facing them and to undertake the measures that were needed to deal with those problems.</P>
    <P>One of the dangers of living in a heavily censored society such as ours, a closed society such as ours, where the political leaders control most of the outlets of information, education, press, television, the radio a mythology can very easily be built up about any particular side of the society about which the leaders of the society want to create such a mythology.  Probably the greatest and most misleading mythology in history is that which is being built up about the success of Irish industry since the early Thirties. Because of the dependent nature of our industries, because they are, in the main, subsidiaries of parent industries outside the country, because of their structure, we said, when the Common Market proposition was put forward here, that it was inevitable that the vast majority of our industries would be unable to stand up to the competition of the Common Market.  It was inevitable, we said, because of the protected manner in which they have continued to exist over the years, because of their complete failure to make any attempt to develop export markets, because of their complete failure to take any advantage of mechanisation, automation, or the general modernisation of plant and machinery essential to keep pace with developments in the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>We said that then.  We have said it every time an opportunity has arisen here since.  We were told that what we said was not so, that we were unpatriotic, anti-national, and so on. Now, a group of the Minister's officials, handpicked officials, sat down to examine the present state of Irish industry.  In the light of the report which lies on the Minister's desk from <Col N="1649" /> that group, how can he possibly come in here now with this bromide of clichés as his answer to the incomparable competition facing this country, now on the threshold of the Common Market, in the next five or ten years?</P>
    <P>We were taken to task for our criticism of Irish industry, and its failures.  Listen to the criticism by this Government-sponsored body set up to examine the present state of Irish industry, now that we are on the threshold of the Common Market. They say most of our firms are too small.  They say that, because of short production runs, they would not be able to meet competition from outside. They say there is under-utilisation of industrial capacity.  They say there is a lack of vertical integration.  They say there is a relatively high wage cost per unit of output.  They say there is poor design of Irish goods. They say there is a lack of marketing organisation.  Could there be a more categorical condemnation of Irish industry, private enterprise, <i>laissez faire</i>, conservative private enterprise, upon which successive Governments have depended over the past 40 years in order to create a prosperous society, to provide full employment, better health services, better education, and so on ?  On every possible count upon which one can assess the capacity, the quality, or the merit of an industry, Irish industry has been found wanting.</P>
    <P>Now we are faced with an impertinent demand from these people that we should ask the unfortunate taxpayer to find an unlimited sum to subsidise incompetence so that they may weather the rough time ahead in the Common Market, these people who for the past 30 years have mulcted the public with their restrictive trade practices, their <i>cartels</i>, their monopolies of one kind or another.  The public are now called to the rescue.  It is our view that the public should have been asked to come to the rescue 30 years ago with industries based on public ownership.  Had that been done then we would now be in the position to decide for ourselves whether we would go into or stay out of the Common Market instead of being in the position in which we are <Col N="1650" /> at the moment, a tin-can tied to the dog's tail, dragged in by the British Government; if they go in, we go in; if they stay out, we stay out.  Where now is our vaunted independence?  Why were you slaughtering one another between 1916 and 1922, if this was your main ambition for Ireland?</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the Government are indulging now in yet another desperate effort to cling to power.  For that is all this Budget is.  Nothing more.  There is nothing creative in it. There is nothing original in it.  There is nothing new.  There is no promise that the Government have at last grasped the seriousness of our dilemma. Faced with this report on industry, faced with our agricultural economy in the position in which it is, uncompetitive even in the protected Commonwealth market, how can the Minister think we could possibly survive in the competitive terms of Common Market trading?  After 40 years of mis-Government we are now in the position that we are not certain whether we will be taken in at all to the Common Market.  Because we are so near to destitution and such a backward, undeveloped society, if we are to believe the findings of our own commission on Irish industry, they can scarcely make any other decision than to exclude us. Alternatively, if they take us into the Common Market, we will spend our lives as the destitute poor relation at a millionaire's banquet.</P>
    <P>The only wealth we have is the rivers, lakes and land of Ireland.  As Deputy Blowick said, the land will be bought up right, left, and centre, by wealthy refugees from various welfare societies of one kind or another, many of them of doubtful origin.  More sinister still, and more undesirable, is the prospect when we think upon our isolated areas in which it would be possible to establish munitions industries. And still more sinister is the prospect that in these isolated places it would be possible to establish rocket bases and other installations from which they could pelt one another, when the time comes, and we will be target No. 1 in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>That is the measure of it.  Those in <Col N="1651" /> Government today have betrayed the whole cause for which some of them fought so courageously 40 years ago and for which many of their comrades died so bravely.  We are now facing a position in which we have absolutely no control.  It would have been useful if, over the years, Ministers for Finance had framed an intelligent fiscal policy designed to create prosperity in our society.  This Government today are betraying our freedom for certain very doubtful advantages in the European Economic Community. The desperate effort to cling to power is best exemplified by the 2/6d. for the old age pensioner. That is an insult.  Trade unions have obtained 21/-, 25/- or 30/-per week for their workers.  Half-a-crown to the old age pensioner is altogether inadequate.  It is the most offensive proposition in the Budget, rendered more offensive still by the fact that its payment will be delayed until August next.  It is difficult to accept that the Minister actually had the temerity to make this proposition.</P>
    <P>When the motion on social service pensions tabled by the Fine Gael Party was being discussed recently in this House, the Minister said the Budget was the time to deal with matters like that. He gave us to understand that he would put forward his propositions in the Budget.  His promise was quite misleading because it now transpires that the time is not the Budget but rather next August.  Meanwhile, we have the added offensive proposition that the wealthy friends of these people in the judiciary, who are quite well off as it is, are not alone to get an increase in salary, but that the increase will be retrospective to last November.</P>

      <P>With the decrease in the value of the £ it is quite clear that this contribution is grossly inadequate to meet the needs of unfortunate pensioners. Someone said that the taxes we are asked to vote on here are the taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco.  That is not so.  What we have here is yet another example of the departure of <Col N="1652" /> Fianna Fáil from the very fine principle they once had of taxing the wealthy in order to help those not so well off and the poor.  We have had a continuous departure from that principle over the years.  Listening to successive Government statements it would appear now as if there was something sinister or immoral in the proposition that we should impose direct taxation.  Direct taxation is the fairest way of collecting taxes because it is assessed by an independent body which decides on the total income of the individual.  After most careful assessment, it is decided what the individual can most fairly pay and he is asked to pay it.  I cannot see a better or fairer way than that.</P>
      <P>We are not only asked not to tax the wealthy; we are asked to impose a total of £2,000,000 in taxation of an indirect kind, that is, anybody who was involved in the eighth round of wages is now to have some of that money taken back and in fact some of these unfortunates who are not to get their money until August&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good; I shall conclude shortly.  This, in fact, is not the end of the taxation which our people have suffered.  We have had increases in relation to Posts and Telegraphs, increases in the price of bread, another increase in the price of tobacco and another increase in transport charges and a separate increase on beers and stout.  So this is not the taxation figure we are asked to decide on finally today.  The public have had a much greater burden imposed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the tax on tobacco, I naturally support it, but I think it is a completely hypocritical gesture on the part of the Minister to try to create the impression that he is endeavouring to honour the exhortations and the proposal by the College of Physicians, but he forgets the fact that I have asked Ministers who could have taken effective steps to do something about this cancer problem&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to curtail <Col N="1653" /> advertisements for tobacco; the Minister for Health, to intensify his campaign to restrict the use of tobacco, and the Minister for Justice, in his small way, to restrict children from buying cigarettes in slot machines.  It is quite clear that we are in the hands of the same people who have led us into this pitiful situation, a situation in which we are now to lose all rights of planning in this new society, political rights in our new society.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the report we have just heard on industries that there will be a great increase in unemployment which cannot be absorbed.  It is absurd to suggest that in five or six years, we can produce a new industrial superstructure when we could not do it in 40 years.  There will be mass unemployment. There will be continued emigration and there will be the low national income which makes so much rubbish of the suggestion that our percentage donation to social services is comparable with that of other countries. It is only comparable because of the small size of our&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>(3)  That in lieu of the duty of customs imposed by subsection (3) of section 9 of the Act of 1957, there shall, as on and from the 11th day of April, 1962, be charged, levied and paid, on mum, spruce or black beer, Berlin white beer, and other preparations (whether fermented or not fermented) of a similar character imported into the State, a duty of customs at the following rates, that is to say:</P>

    <P>(a)  for every thirty-six gallons of beer of which the worts are, or were <Col N="1658" /> before fermentation, of a specific gravity not exceeding one thousand, two hundred and fifteen degrees&mdash; forty-seven pounds, eight shillings;</P>
    <P>(b)  for every thirty-six gallons of beer of which the worts are, or were before fermentation, of a specific gravity exceeding one thousand, two hundred and fifteen degrees&mdash;fiftyfive pounds, eleven shillings.</P>
    <P>(4)  That in lieu of the duty of customs imposed by subsection (4) of section 9 of the Act of 1957, there shall, as on and from the 11th day of April, 1962, be charged, levied and paid on all beer of any description (other than beer chargeable with duty at a rate provided by paragraph (3) of this Resolution) imported into the State, a duty of customs at the rate of eleven pounds, seventeen shillings for every thirty-six gallons of beer of which the worts were before fermentation of a specific gravity of one thousand and fifty-five degrees.</P>
    <P>(5)  That there shall be allowed and paid on the exportation as merchandise or the shipment for use as stores of beer on which it is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, that duty at a rate provided by paragraph (2), paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) of this Resolution has been paid, a drawback calculated according to the original specific gravity of such beer, at the rate of eleven pounds, sixteen shillings and ninepence on every thirty-six gallons of beer of which the original specific gravity was one thousand and fifty-five degrees.</P>
    <P>(6)  That where, in the case of beer which is chargeable with duty at the rate provided by paragraph (2) or paragraph (4) of this Resolution or in the case of beer on which drawback under paragraph (5) of this Resolution is payable, the specific gravity of such beer is not one thousand and fifty-five degrees, the said duty or the said drawback (as the case may be) shall be varied proportionately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a point that seems obscure.  The Resolution proposes to impose an additional duty of 31/- on the standard barrel of beer. I understand the standard barrel to be 36 gallons.  If you divide, 31/- representing 372 pence by 36, it gives you the answer of 10.3 pence.  Would that be correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are eight pints in a gallon.  I am always subject to correction and I am trying to get information. I have divided eight into 10.3d. and that appears to me to represent 1.3d. which is, as far as I know, a differential of 33? per cent. instead of 25 per cent. as the Minister announced it was his intention to apply under these proposals.  Not only that, but as there is no unit of currency representing 0.3d. the public will be charged a halfpenny because the publican is not likely to bear the loss of three-tenths of a penny for every pint.  We are opposed to the imposition of this tax.</P>
      <P>It has been said these taxes are being raised to provide finance to increase pensions and relieve the rates of the agricultural community.  We believe it is a good thing to reduce the rates of the agricultural community and we have directed the attention of the country and the Government to the possibility of doing that and announced our intention during the last general election campaign of doing it, if afforded the opportunity by the electorate.  We believe that with the increased cost of living, a heavy burden falls on the old age pensioners, the widows and all classes of pensioners, as Deputy Cosgrave and others of my colleagues expressed in moving a resolution here in the past month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe it is a good thing to help the agricultural community to meet the increased cost of living they have to <Col N="1660" /> bear, but the yield of this tax comes largely from the very category of persons to whom I have referred and it is being devoted to removing the tax on dance halls and cinemas.  I do not think it is a reasonable thing in this day and age to lay a heavy burden on the licensed trade of the country, who are having a pretty rough time of it as it is, by reducing the total volume of their trade.  But what is a far greater argument against it is the levying of 1½d. on the pint of the working man or of the old age pensioner or of persons with fixed incomes in order to take it off the dance halls and the cinemas.</P>
    <P>We realise that cinemas are having a hard time, consequent on the added competition provided by television, and a modest proposal to help them would have our sympathetic consideration, but a proposal to put 1.3d. on the pint of beer in order to take the tax off dance halls and cinemas is inequitable, unreasonable and unfair.  On the broad, general principles I have mentioned, we are opposed to this tax and will vote against it.  I would now ask the Minister how in his Budget statement he felt it proper to describe a tax as being 25 per cent. less than in fact it is.  There is a very wide difference between a tax of a penny on the pint and 1.3d. and therefore I think the Minister owes us an explanation on that score.  As I have said, this is a tax against which we propose to vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard barrel is given at 1,055 specific gravity.  That is higher than the gravity at which stout is sold.  I am told beer is sold at less gravity.</P>

I did not get an answer to that question and I want to make it quite clear to the country, through the Minister's answer, what the people are paying in tobacco tax already and on cigarettes.  We are putting on 2d. extra.  We are asking the cigarette smokers of this country to pay a tax of ? on every 20 cigarettes they buy. Who are the cigarette smokers?  The vast majority of them are in the lower income group.  I want to hear the Minister's reply.  The Minister replied to the question in so far as cigarettes are concerned but he did not reply to the question in regard to tobacco. What is the actual tax at the present time on hard pressed and loose tobacco?  Before this Resolution is implemented, if it will be implemented, I want a simple answer to that <Col N="1678" /> question.  Surely the Minister or his advisers know the answer?</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £7,824,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities and miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, I shall begin my remarks on the Estimate by referring to the more significant vital statistics for the preceding calendar year and to some matters which will arise as the statistics are considered. The figures I shall quote are at this stage provisional, but it need not be anticipated that there will be any major alteration in them when final figures become available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of births registered in 1961 was 59,826 as compared with 60,730 in 1960.  The birth rate, at 21.3 per thousand population, was again significantly higher than in England and Wales where it was 17.4 per 1,000, or in Scotland where it was 19.5 per 1,000.  Marriages were slightly fewer in 1961 than in 1960, the numbers being 15,140 as against 15,420.  The number of deaths, at 34,548, showed an increase of 1,890 over the previous year.  The greater part of this increase is attributable to an outbreak of influenza early in the year which accounted for 1,153 deaths compared with 190 in 1960.  If we add increases in deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis, frequently associated with influenza, we account for 1,419 of the <Col N="1682" /> total of 1,890.  Heart disease was responsible for a further 352 of the increase.  Therefore under these heads alone the total increase in mortality was 1,771.</P>
    <P>Heart disease in the past year, as in previous years, was the greatest single cause of death.  It accounted for 10,985 deaths.  The increasing toll of deaths under this heading seems to be one of the penalties of civilisation.  Advances in science help to lengthen life, and many of our people who in earlier days would have succumbed while still young to pestilences and famine now survive to add to those who develop the diseases and ailments of later years.</P>
    <P>Scientific achievements in other fields, as a result of which we now eat more and richer foods and at the same time have less incentive to take physical exercise, also provide a background which is conducive to diseases of the heart and of the cardiovascular system.</P>
    <P>In contrast to the disadvantages I have indicated, however, as arising from modern conditions of life, I should mention that in many forms of heart disease, particularly in the case of congenital abnormalities, recently developed techniques permit many more lives to be saved and made more full.  Research into the causes of the degenerative diseases of the heart may also be expected in future years to provide us with a means of reducing the very substantial death-rate from this cause.</P>
    <P>The next greatest single cause, namely cancer, was responsible for 4,683 deaths compared with 4,759 in the previous year.  This slight decrease is too small to be significant.  Among the cancer deaths, there were 680 from those forms which are grouped under the title of lung cancer, as against 648 in 1960.  This increase is particularly notable.  Earlier evidence of the association between heavy cigarette smoking and lung cancer has been fortified by the recently published report of the Royal College of Physicians in Britain and by a report to the Danish authorities.</P>
    <P>This fact of the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer has <Col N="1683" /> been prominently published and it is quite unnecessary to labour the point in this speech.  The trouble about smoking is that the decision to smoke or not to smoke is a personal one, to be taken by the individual.  No nation has yet found an unfailing method of influencing the generality of its people to do what common sense dictates in the interest of personal health.  Smoking is not a disease.  It does not inevitably give rise to disease, and where it does, the disease is not communicable.  It does not endanger the public safety; there is no turpitude attaching to it; and it cannot be held to be contrary to public morality.  Consequently there is no justification for making it a crime punishable by law.</P>
    <P>Short of this, it is difficult to see what preventive action could be taken to extirpate the habit; and, even if a Government were so ill-advised as to attempt its extirpation, surely the history of what its sponsors describe as the &ldquo;Noble experiment of Prohibition&rdquo; should be enough to deter it from such foolishness.  In educating the people as to the risks which smoking involves lies our best hope of reducing the incidence of lung cancer.  But the educational programme must be framed with judgment and psychological discernment. Nothing would be more likely to evoke an adverse reaction than bellowing propaganda. A calm and frequent reiteration of the facts as they have been ascertained by the research workers is the best strategy; and this is the line which we are pursuing and intend to pursue with parents, teachers and all who have growing boys and girls in their care. By pursuing it, we hope to induce their elders to dissuade the young from starting and to teach them by example as well as precept that smoking is not &ldquo;the thing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The fact that cancer is the second greatest single cause of death is, of course, not peculiar to this country, but nevertheless it is obviously a matter which we here must view with the greatest concern.  It is to be hoped that as an outcome of the intensive investigations being carried out on a world-wide basis into malignant conditions, <Col N="1684" /> advances will be made in due course on this front commensurate with those which have given us such welcome results in the fight against tuberculosis.  While this is our hope, it is at present only a hope, and it is clearly necessary for us to ensure that adequate services are fully available on a nation-wide scale for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.  With this end in view, I have set up a new Cancer Consultative Council which will advise the Minister for Health by reporting to him on such matters related to the organisation and co-ordination of existing cancer services as he may refer to them.  The new Council has had its first meeting and it is my earnest wish, and my belief, that it will contribute in no small measure to our efforts to combat this disease.</P>
    <P>Last year, I referred to the fact that I had authorised a grant from the Hospitals' Trust Fund to provide a cobalt unit for cancer treatment at St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar.  Unfortunately, difficulties outside the control of the hospital have delayed its installation; but I am assured that the work will be completed and the unit available for the provision of treatment within the next few months.</P>
    <P>The death rate from tuberculosis continued its downward trend in 1961 when the total number of deaths from all forms of the disease reached the lowest figure on record, 419, which was 49 less than in 1960.  The figures for incidence also fell, the number of new and re-activated cases in 1961 being about 200 fewer than in 1960. Nevertheless, it is a sobering thought that the number of new cases is still as high as 3,030.  This is a clear indication that a large pool of infection remains, and that we are still a considerable way from the eradication of the disease.  It is important therefore that our people should make full use of the facilities for the prevention and diagnosis of the disease which are so readily available to them in all areas.</P>
    <P>First in point of time for recourse to it is B.C.G. vaccination.  This simple and safe procedure affords great protection and parents should see to it that their children have the <Col N="1685" /> benefit of it.  It is especially important that young persons leaving a rural environment for the first time to work in towns and cities should take advantage of it.</P>
    <P>Another important procedure is, of course, mass-radiography.  By it the disease can be detected at an early stage when treatment is likely to yield the quickest and best results.  It would appear, unfortunately, that the fall in the death rate has given rise to a high degree of complacency; so that it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure a good response when units of the National Mass Radiography Association visit local areas.  This is to be deplored, because, as I have mentioned, the incidence of the disease here is still very high.  Moreover, its incidence is increasing among older people.  In the interests, therefore, of their own health and the health of their families everyone, old as well as young, should have a regular chest X-ray examination.  The service is there for the asking.  The process takes only a few minutes.  It is painless.  It is free from risk.  There is not even the trouble or embarrassment of undressing. In face of all this, and in view of the safeguard it affords, it is surprising that the public response continues to be far below what is desirable.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report that the downward trend in maternal mortality, which has been evident for some years, continued in 1961.  The rate was 0.45 per 1,000 births as against 0.58 the previous year.  In the case of infants the mortality rate was 30 compared with 29 in 1960.  It is pertinent to these figures to refer to corresponding rates in neighbouring areas.  In 1961 the maternal mortality rate in England and Wales was 0.33, in Scotland it was 0.4 and in Northern Ireland it was 0.5.  The infant mortality rates were: England and Wales 21.4, Scotland 25.8 and Northern Ireland 27.5.  As will be seen, maternal and infant mortality rates here are in general higher than those of our nearest neighbours although they have decreased very considerably in recent years.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, since 31st <Col N="1686" /> March, 1956, maternity services under the Health Act of 1953 have been available to mothers in the middle income group and their infants up to six weeks old.  The same services are also provided for other persons who, in the opinion of the health authority, are unable without undue hardship to provide them for themselves.  The services cover care by a doctor during pregnancy and for six weeks after childbirth, the attendance of a mid-wife and, where necessary, hospital and specialist treatment; and they are free of all direct charge to an eligible patient.</P>
    <P>One of the main aims of the new service was to encourage eligible persons to look for early ante-natal care. This is in accordance with medical opinion which stresses the need for competent supervision of the expectant mother's health throughout her pregnancy, so that any complication may be detected in good time.  Under our scheme, the doctor, provided he is consulted at a sufficiently early stage, is expected to attend the mother, at least four times ante-natally, and twice post-natally. He is also required to make at least one examination of the baby.  The doctor may, of course, see the mother and infant as many other times as he deems necessary.</P>
    <P>The great majority of maternity patients under the scheme&mdash;87 out of every 100&mdash;now have at least four ante-natal attendances by the doctor. One-third of the patients have their first ante-natal examination before the end of the fourth month of pregnancy and slightly more than half of them have their first examination before the end of the fifth month of pregnancy. While this represents a considerable improvement on earlier experience, the position could be still better.  Once again, therefore, I would urge expectant mothers, in the interest of their own health and the safety of their unborn children, to consult their doctors early in their pregnancies&mdash;the earlier the better.</P>
    <P>The provision now being made for ante-natal care has been reflected in the improved figures for maternal and infant mortality; so that in 1961 the number of maternal deaths was 27, as compared with 70 in 1955, before the <Col N="1687" /> maternity service was opened to the middle income group.  The rate for infant mortality has hovered between 35 and 29 per 1,000 births, during the past five years and, standing at 30 for the year 1961, compares with 68 for 1947.</P>
    <P>The present downward trend in mortality among women in childbirth is no doubt gratifying, but let me emphasise it gives no ground for complacency. Everything possible must be done to lessen the risks and reduce mortality still further.  And for this we must depend almost as much on the timeliness and good-sense with which expectant mothers place themselves under medical advice, as on doctors, nurses and hospitals.  Indeed when we consider that the over-all marital pattern in this country is the quite unusual, if not unique one, of relatively late marriage combined with high fertility, the steady decline in maternal deaths here represents a very meritorious achievement and reflects credit upon our medical and nursing professions.</P>
    <P>Before passing from this particular subject, I might mention that a steady change has taken place in the pattern of confinement here during the past six years.  While the overall number of births has remained constant, the number of domiciliary births has dropped from 21,000 in 1955 to 14,000 in 1960.  During this time there has been a corresponding increase in the number of institutional births&mdash;from 15,000 to 17,000 in voluntary hospitals, from 16,000 to 18,000 in local authority hospitals and from 9,000 to 12,000 in registered maternity homes. These figures, which reflect changes in our social pattern which make births away from home the rule, pose some problems in the provision of more institutional accommodation to meet this trend.</P>
    <P>Sixty-four cases of paralytic polio-myelitis were reported in 1961, with seven deaths.  The incidence of this disease fluctuates from year to year and there is no way of foretelling whether in a particular year it will increase or diminish.  Fortunately, there are vaccines which, for a time at least, <Col N="1688" /> afford strong protection, if not indeed virtual immunity, from the disease. Our present public vaccination service is based on the use of an inactivated vaccine and is provided by health authorities for persons aged between six months and forty years, and for expectant mothers, in the lower and middle income groups and for classes who might be at special risk, such as hospital staffs.  The service is free of charge for persons in the lower income group and for the &ldquo;special risk&rdquo; categories.  A charge of 7/6d. for a course of three injections, with an additional charge of 2/6d. for a fourth injection, subject to a maximum contribution from any family of £1, is payable by persons in the middle income group.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have read about developments abroad in the use of oral polio vaccine.  This type of vaccine, being administered orally, has a number of advantages over the inactivated vaccine which we are now using, and which is injected, and I have been considering whether we should adopt it instead.  In that connection, I sought the advice of the Medical Research Council and have received a report which my officers are considering. Meantime, health authorities will continue to provide a vaccination service on the present basis of inactivated vaccine, but financial provision has been included in the Estimate now before the House sufficient to ensure that, if it is decided in principle to change over to oral vaccine, such vaccine will be available in the current year, at least to the extent necessary to deal with a serious outbreak of the disease in any area.</P>
    <P>Although, fortunately for us, smallpox does not figure in our mortality statistics, I wish to say something about it.  First of all it is a most deadly disease, highly infectious and about 50 per cent. fatal where a high degree immunity has not been secured.  Because there has been no case of it in this country for a long time, the public have become largely apathetic about smallpox vaccination. Perhaps we have all tended to lapse into this apathy, lulled by the prevalent opinion that the risk of the disease <Col N="1689" /> being brought into this country from those regions abroad where it is endemic was negligible.  Whatever may have been the case when ours was a comparatively isolated community, such a view is no longer tenable. Admittedly when only slow surface transport was available the risk that the infection might be imported was relatively very low indeed. But the development of air travel has changed all that and persons incubating the disease may arrive here before its symptoms manifest themselves and may disseminate it among our comparatively unprotected population.</P>
    <P>The outbreaks of smallpox which occurred recently not only in various parts of England and Wales but in the Federal Republic of Germany are an emphatic demonstration of the dangers to which I have referred.  Fortunately by the special steps which were taken at our main air and sea-ports we were able to reduce the risk that the disease might be introduced into this country. Planes arriving here from the local infected areas in Britain and in West Germany were given special attention and the passengers were screened by the health staff.  Passengers on other planes and ships arriving here from the countries in which the disease had appeared, and who had been in the infected areas within the previous 16 days were requested to report to the port Health Authority.  Where considered desirable, they were offered vaccination, and their names and destinations were recorded and notified to the Chief Medical Officers of the areas to which they were going so that, if necessary, they might be kept under surveillance.</P>
    <P>I do not feel that it is necessary to elaborate to the House the arrangements settled long since to deal quickly and effectively with the situation which would arise should a case, or a suspected case, of smallpox be found here.  These arrangements, which cover a wide range, have all been specially reviewed in the light of our recent experience.</P>
    <P>Recent vaccination, and I emphasise recent, is, of course, the only sure safeguard against contracting the disease.  The numbers seeking to be <Col N="1690" /> vaccinated or revaccinated in recent months have increased considerably over previous experience.  To achieve a state of optimum protection in the conditions now obtaining here it would be necessary that everyone should accept vaccination or revaccination. The case for the vaccination of infants is particularly strong, as it is an acknowledged fact that a person vaccinated in infancy is least likely to suffer the complications of vaccination and of revaccination later; and in the light of this it appears to me, and there is strong medical support for this view, that it is desirable that we should attempt to ensure that for the future all healthy children should be vaccinated in the first year of life, preferably about the age of four months.  If we could secure this, we could achieve a great deal.  As to adults, it is desirable that at least those who might find themselves at special risk, such as public health and hospital staffs and persons dealing regularly with travellers coming to this country from abroad, as well as those contemplating visits to areas in which there are current outbreaks of the disease, should take steps to assure to themselves and to their households the protection which recent vaccination or revaccination confers.</P>
    <P>So much for the killing, and potentially killing diseases.  I shall now turn to some of the disabling, but not killing, diseases.</P>
    <P>At the head of that list comes mental illness.  To indicate its importance I need only say that we have about 20,000 mental patients, that they occupy about 34% of all our hospital beds, and that the cost of running the district mental hospitals represents over 22% of the net health expenditure of local authorities.</P>
    <P>As the House is already aware, I have entrusted to a competent and broadly based Commission of Inquiry the task of examining our mental health services, with particular reference to the very high number of patients, and of making recommendations for improvements.  Over the years we have striven to improve the quality of the service.  Undoubtedly the patients in our mental hospitals are <Col N="1691" /> now less uncomfortable than they were previously and their prospects of recovery are better than was the case some years ago; but except in a few instances no spectacular developments have taken place.  Our patient population remains unduly high and it would appear that numbers of patients are still being admitted to hospital when their condition is such that it would be better for them to be treated within the community.</P>
    <P>Throughout the year the Commission of Inquiry has been working hard at its allotted task.  Nevertheless, some considerable time must elapse before it is in a position to submit its report. Meanwhile, I have continued the policy of making available to the medical personnel of mental hospitals opportunities for study provided by such agencies as the World Health Organisation and the Council of Europe.  Similarly I have facilitated psychiatric nurses in attending a special refresher course.  Last December, I caused to be held in my Department a meeting, attended by Resident Medical Superintendents and Managers of all district mental hospitals, at which there was a full exchange of views and suggestions for the improvement of the mental health services.  I addressed this meeting and stressed my view that if the condition of the patient warranted it, active treatment should be intensified and every effort made, by resort to the newer drugs and other forms of treatment, to restore him to society.</P>
    <P>Since 1957 there has been a spectacular increase in the total number of attendances at out-patients mental clinics.  Where clinics are well organised and regularly held, patients are naturally more inclined to attend at them at an early stage of their illness and, in many cases, before there is a need for them to be received into hospital as intern patients and thus to obviate the necessity.  It is significant that it is in the areas which have a reasonably well-developed out-patient clinic service that there has been the greatest fall in the numbers of patients maintained in the mental institutions. Treatment at a clinic has many advantages over treatment in a hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1692" /> For instance, the patients do not lose contact with their homes, their relatives and their friends, and consequently are not in the same need of resettlement as if they have spent a relatively long period in hospital.  Moreover, the economies in treating patients as out-patients are obvious.</P>
    <P>It is now generally realised that the after-care of psychiatric patients is essential, and that if this is not provided patients tend to relapse and have to be re-admitted to hospital.  A doubt as to whether mental hospital authorities had the necessary statutory power to organise after-care services was resolved by the enactment of Section 31 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>I am glad to take this opportunity of complimenting those Mental Hospital Authorities and their officers who organised &ldquo;open days&rdquo; and similar functions in connection with the World Mental Health Year.  In a most effective way they demonstrated to the public that mental hospitals are not primarily places of detention but places of recovery and cure.  Some mental hospitals have gone further in demonstrating that the attitude to psychiatric illness should be no different from the attitude towards physical illness.</P>
    <P>In one of those which I visited in the course of the year, I found that physical as well as psychological barriers had been broken down and that a long section of the high boundary wall along a busy main road had been removed almost entirely and not replaced even by a railing.  I have little doubt that the enlightened attitude thus manifested towards the patients of that hospital will do much to improve their morale and to enhance their prospects of early recovery and reintegration as useful members of the community.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Mental Handicap also continued its deliberations throughout the year but, as in the case of the other Commission I have mentioned, it will be some time before we can expect their report and recommendations.</P>
    <P>During the year, work commenced on extensions of 143 beds at Cregg <Col N="1693" /> House, Sligo, and 120 beds at Delvin, Co. Westmeath.  Both places are homes for the care and education of mentally-handicapped children.</P>
    <P>Various other possibilities of securing additional institutional accommodation for the mentally handicapped are being considered in my Department. Some of these involve the diversion to this purpose of accommodation at present being used by health authorities for other purposes and in due course may result in approaches by my Department to the health authorities concerned.  I hope that Deputies who are members of health authorities will give sympathetic consideration to any such approach made to their health authority.  Despite the fact that we have provided more beds for the mentally handicapped in recent years, the shortage is still great, so I would plead that proposals designed to make additional accommodation available should be received most favourably by health authority members.</P>
    <P>The House will be glad to learn that in the course of the past twelve months we have happily been able to make a fair degree of progress in tackling the questions of medical and vocational rehabilitation.  I have already paid public tribute, both inside and outside the House, to the noble part played by voluntary organisations in getting this important work under way.  But I wish to repeat that the work of these bodies not only supplements in a substantial way our activities, but is a source of encouragement to us in what is, as yet, only an early stage in our endeavours in this important field.</P>
    <P>Even at this early stage the work which is being done in the hospital of Our Lady of Lourdes, Dun Laoghaire, where the Sisters of Mercy and the National Organisation for Rehabilitation have established the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre is very rewarding.  A fairly considerable capital outlay has yet to be provided for in order to develop the hospital to the full and to bring it up to the standard necessary. But when fully developed, the work of the centre will include restoration of function in traumatic cases, a centralised limb-fitting service and the rehabilitation of paraplegics.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> Particular attention has to be given to the problem of securing a sufficiency of occupational therapists.  Questions of training other skilled paramedical personnel also arise.  I have sought the best expert advice available on these problems and have under consideration the necessary steps which should be made to deal with them.</P>
    <P>Coincident with the opening of the National Medical Rehabilitation Centre, there has been a quickening of interest in the general question of rehabilitation.  It is important that our public health personnel and authorities who hitherto have thought so much in terms of active disease and preventive medicine, should have their minds orientated more to rehabilitation as a real function of the health services.  The seminar organised by the National Organisation for Rehabilitation at the Dun Laoghaire Centre in September last year will, I hope, prove to be the first of a number of discussions designed to arouse an active interest in this field of curative endeavour.</P>
    <P>Vocational rehabilitation, as distinct from medical rehabilitation, has developed apace under voluntary auspices generally.  Much of the funds which have financed this development have come from voluntary sources, but the activities of these bodies have so developed that I feel that their resources ought to be supplemented from public funds.  The problem when reduced to legal terms will be one of making regulations under subsections (1) and (2) of Section 50 of the Health Act, 1953, dealing with the training of disabled persons.  I propose to make regulations accordingly prescribing the conditions under which financial assistance may be given to organisations whose purpose is to provide suitable training facilities for the disabled.  In order that disabled persons may derive greatest benefit from the work of the several organisations now concerned with rehabilitation, it is essential to ensure that, so far as may be possible, the aptitudes of those seeking training are matched with the kind of work best suited to them.  The National Organisation for Rehabilitation has this question of vocational assessment under consideration and I hope to see <Col N="1695" /> their proposals take practical shape in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate at this stage that I should tell the House what has happened in the last year under the more important enactments which were before it in recent times.</P>
    <P>Under the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act, 1960, I am empowered to make regulations providing for the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in any area, but, before doing so, I must cause to be made a survey of the incidence of dental caries in a representative sample of school children in that area and an analysis or series of analyses, of the fluorine content, etc., of each public piped water supply in the area.  Reports on such dental caries surveys and water analyses must be presented to each House of the Oireachtas.  Surveys have now been completed in Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow, Cork, Limerick and Waterford and are at present being conducted in a number of other counties, including Louth, Wexford and Laois.  During the past year also, arrangements were made for the analysis of public piped water supplies in the areas in which the surveys have been completed or are in progress.  A report setting out the results of the surveys in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow will shortly be presented to the Oireachtas.  In the light of the information contained in it, I think that it will be admitted that, in general, the dental health of school children in the areas covered by this particular survey is very unsatisfactory.  Moreover, the results of the analyses of the water sources which supply the area covered by the dental survey confirm the findings of the previous water survey that in only a few of them is fluorine present and then only in insignificant quantities.</P>
    <P>The procedures I have mentioned will be carried out as quickly as possible in the remaining counties until the entire country has been covered.</P>
    <P>The Medical Research Council of Ireland kindly agreed to be responsible for the caries surveys, the cost of which is being met by grants from the Hospitals <Col N="1696" /> Trust Fund.  I would like to put on record my sincere thanks to the council for undertaking this important public task.  I would like also to place on record my appreciation of the willing co-operation afforded to the survey teams by the managers and teachers of all the schools approached.</P>
    <P>After the report I have mentioned in relation to Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow has been presented, the next step is to make regulations providing for the fluoridation of specified water supplies in those areas.  These will be made shortly and in accordance with the law will be laid before the Oireachtas. Regulations covering supplies in other areas will follow in due course, after compliance with the statutory requirements.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary, once fluoridation is introduced, to carry out a continuing and detailed examination of the status as to dental caries in order that the extent of improvement in dental health may be accurately measured.  This will involve having recurring scientific surveys made on a representative sample of the child population, of various ages, these surveys being of a much more detailed character than those already carried out.  I am advised that it will be sufficient if these surveys are conducted in a single area, and I have under consideration at present the best means of organising and arranging for them.  I hope to be able to combine with them an assessment of the benefits to be derived from the topical application of fluorides, that is, the application of a fluoride solution to the surfaces of the children's teeth by trained personnel.  A number of studies which have been, and are being, carried out in U.S.A. and Canada give grounds for hope that it may be practicable and rewarding to introduce this procedure for children in parts of the country where public piped water supplies are not available.</P>
    <P>The Mental Treatment Act, 1961, has been brought into operation.  As a result, unnecessary procedures have been cut out, resulting in smoother administration of the mental treatment code.  Staffs employed in district mental hospitals, unless they decided to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo;, have had applied to them, with <Col N="1697" /> modifications, the general local government superannuation code&mdash;incidentally, my information is that very few have opted out.  Since 1st March last the power to make a recommendation or sign a certificate for the reception of a patient as a chargeable patient has been extended to medical practitioners generally so that the family doctor may now give the necessary recommendation or certificate, a power which previously was reserved to the district medical officer.  In that connection, the booklet, a draft of which I circulated to Deputies to facilitate them in considering the Bill when it was before the House, has been revised and put on sale and should be of great help to persons concerned with the administration of any aspects of the Mental Treatment Acts.</P>
    <P>The Poisons Act, 1961, provided for the establishment of an expert Advisory Council on poisons, whose function it will be to advise the Minister for Health and the Minister for Agriculture on up-to-date controls on the sale and use of poisons.  The council has now been set up and will begin its deliberations shortly.  The making of regulations based on the advice of this council should, in due course, ensure that an up-to-date, comprehensive and flexible poisons code will be in operation in this country.</P>
    <P>The Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, which provides for the federation and ultimately, by consent, the amalgamation of seven distinct Dublin voluntary hospitals, was also brought into operation during the year to the extent that the hospitals are now federated.  The object of the measure was to secure a degree of co-ordination and co-operation between the hospitals concerned in the interest not so much of saving money, desirable as that may be, as of providing a better service for the patients whom they serve.  I have previously paid tribute, in this House and elsewhere, to the readiness with which the boards of the several hospitals agreed to sink their individuality and surrender some of their autonomy for the common good.  My only regret is that they could not, at this stage, agree to go all the way and decide on amalgamation; but <Col N="1698" /> I hope the day is not too far distant when they will see their way to take that decision.</P>
    <P>The past year has witnessed accelerated progress in hospital building activity.  The amount expended by way of grants and loans on capital works in the year was about £860,000 as compared with £770,000 in 1960/ 61.  If present indications should prove to be reasonably near the mark, the comparable annual rate of capital expenditure in the years 1962/63, 1963/64 and 1964/65 will be £1,500,000, £1,900,000 and £2 millions respectively.</P>
    <P>One of the main reasons why I am able to envisage this accelerated rate of spending is that the improved position of the Hospitals Trust Fund has enabled me to authorise a significant resumption of hospital building activity.  Planning is now being actively pursued on schemes estimated to cost some £6½ millions.  Works at voluntary hospitals account for about £3½ millions of this programme and the approved health authority hospital building programme is estimated to cost almost £3 millions, about half of which will be met by way of grants from the Hospitals Trust Fund.  I might also mention that works at mental hospitals account for about two-thirds of the cost of the health authority programme.</P>
    <P>Apart from the foregoing, I have also under consideration further works proposed by hospital authorities involving an estimated total expenditure of a further £6½ millions.  It is also probable that arising out of the reports of the Commissions on Mental Illness and on the Mentally Handicapped it will be necessary to incur further considerable expenditure on buildings and equipment.  The need for improved accommodation for nursing and domestic staffs must also be dealt with, and, of course, there is always pressure from existing hospitals for improved facilities for the treatment of their patients.  The total expenditure to be faced under all the heads I have enumerated will amount to very many millions, all of which will be necessary, not merely to keep our more modern hospitals abreast of <Col N="1699" /> the times, but to make good the sad deficiencies which still exist under many heads.  We have a mighty programme before us, and I am sorry to say that, as I shall show later, we are not getting from certain quarters the co-operation which is necessary to enable it to be completed in an expeditious and orderly way.</P>
    <P>The financial position, in so far as the Hospitals Trust Fund is concerned and so far as can be foreseen, is that the moneys necessary to finance all the works which have actually been approved or proposed, or which are likely to be called for over the next few years, will not be available to the extent sought.  Nor is there any prospect of an early improvement in that regard.  Furthermore, health authorities will be competing with other borrowers from the Local Loans Fund for a share in the resources available for capital works.  It is therefore imperative that all hospital building projects should be carefully pruned so as to avoid lavishness in either the nature or the extent of the works proposed. A thorough reassessment must be made of the existing resources in the way of hospital accommodation of the extent to which existing deficiencies in any particular type may be made good by prospective reductions in demands for accommodation of another kind; it is essential to ensure that accommodation likely to become surplus to requirements will be utilised as far as possible, so that new building may be obviated where that is feasible.</P>
    <P>In recent years the implementation of our construction programme has been greatly retarded by a shortage of money.  Our situation today in that regard is easier and more liquid than it used to be, inasmuch as we have overtaken and discharged outstanding commitments to contractors and have built up a cash reserve to ensure that once works have been begun they will be carried through to completion&mdash;or at least will not be held up for lack of cash.  But, while building and other costs have been rising rapidly, the income out of which these costs are defrayed has risen very much more <Col N="1700" /> slowly, indeed is tending to find a constant level.</P>
    <P>This adverse situation has been greatly aggravated by recent developments in the building industry.  By reason of the eighth round increases, wages in the building industry have advanced by about 7 per cent. over the past year, and this factor, intensified by increases in the prices of materials and reduced working hours in the Dublin area, has been reflected in tenders.  Moreover, due to the high level of building activity which now obtains there is only limited competition for building projects generally. Hence tenders and prices are much less satisfactory than they were a year or two ago.  This not only reduces our financial capacity to give effect to our building programme, but highlights the unnecessary difficulties caused for everyone by the tardiness of certain clients and their professional consultants to bring their plans to tender stage.</P>
    <P>The dilatory way in which some important institutional projects have been handled by those who have been commissioned to plan them has become not only a source of embarrassment and grave inconvenience, but calls for special action.  The works in question are an essential part of the over-all hospital programme.  They were approved in principle and their main features and functions settled many years ago and since then frequent consultations in regard to their details have taken place between the officers of my Department and the architects, quantity surveyors, and other consultants concerned.  The difficult financial position which developed in 1956 slowed down, perhaps even led to the suspension of, the active planning of these projects; but in 1959 and 1960 the financial situation was so much easier that I felt justified in allowing those concerned to press forward with the proposed works, albeit with very definite restrictions as to their over-all cost.</P>
    <P>The House will be as disappointed as I am that some of these major projects are not yet ready to go to tender on the basis of complete contract documents.  Such explanations <Col N="1701" /> as I have received have not, in at least one case, satisfied me that the delays in planning, in taking out quantities and in proceeding to tender have been warranted.  My dissatisfaction in this instance has been aggravated by the fact that other commissions entrusted at a later date to the consultants concerned appear to have been executed with much greater expedition.  This is not good enough. In view of the urgent need to make good the deficiencies of several generations, in view of the humanitarian considerations which are involved, projects included in the Hospital Construction Programme must in future be accorded the highest priority by those concerned, whether as sponsors, technical consultants, or in any other way with the project.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that the planning of a major hospital scheme is a complex affair, and that certain staffing problems have arisen over the past year or two which may have impeded consultants in their efforts to make progress, but when it has become evident that it is taking far longer than two years to arrive at a stage when the clients would be in a position to seek tenders, then I am driven to the conclusion that the consultants concerned have not recognised the pressing urgency of these hospital works, have taken their responsibilities in regard to them too easily and under the pressure of other business have put the planning of them aside and only resumed it as other demands for their services slackened off.</P>
    <P>It is very frustrating to have achieved a liquid financial position and yet to find that certain hospital authorities who a few years ago were on my door-step importuning me for funds have been slow in taking up the money which they have been told is available to them.  The money in the Hospitals Trust Fund has been accumulated for the financing of the hospital construction programme, and not for other purposes, no matter how meritorious they may be.  All the works in that programme are urgently required. Mainly on the practical ground that everything could not be undertaken at once, some items have been accorded <Col N="1702" /> priority over others, perhaps in themselves just as urgent.  They have been given that priority on the assumption that the authorities putting them forward would see to it that the designated works were executed as expeditiously as possible. As I have said, I am far from satisfied in one or two instances that the need for expedition in planning and construction has been realised.  But I do not intend to wait indefinitely on the convenience of hospital authorities, or the consultants employed by them, whoever may be responsible.  I intend to keep this position under review, and within the next three months I propose, in any case in which it is clear that there has been needless delay in preparing the documents necessary for the obtaining of firm tenders, to give the most serious consideration to the question of withdrawing any assurance of a grant, thereby releasing the funds hypothecated so as to finance other projects. Any projects in respect of which grants might be withdrawn under this policy will lose their priority, and will be placed at the end of the queue.</P>
    <P>The approved procedure to be followed by the authorities of participating voluntary hospitals who required assistance from the Hospitals Trust Fund for works which it was desired to undertake was laid down in a circular letter to all voluntary hospital authorities which issued from the Hospitals Commission in 1954.  This letter gave clear warning of what would happen if the procedure were not followed.  In 1957, in a further circular letter, this time from my Department, the warning was repeated.  In 1959, speaking here on the Health Estimate for that year I said, as reported in Volume 175, Columns 191 and 192 of the Dáil Debates:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... it will be worse than that to look for grants in respect of projects or commitments entered upon without my prior sanction.  Let there be no doubt about it: I shall refuse to be coerced by any <i>fait accompli</i>; and those who think otherwise are likely to find themselves shouldering not merely the capital cost of their new venture but every other expense arising out of it as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> I am forced to speak bluntly in this matter because in some quarters there is a disposition to think that hospital authorities can spend first and then turn to the Minister for Health for recoupment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it will be agreed that I could hardly put the point more strongly. Moreover, in a further letter issued in June 1959 I drew the attention of the authorities of all participating hospitals to the statement and warned them that it would be strictly adhered to.  I have now to repeat the warning as strongly and as emphatically as before.  It may seem extraordinary that I should have to do so, but a number of glaring examples of complete disregard for its most explicit terms have come to my notice over the past year.  These will be dealt with as foreshadowed in the statement which I have quoted and in the circular letters of 1954, 1957 and 1959.  And to make certain that the position is again made clear to all concerned, I repeat once more that, so long as I am Minister for Health, no assistance will be forthcoming from the Hospitals Trust Fund for any works undertaken or commitments entered into without the prior approval of the Minister signified in writing, stating the amount of the grant and specifying the works in respect of which it will be given.</P>
    <P>Some years ago it was often difficult for a patient to obtain admittance to a public hospital at short notice; but in latter years pressure in this regard has considerably eased.  The fact indeed is that in respect of hospital beds, we appear to be better off than many other European countries.  The ten year hospital building plan recently published in Great Britain enables us to compare our position and progress with theirs.  The most striking feature of the comparison is that in England and Wales, there are at present about 3.9 acute beds per 1,000 of the population, against 6.8 here. Inherent differences &mdash;population densities and so forth&mdash; which exist make direct comparison of figures open to qualification but, even allowing for these, it is true to say that our acute bed ratio is proportionately much in excess of the British figure.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> The British authorities have fixed on a ratio of 3.3 acute hospital beds per 1,000 population as being the figure to be aimed at in their 10 year plan.  They consider that this reduced ratio for acute hospital beds can be secured by the development of home and communtiy services; by increased efficiency in the hospitals; by the development of out-patient facilities; and by substituting for existing small general purpose or special hospitals large general-purpose establishments, so as to obtain a more efficient and effective bed user.  These are the lines on which we ourselves have been moving, even if our progress has been retarded by lack of resources, and by the difficulty, in some cases, of reconciling divergent interests.</P>
    <P>In point of scale, it might be said that our biggest task now is not the further expansion of our acute hospital bed complement but the modernisation or replacement of existing obsolescent accommodation.  Considerable work has already been done in this sphere and it has been facilitated by the fact that we have been able to divert redundant institutional accommodation to other purposes.  A gratifying example of this is well known to the House.  It is the extent to which we have been able to apply to other uses beds which originally were provided for patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis. Over two-thirds of such beds have been thus diverted and there are indications that still more will become available. In the case of other infectious diseases a similar decline in incidence has been manifested, so that a number of fever hospitals have been utilised for other purposes or where, for various reasons, this would not be justifiable have been closed down altogether with consequent savings to public funds.  However, we must bear in mind that a substantial margin of fever beds is necessary to ensure that adequate isolation facilities are available at all times as insurance against possible epidemics, and a levelling-off in this trend is likely.</P>
    <P>Last year I stressed the duty of local health authorities to maintain in good condition the fabric of their health institutions.  I have since requested <Col N="1705" /> these authorities to make proper provision for regular and effective inspection of their institutions and for the prompt and systematic reinstatement of structural defects.  As part of a general examination of the problem, comprehensive information has been obtained from the authorities regarding the arrangements which they are making under this head.  In addition, a number of institutions have been specially inspected by technical officers of the Department who have reported specially on the manner in which the buildings have been maintained.  All the information thus obtained is being studied and will form the basis of a draft programme for effective buildings maintenance which it is hoped to issue this year.</P>
    <P>The House will be glad to learn that the schemes of voluntary health insurance operated under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, continue to develop very satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The financial year of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board ended on 28th February last, and during it the number of persons insured increased by 28,000 to 133,000.  This represents steady progress and I am sure that increasing awareness of the value of the service will result in continued expansion in the years to come.</P>
    <P>The Legislature, in laying down the mode of administration of the voluntary health insurance system, made the provision that the subscriptions provided for the different schemes adopted by the Board should be fixed so that, taking one year with another, the total revenue should be sufficient, but only sufficient, after the Board has made such allowance as it thinks proper for reserves, depreciation and other like purposes, to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.  During this period when the number of subscribers is growing rapidly, the question of the reserves to be made for future heavier liabilities will be crucial to the continued success and stability of the Board's operations.  I am glad to say that in my opinion the Board, while pursuing an imaginative and progressive policy in the matter of benefits, <Col N="1706" /> has continued to operate a wise degree of financial prudence.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for 1962/63 shows a net increase of £1,500,200 over the original Estimate for 1961/62, but the real increase, even over the original Estimate, is less than that figure by £300,000 approximately.  If Deputies will turn to the details of the appropriations-in-aid in Part III of the Estimate in the Volume of Estimates, they will find that no provision is made in 1962/63 for a receipt, for credit of the Vote, on foot of licence duty grant and estate duty grant.  These grants, prior to the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, were payable to all local public assistance authorities and health authorities in relief of rates for health services.  Under the 1947 Act they were merged in the health grant which, in the events which have happened, now amounts to 50 per cent. of net local health expenditure.  When the 1947 Act was being enacted, the way was not yet clear for the abolition of this anachronism of assigning specific proportions of certain revenue duties to specific expenditures and the device was therefore adopted of charging the new, compounded, health grant to the Vote and taking account of these old grants as a credit item. The process of rationalising this position has been prolonged but it has now been decided that these Exchequer grants in relief of Exchequer expenditure are to go and, as the Minister for Finance said this afternoon, appropriate legislative proposals to that end will be placed before the House by him in the near future.  I would like to emphasise that this is merely a matter of rational book-keeping.  The Exchequer will not gain anything as a result of the change and local authorities will not lose anything, immediately or prospectively.  The result, however, is to increase the amount of certain Votes, notably the one now before the House.</P>
    <P>Taking account of this book-keeping change, the net increase in the Vote provision over the original estimate for 1961-62 is reduced to £1,200,000.  Practically the whole of this increase is attributable to Subhead G&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities, <Col N="1707" /> which accounts for £1,160,000 of the increase, though Subhead A&mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances for the officers of my Department, accounts for £33,000.  Increases and decreases on other subheads are casual and do not call for comment, except for two items where new services are involved.</P>
    <P>In the details of Subhead F&mdash; Expenses in connection with advisory and consultative bodies, there is a provision of £10 for contingencies. Earlier in my remarks, I referred to the need for a small, but intensive and continuing, scientific survey to measure for the record, in as precise a form as is possible, the effect on dental caries of the introduction of fluorine into public piped water supplies. At the same time I wish, as I have said, to investigate what effect the topical application of fluorine to teeth might be expected to have in retarding dental decay here.  As a result I would hope to be able to arrive at a sound opinion as to whether or not topical application might be usefully used as a preventive of tooth decay in areas in which, in the absence of piped water supplies, children would be deprived of the benefits of fluoridation.</P>
    <P>When the Estimate was being prepared, my discussions with appropriate authorities and my examination of the question generally had not reached a stage when I could estimate the cost in this year of such a survey under proper scientific auspices.  My consultations and examination are not yet complete, but they have reached a stage when it is possible to be a little more precise and I now estimate that the cost will be of the order of £4,000 in the current year.  This will include the expenses of an appropriate scientific advisory body, the cost of securing expert scientific opinion from abroad and actual expenses of the survey.  To the extent to which the cost cannot be met from the provision in the subhead, I propose that it should be met by virement.</P>
    <P>The second of the minor subheads to which I wish to direct special attention is Subhead O, which relates <Col N="1708" /> to the training scheme for health inspectors.</P>
    <P>Provision for the creation of the grade of Health Inspector was made in Section 75 of the Health Act, 1947, and there are now some 160 persons thus employed by local authorities throughout the country.  Under the County Medical Officers of Health, the health inspectors have been doing excellent work for the advancement of public health.  As yet, however, no fully satisfactory course of basic training for them has been devised, and no course laid down so far has been found to be fully satisfactory in respect of curriculum, standards and duration. The need, therefore, for a fresh approach to the problem is manifest.  I feel that the most satisfactory form of course would be one extending over a period of some years, based on the appointment of students as pupil health inspectors under local authorities, coupled with an extended course of theoretical training.  I am proposing to set up a Health Inspectors' Training Board which will organise a suitable course.  Until the details are fully worked out, it is not possible to say what the cost will be but the token provision in Subhead O, if approved, will enable a commencement to be made this year.</P>
    <P>To revert now to the two major subheads, there is an increase of £33,000, as I have mentioned, for salaries, wages and allowances of the staff of my Department.  This increase is due in the main to the general increases in salaries throughout the Civil Service.  The full impact of these increases will be borne for the first time in the current year.</P>
    <P>Of the increase of £1,160,000 under Subhead G&mdash;Grants to Health Authorities, no less than £840,000 is attributable directly to increases in salaries of staffs generally and to increases in the strengths of nursing staffs due to the reduction from a 96-hour fortnight for nurses.</P>
    <P>When introducing the Supplementary Estimate for Health last year I mentioned that more than 55 per cent. of the net expenditure of health authorities in that year was attributable to <Col N="1709" /> salaries of health authority staffs alone.  Incidentally, if I had included the element for staff costs in the payments made by health authorities for services given to their patients in extern institutions, the percentage figures would have been much higher.  The fundamental point to be borne in mind, however, when these figures are under review, is that health services are, in the main, services given personally by highly trained persons whose work must be paid for at rates commensurate with their training and abilities. I must emphasise that point because the eighth round increases for medical, nursing and kindred staffs were not related specifically to the cost of living. If they were, the rates of increase would have been much lower.  Rather have they resulted from a reappraisal of the value of the work done by those staffs, and while I am as ready as the next to seek to protect the interests of the ratepayers and the taxpayers, I do not feel that I need apologise to anybody for the increases which I have sanctioned in these instances.</P>
    <P>But even if my thinking in this matter were conditioned by what I thought we could get away with&mdash; which it was not&mdash;I would still have to consider whether less generous increases would continue to attract to our services, and to retain, an adequate number of qualified and contented staff.  I am convinced that, with competing demands elsewhere, the day is not far distant when, in the absence of increases such as have been granted, we would fail altogether to get suitable staff.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from the details of Subhead G that £14,440,000, or over 70 per cent.  of the estimated net health expenditure by health authorities, is in respect of hospital services. This expenditure consists of the running costs of institutions conducted by health authorities together with the amounts paid by health authorities to voluntary and proprietary hospitals and homes in respect of services obtained by patients admitted to those institutions under the provisions of the Health Acts.  It is, I think, appropriate to mention in this connection the grants which the voluntary hospitals <Col N="1710" /> receive from the Hospitals Trust Fund towards their revenue deficits and which are estimated to amount to £1,800,000 in the year 1962-63.  If we regard these grants as a further contribution from public funds, which I think is the correct view, we arrive at the very considerable total of £16,240,000 as the expenditure of public authorities on hospital services.</P>
    <P>The subhead makes provision for an improved service which I am sure the House will welcome.  Previous Ministers for Health will remember efforts to improve aural services.  The difficulty was to find an agency which would be responsible for the supply, fitting and repair of reasonably priced, but efficient, hearing aids.  I am glad to say that for some time the National Organisation for Rehabilitation has been addressing itself to this problem and that it is now on the point of inaugurating such a service.  It is arranging for the supply of hearing aids on a contract basis, has secured and is adapting premises for a hearing-aid centre, is recruiting trained personnel and should shortly be in a position to meet demands from health authorities for such aids for Health Act patients on the recommendation of the health authority's appropriate medical specialists.</P>
    <P>In anticipation of this development, I have recommended to each health authority that it should provide itself with the necessary equipment to help in the ascertainment of partially deaf children, whose educational development would be retarded by defective hearing, and, further, that they should arrange, as a commencement, that a public health nurse in each area should undergo special training in the use of it.  The response I am glad to say has been very satisfactory indeed. All health authorities have either purchased or agreed to purchase the equipment and already two special training courses for public health nurses have been held.  The aim is to discover early in life&mdash;in the first year or two if possible&mdash;children with defective hearing so that to the maximum extent possible their normal development of speech and intelligence will not be retarded.</P>
    <P>The hearing-aid service will not be <Col N="1711" /> confined to children.  When the service gets into its stride, it will be possible to cater for the needs of adults who are eligible for such aids under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned, under the heading of rehabilitation, the making of regulations under Section 50 of the Health Act, 1953.  Provision has been made under Subhead G for the commencement in the current year of regulations under the section.  I should, of course, point out that already there is statutory provision for the vocational rehabilitation and retraining of persons who have suffered from infectious diseases&mdash;notably tuberculosis and poliomyelitis&mdash;and that already a considerable amount has been, and is being, done in respect of such persons.</P>
    <P>Another item which, year by year, has being contributing to the increase in expenditure under Subhead G has been drugs and medicines supplied to persons eligible for free issue of these items under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>In passing, I should, perhaps, mention that the supply of free drugs and medicines under Section 14 is not confined to persons who hold medical cards.  A person might be ineligible for a medical card because he is regarded as being in a position to pay for the services of his doctor; but his medical condition might be such that he needs, over a long period, a supply of the newer and more expensive drugs. Cases have come to my notice where the necessary supply of these preparations might cost as much as £3 a week, and that indefinitely.  The section allows of a supply, or partial supply, in those cases, even if the patient has not a medical card and last September I thought it well to remind health authorities that such was the position and asked them to publicise the fact. If all health authorities had exercised their powers in this respect more generously than they have done, I think that complaints about the operation of Section 14 would have been considerably fewer than they have been.</P>
    <P>To revert to the increasing cost to health authorities of drugs and medicines provided for out-patients, the <Col N="1712" /> figure has increased from £176,000 in 1956/57 to an estimated £392,000 in the current year.  While, by reference to costs in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the average cost per eligible person is still relatively low, it is important to ensure that there is no unnecessary or wasteful expenditure and I have been considering the problem in consultation with health authorities.</P>
    <P>One of the matters under consideration has been the establishment of central pharmacies by health authorities under the control of whole-time pharmacists.  It is envisaged that all the supplies of medicines and drugs required by the district medical officers would be ordered through the central pharmacies and that the duties of the pharmacists would include the general supervision of the stocks of medicines held by compounders and district medical officers, particularly with a view to ensuring that stocks likely to go out of date are used in another dispensary district where they may be required or in a health authority institution.  The pharmacists could also be of assistance to dispensary doctors in their ordering of drugs, and in advising them of non-proprietary equivalents available, where expensive proprietary medicines are proposed.  As a first step in this direction Limerick and Dublin Health Authorities have appointed supervising pharmacists with an overall responsibility for the health authority pharmacy services in their areas.  When experience has been gained of the system in these areas, it is proposed to suggest further similar appointments in other health authority areas, if results appear to justify that course.</P>
    <P>A list of analogues, that is, the cheaper but equally effective equivalents of proprietary drugs, for use by district medical officers, was issued to health authorities from my Department some years ago.  This list is being brought up-to-date and will be issued to health authorities shortly.  By using this list, district medical officers will be enabled to avoid the unnecessary use of expensive proprietary drugs.</P>
    <P>In the last analysis, of course, the doctor is the final arbiter of what treatment <Col N="1713" /> the patient needs and, without his co-operation, little in the way of economical, yet effective, prescribing can be achieved.  Having full faith in the integrity of our doctors, I know that they will not impose unwarranted charges on their health authorities by prescribing expensive preparations where equally effective substitutes can be obtained at lower cost.</P>
    <P>As the House will already have heard this afternoon, the Minister for Finance, in connection with his Budget proposals, has found it possible to agree to increases in the rates of infectious diseases maintenance allowances and disabled persons allowances. The details of the increases are being worked out preparatory to the making of the necessary amending regulations. The Exchequer portion of the increase will be borne on Subhead G of this Vote and a Supplementary Estimate will probably be necessary in due course.</P>
    <P>I trust that the House will accept the Estimate.  It shows a considerable increase over previous years.  Much of this is due to increases in the remuneration of essential personnel; but some of it is due also to the progressive improvement in the health services and the projected expansion of them in sectors where this has been frequently demanded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In doing so, it is my purpose to initiate a discussion on the work of the Minister's Department during the past 12 months and on the administration of the Department by the Minister. The speech the Minister has just completed contained a very comprehensive review of the important factors in relation to our health services.  I should like to make a few comments on some of the figures to which the Minister referred.  At the start of his address, he gave us some vital statistics which are interesting.  It appears that in the last 12 months the number of births is down, there are fewer marriages and the death rate is up.  That is of course not surprising when we have <Col N="1714" /> regard to the economic and other difficulties the country has been facing in recent years.  A fall in the number of births, fewer marriages and an increase in the death rate is symptomatic of the toll of emigration on our people.  It is certainly interesting to see the effect of emigration on the vital statistics contained in the very formidable report which the Minister, as the responsible Minister, had to give the Dáil this evening.</P>
    <P>The Minister also in relation to figures and statistics referred to the mortality rate arising from heart disease and cancer.  Once again, the Minister has told us that the greatest single killer is heart disease.  The next greatest killer appears to be cancer. With regard to cancer we have had in the last five weeks or so a renewal, certainly a repetition, of the warning given from time to time in recent years with regard to the danger to health from cigarette smoking.  I appreciate that for any Minister for Health, and particularly in this country, the link between cigarette smoking and cancer poses problems difficult to solve. The Minister for Health here has not at his disposal the means of research and investigation available in other countries, but we now have available to us the results of such research and medical inquiry.  The link between the incidence of cancer and cigarette smoking appears to be clearly established.</P>
    <P>It is because of that I must express, purely personally, some slight regret at the manner in which the Minister in his statement today dealt with this problem.  I can understand well what the Minister had in mind when he said no useful purpose was likely to be served by the bellowing of propaganda with regard to the association between cancer and cigarette smoking. The Minister is perfectly correct in that but, at the same time, I feel that a sympathetic and&mdash;I will not say &ldquo;paternal&rdquo;&mdash;avuncular approach by the Minister for Health to this problem might be helpful.  There are at the moment quite a large number&mdash;I believe a growing number&mdash;of people who are anxious to be helped in giving up or reducing cigarette smoking. <Col N="1715" /> Many parents with young and growing children feel that their duty is not to set such an example in the home that the habit which they unfortunately became affected by would be passed on to their children.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest very urgently to the Minister that more could be done without undue indulgence in propaganda by making available to the public information as to these aids in the form of non-smoking drugs and so on which are so widely discussed in other countries. There are apparently available in Britain and America a variety of aids towards the reduction of smoking.  I do not know how effective they are but certainly they are widely talked about.  Possibly they are available here.  Certainly, information with regard to them should be made more generally available to persons anxious to seek assistance.  I would also suggest to the Minister that merely to refer to the duties of parents and teachers in this regard may not be sufficient.  I should like to see carefully and wisely conducted some form of educational propaganda in relation to cigarette smoking in the schools and particularly made available to boys and girls on the point of leaving school.  While the cigarette smoking habit may be impossible to deal or contend with in those already unfortunately afflicted by it, certainly it should be the concern of the Minister, as I am sure it will be, to try to prevent a future generation of heavy smokers coming along, and there should be an effort to deal with it along those lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some interesting figures on the operation of the maternity services.  He referred to the fact that these services have been in operation for Health Act patients since 31st March, 1956.  As it was my privilege, as Minister for Health, to preside over the introduction of those services, I feel some pleasure in learning from the Minister that the progress of the maternity services in the past six years has been in accordance with the expectations expressed on their behalf when they were introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> I note, however, that in the year under review, there has been a fall in the number of domiciliary births and that fewer mothers in the past 12 months have had their babies at home and more have had their babies in the local authority and voluntary hospitals. The Minister did not comment on these figures but it does appear to me to be a pity that that trend should be so apparent.  In the case of the mother with a large family or with a number of children who are already a responsibility, perhaps living in a home where conditions are crowded or perhaps not good for one reason or another one can understand her having her baby in hospital and indeed having a much-needed and well-earned rest.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that most of us in this House were born in our mothers' homes.  It is only in comparatively recent years that the tendency towards hospital birth has become so definite.  It has to some extent contributed towards the cost of health services.  When the regulations under the maternity services were being framed, they were designed expressly to encourage domiciliary births, where conditions made that course possible.  In the case of a first or second child and where the home circumstances make it possible, doctors operating the maternity services should encourage domiciliary births.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred, very properly, to smallpox.  No doubt he did it in such a clear way because of the current concern in these islands with regard to this dreaded disease.  We have been fortunate in that there has been no case of smallpox in this country since the early years of the Twenties.  At the same time, our public health officers and those charged with responsibility in this regard have always been conscious of the fact that, with the increasing facilities for communication in recent years, the danger of smallpox coming here might always be increasing.  Despite an increasing danger over recent years, the figures in regard to smallpox vaccination have decreased to such an extent that in the past two decades, there has been virtually no vaccination against smallpox. The outbreak, therefore, in the <Col N="1717" /> sister island in recent months must have brought our people, particularly people on the east coast, face up against the possibility of an outbreak here.</P>
    <P>I would agree with and support the Minister in everything he has said with regard to the need, indeed the urgent need, for parents to avail of the vaccination services.  I do not know whether any information has yet been made available&mdash;perhaps I am referring to something that has already been decided&mdash;but I would express my own personal hope that the international match between this country and Wales will not, in the circumstances, take place.  The holding of such a match in these circumstances would be indulging in a very unnecessary public health risk and I have no doubt that most sensible people would concur in that view.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some figures in relation to the hospital building programme and in that regard may I say a few words for the record?  The Minister announced this time last year, with rather a fanfare of trumpets, that there was to be a new hospital building programme, that he had given the green light for certain hospital projects such as the new Coombe Hospital, and so on.  In doing so, he referred to the more solvent condition of the Hospitals Trust Fund, of which he is in the capacity, as it were, of public trustee. Today, he again referred to the hospital building programme.  He announced that over the next three years some £6,500,000 from the Trust Fund will be expended on hospital building. I should like to say&mdash;I have said this before but it is necessary to repeat it every time this subject is discussed&mdash;that each of the hospital building projects which the Minister has in mind would now represent a hospital already constructed, had the Minister in 1957 not stopped the hospital building programme I had drawn up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I was; I have been in Cavan many times and I am sure I shall be there again.  To proceed with what I was saying, in 1956, there was facing the then Government, and me particularly, as Minister for Health, a difficult problem in relation to hospital building.  The Hospitals Trust Fund, in order to fulfil the commitments it had to face, was depending on a grant from the Central Fund.  It was quite clear, in the conditions of capital shortage facing the State in 1956, that the building programme the Department of Health was expected to implement was top heavy and required a complete overhaul and reappraisal. On my instructions such a reappraisal was carried out.  In effect, decisions were taken to build in this city a new Coombe Hospital and a new St. Vincent's Hospital.  A decision was taken to build a regional hospital in Cork.  A fourth building project was also decided upon.  I think it was in connection with St. Laurence's (Richmond) Hospital, but I am not certain about that.  In addition, it was decided to proceed with certain local authority building projects, such as the county hospital in Longford, and a number of others which had reached a stage that compelled me to decide they should proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That building programme in 1956 was based on the assumption that the income into the Hospitals Trust Fund in the ensuing years would be of the order of £2,000,000.  That assumption was perfectly justified and, had the Minister not decided to scrap that programme, these projects would now be completed, and completed in circumstances that would satisfy even the strictest exponent of financial rectitude <Col N="1719" /> because the expenditure envisaged in each year was carefully framed in accordance with the expected income into the trust fund.  However, the Minister decided not to build these hospitals until he had stacked up in the trust fund a large surplus.  It is interesting to note that in recent years trust funds have been invested in stocks and shares at the direction of the Minister instead of being devoted to hospital building.  The result now is that the cost of these hospitals upon which the Minister has decided to embark will be substantially more than it would have been, had the plans and building proceeded some six years ago.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister say in relation to his hospital building programme that he was disturbed and concerned at the tardiness of various local authorities in submitting their plans, now that the green light has been given to them, but I noticed the Minister did not say that with much conviction.  I should like to ask the Minister could he possibly blame these people, who have been entertaining pipe dreams for years about new hospitals and, every time their dreams began to take on the trappings of reality, some Minister for Health came along and scrapped the entire programme?</P>
    <P>The governors of the Coombe Hospital from the early Thirties planned, and dreamed and talked about a new maternity hospital in Dublin.  A kinsman of mine associated with that hospital, thought and talked of nothing else up to the time of his death.  Those associated with the hospital were heartened in 1955 when they learned that that project was to proceed. Unfortunately, some few months later, they learned that once again it was to be postponed.  It has been postponed ever since.</P>
    <P>Again, the governors of St. Laurence's had their dreams.  What can the Minister say of the effect on them of the lack of any decision in regard to the future of that hospital? In 1955, that hospital was almost ready for the acceptance of tenders. I had to take a decision then to postpone the St. Laurence's project <Col N="1720" /> because of the condition of the trust fund.  Subsequently, when the revised programme was drawn up, that project had to be reappraised.  I do not know whether St. Laurence's is now to have a new hospital.  My information is that the authorities in the hospital still do not know.  Certainly, if they are amongst the people blamed for being tardy, I find it difficult to see why they should be blamed.</P>
    <P>Out near Montrose there are the foundations of a new general hospital designed with imagination, with faith and with hope and where is that project today?  The new St. Vincent's Hospital on the Bray Road was given the green light away back in 1954.  In the early part of 1956 the initial construction contract was cleared by the Department of Health and handed over to a contractor and the foundations were laid.  In the latter part of 1956, or around 1956, there was a ceremony whereby the cutting of the first sod for the laying of the foundations took place.  The following year, in accordance with the plans drawn up in my time, the actual construction contract was to be effected, but nothing happened.  There the situation now is.  The foundations for that hospital were laid seven years ago and since that they have been collecting the frost and snow and rain but nothing else.  There again is a hospital that would now be providing care, attention and treatment for sick people if the Minister had not abandoned the building programme of 1956.  However, in that respect I have said all that it is necessary to say.  May I just go on to refer to another matter dealt with by the Minister?</P>
    <P>It gave me great pleasure to hear the Minister's remarks about the continued progress of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board was set up by an Act of this House passed in 1956.  It contained an idea which represented a declaration of faith in the community spirit amongst our people.  The idea of voluntary health insurance was a new one and it was felt by the Government and by all Parties in this House that the idea of people voluntarily getting <Col N="1721" /> together to help share the burden of sickness was a thing worth starting.  I have little doubt that the idea would have been adopted whoever happened to be Minister for Health and it just happened that it was my lot to have the pleasure of introducing that legislation.</P>
    <P>At the time I said to the House that it was the first measure of social welfare legislation introduced in any Parliament in Western Europe that in my view was not going to cost the tax-payer one penny.  Now, some six years later, it is worth recalling that over that period the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which started its operations with a loan from the State&mdash; I forget the figure, but it was something like £10,000, a loan which was repaid either the following year or the year after, but certainly within two years of its inception&mdash;continued to provide a very fine service for an increasing number of persons.  From its operations benefit and good have come to a large section of our community. The interesting thing is that it has not cost the State one penny.  On the contrary, the State has made money out of it.  The State charged, as it was entitled to charge, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board interest on the initial loan made available to it.</P>
    <P>That loan was repaid with full interest and in each year since provision has had to be made by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board in respect of an income tax liability on the surplus it makes on its premium income over its expenditure.  So that this Board, which is providing a necessary social service for a large section of the community, is in fact helping to run the State, to a very small degree, perhaps, but it is making a contribution in respect of income tax.  I mentioned before this question of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board being charged for income tax and may I mention it again?  It appears to me completely wrong and unfair that a State Board, or a board established under Act of the Oireachtas&mdash;which is prevented and prohibited by the State from making a profit, which has the obligation under its charter, under the Statute, to turn any surplus back into <Col N="1722" /> benefits for its contributors&mdash;merely because at the end of twelve months' trading it should happen to have a surplus of some £5,000 or £6,000, which is destined to go back as a benefit in the next year's trading, should attract an income tax liability.</P>

When the scheme was being drawn up and introduced here, I, as Minister for Health, had discussions with the then Minister for Finance and it was agreed that a section would be introduced in the ensuing Finance Bill exempting the Board from income tax liability.  Unfortunately, my colleague at the time the Finance Bill came to be introduced, was no longer there.  I am going to suggest it is the duty of the Minister for Health to investigate that particular commitment&mdash;I regard it as a commitment&mdash;made by the Minister for Finance to the Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that, but I can only suggest to the Minister that he should discuss this matter with the Minister for Finance. I have raised it with the Minister for Finance many times in the House and I have always gathered from him that it is not a matter for him initially but that he would be interested in the views of the Minister for Health.  I suggest the Minister for Health take it up with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is as much as I want to say with regard to the matters covered by the Minister's statement.  May I say, however, that the motion to refer back the Estimate has been tabled by us in <Col N="1723" /> order to emphasise the fact that we are not satisfied there is in operation at the moment any clear, definite, logical health policy whatsoever? As far as we can see, the Government are groping and muddled with regard to health policy and that has had the effect of creating administrative problems.</P>
    <P>All these wonderful figures the Minister refers to in his very comprehensive statement must not conceal from us the fact that at the moment under the administration of our health services, for two-thirds of our people, the State provides no form of medical service whatsoever.  It means that two out of every three have to fend for themselves, unaided, unhelped in any way by the State in relation to the provision of doctors or of necessary drugs and medicines for sickness in their homes.  That is a glaring weakness in the structure of our health services.  At the same time, as the services are administered at the moment, there is maintained a series of absurd charges for hospital treatment for sick needy people who, when they go to hospital, when they are no longer earning, are charged maintenance rates for services which their circumstances require should be provided free.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been increasingly anxious in <Col N="1724" /> recent months, particularly since the last general election, to prevent a discussion on these matters and for that reason he had the House appoint a Committee to find for him a health policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never tried to get out of anything in my life and I do not intend to start now.  The Minister hoped the setting up of that Committee would prevent any further discussion in this House on the glaring defects of the health policy he is pursuing.  I told him at the time that would not be so and warned him that despite the operation of the Committee, we could continue to advocate an entire reform in the administration of his Department and of the policy now being pursued by it.  That is the reason this motion to refer the Estimate back has been tabled.</P>
      <P>We are far from satisfied that the Government have any real appreciation of the glaring defects in our health services or in the manner in which they are administered.  As far as the evidence goes, it appears that the member of the Government chiefly responsible is entirely satisfied with the present health policy.  &ldquo;Point to defects,&rdquo; he says.  He has no regard for the fact that he has behind him, from Cavan, Donegal, Cork and elsewhere, Deputies in his Party whose postbags outside are full of letters asking for their assistance in trying to secure medical cards or to have hospital bills reduced.  Apparently none of the mutterings behind him has reached the Minister's ears or if it has, he pays no attention to it.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister live in some sort of balloon, entirely removed from everybody else? Does he not appreciate the fact that health or medical cards are sought after as so much gold dust by unfortunate needy poor people because they represent the means whereby essential lifesaving drugs and medicines can be obtained when illness affects a family? That is because under this absurd policy the Minister believes in there is no medical service or assistance for two out of three people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1725" /> We on this side of the House&mdash;other Parties can speak for themselves&mdash; have declared our views in that respect quite clearly.  It was one of the issues on which we fought the last general election, and if the Minister thinks he is going to silence us by a Parliamentary Committee to relegate health into the background, he is making a grave mistake.  We know we are right. We know there has to be a very definite change in health policy and we will continue to advocate that, irrespective of what the Committee on Health Services or any other body may decide to say. Talking of committees, it is interesting to see that there are at the moment, presided over by the Minister for Health, a whole variety of commissions of one kind or another&mdash;mental illness, handicapped children, poisons, cancer &mdash;and now there is one on health.</P>

      <P>Not presided over by the Minister but certainly established by him.  Surely whatever need there may be for a specialised, limited inquiry as to particular problems such as mental illness or mentally retarded children, it appears to me that no case whatever could be made for the setting up of a Parliamentary Committee, manned by the Minister's opponents, to find for him a health policy.  We do not need a Parliamentary Committee to tell us what our health policy should be.</P>

May I suggest to <Col N="1726" /> the Minister that we will continue, on every appropriate occasion and in every orderly way, to advocate the policy we stand for and hasten the day when the Fianna Fáil Health Act and the policy enshrined in it will be scrapped and something better and worth while put in its place?</P>
      <P>May I inquire from the Minister what is happening in relation to his row with the doctors?  The Minister has been Minister for Health continuously over the past five years. When he went in, no doubt he felt happy that the heat was off health and that he was met with a measure of goodwill.</P>

      <P>Watch the Minister; he is going to talk again. However, it was not very long, only a matter of months, before the signs of discord became apparent again.  I was interested to see, after he became Minister for Health, that the following June he went along as the guest of the I.M.A. to their annual beano.  He was met and <i>fêted</i> there, as he should have been, as the Minister for Health, and accorded all the honours.  He spoke at the annual banquet of the I.M.A. in 1956, expressing the accord which existed between his Department and the I.M.A.  Something happened after that.  The Minister says it was the fault of the doctors; the doctors say it was the fault of the Minister.  It is not possible for us in this House or for the general public outside to decide whose fault it was.  Certainly, we have had a profusion of enormous statements issued by the Minister dealing with all aspects of his current dispute or disputes with the I.M.A.  They have been dreary and rather boring to have to read through.  I think I am the only person in the country who reads them: I have to do it.  However, I still do not know the basis of this dispute.  What I am concerned with is the fact that it should have continued.</P>
      <P>Last October, when the Minister, as a result of a vote of this House, got his seal as a member of the Government and was once again given the responsibility of the Department of Health, surely he could have said: &ldquo;Well, let us start off with a clean sheet&rdquo;? Surely he could have wiped the slate clean and asked the I.M.A. to discuss with him the problems which affected doctors in operating health services throughout the country?  Apparently he has decided not to do that.</P>

      <P>It is certainly a most disturbing fact that in the past five years, the Minister for Health has never once met any deputation from the I.M.A., not once.  I do not believe that could be said of any Minister for Health anywhere else in the world.  He has never met any group representing the professional class who are supposed to carry out health services.  He has refused to meet them.  Not only that, but he has gone out with a hatchet and waved it all around the place in order to try to destroy the ordinary association of doctors called the I.M.A.  What is the sense of that?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister for Health want to be remembered as the Minister who destroyed the I.M.A.?  Is that the kind of monument he wants erected to his memory and to his work in the Custom House?  If that is his concern, well, I pity him.  The I.M.A. may have its faults&mdash;I am aware of many of them &mdash;but I do not believe that any assault upon that association will have any result other than to strengthen it.</P>

Just because the Minister frowns does not mean that I shall keep silent.  The Minister and his colleagues frowned in the past but we have the right to speak.  Even if it worries and embarrasses the Minister, I shall still continue to talk about his row with the doctors until such time as the <Col N="1729" /> Minister has taken some steps to bring it to an end.</P>
      <P>It is absolutely absurd in a small country such as this, with quite a large health problem, that there is not available to the Minister in an orderly, regular, constitutional way, the advice and the help of the leaders of the medical profession.

It may be water under the bridge now but it would be helpful, in this year when he is desperately looking around for some health policy, if the Minister would admit he does not know all the answers.  He has at last had to admit, by his move to establish a health committee, that there is something wrong in the policy he is pursuing.  Could that not instil into the Minister some awareness of the fact that there are possibilities in the medical profession, that there is a wealth of wisdom that might be availed of in helping the Minister, the Government and the country in devising a new health service and a better health policy?  I appreciate that I may have spoken longer than I intended to, but, to some extent, the Minister is responsible for that.</P>

      <P>I would again like to congratulate the Minister on the comprehensive nature of his factual report to us in relation to the operation of the health services, such as they are.  We are not satisfied that <Col N="1730" /> the nature and construction of these health services accord with the requirements of this country and we were sent here in pursuance of a clear health policy.  Therefore it is our duty to vote against this Estimate and accordingly, for the reasons I have stated, I have moved that the Estimate be referred back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot but agree with Deputy O'Higgins when he says that the Minister gave us a comprehensive report on the health services.  This, followed by an hour long speech by Deputy O'Higgins, makes it difficult for me to have anything at all to say on the Health Act.  I regret very much that this Estimate appears to have been rushed forward this evening.  As far as I am concerned I had no prior notice until some time to-day that it was to be taken after the Budget. However, I feel that I can express my views on it even without the preparation which I would have liked to have had the opportunity of making.</P>
      <P>Much of the criticism of the Health Act, whether in the House or by local representatives on health authorities, appears to be caused by the confusion that exists about the benefits obtainable under the Act.  A good deal of the criticism that we get, particularly from local representatives on health authorities and county councils, comes from the fact that people believe that the medical card is the beginning and end of the health service. There appears to be an idea current throughout the country that unless you are the holder of a medical card you get no benefit from the Health Act, that you are deprived of the right to health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and again the Minister, local authority officials and other people have endeavoured to show the benefits of the Health Act, 1953.  Notwithstanding all the propaganda, there still remains an ignorance of the benefits of the Act which accounts for the fact that so many people feel that the cost of the Health Act far outweighs its value.  I do not accept that view.  I believe that the Health Act is a good Act.  In 1953, I, in common with my Party, supported the then <Col N="1731" /> Government in putting through the Health Act, not that we thought it was a perfect Act but because we thought it was a marked step in the improvement of our health services and that the people would benefit from it.</P>
    <P>People assume that unless you have a medical card you do not come under the Health Act at all.  It is true that to get the full benefit, to get all and every benefit, the holding of a medical card is a very important factor.  But there is a big section of the people, the middle income group, which can secure advantages under the present Health Act for which they pay through rates and taxation.  I would suggest and I would urge on any individual or group of individuals joining in any scheme, that they could not get for the same amount of money anything comparable to the medical service that the middle income group can secure under the existing Health Act.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that maladministration can deprive and has deprived many people of the middle income group of the benefits that should rightly be given to them under the Health Act. As an instance of what I am saying I would like to quote from the Minister's speech this evening.  On the third last page of the Minister's written speech he states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>In passing I should, perhaps, mention that the supply of free drugs <Col N="1732" /> and medicines under Section 14 is not confined to persons who hold medical cards.  A person might be ineligible for a medical card because he is regarded as being in a position to pay for the services of his doctor; but his medical condition might be such that he needs, over a long period, a supply of the newer and more expensive drugs.  Cases have come to my notice where the necessary supply of these preparations might cost as much as £3 a week, and that indefinitely.  The section allows of a supply, or partial supply, in these cases, even if the patient has not a medical card, and last September I thought it well to remind health authorities that such was the position and asked them to publicise the fact.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to the Minister that most local authority representatives have never heard that that circular was issued.  Local authority officials, in the main, comprise the secretary of the health authority and should he suppress that circular, as I suggest that circular has been suppressed throughout the length and breadth of the country, that is, to my mind, the reason for most of the campaign that is going on.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
