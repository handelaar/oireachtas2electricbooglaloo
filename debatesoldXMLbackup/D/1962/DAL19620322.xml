    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £550 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President, and for certain other expenses <Col N="346" /> of the President's Establishment (No. 24 of 1938) including a Grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The provision under subhead A is required to cover the cost of salary increases and also to provide for the allowance payable to the substitute <i>aide-de-camp</i> to the President and to cover the cost of additional telephonists in Aras an Uachtaráin at the time of the visit of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace of Monaco and at the opening of the Patrician Year.  There is an offsetting saving of £220 on the subhead, due in part to one post of shorthand typist being unfilled since 1st February, 1962.  The provision of £50 under subhead B represents the cost of installing extra telephones in Aras an Uachtaráin for the duration of the State visits.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £50,800 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Stationery Office; for Printing and Binding, and the provision of Stationery, Paper, Books, Office Machinery and other Office Supplies for the Public Services; and for sundry Miscellaneous Purposes, including the Publication and sale of Reports of Oireachtas Debates, Bills, Acts and Other Government Publications.</P>
      <P>The main reason for the Supplementary Estimate is the need to replenish stocks of paper, envelopes and other office supplies.  Provision is also required to meet the cost of a mechanical horse and trailer purchased to replace a motor truck and expenditure, in excess of the sums provided in the Vote, on books, periodicals and office machinery required for the Public Service. There was a rather large purchase of paper and prices of periodicals were higher than anticipated.  Stocks have been replenished under subhead E.</P>

      <P>There is provision here for publications including Oireachtas Debates.  It is the custom to publish every five years or so a comprehensive index to the Oireachtas debates.  I think the last one was published about 10 years ago or five years ago. There has not been one published recently and I wonder when in the ordinary course, it is intended to provide the general index covering a period of years?  The Minister may not have the information at the moment.  Perhaps he would look into it and let me know at his convenience.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £70,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Garda Síochána including Pensions, etc. (9 &amp; 10 Geo. 5, c. 68; No. 25 of 1924; No. 7 of 1925; No. 10 of 1926; No. 32 of 1933; No. 5 of 1937; No. 19 of 1941; Nos. 1 and 17 of 1945; No. 41 of 1947; No. 44 of 1956; and No. 43 of 1959) and for payments of compensation and other expenses arising out of service in the Local Security Force (No. 19 of 1946 and No. 15 of 1949).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is the necessary result of increases during the <Col N="348" /> year in the rates of pay of the Garda Síochána.  A sum of £131,000 is needed to meet the cost of the pay award, granted with effect from 1st November, 1961, which followed the acceptance by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance of an agreed recommendation of the Garda Conciliation Council on a claim for pay increases.  A further charge on Subhead A is due to a change in wastage trends since the time the original Estimate was prepared.  The trends then indicated a fairly high incidence of resignations in the voluntary retirement group, that is, those members who, having reached 50 years of age and having served in the Force for 30 years, are entitled to retire and receive a pension.</P>
    <P>As things turned out, however, there was a marked falling-off in the number of retirements among those who could leave on pension before reaching the age limit and, as a consequence, Garda strength on maximum rate of pay has, since the beginning of the year, been substantially in excess of the number for whom the top pay rate was provided.  This deficit in the pay subhead is however offset by the savings in the pensions subhead resulting from the drop in expected pensionable retirements.  Other expenditure during the year which was in excess of estimated requirements related to telephone charges, locomotion and travelling expenses.  Altogether the total additional sum required is £210,977 but savings on other subheads and a surplus in the receipts which are appropriated in aid of the Vote have contributed to reducing the total to a net sum of £70,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was a little delayed this morning and we must make allowances for that, but I want to put on record the Standing Orders of the House which prohibit the reading of statements by any member of the House.  If it is the Minister's wish to read a statement, there is a reciprocal obligation upon him to provide the Opposition members with copies of the statement.  I would urge that this reciprocal obligation be met; otherwise we must object to what I regard as a <Col N="349" /> reasonable request of Ministers to be permitted to read their introductory statements.</P>
      <P>There is nothing controversial that I can find in the details of the Estimate, except that I am not clear in my mind how the payments out of the Road Fund in respect of payments to the Garda Síochána could be so underestimated at the beginning of the year by such a large sum as £44,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The payment from the Road Fund is approximately one and a half per cent of the Fund.  During the year, the Minister for Finance agreed that, in addition to that, all fines collected would be paid over in aid of the Road Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It includes the award which became effective from November 1st.  Roughly speaking, a recruit leaving the depot after training got £9 19s. a week and so on up to approximately £14 a week, which is the maximum. That award became effective from 1st November and the cost from that date to 31st March is £131,000.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet the cost of increases in the salaries and other grants payable to teachers in classification and national schools.</P>
      <P>The increases, which have been awarded with effect as from 1st November, 1961, arise from the implementation of a Report of the Arbitration Board for National Teachers.  The Arbitration Board met on 20th and 21st December, 1961, and on 2nd January, 1962.  The findings of the Board were approved by the Government.</P>
      <P>The additional cost of the revised scales of salary and rates of capitation grant following from the implementation of the Board's report is estimated at £1,150,000 for a full year. The amount which will become payable in the present financial year is estimated at £400,000.  It is not anticipated that there will be any appreciable savings in any other subheads of the Vote.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is merely a token Vote to enable savings on various subheads to be applied to increase the grant-in-aid to the National Library for the purchase of books, etc., and to provide a grant-in-aid to the Catholic Workers' College.</P>
    <P>The increase of £1,000 in grant-in-aid to the National Library is required for the purchase of the Gormanston Register.  It is the entry book of the title deeds of the Preston family.  I understand it is the oldest surviving manuscript in the form of a register dealing with lands in Ireland.  It is a 14th century manuscript.  It is of great interest for place names and for history of the Dublin, Meath and Louth areas.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid of £2,000 to the Catholic Workers' College is a new provision.  The college which was founded in 1948 by the Jesuit Fathers provides courses for trade union students, management students, supervisors and foremen and various other groups.  As the college constitutes an important centre of adult education I thought it desirable that it should be provided with the minimum of State aid necessary to enable it to continue its work.  It needed the aid so, this year, it is getting a new grant-in-aid of £2,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The mention of the Gormanston Register which, the Minister tells us, the National Library is to acquire, brings a certain analogous matter to my mind.  First of all, I congratulate the Minister on enabling the Library to acquire this manuscript because these kinds of family documents are very liable to be lost and they constitute a very important part of the social history of our country.  I think a great many similar documents are in imminent peril of being lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember salvaging a box of <Col N="352" /> documents in a country house in Ireland, which the Library subsequently acquired, which made a very real contribution to a strange part of the history of this country, of which I had personal knowledge.  If the papers had not been found and finally deposited with the National Library, that side of the story might have perished altogether, the story of a landlord.  I remember people saying, when I was young, that their grandfathers had knelt down and thanked God the day he was murdered for that he was the worst man who had ever walked the world.  Yet, when that box of documents was opened, an entirely different version of his life was told.</P>
    <P>Looking back on those days, I have very little doubt now that he was a very good man who was anxious to do what was right by his people, but, as good people often are, he was wholly misunderstood, cruelly misrepresented and finally murdered.  That is a story into which I do not propose to go now. Still, these old family documents constitute a very vital and essential part of the social history of our people.  Here is the point I want to make today.  I believe that in the files of the Land Commission there is an immense mass of documents relating to the old estates they took over under the first Land Act and all the way down since the eighties. They have never been catalogued.  I do not believe anybody knows what is in them.</P>
    <P>We are all conscious of the perennial outbursts of activity that take place in Government Departments when somebody takes it into his head to clean up the place.  The files become too numerous, accommodation is overcrowded and suddenly an heroic decision is taken that everything more than 20 years old is junk.  The Land Commission have shown a very prudent reluctance to do that for which they have sometimes been criticised.  I think they were wise and right to have held their records as long as they have. I do not know how far back they have held them but I think the National Library ought to collaborate with the Land Commission to get these documents catalogued and either preserved <Col N="353" /> or at least microfilmed so that a complete record of them can be kept.</P>
    <P>I imagine it is almost true to say that practically every acre of land in Ireland has at some time or other passed through the hands of the Land Commission since we bought the last of the landlords out under the 1923 and subsequent Land Acts.  A record of that ought to be preserved and of all that went before that, most of which is history contained in the rent books and the records of the old estates.  I had a certain interest, not because of any family connection but because we happened to be tenants of it, in the Dillon Estate in the West of Ireland which, as some Deputies in the West know, stretches from Castlerea to Charlestown.</P>
    <P>The papers of that estate have been lost to us.  They were taken to Ditchley and I pursued them there and hoped to get them for the National Library and then I found that through some subsequent will, they had been left to some obscure museum in Portsmouth or Plymouth.  I imagine the title they have acquired to them is of such kind that it is highly unlikely they will ever be recovered to this country. They relate exclusively to land and homes in Roscommon and Mayo and it seems odd that they should have found their ultimate resting place in Portsmouth or Plymouth, where nobody can have the slightest interest in them but whither any scholar who wants to consult them must go.  I suggest that in cases like that the National Library should be facilitated to microfilm such documents and bring back the record for installation here.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to make is that I believe there is a mass of material in the Land Commission at the present time which should be catalogued and either preserved or microfilmed for the records of the National Library.  The trouble about this sort of proposition is that very few people give a damn and the great danger is that because there is no proper preservation of that record, just through the process of inertia, nobody does anything about it.  The Minister for Education is a young and zealous <Col N="354" /> person and he should be concerned for the social history of Ireland.  It is a thing a great many people ignore and are not interested in but it is the very fabric of the lives of our people and one of the few good things the landlords left, these exhaustive records.  We should not be such fools as to suffer these treasures to perish simply because we associate them with a source of which we have bitter memories.</P>
    <P>The other point I want to mention is that the Catholic Workers' College needs Government help.  It should be given that help but I cannot help registering a note of regret.  I always regret when I see a voluntary undertaking which has been carrying on under its own steam successfully having to fall into the category of the multitude of enterprises which have become partially, if not wholly, dependent on Government aid.  I should have thought that the Catholic Workers' College here could have looked to the trade unions and to the business establishments of the country for such modest funds as they require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Macra na Feirme and the Irish Countrywomen's Association could have done the same thing but they got State aid also.  I think the Deputy was the one to recommend it. I think he started it in the case of the Irish Countrywomen's Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but there is a distinction. The problem of the Irish Countrywomen's Association was that they had no funds for organising.  I said to them: &ldquo;I shall not recommend the Government to give you a penny for general funds.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;If we could get organisers to communicate to the people the kind of work we are doing, we would not want Government funds.  We can raise all the money we need to carry on our work without Government assistance but the one difficulty we have is to get people to go around organising branches.  It is not only a question of paying them a bare living wage but also of paying their travelling expenses.&rdquo;  I did ask the Government to make a sum of money available to them, on the understanding that their only obligation would be to give me, or the Minister <Col N="355" /> for Agriculture for the time being, a certificate at the end of the year stating that they spent that money on organisation.  They have no help at all other than the peripatetic organisers. I think there is a distinction.  I do not grudge the Workers' College this money: if they need it, I think they should get it.  I merely register regret that it cannot be carried on by voluntary effort where you have trade unions and an employers' federation, both of whom ought to recognise the value of this work, and the sum involved is very trivial compared with the resources of the bodies to whom I now refer.</P>
      <P>The great danger is that the moment grants of this kind fall to be made by Government Departments sooner or later the Comptroller and Auditor General or somebody brings pressure to bear on the Department to supervise the expenditure of the money. When I was asking the Government to provide funds for the Irish Countrywomen's Association, I erected a ten-foot fence all around the proposal in order to ensure that nobody would require me to interfere in the internal affairs of the I.C.A. and it was specifically set out that their only obligation was to hand the Minister a certificate stating: &ldquo;We spent that money on organising.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I trust that if this grant-in-aid becomes an annual feature, we may rest assured that the Minister will not be required to take the College under his control and supervision and that it will continue to be, as it at present is, a wholly independent institution working along lines laid down by itself. I am not without hope that the trade union movement and the Employers' Federation will combine to undertake this burden themselves and thus render it unnecessary in future for the Department of Education to make funds available for this purpose, excellent though this purpose is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the value of the College lies largely in its independence and both the administration of the College and I were reluctant to <Col N="356" /> arrange in this way to help them. However, it is a grant-in-aid with no intention on my part that the College should ever come under the Department of Education.  They have other sources of income from fees.  The more successful they are, the more help they will need from outside.  They have associate membership which perhaps does include a number of people in the trade union movement and management. They get help from people who become associate members and subscribe fees without attending courses. I do not think there is any grant from the bodies as such.</P>
      <P>On the question of historic documents, I understand the law is that we are entitled to inspect and photograph any document which may be going out of the country.  We have no right to stop it being exported, but when a licence is sought, the Director of the National Library has the right to inspect and take a photograph of it. This document was purchased in England at a public auction.  Of course, the Library has to compete at an auction with collectors.  Sometimes collectors are very wealthy and very interested.  We were lucky this time to get the register.  I do not know what treasures may lie in the Land Commission but I undertake to examine the matter.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate for Army Pensions is for a nett sum of £30,000.  As Deputies will see, it is expected that the expenditure under Subheads G and O of the Vote for 1961/62 will exceed substantially the amounts provided.  There are also anticipated excesses in two other Subheads&mdash;the amounts, however, being negligible.  Savings to the extent of £24,530 are anticipated in still other Subheads.</P>
    <P>The anticipated excess in Subhead G is attributable to retirements exceeding the numbers provided for, involving payments of retired pay and gratuities. As regards Subhead O, the position is that only a token amount was provided for special lump sum compensation in respect of casualties attributable to service in the Congo.  Tragically, and to the very deep regret of us all, there has been a number of such casualties in recent times, and the lump sum payments to the extent of £26,500 have been made or will be made before the end of the financial year.  There will, in due course, be a refund by the United Nations of the amount involved.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is necessary for me to say any more about the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>While there is much comment one can make on the administration of the pensions code, I do not suppose this is the appropriate time to do it.  It would be more appropriate on the main Estimate to be introduced in the next financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="358" /> I am glad to learn the United Nations will refund the £26,000 or most of it that will fall for payment in respect of casualties among United Nations personnel in the Congo.  I could not hear the Minister very well but I take it also that the amount in the Vote includes the ordinary increases that have been granted in the pensions scheme, as well as the gratuities that fall to be paid.  More gratuities fall to be paid than were anticipated.</P>

      <P>There is one complaint I want to make.  I mentioned it before on the Vote and I want to remind the Minister of it again, that is, in relation to the nursing service.  The Minister is acting in a very cavalier way about the nursing service of the Army who are doing such good work.  An increase in their emoluments is long overdue and it is amazing that the Minister has not done anything about it.  They are retiring and going out in the hope that the award will be backdated but there is always the danger in these cases of neglecting&mdash;that is the only word I can use&mdash;to put the thing into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy MacEoin that discussion of the Army nursing service will be initially more appropriate to the Defence Estimate proper.  Apparently it is not ordered for to-day.  Perhaps I ought to reserve my remarks until it comes up for discussion.  I should like to take this opportunity of assuring Deputy MacEoin, and the others who have spoken on behalf of the Army nursing service, that I have the utmost sympathy with the service; but there is a complication in relation to it, a complication that does not apply to the men in the Army.  It was, I think, explained in reply to a question here last week.  In general, a separate decision in respect of the Army nursing service is not made when there are negotiations on foot in relation to the general nursing service throughout the country.  We wait until we see <Col N="359" /> what the general decision is.  It is usual to apply it then.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything else to be said on this Supplementary Estimate. We shall have the main Estimate very shortly.  I understand Defence is one of the earliest, and I take it there will be a full discussion then on this and the other question raised.</P>

      <P>Go ndeonófar suim fhorlíontach nach mó ná £135,000 chun íoctha an mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1962, le haghaidh Pinsin Seanaoise agus Pinsin do Dhaill, Liúntais Leanaí, Cúnamh Dífhostaíochta, Pinsin Neamhranníocacha Baintreach agus Dílleachtaí agus le haghaidh Ilseirbhísí Ilghnéitheacha Leasa Shóisialaigh, lena n-áirítear Deontais.</P>
      <P>Séard is cuspóir leis an Meastachán Fhorlíontach seo ná an t-airgead bhreise a fháil a bhéas riachtanach i rith na bliana seo de thoradh An Achta Leasa Shóisialaigh (Forálacha Illgnéitheacha), 1961, a mhéadaigh, le h-éifeacht ó thosach mí Lúnasa, 1961, na rátaí Pinsean Seanaoise agus Pinsean do Dhalla, Pinsean Neamhranníochach do Bhaintreacha agus na Rátaí Cúnaimh Dhífhostaíochta, agus a chuir feabhasanna eile i bhfeidhm ins na seirbhisí sin chómh maith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Mar a teaspáintear ins an Meastachán Fhorlíontach, sé an suim bhreise atá ag teastáil le h-aghaidh Pinsin Seanaoise&mdash;Fo-mhírcheann A&mdash; ná £140,000.  Nuair a bhí an Bille ós cómhair na Dála measadh go mbéadh breis caiteachais de £336,000 ar Phinsin Seanaoise sa bhliain 1961-62.  Meastar anois ná rachaidh an bhreis caiteachais thar £328,500.  Ar an dtaobh eile, beidh spáráil de £188,500 de bhrí nár shrois uimhir na bpinsean a bhí iníochta i rith na bliana an leibhéal a measadh ar dtúis.  Mar sin, ní bheidh ag teastáil ach £140,000 sa bhreis i gcóir Pinsean Seanaoise.</P>
    <P>I gcás Fo-mhírcheann D&mdash;Pinsin Neamhranníochacha do Bhaintreacha agus do Dhílleachtaithe&mdash;measadh ar dtúis go gcosnódh na rátaí nua agus na feabhais eile £75,000 sa bhliain 1961-62.  Meastar anois go dtiocfaidh an costas go dtí £79,000.  Meastar leis, toisc luach seachtainiúil na bpinsean a bheith beagán níos aoirde ná mar a ceapadh, go mbéadh £16,000 sa bhreis ag teastáil taobh amuigh ar fad de chostas na rátaí nua.  Mar sin, tá £95,000 ar fad de dhíth fé'n Fo-mhírcheann seo.</P>
    <P>Fé Fo-mhírcheann G, táthar ag lorg suim bhréise de £500 le h-aghaidh Leasa na nDall.  Séard is cúis leis an mbarríocht ná méadú ó £40 go £60 in aghaidh na bliana a rinneadh i ráta an cheann-deontais i leith oibritheóirí dalla atá ag obair i seomraí oibre institúd aitheanta, agus atá in a gcónaí taobh amuigh.  Méadaíodh an ráta deontais i mí Deireadh Fómhair, 1961, le h-éifeacht ón chéad lá d'Aibreán, 1961.  Meastar go gcosnóidh an méadú £1,500 in aghaidh na bliana ach ní bheidh ach tuairim is a leath de sin iníochta roimh deire na bliana seo. Toisc go bhfuiltear ag súil le spáráil bheag ar an mbun-mheastachán, meastar anois gur leor suim bhreise de £500 in aghaidh na bliana 1961-62.</P>
    <P>I gcás Cúnaimh Dhífhostaíochta, measadh go mbéadh suim bhreise de £165,000 iníochta i rith na bliana seo de bhárr forálacha an Achta a reachtaíodh i 1961.  Meastar anois gur bé costas na bhforálacha sin ná £153,000. Ar an dtaobh eile, bhí laghdú in uimhir na n-éilitheóir ar chúnamh dhífhostaíochta sa bhliain seo, agus dá bhrí <Col N="361" /> sin meastar go mbeidh an caiteachas £153,000 níos lú ná mar a measadh i dtosach.  Mar sin, ní gá aon suim bhreise a chur ar fáil fé'n Fho-mhírcheann seo.</P>
    <P>Chímíd mar sin gur bé an mór-iomlán atá de dhíth ná £235,000.  Táthar ag súil le breis fáltaisí de £100,500 fé Fho - mhírcheann J &mdash; Leithreasa - i - gCabhair&mdash;agus nuair a cuirtear iadsan san áireamh, sé £135,000 an glaniomlán. Baineann na Leithreasa-i-gCabhair le suimeanna a íochtar ar an gcéad dul síos as an Vóta le h-aghaidh Cúnaimh Shóisialaigh, agus a bhfaightear amach níos déanaí go bhfuil na h-eilitheóirí i dteideal sochair árachais. Rinneadh a lán íochaíocht de'n tsórt san san tréimhse ón 6ú lá d'Eanair, 1961, go dtí an 31ú lá de Mhárta, 1961, i gcás daoine a bhí ag fáil Pinsean Neamhranníochach Seanaoise agus a bhí i dteideal Pinsean Ranníochach Seanaoise nó Pinsean Ranníochach do Bhaintreacha ón 6ú lá d'Eanair. Niorbh' fhéidir na h-éilimh go léir ar an bpinsean nua a chinneadh roimh deire na bliana, agus dá bhrí sin níor mhór méid iomlán na n-íochaíocht san a aisíoch ón Chiste Árachais Shóisialaigh do'n Vóta um Cúnamh Sóisialach sa bhlian 1961-62.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the additional cost in the current year arising from the operation of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1961, which increased the rates of old age and blind pensions, windows' non-contributory pensions and unemployment assistance as from the beginning of August, 1961, and effected other improvements in these services.</P>
    <P>As shown in the Supplementary Estimate, the additional sum required for Old Age Pensions&mdash;subhead A&mdash; is £140,000.  When the new legislation was being enacted it was estimated that the additional expenditure in the current financial year from this subhead would be £336,000.  It is now estimated that the cost will be slightly less, namely, £328,500.  However owing to the number of pensions in payment during the year being less than anticipated there will be an estimated saving of £188,500 on the original provision of £9,000,000 for old age <Col N="362" /> pensions, with the result that an additional sum of £140,000 will suffice.</P>
    <P>As regards subhead D&mdash;Widows' and Orphans' Non-Contributory Pensions&mdash;it was originally estimated that the cost in 1961-62 of the increases and other improvements would be £75,000.  The cost is now estimated at £79,000.  It is also now estimated that owing to the average weekly value of pensions in operation being slightly higher than anticipated, the original provision of £1,748,000 for widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions will be £16,000 too low.  Accordingly, an additional sum of £95,000 will be required under this subhead.</P>
    <P>On subhead G, there is provision for an additional sum of £500 for welfare of the blind.  The excess is due to an increase from £40 to £60 a year in the rate of capitation grant in respect of out-resident blind workers employed in the workshops of approved institutions.  The rate was increased in October, 1961 with effect from the 1st April, 1961.  The additional cost is estimated at £1,500 annually. Approximately half that amount will fall due for payment in the current financial year.  As small savings are expected on the original provision of £19,000 for welfare of the blind it is now estimated that an additional sum of £500 will suffice for 1961-62.</P>
    <P>I should mention that the additional cost arising under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1961, in the case of unemployment assistance was originally estimated at £165,000 in the current financial year.  The cost is now estimated at £153,000.  Owing, however, to a reduction in the number of applicants for unemployment assistance in the current year, it is now estimated that there will be a saving of approximately £153,000 on the original provision of £1,110,000 for this service.  Accordingly, the costs arising under the new Act will be met in full from the savings, and no additional provision is required on the subhead for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The gross estimated additional expenditure accordingly comes to £235,500.  This amount is reduced by £100,500 in respect of estimated additional <Col N="363" /> receipts to the Vote under subhead J.&mdash;Appropriations in Aid.  Provision was made in the original Estimate for 1961-62 for repayments from the Social Insurance Fund of interim payments of social assistance totalling £8,600.  It is now estimated that this provision will be increased by £100,500.  These interim payments are payments from the Social Assistance Vote made to persons who are subsequently found to have been entitled to insurance benefit.  The additional receipts in the current financial year are due to the fact that many recipients of non-contributory old age pensions became entitled, on or after 6th January, 1961, to old age contributory pensions or, in the case of certain widows over 70 years of age, to widows' contributory pensions.  Payment of non-contributory pensions was made pending determination of their title to contributory pensions. The volume of claims to be dealt with in the initial stages of the new scheme was so great that many awards of contributory pension effective from a date in the quarter ended 31st March, 1961, could not be made before that date.  Accordingly, payments from the Social Assistance Vote made in these cases in the last quarter of 1960-61 fell to be treated as payments on account of insurance benefit. The necessary adjustment between the Social Insurance Fund, from which the insurance benefits are paid, and the Social Assistance Vote was made in the current financial year.  As the Appropriation Account for 1960-61 was closed, the receipts from the Fund fall to be credited as Appropriations in Aid of this year's Vote.  When these excess receipts are taken into account, the net amount to be provided is reduced to £135,000.</P>

      <P>There is just one point I wanted to ask the Minister in connection with this.  As he points out, it is necessary to bring in this Supplementary Estimate by reason of the 1961 Welfare Act.  In the second paragraph of the Minister's English translation of his Irish statement, he refers to a saving of £188,500, which is due to the number of old age pensions in payment during the year being <Col N="364" /> less than anticipated.  I was wondering if the Minister had the actual figure in numbers, whether there were 100 or 1,000 people fewer in receipt of the pension?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;For the purposes of an application for a certificate of free legal aid under the provisions of this Act, a solicitor shall have a right of audience in any court notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in any other enactment or in the Rules or Orders of any Court.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to provide a right of audience in any court for a solicitor for the limited purpose of an application for free legal aid.  We do not know, because we have not got the regulations yet, whether the regulations to be made by the Minister will provide that the free legal aid will include the cost of an application for free legal aid, but, on the assumption that it will not include this, it seems to me that if you are dealing, as you are here, with the case of a poor man who does not want to make his application for free legal aid in person, because he has not confidence in himself, then he should not be compelled to engage counsel to make his application, as he would be in the higher courts as the position stands at the moment.  If he does not make it himself, his solicitor <Col N="367" /> cannot make it on his behalf; it must be counsel.  Counsel is the only person who has right of audience in the higher courts.</P>
    <P>If we leave the position as it stands, he will be compelled to engage counsel for an application for free legal aid, unless he does it himself.  On the other hand, if the regulations provide that the costs of an application for free legal aid are included in the legal aid to be granted, then from the point of view of the State, we are, if we leave the position as it stands, compelling the State to pay counsel's fees in connection with an application for free legal aid in every case, although there may be some cases where this would not be necessary, if we accept this amendment.  Where an application can be made by a solicitor alone and the applicant is willing to have this done, the State should get the benefit of that.  That is acting on the assumption I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would point out that this amendment does not close any existing source of revenue or work for barristers, nor does it preclude the engaging of counsel in legal aid applications. It merely ensures that one is not compelled to engage counsel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment, first of all, because it would involve such a radical departure that it would be completely unacceptable not alone to the court but to the profession of the Bar.  Apart from that, I do not think it is necessary.  The reason it is suggested that a solicitor should have the right of audience in the Supreme Court is apparently to avoid the expense of procuring counsel to make the application.  Deputy Colley is completely overlooking the fact that the application may be made by the person himself.  It is open to the accused either to apply by letter to the registrar or make the application in person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me also that there is this practical answer to the amendment. Surely if a person is able to procure the services of a solicitor to make the application, it is reasonable to assume that that solicitor in turn would not find it impossible to procure <Col N="368" /> the services of a barrister to go into the Supreme Court and make the simple application for a legal aid certificate.  Deputy Colley is asking something that is &mdash; the word &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo; might be too strong&mdash;a radical departure from all precedent in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A solicitor is not allowed in the Supreme Court and we would have to upset that practice and precedent for this single purpose.  I suppose the House would contemplate even doing that but, as I have said, it is not necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably aware that there are certain circumstances in which a solicitor has the right of audience in the High Court and in circumstances somewhat analogous to the type of matter we are describing here.  The solicitor has the right of audience in, for instance, matters of bankruptcy.  The representations there may frequently arise because of the poor circumstances of the person who has either taken the protection of the court or has been made bankrupt.  It does seem that this may be something new but I do not think there is anything outrageous in Deputy Colley's suggestion.  When you are setting up completely new machinery to deal with cases where legal aid assistance is actually to be given by the State to people who are not in a position adequately to represent themselves, then I do not think there is anything outrageous in the suggestion that a solicitor should be entitled to make an application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has an amendment down later on dealing with the question of means and that kind of thing.  It seems to me that very frequently you may have a person who would, I am sure, in normal circumstances be the type of person who would qualify for this type of legal aid, who would be able to make the case properly himself. One of the factors that probably would be taken into account by the Benches in granting certificates of free legal aid may very well be a person's ability or <Col N="369" /> inability to speak for himself and present his own case.  Deputy Colley is worried about this kind of person who cannot coherently make an application for himself.</P>
    <P>It may appear to the Minister to be a simple matter but I do not think it will be quite so simple.  Many factors will be taken into account.  One is the person's means and, secondly, there is the gravity of the offence with which he is charged.  If he does not qualify on the grounds of gravity, then the court is entitled to look to exceptional circumstances which may exist.  It may very well take a qualified legal practitioner to present properly to the court the question of the gravity of the offence or the exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I understand the Minister is a qualified barrister himself and as such, will appreciate that the barrister proceeds on the brief presented to him by the solicitor. Deputy Colley's suggestion has the virtue of reasonability and from the point of view of the Minister, and particularly from the point of view of his colleague, the Minister for Finance, it would also have the virtue of being a less expensive procedure than if the Minister forces the position that except in the district court, any further application must be made by counsel if the applicant himself is unable to make it. Such a procedure would make it more expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the fact that the Minister is himself a qualified barrister.  I am also aware of the fact that he did not practise and I am amazed that he has absorbed so much of the reactionary outlook of his profession. It is true that as a solicitor I am interested in putting this matter forward.  My profession is a very humble one compared with the other branch to which the Minister belongs but this suggestion is not put forward in an effort to improve the status of solicitors.  It is put forward as some attempt towards rationalising the procedure <Col N="370" /> involved here.  If the Minister chooses to view it as the thin edge of the wedge, I should have hoped that he would have welcomed such a wedge.  I should have thought that he would have aimed at rationalising the administration of the law and would welcome any effort to make it cheaper and simpler.  If the Minister wants to view the matter from the overall point of view, this suggestion should appeal to him because it simplifies and cheapens the procedure involved.</P>
      <P>The Minister is going a little far in saying that the amendment might possibly be described as outrageous.  The only reason the Minister has given for not accepting it is that it would interfere with existing practice.  At present, members of the solicitors' profession have the right of audience in limited cases in the higher courts and I think the Minister should not allow himself to be influenced too much by the outlook of the barristers' profession.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is probably the most pragmatic individual in the House and is prepared to try anything which he thought justifiable for the common good.  If it is expense that Deputy Colley is worried about, it is a simple thing for the accused himself to make a simple application to the Supreme Court by letter to the Registrar of that court as set out in the Bill.  There need be nothing complicated about that application.  We propose to provide a simple form whereby the applicant can set out his means and he can attach that form to the letter to the Registrar.  He can do that without the assistance of solicitor or counsel.  If it is a complicated case and if the accused is in a position to secure a solicitor, there will be no difficulty in that solicitor getting counsel to make the application for him.</P>

      <P>The point is that a solicitor should have the right to appear in the Supreme Court and I think that a solicitor should have such a right.  Any individual should have that right.  I am satisfied that there is a racket in the legal profession by which one member of it calls in his pals so that they can get a bit of what <Col N="371" /> is going.  I have the experience of a solicitor making a certain application and he won his case.  He asked for costs and I appealed against the costs and they were reduced by half.  The Taxing Master agreed that there was no need for junior counsel in the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (1) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate is granted in respect of a person, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall in exercising jurisdiction under section 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, or section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, to award costs, order to be deducted from such costs so awarded any costs paid or payable under such certificate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is quite a simple matter and I hope the Minister will accept it at least in principle, if not in the drafting.  It is a point I mentioned on Second Reading, namely, that there are circumstances at the moment where an accused person who is acquitted is entitled to full indemnity in respect of costs and he is so awarded by the trial judge.</P>
      <P>However, under the wording of Section 8, for the sake of avoiding double payment&mdash;the Minister set this out in an Explanatory Memorandum &mdash; the judge is precluded, where a free legal aid certificate is given, from awarding the costs under the Act of 1924 and the Act of 1928.  My suggestion is that that is not fair and that in such circumstances it would be quite adequate to avoid any danger of double payment if the Minister provided that there should be a set-off of one set of costs as against the other.  It was for the purpose of pin-pointing that that I put down this amendment.  I urge the Minister to consider the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 32 is virtually the same in effect as amendment No. 31.  The only practical difference is that under amendment No. 32 the State might offset the costs in question without any court order.  Therefore, if, by any chance, as sometimes happens, the Court of Criminal Appeal omitted to include an order for deduction or for offsetting costs, then the expense and trouble involved in having <Col N="373" /> the order amended would be avoided under amendment No. 32, which might appeal to the Minister if he accepts the principle that the State can offset these costs without reference to the court or anywhere else.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept the principle involved in this unless he can assure us that the costs awarded under the free legal aid certificate will be on the same scale as those already allowed for in the cases mentioned here in respect of the Court of Criminal Appeal awarding costs.  We do not anticipate that they will be, but, if they are not, then it is inaccurate to say that this section is designed to prevent double payment of costs.  I think that was overlooked.</P>
      <P>If the Minister would be prepared to rectify the situation on the lines of either of these amendments, I think both Deputy O'Higgins and myself would be quite satisfied with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not accept the principle enshrined in either of these two amendments.  Section 8 is specifically designed to do what it says.  It is our intention that where a person proceeds under this scheme and gets free legal aid under the Bill he should stick, as it were, to that line of country.  If he is a poor person and avails himself of the provisions of the Bill and gets free legal aid then he should not, at a certain stage, be able, as it were, to get back into a different category and procure what people seem to assume will be a more favourable scale of costs.</P>
      <P>To some extent the amendments are based on the assumption that the scale of fees which will be paid under these free legal aid provisions will not be satisfactory.  I am hoping they will be satisfactory.  I am hoping they will be acceptable to both professions. They may not be&mdash;as we have discussed&mdash;the full professional fees which a solicitor or counsel would procure in the normal way from, if you like, paying clients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that whatever scale we ultimately settle upon as a result of our discussions with both professions will <Col N="374" /> be accepted.  That being so, I think that when an accused person and his legal advisers set out, so to speak, on the free legal aid track, they should stick to it and not expect a more favourable scale at a later stage.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go on arguing: the Minister made his point quite clear.  I think he is wrong.  I think he is using this Bill in a way in which it should not be used and which certainly seems to me to be contrary to the principles and spirit in which it was introduced.  Now, under Section 8, he will use the Bill for the purpose of saving money in particular cases where, in normal circumstances, if the Bill did not exist, the State would have to pay the cost.  Now, in those cases where free legal aid is granted, the State will not have to pay the full costs which, in ordinary circumstances, it would have to pay.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is wrong to this extent, I think.  The cases to which he referred might not have got as far as the Court of Criminal Appeal, were it not for the free legal aid provisions.  In that respect, we are not saving money.  All the existing cases which go to the Court of Criminal Appeal and avail of the provisions of Section 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1934, or Section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, will still go of their own volition, as it were, to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  But side by side with them, will now go new cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is perhaps under two misapprehensions here.  First of all, he thinks both these amendments are based on the assumption that the scale of costs to be awarded under this free legal aid scheme will be unsatisfactory.  They are not based on that assumption. They are based on the assumption he <Col N="375" /> mentioned, that they will be acceptable to the profession.</P>
      <P>I think Deputy O'Higgins and myself are both sufficiently realistic to know that that probably will mean that they will be less than the full professional costs which normally would be payable.  We recognise that fact.</P>
      <P>We are trying to ensure that where, under the present system, without this Bill at all, a person&mdash;whether he be a pauper or a millionaire&mdash;will get, in certain circumstances, costs awarded by the Court of Criminal Appeal against the State, that right will not be taken away.  I think the Minister is approaching this in the wrong way when he says that a person who starts off on the free legal aid track should stick to it.  It seems to me that as far as possible our approach should be that, where a person obtains free legal aid, having obtained the certificate, he should then go on in the same way as any other person who pays his own way; that he should not carry a stigma because he is getting free legal aid.  He should not be under any obligation to the State or anybody else.</P>
      <P>I think this justifies the line I was urging before, namely, that the whole application for free legal aid should be kept separate on the file.  It is an administrative function.  A person who gets free legal aid should, from there on, be treated as far as possible in the same way as somebody paying his own way.  To attempt now to penalise somebody&mdash;which is what we are doing&mdash;who gets free legal aid, by not allowing him to get the costs which he would get if he were not getting free legal aid, is, I submit&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  The Minister is under a misapprehension in thinking that this means that the cases involved here would never have gone to the Court of Criminal Appeal before now. He referred to the fact that he was aware that the practice in the profession <Col N="376" /> has been that where somebody appeared to have a reasonable case, he managed to have it brought on without money, because of the traditions of the profession.  He said there were various reasons why that was unsatisfactory but was recognised as existing.  In other words, at present if somebody has a reasonably good case and has no money, his case will be brought anyway.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think the Minister is mistaken if he thinks that, as a result of free legal aid, there will be cases going to the Court of Criminal Appeal involving costly procedure that otherwise would not be going on appeal. That may be so in some cases but it seems reasonable to assume that the vast bulk of cases will go forward whether there is free legal aid or not. We are dealing with cases which, if they are going to succeed, will involve costs against the State in some degree. For that reason, I think the Minister is under a misapprehension and that in his approach to this, he is, in fact, penalising somebody because he is getting free legal aid.  He is not getting the same rights as a person not getting free legal aid.</P>

      <P>In page 6, before section 9, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Before a person is granted a legal aid certificate he may be required by the court or judge, as the case may be, granting the certificate to furnish a written statement in such form as may be prescribed by the Minister by regulations under section 9 of this Act about matters relevant for determining whether his means are insufficient to enable him to obtain legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  In this and in the next following section `legal aid certificate' means a legal aid (District <Col N="377" /> Court) certificate, a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate, a legal aid (appeal) certificate, a legal aid (case stated) certificate or a legal aid (Supreme Court) certificate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to insert a new section before Section 9 and the object of the new section is partly to facilitate the court or judge in coming to a decision as to whether a prisoner's means are insufficient to enable him to afford legal aid and partly to facilitate the prosecution if it turns out later that the applicant has made a false or misleading statement as a result of which he appeals.  I want to assure the House that it is not intended there should be a means test as such.  It will still be exclusively a matter for the court to decide whether the applicant's means are insufficient.  The form of the written statement which the applicant may be required to furnish to the court will be prescribed by the Minister by regulation.  It is really designed to show the income of the applicant and his various commitments.  The general intention is that this will be a simple form requiring a minimum amount of information to enable the court to decide whether or not his means are insufficient.</P>

Can the Minister assure us that it will not be rigorously applied as it has been in respect of other types of State assistance?

      <P>I should like the Minister to make clear that it will be the income of the individual applying for legal aid and that regard will not be had to the household or family income. If the latter is to be the case the Minister should tell us now.  Will it be the income of the individual or the income of the household, parents, brothers and sisters and so on?  That is the way it applies in the case of health which is much more important to the masses of the people than what will be affected under this measure.  If the court is to decide who will get free legal aid, I think the Minister must give some help or advice and that he will have to tell the court whether it is the income of the individual or the household.  If we are to interpret strictly the amendment which the Minister has here it means&mdash;it refers to &ldquo;his income&rdquo;&mdash;the income of the individual. But I am afraid the same sort of phraseology has been used in the Health Act of 1953 but despite that those who determine means usually, perhaps, I should say invariably, take into account the means not only of the individual who makes the application for a medical card but of the household. This Bill will be absolutely useless unless the Minister indicates to the House now, and in the legislation, whose means are to be taken into account, if it is the applicant's exclusively, those with whom he lives, the household or the immediate relatives.</P>

      <P>When we discussed this Bill previously, I actually raised the question of means and I agree with Deputy Corish that it is the practice, no matter what form of assistance is sought&mdash;whether unemployment assistance or free boots or anything else&mdash;to assess the means of the family.  I suspect this will be the procedure here also as the Minister is not <Col N="379" /> disclosing it.  He says the Minister will make regulations.  We are actually being asked to buy a pig in a sack as we do not know what the regulations will be.  The Minister should say now if the means of everybody else in the household will be taken into consideration. I suspect that will be the case.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Because that is the position with every other form of assistance given by the State.  The means of every other person in the dwelling is assessed.  Unless we get it in black and white now, how are we to know what the Bill means?  Let us have it out.  It will mean that there will be victims.  We know families, and it is a case of everyone for himself. If some member of the family is asked to hand out a couple of pounds, he will tell the unfortunate relation or member of the family to jump in the lake.  That is what will happen if the means of the family is going to be the issue on which the application will be decided.</P>
      <P>We should have an indication from the Minister of what he means.  That raises another matter that, perhaps, is not relevant on this Bill.  This is like the question of costs.  In any action, if there are costs, you are examined and I think it is most unfair that a person's life-savings should be taken away from him just because of the costs of some little action taken to get justice.  Suppose we are dealing with an individual and it was found the individual had £20 in the bank, his savings over a number of years, would the whole £20 be assessed or only part of it?  Would he have to pauperise himself completely?  I want an answer to these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties of Deputy Corish and Deputy Sherwin but I think the Minister has been rather courageous in his approach to this question of means here. He is leaving it entirely to the discretion of the justices or the judges. For a Minister of State to do that requires a certain amount of courage <Col N="380" /> because it means he cannot assess what this will cost.  It may be that under the scheme we shall find that in one part of the country a person with a very considerable income can still get free legal aid and in another part of the country, a person may be a pauper and not get it because of a difference of approach by justices. However, on balance, it is wise to leave the matter as it is and have another go at it, if it does not work properly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish should realise that what he is asking the Minister to do is to introduce a means test.  If any proviso is put in as to what the Minister should apply, it is a means test. The alternative to that is what the Minister is doing and we should commend him for taking that approach.</P>

      <P>I do not know why Deputies should look a gift horse in the mouth or impute bad motives to my innocent mind.  This Bill is as clear and explicit as it can possibly be.  We are leaving it entirely to the discretion of the judge as to whether or not free legal aid should be granted. We could have brought in all sorts of provisos about satisfying the Minister for Finance, the Comptroller and Auditor General, or something of that nature.  We have not and it is not our intention in the Bill to fetter the judge in this regard.  I would visualise that as often as not, the judge would not even ask for this form.  He would put a few questions to the accused and on the basis of the information elicited, decide whether or not to give free legal aid.</P>
      <P>If Deputies want a specific assurance in this regard from me, I am prepared to give it, but I do it reluctantly because it is intruding on the principle of leaving the judge completely free to decide these things on their merits.  I do not think anybody else's income or means, apart from that of the accused, should be taken into account in this regard and it is not my intention that it should.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1) (c), to add &ldquo;having regard to the principle that a person in respect of whom any such certificate may be granted shall be entitled to choose the solicitor and (where applicable) counsel to be assigned to him subject to such solicitor and (where applicable) counsel being available and willing to act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am endeavouring to ensure that the accused person can, subject to the limitations set out in the amendment, select his own solicitor and counsel.  I regard this as being of vital importance to the Bill.  The provision as it stands could do great harm later.  The principle on which I argue this is that the person who obtains a legal aid certificate should as far as possible be put into the same position as somebody who is paying his own way.  One of the essential rights of a person who is paying his own way as a litigant is that he selects his own solicitor and, if he wants to, his own counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what is provided in this amendment, that a person who gets a free legal aid certificate will select his own solicitor and counsel, if they are available and willing to act. This right should not be denied to a legally-aided person and if we deny it to him, we are imposing some kind of restriction or stigma on him.  We are saying he is not capable of selecting his own.  As the provision stands, the position would be that the accused would indicate his wishes, the judge would decide whom he was going to assign and in doing so, would take into account the wishes expressed by the accused.  That is all very well where he assigns the people whom the accused wants but in the case where the judge assigns somebody the accused does not want, that is where we get into difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the judge assigns, say, solicitor <Col N="384" /> and counsel A, accused having wanted solicitor and counsel B and this judge, as the Bill stands, goes on to conduct the trial and convicts the accused, it is almost inevitable that the accused and maybe other people will feel that he has not got a fair trial.  I would urge the Minister to remember in all his dealings with this Bill the cliché that it is very important that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.  I believe that, unless this principle is accepted, justice will not be seen to be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Inevitably.  We may as well face realities.  Some judges dislike certain solicitors and certain counsel. That being so, it is possible that such judges might refuse to assign certain solicitors and barristers, for reasons they consider good ones, although those concerned might be the very people the accused required.  It could be argued that the judge would know better than the accused which solicitor or counsel would be best in the particular type of case, but it seems to me that the advantages involved in that are far outweighed by the disadvantages of taking away from a legally-aided accused the right to select his own solicitor and counsel, a right which every other accused has.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept the principle involved here.  From his point of view nothing more is involved than a question of mere administration. On the other side, however, a more important principle is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with both the amendment and the views expressed on it by Deputy Colley.  The case was made on Second Reading, and I think accepted by everyone, that this Bill when it becomes law simply will not function, or cannot function, without the fullest co-operation of both branches of the legal profession.  It seems to me entirely wrong that a situation could be allowed to develop&mdash;I do not suggest it is intended by the Minister that it should develop&mdash;in which people would be forced to accept representages <Col N="385" /> tion from either solicitors or barristers whom they did not want.  If this Bill is to work the person who is accused, and who has got a free legal aid certificate, must be entitled to choose from a panel of solicitors and barristers those whom he wants to represent him. If that is not done this Bill will not work.  I think Deputy Colley's amendment goes to the very root of the Bill. It is a matter of principle, and the Minister should accept it.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that under Section 9, or under his amendment No. 35, there is nothing to preclude an accused choosing from a panel of solicitors and counsel.  It may be true that he is not specifically precluded, but what the Minister is doing is reserving to himself the right to make regulations governing the manner in which solicitors and barristers will be assigned.  The whole crux of the matter lies in the words &ldquo;the manner in which&rdquo;.  The Minister probably intends that phrase to cover simply the administrative machinery, and the court will make the actual assignment. But that does not go far enough.  The court should assign a solicitor or barrister chosen from a panel of solicitors and barristers prepared to work this Act, and chosen by the accused.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express an opinion.  I agree the accused should have the right to make a choice.  There is always the danger that the court may have their own pals.  Every judge is, after all, a political appointee and he may choose a certain member of the profession, and continue to choose him in order to put jobs in his way.  There is as much difference between chalk and cheese as there is between one solicitor and another solicitor and one barrister and another barrister.  The person appointed could be a dud.  If the accused picks a dud, that is his own responsibility.  It is for him to pick whoever is, in his opinion, the best man.  The Minister may be concerned about costs.  He may consider that leaving it in the hands of the accused might be more costly as against certain people functioning in a permanent manner.</P>

If the person assigned were getting regular assignments he might not take much interest whereas the man selected by the accused would do his best.

It might happen occasionally that a particularly strong-willed client would overrule his solicitor's selection, but that would not happen very often. Certainly we cannot contemplate that here.  Whatever merit there might be in the suggestion that the client should have the right to nominate his solicitor, we could not possibly contemplate, from a practical point of view, his having the right to nominate his counsel; indeed, the counsel he might select might not be a person of whom his solicitor would approve at all.  That would be a ridiculous situation.</P>
      <P>First of all, let us consider the fact that we are providing that the court will set up a panel of solicitors.  The accused's right of selection is limited straight away in that regard.

I am not in any way reflecting on the counsel as incompetent when I say we do not want to retain that counsel.  It is far easier for the solicitor to work with somebody whom he knows.</P>

      <P>The right to make the selection is the client's right and the solicitor has absolutely no authority whatever to override that right. If he does not like to retain the counsel whom the client nominates, his right is to withdraw completely. In certain circumstances, I can see a solicitor saying: &ldquo;I will not retain Mr. So-and-So; I will withdraw from the case.&rdquo;  That is a principle which is an essential part of the administration of justice for a person who pays. The whole point made by Deputy Colley, and I agree with him, is that, once a certificate for free legal aid has been given, the person to whom it is given should be just as free as the person who is going to pay out of his own pocket.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that. There would be another way of doing it without the panel at all.  I can see difficulties of administration in relation to it, but there would be another way. One way is that the certificate would be such that the accused person would be entitled to bring that certificate to any solicitor and that the certificate, when presented, would be the proper authority for payment of costs, according to the recognised panel scale, shall we say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether it is done one way or the other, there is no justification whatever to suggest that the opposition to Deputy Colley's amendment arises because of the inclusion of counsel. Let us go on from that.  Having thrown aside the Minister's deliberate red herring to cover up a point he did not <Col N="390" /> want to argue, you have got a panel of solicitors, and there is no reason why one should not leave to the accused the choice of what person he goes to on that panel.  If a person on the panel is ill, for example, obviously he will not be available to take the assignment. There is not any possible method by which what the Minister is pleased to call the &ldquo;recalcitrant accused&rdquo; can avoid or hold up justice.</P>
    <P>I heard another Minister saying here, sitting in the seat in which the present Minister sits, that one of the fundamental principles of our law is that a person is innocent until he is proved guilty.  What Deputy Haughey, as Minister for Justice, is now trying to suggest is that a person, because he is accused, because he is recalcitrant, should not get the proper rights the ordinary citizen gets.  I disagree entirely, categorically and fundamentally with that.  It is a principle which I am extremely grateful to Deputy Colley for having given us an opportunity to ventilate in this House.</P>
    <P>An accused person says: &ldquo;I want Mr. X on the panel&rdquo; and is told: &ldquo;No, I will not give you Mr. X but will give you Mr. Y.&rdquo;  I am not saying that is done for capricious reasons but for reasons which the justice may think good and proper.  Mr. Y then comes in and deals with the case.  The man is convicted.  Nothing that anybody can say, certainly nothing the Minister for Justice can say, will ever persuade that man that he was not unfairly convicted and that if he had been given the solicitor of his choice that solicitor would have had him acquitted, the solicitor of his choice who had already indicated to the court he was properly available to deal with panel cases of that type.</P>
    <P>There is not any possible reason why the theory running through this amendment cannot be accepted.  I shall not say categorically at all that the exact wording of this amendment is such that it carries into full drafting effect the principle involved.  That principle cannot be gainsaid.  It is a principle the Minister will find every reputable lawyer in the country will be whole-heartedly and absolutely behind.</P>

      <P>I want to tell the Minister that I consider the argument he put forward, in which he alleged that the principle argued by me was ridiculous was, in fact, ridiculous on his part.  If I understood him correctly, he said I had argued that the right of an accused to select his solicitor and counsel should be absolutely unfettered.  He pointed out that this could lead to an absolutely ridiculous situation.  With due deference to the Minister, I suggest this was a debating trick on his part.  It would be easily possible to argue on that line that somebody should have the right to have Dan O'Connell or John Philpott Curran acting for him and, because he could not have him, he was not going to put up with what was happening.  Obviously, it was implied in the argument, in fact, more than implied, because it is set out in the amendment that where such solicitors are &ldquo;available and are willing to act...&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>Does the Minister suggest that I should have enunciated the principle by saying &ldquo;Of course, I am excluding persons dead, persons not yet born or persons unwilling to act&rdquo;? The argument was clear and the amendment was clear.  All that is required here is that where this panel has been drawn up of people willing to act, the accused should have the right to choose from that panel.  It is possible that the accused would choose from that panel a person who might be sick or unable to take the case for one reason or another.  I would not object if the Minister wanted to re-draft this to provide that in such circumstances the accused could not hold up his trial <Col N="392" /> for ever.  That is the only argument the Minister advanced, that a recalcitrant accused might hold up the proceedings of the court.  If the Minister is prepared to accept the amendment, it is not beyond the wit of the Parliamentary Draftsman or himself to overcome this difficulty.  The principle involved is extremely important from the Minister's point of view and the administration of the Bill.  There would be no real difficulty there at all.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Before making regulations under this section in relation to any of the matters provided in subsection (2) of this section the Minister shall consult with the Council of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the General Council of the Bar in Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide that when the Minister is framing his regulations he will consult with the Council of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland and the General Council of the Bar in Ireland. I am satisfied that the Minister intends doing this.  It is very probable he has already done so but these regulations are liable to be changed from time to time.  There will be persons other than the present Minister presiding over that Department and the whole success of this Bill, when it becomes an Act, as I said more than once already, will depend entirely on the co-operation of both branches of the legal profession.  For that reason I want it written into the Act that when regulations are being made by the Minister with regard to any of the matters which are referred to in subsection (2) of Section 9, as it originally stood at the time my amendment was put down, the Minister will consult with the Incorporated Law Society on the one hand and the Bar Council on the other.</P>
    <P>The particular matters about which I want this consultation to take place are the form of the legal aid certificates, the rates and scales of pay, and the manner in which counsel and the solicitors will be assigned.  Deputy Colley moved an amendment regarding the free choice by accused persons of their solicitor and counsel.  He was quite right and the arguments he put up were quite right but I would be less worried about that particular amendment of Deputy Colley being rejected by the Minister, if the Minister would accept the principle of this amendment which would require him to consult with the Incorporated Law Society and with the body controlling the barristers' profession before he made regulations regarding the manner <Col N="394" /> in which counsel and solicitors would be assigned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this amendment is necessary.  In fact, as the Deputy surmises, I have consulted with both the Incorporated Law Society and the Council of the Bar in Ireland.  It is my intention to meet them again and to prepare the regulations in the fullest possible co-operation with both bodies and to procure their assistance, help and guidance to the greatest possible extent.  In view of the realities of the situation, that we are in consultation with these bodies, the amendment could very well be withdrawn.</P>

They are not being tied up in any way with this scheme which, as I say, depends entirely on them and their co-operation for its success.  I would prefer, as I made it clear on Second Reading, that the entire administration of this scheme be left to the legal profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this about it, if we make it a statutory requirement I think it takes from the good of the situation.  The relations between the Minister for Justice for the time being and these bodies should be such that it would be understood in matters of this sort that consultation would be a normal and natural process, and I think that is the right way to have it.  I feel something would be lost if the Minister consulted these bodies simply because he had to rather than, as we do at the moment, consult regularly <Col N="395" /> from time to time about all sorts of matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There may be an argument for what the Minister says, that it would lose something by putting it in the actual wording of the scheme.  I do not agree with him on that.  At least I can see that it is possible for people to have two different points of view.  That I can understand, but I feel the position must be clear in practice and beyond question that regulations will not be made without proper consultation with both branches of the legal profession. By proper consultation I mean consultation in an atmosphere of give and take and not merely the fulfilment of a legal obligation in that respect by saying &ldquo;Here is what I am going to do, say what you like but I am still going to do it.&rdquo;  If it is not going to be done on the word basis, before the regulations are being made, it is not going to be worth doing.  As I say, I would prefer it in the Bill.  It would be better in the Bill but at the same time if the Minister makes it clear that he is not speaking as the present occupant of the position but is speaking, as it were, as the corporate soul, and that it is going to be always the practice that whoever is Minister for Justice will consult with both branches of the profession before regulations of any sort are introduced in an effort to achieve a harmonious result, then with some reluctance, I would be prepared to accept that.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to delete paragraph (a) of subsection (1) of Section 10 which provides that, on conviction on indictment, a person shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £100 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. Having reconsidered the matter, it seems to me that this is the type of offence that ought to be dealt with summarily.  When a district justice has power to impose a sentence of up to six months, it seems to me that it would be unreasonable to send for trial on indictment when the maximum penalty of imprisonment is only six months.  This amendment makes the offence of obtaining free legal aid by false representation subject to a penalty of £100 or six months' imprisonment, or both.</P>

    <P>This amendment proposes a fresh subsection for the existing subsection (2) of Section 10 and is almost completely consequential on the last amendment. In addition, the words &ldquo;in addition to imposing the penalties provided for in subsection (1) of this section&rdquo; are being deleted as it might be argued that they implied that the court, when convicting under subsection (1), was bound to impose a fine and imprisonment in every case and was not free to apply the Probation Act.</P>

    <P>This amendment has a twofold purpose.  Firstly, it provides for the redrafting of the subsection so as to clarify that where a Chief Superintendent gets a number of applications for permits to hold collections on the same day in the same locality, he must either grant only one permit, or, subject to fulfilment of certain conditions, grant permits to all the applicants who do not fall to be refused under the other provisions of the Bill. The subsection envisages that, in the ordinary way, only one collection will be permitted to take place in a locality on a particular day.  However, more than one collection will be permitted where all the applicants agree and the Chief Superintendent is satisfied that the public will not be excessively importuned.</P>
    <P>The other purpose of the amendment is to provide that, in the type of case just mentioned, where the Chief Superintendent is prepared to grant more than one permit, it will not be necessary to get the consent of any applicant whose application the Chief Superintendent must, in any event, refuse under the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 5, lines 43 to 52, and page 6, lines 1 to 13, to delete subsection (3)  and to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( )  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  applications are made for the grant of collection permits in respect of more than one collection proposed to be held on the same day and wholly or partly in the same locality,</P>
      <P>(b)  no collection permit stands granted in respect of a collection to be held on the day and wholly or partly in the locality to which the applications relate, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="403" /> (c)  only one permit is proposed to be granted,</P>
    <P>the permit shall be granted in respect of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the object in relation to which an application is received by the Chief Superintendent for the locality on a day before the day of the receipt of any other application, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  if two or more applications are received on the same day, being a day before the day on which any other application is received, the object chosen by lot from among those in respect of which applications are received on the same day, being a day before the day on which any other application is received,</P>
    <P>and where, pursuant to this subsection, it is proposed to make a determination by lot, the applicants concerned shall be informed of the time and place at which the determination will be held and be given an opportunity to be present thereat:</P>
    <P>Provided that, an application that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  is on behalf of an object in respect of which a collection was not held in the immediately preceding year on the day corresponding to the day to which the applications relate, and</P>
    <P>(II)  is received by the Chief Superintendent on the day, or on a day before the day, on which there is received by the Chief Superintendent an application that is on behalf of an object in respect of which a collection was so held and that does not fall to be refused under any other section of this Act,</P>
    <P>shall be deemed, for the purposes of this subsection, not to have been received by the Chief Superintendent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment the main purpose of which is to clarify and ensure that where a Chief Superintendent has before him a number of <Col N="404" /> applications for permits to hold collections in the same locality and on the same day and proposes to grant only one such permit, priority will be given to an application received from what, for convenience, may be referred to as an old-established charity.  In the course of the Second Stage discussion on the Bill a plea was made by Deputies that there should be no interference with the activities of these charities, which have been conducting flag-day collections for very many years.  As I mentioned on that occasion, safeguards for these charities have already been written into Section 6 of the Bill, but, on a re-examination of the section, it has been found desirable to redraft subsection (3) so as to clarify the underlying intention and to remove any possible loopholes by which the old-established charities might be deprived of the priority to which the House rightly considers that they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The proposed new subsection (3) provides that, where there is a clash of applications in respect of collections to be held on the same day and only one permit is proposed to be granted, the order of priority for the grant of that permit will be</P>
    <P>(i)  the first application received, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  where a number of applications are received on the same day, the application chosen by lot from among them.</P>
    <P>The proviso to the subsection goes on to stipulate that, where an application from what may be termed a newcomer is received before, or on the same day, as an application from an old-established charity, the newcomer's application will, for the purposes of the subsection, be deemed not to have been received.  In that way the application of the old-established charity will be accorded priority.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 19 to 22, to delete &ldquo;(being, in the case of a collection permit in relation to a collection of, or attempt to collect, money in the course of house to house visits, days occurring within a period not exceeding six months)&rdquo; and to insert &ldquo;(being either all the days specified in the application for the permit or such one or more of those days as the Chief Superintendent considers reasonable in all the circumstances)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of this amendment is to remove the limit of six months on the period within which house to house collections may be held and to provide, instead, that in granting a permit either for a street or house to house collection a Chief Superintendent will have discretion to confine the collection to a shorter period than that applied for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of limiting the duration of collections, either of the street or home to home variety, it is felt, on reconsideration, that it is desirable to keep the Bill as flexible as possible and to leave the matter to <Col N="408" /> the discretion of the Garda authorities. If it ever becomes necessary to apply the proposed Act to house to house collections it is envisaged that collections made for religious and other obviously legitimate purposes would be exempted, and a period of six months would probably be too long for the type of collections which would be subject to control.  On the other hand, the exceptional case could arise in which six months might prove too short.</P>
    <P>As regards street collections, the position will be that the normal collection will not extend over more than two or three days but here again it is desirable to provide for the exceptional case where a much longer period would be appropriate.  For example, it has come to my notice, since the debate on the Second Stage of the Bill took place, that not all the collections made by the St. Vincent de Paul Society after Mass on Sundays actually take place inside church grounds.  There are at least a few instances in the Dublin area where, for one reason or another, the collections have to be taken up on the footpath outside the church.  I have considered whether there is any way in which the Bill could be amended so as to exempt these collections but I am satisfied that this cannot be done without also exempting other types of collections which we would clearly want to control.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in these isolated cases in which after-Mass collections are taken up by the Society on the public street it would be necessary for the local Conference of the Society to apply for a collection permit and I would envisage that in such cases the permit issued might authorise the taking up of the collections over a period of, say, twelve months.</P>
    <P>The granting of discretion to Chief Superintendents to confine a collection to a shorter period than the one applied for is necessary to cover the case where an application for a collection permit is made which does not fall to be refused under any of the other provisions of the Bill but which seeks to have the collection held over an excessively long period. Under the Bill as it stands the Chief <Col N="409" /> Superintendent would have no specific authority to grant a permit restricting the collection to a shorter period than the one applied for.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;( )  A Chief Superintendent to whom an application (in this subsection referred to as the relevant <Col N="411" /> application) for a collection permit is made not later than three months before the day or the first of the days on which the collection to which the relevant application relates is proposed to be held shall, not later than seven days after the date on which the relevant application is received by him, give notice of such receipt to any holder of a collection&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <P>(d)  in respect of which an application for a collection permit in respect of a collection to be held on a day to which the relevant application relates has not been received by the Chief Superintendent.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The gist of that is that if an application is made by a newcomer, it goes on to say:</P>

      <P>Has the Minister given any further consideration to the point I raised on Second Reading with regard to subsection (4)?  This deals with appeals to the district court against the refusal of the Chief Superintendent to grant a licence and it is provided in subsection (4) of this section that without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the district court to disallow on other grounds an appeal under this section, an appeal under this section shall be disallowed, if, on the hearing thereof, a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector, states on oath that he has reasonable grounds for believing that the proceeds, or any portion of the proceeds, of the collection would be devoted to purposes set out.  I suggested to the Minister on Second Reading that that is carrying things a bit too far.</P>
      <P>All an inspector has to do is to swear that he has reasonable grounds for believing and, once he swears that, this discretion of the district court to grant a permit where it has been refused by the superintendent goes by the board and, in fact, no discretion at all is being left with the district court. Once the inspector gets into the witness box and says he has reasonable grounds for believing, the district justice, under the Bill as it is framed, will have no authority at all to require the inspector to satisfy the court that his suspicions are reasonable, or to adduce any evidence or proof whatever.  It seems to me this is a matter which should be capable of some proof and that the inspector should be required to satisfy the court that he has reasonable grounds for his belief.  It should not be sufficient simply that he states he has reasonable grounds.</P>

      <P>I do not like subsection (5).  I referred to it on the Second Stage and I think it is necessary to make some protest whenever this type of subsection appears in our legislation.  Subsection (5) says:</P>
      <P>(5)  In a prosecution for an offence under this section, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that at the time he acted as a collector in the collection, the defendant did not hold a collector's authorisation granted to him by the holder of the collection permit relating to the collection.</P>
      <P>In bringing in that kind of provision, we are running completely counter to the normal pattern where a person is innocent until he is found guilty by the court.  Here we are saying he is guilty until he satisfies the court that he is innocent.</P>

      <P>Subsection (5) only shifts the burden of proof in relation to the affirmative fact which is known to the defendant, whether he possessed a collector's authorisation or not.  If I were on the Deputy's side of the House, I might be inclined to agree with him but I do put it forward as being necessary for the practical applition of the provisions of the Bill.  It is the same sort of provision as is included in the Road Traffic Act, 1961, in relation to driving licences.</P>

      <P>If my memory serves me, I objected to the provision in the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  One of the reasons was precisely what is happening now, that it would be used as a precedent for the enactment of other provisions of this sort.  I think it is wrong.  It is capable of proof by the prosecution as to whether a person had a collector's authorisation or not.</P>

      <P>It is, of course.  The prosecution should not assume that everybody who goes into the witness box will commit perjury. All the prosecution has to do is to issue a witness summons to the holder of the collection permit and require him to give evidence as to whether or not he issued a collector's authorisation to the defendant.  That is all that is necessary and for the sake of saving trouble to the ordinary pattern calling an additional witness, it is not worth while that the ordinary pattern of law to which we have been accustomed since before the State was established should be upset.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>Then the defendant under this section would be badly in the soup.  Suppose he has lost it?  How can he establish his innocence?  The Minister's justification for the section was that the <Col N="416" /> defendant would be in a position to prove he had an authorisation.  Supposing he has lost his collector's authorisation and the situation is such as the Minister envisages, that the holder of the permit has not kept a record, how can the defendant discharge the onus of proof that has been put on him by this subsection?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 10, line 11, to delete &ldquo;fourteen&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;thirteen&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down this amendment by reason of experience of a great deal of prejudice by adults against children. When they think of children, they think of them in terms of young fellows in knickerbockers making a nuisance of themselves.  They are thinking of children of eight or nine years of age.  The average young lad of 12 or 13 is grown up and could look 15.  The average lad of 12 or 13 wears long trousers.  That is important in the make-up and mentality of a boy.  As soon as he begins to wear long trousers, he begins to feel he is a man.  Now, we should not misjudge these lads.  Theirs is the teenage world.  Some people think these lads are a lot of irresponsibles. They, on their part, think adults are a lot of old fogies.  We should not lose sight of that.  It would be as well for us to try to understand these lads a little and not take the attitude that they are here just to do what they are told, and &ldquo;Mother knows best&rdquo;.  These boys have plenty of <Col N="417" /> sense.  We should not mix them up with the little nippers in knickerbockers dodging in and out through the queues in O'Connell Street, trying to knock down a &ldquo;tanner&rdquo; or a threepenny bit.</P>
    <P>The most successful collections for charity are done by boys of 12 and 13.  If we make the age limit 14, we will kill half the collections in Dublin. I invite the Minister to consult with the managers.  I bought the badge I am wearing from a young lad of 13. A fortnight ago, I bought another badge from a boy of twelve.  The best collections are done by the boys in sixth standard in the national schools.  They are free at three o'clock and they have nothing to do for the rest of the day.  When they leave school at 14, they become sex conscious. Indeed, when they leave, the managers lose valuable contacts from the point of view of collections for charity.  If this is made law, the national schools will be out.  On whom then will people depend for the success of collections?  There may be a handful of dedicated people who will organise, or elderly well-meaning people, but they are useless.  I have two boys myself; one is 13 and the other 12.  I have but to say: &ldquo;Fill that box and I will give you half a dollar&rdquo; and the box is filled.</P>
    <P>I know what I am talking about.  I know boys.  The moment they leave school, they become sex conscious. They want to dance.  I do not want this legislation to be another Dance Halls Act.  I am an authority on dance halls.  According to the Act, persons under 16 must not be admitted. Half the dancing public in Dublin are under 14.  The moment the girls leave school and get a job, they want to go dancing.  The Dance Halls Act is a joke.  Boys and girls of 14 are dancing in clubs.  They may not enter a public dance hall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a reasonable request and, in so far as it is possible, we shall try to implement it.  I should like, however, to point out one fact. The age at the moment is 16.  We propose reducing it to 14.  We discussed this matter at some length on the Second Stage and I should imagine public opinion was focused on it to a certain extent.  We have not received so far any representations asking that the age should be reduced still further. Indeed, as the Deputy knows, the only representations we have had are to the effect that it should be increased to 16. I am fairly clear in my mind that we should not increase it to 16, because I think 14 is a reasonable age.  We have arrived at that after consultation with the school managers and other persons concerned.  Fourteen is also the age of criminal responsibility.  A young person is regarded as capable of accepting criminal responsibility at that age.  It was logical from that point of view, therefore, to fix on fourteen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My recollection of these collections <Col N="419" /> is much the same as Deputy Sherwin's. I think the majority of charity collections in the cities are taken up by secondary schoolboys.  I remember myself on a number of occasions being drafted for that task.  Boys are at secondary school until 16 or 17.  With the age of 14 you still would have in the secondary schools a considerable pool of young lads who would be available to undertake these collections.</P>
    <P>I am not sure there is a great deal to be gained by going down to 13.  If it were a case that you would not have a sufficient number of boys of the age of 14 there might be something to be said, but I do not think it is a problem. However, if the Deputy wishes, we will have a chat with some of the school managers and see what they have to say about it.  But I would reiterate to the Deputy that the only representations we have are to the effect that the age should be increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate Deputy Sherwin's arguments, and he made them in a very telling manner, but I disagree with him.  I think the Minister is making a mistake to reduce the age limit from 16 to 14, and I hope he will not go any further than that.  There is this point to be considered in connection with the temptation to get people to break the law and say they are of age when they are not of age.  Under existing provisions, which were the regulations made under the Police Act of 1916, the penalties imposed are comparatively light, I think £2 for a first offence and £5 for a second offence.  The penalties under this Bill will be far heavier.  There is provision made for a fine of £50 or imprisonment up to six months.  I do not think there is going to be any very great attraction held out to people to break the law when this goes through.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) of Section 16 provides for offences where a person under the age of 14 acts as a collector.  The person who will be held responsible in such cases will be either the person who granted the collector's authorisation or the organiser of the collection.  It is not intended that the young person concerned should be made guilty of an offence and the object of this amendment is to remove any doubts on this score in the exceptional case where the collection is organised by the young person himself.  In theory, of course, the young person in such a case could be charged with an offence under Section 3 for holding an unauthorised collection, but, in practice, it is unlikely that such a charge would be brought, as, apart from any other consideration, it would be necessary for the prosecution to show, firstly, that the child had the ordinary <i>mens rea</i> required by law for the particular crime and, secondly, that he knew his act was wrong.</P>

The number that will have time to undertake collections will not be as great as the Minister thinks.  But there is this large body of young fellows of 13 in the Sixth Standard who cannot leave school.  They would love to leave&mdash; at 12 they think they know as much as you do&mdash;but they are not allowed to leave.  If the Minister goes down O'Connell Street and sees the kids of nine and ten selling newspapers, he will know they have as much &ldquo;savvy&rdquo; as a lot of adults.  Do not confuse young lads of thirteen with kids.  They are young men, restless and anxious to leave school and go to work.  And only the law prevents them.  Many people express opinions about youth.  I do not mind that at all.  I judge by experience and I have bags of experience.  There are thousands of dance halls full of kids aged 14 and 15 having a good laugh at the law.</P>

      <P>I think it is not an unreasonable request, nevertheless, that we should ask people who collect money from the public to account for it.  I have no doubt this will work out all right in practice.  The majority of cases will never give rise to any difficulty but it is necessary to have provision for the odd case where there is something funny going on.  Subsection (1) says: &ldquo;... in such detail as may be appropriate to the circumstances.&rdquo; I think that is a fairly reasonable approach.</P>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the required information. Estimates of the purchasing power of money are based on the retail price index numbers.  The appropriate index numbers are not available for the year 1920 and a corresponding estimate for that year cannot, therefore, be made.  The available information suggests that retail prices rose by about 150 per cent between 1914 (the base year of the original series of index numbers) and 1920 and, on the assumption that these figures are correct the relevant estimate for 1920 would be 10/2.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>AMOUNTS which would be required at the periods specified to purchase the same quantum of goods and services at retail prices as would £1 at mid-February, 1962.</P>

      <P>The hospitals to which the question relates are voluntary or proprietary hospitals, and the fixing of fees chargeable to girls entering their nursing schools is entirely a matter for the individual hospital authorities. While I would deprecate any conditions likely to discourage girls from entering training schools in Irish hospitals, I have no evidence that the hospitals in which entrance fees are charged are experiencing difficulty in recruiting their full complements of students.</P>
      <P>In order to improve the conditions of new entrants to the profession, I recently intimated to the authorities of voluntary and proprietary hospitals to which grants to cover revenue deficits are paid from the Hospitals' Trust Fund that, should they decide to adopt new scales of pay for student nurses, the additional expenditure involved would rank towards the calculation of deficits for the purpose of grants.  The new scales of pay indicated to the hospitals represent very considerable increases over the rates hitherto in operation, and their adoption will, it is estimated, increase the demands on the Hospitals' Trust Fund by £250,000 annually.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is, no doubt, aware that nurses who enter training schools in hospitals conducted by health authorities are not liable for entrance fees, and have for a considerable time received salaries which compare very favourably with those paid in other hospitals.</P>

      <P>It is an offence under Section 56 of the Nurses Act, 1950, for a person not in the register of nurses kept by An Bord Altranais to hold herself out as being so registered.  This is designed to ensure that only properly qualified persons will be appointed to posts designated to be filled by registered nurses.  As the care and nursing of the sick must in practice be shared between registered nurses and other persons, including, for example, trained first aid workers, religious communities and relatives of the ill, I do not think that it would be appropriate to extend the present statutory protection given by Section 56 of the Act of 1950 to registered nurses.</P>

      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appeal under the Town and Regional planning Acts related to a proposal for the erection of 53 houses. I allowed the appeal subject to the omission of 12 houses.  In coming to <Col N="432" /> this decision I took into account all relevant considerations including the demand for residential accommodation in the area, the provision of open space in relation to the proposed development and the amount of open space available in the Clontarf area generally.</P>
    <P>As Section 59 (3) of the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, provides that my decision on an appeal shall be final, no useful purpose would have been served by my receiving a deputation from the Corporation after I had made the Order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when this estate was first developed six years ago, the purchasers of houses there at that time were given clearly to understand that a park would be provided on this open space which was reserved as an open space under the draft town planning?  The Minister is condoning a grave breach of faith by the developers of the estate.</P>

To expend, possibly for once in one's lifetime, rather a large sum in providing oneself with a house and then to take so little care when purchasing it as to accept statements made verbally, or indeed only inferences, is a practice which, I think, should be discontinued for the benefit of all concerned.

      <P>(1)  Only three 625 line channels can be accommodated in Band 1.  Gort will occupy channel B.  The use of channel A for Mount Leinster would result in interference to the B.B.C. transmissions on channel 1.  Channel C would not be suitable because of interference from B.B.C. stations on channels 4 and 5, including in particular Pembroke and Wenvoe (South Wales) and North Hessary Tor (Devon).</P>

    <P>(2)  The use of a modified channel D for Mount Leinster would be unsatisfactory <Col N="436" /> because of the Stockholm assignments for new stations on channel 6 in Great Britain and the Six Counties, including in particular Black Mountain (Belfast), Llangollen (Wales) and Stockland Hill (Devon).</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the case that service in Northern Ireland is not recognised for incremental purposes?  Having regard to the fact that a number of religious orders, particularly, operate schools in the North of Ireland and in the Republic and normally would like to have their staffs interchangeable, will the Minister take steps to ensure that they will not be put at a financial disadvantage, say, the Christian Brothers wishing to transfer one of their staff from Newry or Belfast to Dublin or Cork?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to which I referred the Deputy covers these points. In other countries where service abroad is considered, it is because those countries are short of teachers and want to attract them.  We have not that problem here.  Another point which seems to be overlooked by Deputies is that such recognition will not create new posts.  There seems to be a general assumption that if you recognise service abroad, you will create new openings here for Irish people abroad.  If the Deputy refers back to my answer, he will see the whole question is being kept under review from the point of view of the needs of education in this country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if in view of the recent decision of the Supreme Court that area exemption orders granted prior to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, were valid during the summer of 1960, despite the fact that he assured the House that his legal advisers informed him that such orders would expire on the Act becoming law, he will now refund to the publicans the stamp duty paid by them on such exemption orders; if he will introduce legislation to wipe out all endorsements on spirit licences during such period; and if he will refund fines imposed by the Courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no connection between the Supreme Court decision and the question of a refund of fees and I am not prepared to recommend a refund.  The fee paid for an Area Exemption Order was the same whether it applied to one Sunday or several and the publicans concerned had the benefit of the Area Exemption Orders up to 4th July, 1960.  If any publican had paid a fee for an Area Exemption Order which was not due to come into effect until after 4th July, that would, perhaps, be a different matter but my Department received no complaint that that had occurred in any area.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any case where a publican was convicted for a breach of the licensing laws on a Sunday after the passing of the 1960 Act in circumstances where he was acting within the terms of an Area Exemption Order granted to him before the passing of that Act.  If, however, any such case is brought to my notice I shall consider what steps should be taken to remedy the situation.</P>
