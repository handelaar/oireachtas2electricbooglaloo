      <P>Reasonable attention should be given to this matter.  I do not think it desirable that we should have to scramble through important Bills at the end of the month of August when the Dáil is jaded and legislation does not get the consideration to which it is entitled.  What is urgent must be done, and what is not urgent could be left to the autumn to be dealt with, with calm deliberation, by whatever Government are then in office.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> To delete subsections (3) and (4) and substitute a new subsection as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Council may charge a fee in respect of registration and the amount of such fee shall be determined from time to time by the Council with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night on this amendment, I was making the point that the Pharmaceutical Society combines several functions.  It is a qualifying body; it is an examining body; it is an educational body; and it has also many of the functions of a trade union in so far as it takes upon itself the burden of ensuring that the law restricting the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions and the selling of poisons is enforced.  That is to the advantage and benefit of every member of the pharmaceutical profession.  My view is that every member of that profession should be required to contribute to the funds of the Society in exactly the same way as a member of a trade union contributes to the funds of his union for the protection which it affords him in the exercise of his means of livelihood.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan pointed out that the medical profession pay one fee on registration, but then he went on to say that, in addition, most members of the profession are members of what is, in fact, a trade union, though it disdains to call itself that, being a body which exists for the protection of the economic and temporal interests of the members of the profession.  He did not see any objection to that because that particular association, of which he is a member, does afford to its members, or used to afford to them, a certain amount of protection.  I do not see why he should expect that a fraction only of the Pharmaceutical Society should take upon themselves the financial burden of protecting the interests of the profession as a whole.  I do not see any reason why any person who wishes to remain on the register of the Society should not be expected to pay a fee for that privilege.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> Apart from the protection which the Society affords to pharmacists in general, the Society also undertakes the burden and expense of keeping the registers properly.  There is a very heavy penalty, which is increased in this Bill, for failure to keep the registers properly or offences in connection with false representations in respect of the getting on to a register.  There is imposed a legal obligation on the Society to ensure that they are properly kept.</P>
    <P>The fact that a pharmacist's name is on the register gives him a special place which is afforded to all persons who are on the various registers referred to in Section 2 of the Bill.  It confers upon that person, if he wishes to set up on his own account, the right to keep open shop for the sale and dispensing of medical prescriptions and, if he is a registered druggist, the right to sell poisons.  People need not seek to retain that right for themselves; they can have their names removed from the register if they wish and in those circumstances they do not have to pay any fee.  However, if it should happen that they might wish to have their names restored to the register then they would have to pay a restoration fee.  There is no injustice being done if we ask a person who wishes to be put in a privileged position, for which purpose he must be on the register, to pay what is a very moderate fee for that privilege.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I do not see that there is any ground for accepting the amendment.  As Deputy Hogan said in proposing the amendment, this is a free society.  Nobody is coerced to become a member of the Society or to have his name on the Society's register.  It is a question that a person can decide for himself whether it is worth his while to keep his name on the register and for that purpose to pay the necessary fee.  I do not think there is anything more that need be said in that connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When introducing his amendment, Deputy Hogan developed the point of view with regard to his own and the pharmaceutical profession that when a person was entering either of them, he had to <Col N="815" /> have his name on the register and to pay a registration fee.  That registration fee gives him the right to practise. The principle is that if a qualified pharmacist enters his profession, he pays a registration fee on entering.  It is desirable and necessary that every pharmacist must do that but the Minister is taking the matter a point further.  His legislation makes it mandatory on a qualified pharmacist to pay an annual fee and he advances as the reason for doing that that he is protected by the Society and that the Society has to have funds for the purpose of education and carrying out the examinations of the pharmaceutical profession as a whole.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried to draw a parallel between the two professions and he has tried to indicate to the House that there is an excessive onus being placed on the Pharmaceutical Society.  Actually, the same onus is being placed on the Pharmaceutical Society as is placed on the Medical Registration Council.  They are an examining body and they function and finance themselves as such by the fees they collect from the students and also by the fees they collect from the qualified practitioner on registration. But they only ask him to pay the one fee.  They ask him to pay a fee to register as a newly qualified practitioner and ever after that they give him the protection of the profession.  He has to conform to the rules, standards and moral code of the profession and provided he does that no unlicensed person is allowed to set up in opposition against him.</P>
      <P>What the Minister is doing in this connection is perfectly right.  He is bringing in a Bill to create a pharmaceutical profession.  The Minister says that it is not compulsory on a pharmacist to register unless he want to, but if he does not register he cannot keep open shop and cannot practise his profession.  Therfore there is compulsion. As Deputy Hogan said, this is a free society and compulsion should not be placed on any member of a free society.  Deputy Hogan instanced the medical profession.  They have existed for a long time without compulsion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> The amendment simply says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Council may charge a fee in respect of registration and the amount of such fee shall be determined from time to time by the Council with the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan agrees in principle with the Minister's Bill but he maintains that it should not be compulsory on the registered pharmacist to continue to pay that fee throughout his existence.  In his introductory speech the Minister stressed the point that this fee was necessary for the purpose of maintaining the Pharmaceutical Society in funds so that they could carry out the necessary curricula in regard to education.  I do not think that is a good argument.  They are entitled to charge whatever fees they want to charge in reason.  The Minister should consider taking another look at this matter before the Report Stage and see if he could change it.  It would not be a revolutionary change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> Much play has been made by the Minister with the important functions of pharmacy from the point of view of education, qualifying examinations, and so on.  At the moment there are 1,100 registered pharmacists or druggists who pay their four guineas per year for membership of the Pharmaceutical Society.  At the same time, there are 1,500 who have decided, for one reason or another, that the service they receive from that Society is not sufficient to warrant their paying four guineas per year. Some of these people who pay this fee and some of those who do not probably qualified as pharmacists before this State was founded and now we are to say to these 1,500 pharmacists: &ldquo;You must join this Society and pay four guineas, five guineas, 10 guineas or whatever the council of the Pharmaceutical Society may decide subject to the consent of the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are given to understand that the people who make this contribution to the Pharmaceutical Society are very good people who are doing it philanthropically and entirely in the interests of pharmacy and that the other 1,500 <Col N="817" /> are really bad boys.  I have the feeling that this question is not so simple, that one side is not all black and the other side all white.  It is regrettable that these 1,500 are not members of the Pharmaceutical Society.  It is desirable that they should be but it is very important that they should be given free choice in the matter and that the 1,100 should put their house so much in order that they will attract these men to join voluntarily rather than that it should be necessary for the Minister to exert statutory pressure on them to do so.</P>
    <P>The people who are members of the Pharmaceutical Society at the moment are not members entirely for philanthropic reasons.  After all, if you keep open shop, it is nice to have the letters &ldquo;M.P.S.I.&rdquo; over your front door. It is good for business.  It is also an advantage from the point of view of affording you an opportunity of eventually becoming a member of the council of the Pharmaceutical Society. These are not entirely philanthropic or selfless approaches.  It must be remembered that the other 1,500 may be hospital pharmacists, county council dispensary chemists or perhaps on the road as travellers for various manufacturing companies, to whom keeping open shop or being able to write &ldquo;M.P.S.I.&rdquo; after their names is of no interest.  I think you will find that many of the 1,500 are in those categories I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the educational, examinational and qualifying functions of the Pharmaceutical Society have now become so oppressive that it is necessary to introduce a Bill here to compel the recalcitrant 1,500 to contribute.  However, let us see what has actually happened since last October. The new course in pharmacy has begun and that course consists of three years in a university to obtain a B.Sc. in pharmacy.  Having qualified, you do one year in a retail shop in Dublin, down the country or anywhere else. Therefore, that has not cost the Pharmaceutical Society much money. In fact, if it has cost anybody any money, it has cost the general rate-payers money by way of contribution to University College, Dublin.  Then these graduates&mdash;it must be borne in <Col N="818" /> mind that they are graduates now&mdash; have to sit for a simple, nominal examination set up by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society in order to get their title of Member of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland.</P>
    <P>When the Minister speaks about the great educational expenses that are placed upon the council, I submit that from now on that burden, to a great extent, is being taken off them in so far as we, as is happening in other places like London, Liverpool, Manchester and Cardiff, are integrating pharmaceutical education with university education.  Therefore, if there was ever a case to be made for compelling non-members to become members by statutory power, it existed in the past more than in the present.</P>
    <P>On the question of registration, one would get the impression here that it was something phenomenal.  Registering a person who qualifies in pharmacy is very much more elaborate than the simple registration that is carried out when somebody exchanges a block of shares on the stock exchange for which he may pay 5/-</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> The Minister is going down another road entirely.  If, for example, the General Medical Council registers a member&mdash;in my time, it was three guineas; I suppose it is more now&mdash; you just pay that one fee and you never bother any more.  If you are ever unfortunate enough to have your name removed, they do not charge for it and if your name is put back, they do not charge you.  The Minister says this is quite simple, that a man need not ask to have his name on the Pharmaceutical Register, but then he goes on to say that it is necessary for him to have it in order to practise.  In other words, he must pay his annual <Col N="819" /> fee, if he wants to keep open shop. Would it not be straighter and more simple to understand if the Minister said: &ldquo;We shall charge these people who keep open shop up and down the country for a licence and throw the proceeds into the Exchequer just as we charge the publicans&rdquo;?  He does not say that but in effect that is what it amounts to.</P>
      <P>As I have said, the educational functions of the Pharmaceutical Society are being radically curtailed in so far as the universities are taking over that work.  The fundamental purpose of a doctor, as of all the auxiliary professions, is ultimately the investigation and treatment of disease.  Functionally they are all auxiliaries of the medical profession.  I asked the Minister last night if he would not consider the position that obtains in Britain.  There, there is a doctor on the council.  I repeat my plea now.  The presence of a doctor on the council would add prestige and status to the council.  The doctor need not necessarily be a practising doctor.  He could be a lecturer or a professor; he could be a physiologist associated with hospitals, his services in that way being integrated with human physiology.  The Minister's reply was to ask me would I like a pharmacist on the General Medical Council.  There is no analogy really because the medical profession is the only profession that makes contact with patients.  It is the apex of all the auxiliary professions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I asked the Minister a question last night and the Minister's reply to me was to ask me if I would like a pharmacist on the General Medical Council.  I maintain that a Pharmacist is in the same position as a biochemist or a physicist.  These are professions in their own right; they are auxiliary to the fundamental functioning of doctoring, which is the investigation and treatment of disease. In that functional aspect, they are subsidiary.  To put a physicist, a biochemist, a radiographer, or a pharmacist on the General Medical Council would be getting the tail to wag the dog.  That is my reply to the Minister's question.</P>
      <P>I submit that this proposal to charge an annual fee to pharmacists, past and present, is completely unjust unless pharmacists are voluntarily prepared to pay an annual fee.  Eleven hundred do so at the moment.  If these 1,100 were circulated and asked if they wanted pressure put by law on the remaining 1,500 to make an annual contribution, I think most of them would say they would not like to do that.  They would see the unfairness of it.  They would like the remaining 1,500 to come in, but they would not like to force them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They feel exactly as I do in the matter of associations.  If, tomorrow morning, I went to the Minister and told him that the Irish Medical Association has done a great deal of good work educationally and materially for the medical profession and there were some doctors who had not become members of the Association, I do not think the Minister would introduce a Bill here to compel these recalcitrants to join.  To carry the analogy a little further, if <Col N="821" /> the bricklayers' association, if there is such an association, told the Minister there were 500 members in their association and 600 who refused to join&mdash;&mdash;</P>

At the moment he can voluntarily become a member of the association and he can withdraw <Col N="822" /> from membership any time he likes. All he pays is the initial registration fee.  Under this Bill, he will have to pay a fee annually.  That is coercion. If he does not pay, he cannot practise. Fifteen hundred members have not chosen to pay under the existing system.  Are they now to be compelled &mdash;men of 60 and 65 years&mdash;for the first time in their lives to pay an annual fee to an association they do not want and from which they did not believe they were getting sufficient value to make it worth their while to join ?</P>
      <P>The Minister is a recruiting sergeant, in effect, for the Pharmacy Council and the Pharmacy Association.  I submit he is interfering with the fundamental right of free association.  That is a constitutional right.  I should like to see these 1,500 people in the society, but the choice should be a voluntary one.  I have worked with them all my life.  No doctor can say anything but the best in regard of them.  Relationships are excellent.  But there is a principle involved here, the right of free association.  That is my approach in relation to any association or trade union.  The right of free association is precious.  It is something we should be determined to defend and fight for.</P>

      <P>Obviously, Deputy Hogan is suffering from some confusion of mind.  We have heard membership of the society, registration, and retention, all used as if they mean the same thing.  They differ so much that in fact there are specific subsections in this section dealing with membership of the Society, entrance with registration and with retention. Deputy Hogan did not seem to know that the distinction was drawn.  He was swaying off in one direction after membership, off in another direction after registration and then going backwards on retention.  But the thing is clear and simple.  No qualified pharmacist is compelled to be a member of the Pharmaceutical Society.  He has the entire option as to whether he will join or will not join.  I hope that is clear to Deputy Hogan.  It does not seem to have penetrated his mind.</P>

      <P>Opticians, both ophthalmic and dispensing, have to pay a retention fee.  It amounts to seven guineas for ophthalmic opticians for the first four years and five guineas for dispensing opticians.  After five years, the fee goes up to ten guineas for ophthalmic opticians and seven guineas for dispensing opticians.  That Act was passed quite recently in 1956, and I think it has set a very good precedent.  Since the Solicitors Act, 1954, solicitors must pay to the Incorporated Law Society for a certificate of practice, which is equivalent to retention on the register, a fee of £6 per year.  A Dublin solicitor must pay a fee of £9 a year.  That was done under the 1954 Act following the principle laid down in the Dental Act of 1926.</P>
      <P>A patent agent must pay an annual fee in order to retain his name on the register.  There is nothing exceptional in this, no attempt to victimise any person by giving the council the right to charge fees for the retention of names on the register.  There is only a very slight analogy between what is being done by the Medical Registration Council and the Pharmaceutical Council.  The Medical Registration Council is not an examining body.  It does not conduct courses of study as does the Pharmaceutical Society.  It provides no educational facilities whatsoever and therefore the analogy between the fee a medical man pays and that which it is now proposed to empower the Pharmaceutical Council to charge for keeping a register which inures to the benefit of the person whose name is on the register, is very slight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing the Deputy says suggests that he is under complete misapprehension. It is only during the first year of study that a person who is to become a pharmacist does his course solely in University College, Dublin.  In the second and third years, his courses will be divided between the two&mdash;he will follow some subjects in the Pharmaceutical College and the others in University College, Dublin.  In recognition of the fact that the Society is providing these courses of study, they get part of the fees and the other part is paid to University <Col N="826" /> College, Dublin, by the students, but those fees paid to the Society do not cover the cost to the Society of providing the special facilities.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Deputy seems to be completely misinformed about the real position that will arise.  In all these circumstances, it would be unjust to expect the Pharmaceutical Council to keep these registers and to ensure that they are a good record without, at the same time, being able to charge a small fee to pharmacists for the privilege of being on the register and conferring upon the person concerned the right to keep open shop.  He is not compelled to keep open shop.  He can find employment elsewhere, if that be his bent &mdash;he can find employment in teaching, in industrial pharmacy&mdash;and if he finds a position within any of these other categories he is not bound to pay any fee, but, being in these branches of the profession, if he wishes to have his name retained on the register, he must pay a fee and that is only just.</P>

      <P>The confusion which the Deputy opposite is suggesting exists stems from a confusion of qualification.  I do not want to repeat what the Minister has said but there is, first of all, this question of qualification&mdash;passing the examinations.  The second thing is registration and the third thing is membership of the Society.  All of these matters must be considered as distinct.  In respect to qualification, the first necessary thing is to do the courses and pass the examinations and I presume anybody who successfully passes the examinations will receive from the examining body&mdash;the fact that in this case it is the Pharmaceutical Society does not matter&mdash;a document certifying he has done so.</P>
      <P>As far as that person is concerned, there are three possibilities open to him.  First of all, he may not wish to pursue the profession at all&mdash;he may merely regard it as an academic qualification.  In that case that person need not do anything more.  Secondly, there is the case of the person who may wish to practise.  He must be registered.  Lastly, there is the voluntary question as to whether he will become a member of the Society or not.  Though I want to preserve what the Minister has said with regard to the analogy with the doctors, and while I agree absolutely with the Minister, I think there is a certain analogy we can make.</P>
      <P>A doctor qualifies in either one of the special colleges like the College of Surgeons, or in the university, and he receives a medical degree.  Take the university case.  It is merely an academic degree and carries no right to practise.  A graduate may, for instance, become a research worker and may not be concerned with practice.  He may take the M.B., B.Ch. and B.A.O. but may wish to specialise as an anatomist or a physiologist and may not be concerned with registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exactly the same may apply to pharmacists.  It may be the case of an organic chemist who may, because <Col N="828" /> he wishes to do special research, have no further interest in practice in the sense of keeping open shop.  That person is not touched by this legislation, so any arguments suggesting there is any compulsion in that category are out.  Then comes the question of registration and that is what is involved in this section.  In order to capture the benefits of this Bill in respect to keeping open shop, pharmacists must register.  As a practising pharmacist a person will probably find it an advantage to be so registered.  It is only necessary for him to register if he is keeping open shop.  In other words, a person might be practising pharmacy in an industrial firm but need not register and accordingly the Bill will not touch him.  The whole crux is whether an annual fee is to be charged for remaining on the register or not.  That is all that is involved here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Keeping his union card clear, so to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That is an arguable thing.  There are the fees charged in the cases of doctors and barristers.  A doctor, on being registered, or a barrister, on being called to the Bar, is thereafter entitled to practise. In the case of a barrister, for instance, although he remains competent to practise at any time, actually, membership of the Law Society is generally restricted to those who are in fact practising, but that is beside the point.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there are the cases quoted by the Minister and the case of solicitors.  It seems to me that, on balance, having admitted that and having tried to see the Deputy's point of view, by these admissions, there is a strong case to be made for a reasonable annual fee, for retention on the register in this case.  Remember, each individual has his own individual certificate, I take it, to prove that he is competent.  Therefore, it does not deprive him of his competency in regard to anything that is not concerned with the direct practice of pharmacy through the keeping of an open shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be very reasonable <Col N="829" /> to make that provision for an annual registration fee, provided it is reasonable.  This Society is keeping the register; membership continues to be voluntary, and that is vital, just the same as membership of the Bar Library continues to be voluntary. Such bodies give the members of the profession a service they could not otherwise have.  I am not a pharmacist, nor have I even as close association with the profession as the Deputy has, but it seems to me that in providing for the courses, in protecting the rights, in being the spokesman for the professional body of pharmacists, in the work it does generally for the profession, that body is providing a great service for the profession of pharmacists.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable, then, to provide that those who are making a living and a profit out of that profession, particularly through the keeping of open shop, should be asked to contribute in a small way, for example, to the cost of maintaining a register for their benefit and protection. After all, the register fulfils two functions.  It is for the benefit of the practitioner who is registered in the first case.  It is also for his protection in that, by the adequate keeping of that register, the administration connected with it, and a society to back it, he has a guarantee that there will be no improper or unfair competition against him in the carrying out of his profession.  For these reasons, although I have admitted the case to the contrary, I think it is probably desirable in this case to allow the Minister's section, particularly subsection (3) to stand.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's amendment, I would point out that the actual substitution he suggests does not change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This amendment refers to the same problem as was dealt with in the last amendment but approaches it in a slightly different light.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may correct me if my recollection is wrong.  It is that there are roughly 2,900 people on the various registers now maintained by the Pharmaceutical Society.  There are, in fact, roughly 1,500 pharmacies in the country of one kind or another and there are roughly 1,100 members of the Pharmaceutical Society.  That means, if these figures are remotely accurate, that of those at the moment in one way or another on the register maintained, roughly 50 per cent. keep open shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are any number of pharmacists of one kind or another who engage in activities related to pharmacy which have nothing whatsoever to do with the keeping of a chemist's shop.  There are hospital pharmacists, there are trade representatives of one kind or another whose duty and concern it is to interest <Col N="831" /> medical practitioners in particular lines of drugs and proprietary medicines of one kind or another.  All these different groups not concerned with the keeping of open shop represent roughly half those who call themselves pharmacists today.  It does appear to me unreasonable that power should be taken in this Bill to make a mandatory charge on all these people &mdash;every one of them including those who never have kept and never intend to keep open shop&mdash;in order to have their names retained on the register. That is going too far.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to confine the retention fee for registration to those who keep open shop or who, in fact, desire to keep open shop. By all means let them, if that is the view, pay an annual retention fee but differentiate in relation to other pharmacists who are not concerned at all with engaging in the trade of selling, of keeping a shop, of filling prescriptions, of selling poisons and things of that kind.  It would appear to me reasonable that some difference should be made.</P>
    <P>I suggest here that the annual retention fee should not be charged to those who do not keep open shop. If it is felt that that is unreasonable, at least quite a different fee should be charged to those who do not keep an open shop.  Undoubtedly a difference should be made.  It appears entirely unreasonable that the power set out in the Bill should be sought to inflict on people a payment which they have never had to make up to this.</P>
    <P>Most of the chemists who do not keep open shop are not concerned with the activities of the Pharmaceutical Society.  They do not intend to be members: they are not members.  They are not concerned with keeping shop. They never have been.  They are operating in an entirely different way and they should not be interfered with in the way sought in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I cannot see the point of Deputy O'Higgins's amendment. He said that people who did not keep open shop were not concerned with the working of the Pharmaceutical Society.  Surely they are very much concerned?  Surely they are concerned to the same extent and in the same way as the people who do keep open shop?  I cannot see the point of the differentiation.  After all, this amendment is very much on the same lines as the previous amendment, except that it is more restrictive.  The Pharmaceutical Society have to keep registers, irrespective of what branch of pharmacy the licentiate is in.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has said, less than 50 per cent., roughly, keep open shop.  It is a well-known fact that a number of people who keep open shop are not in as lucrative a position, if you like to put it that way, as people in other branches of pharmacy, manufacturers, wholesalers, public appointments, and so on.  Therefore, there should not be any difference from the point of view of the retention of the fee.  I know of cases where people left retail pharmacy and went to call on doctors, as Deputy O'Higgins said, for perhaps more money or a better living.  The Society has the same responsibility for those people as it has for people who keep open shop. Therefore, why not let them be on an equal footing in the interests of equity?</P>

      <P>The argument in the amendment is that those who keep open shop should pay an annual fee and those who do not keep open shop should not pay an annual fee.  Deputy Brady's argument is that those who do not keep open shop are <Col N="833" /> pharmacists and have paid their registration fees.  To find an analogy, one must refer to the medical profession, which is a twin profession. What happens in the medical profession is that they pay a registration fee on qualifying and by that fee they are protected by the society.  If Deputy O'Higgins's amendment is accepted, the pharmacists will pay a registration fee when they are duly qualified pharmacists, and as such, will get protection in the same way as the medical profession.  If they continue to pay that fee, they are, in effect, helping to support those who are keeping open shop.  Those who are keeping open shop are earning considerable revenue. I do not see why they should be coerced into paying this fee annually. If I were a pharmacist and not keeping open shop and I had to pay an annual fee, I would feel I was supporting those who were.  I would say that I had paid my fee on qualifying and that I was entitled to protection. I think that is a perfectly reasonable argument which brings it back to the question of a free society.</P>

      <P>Deputy Esmonde seems to think that the person who is employed by a drug manufacturer or a medical wholesaler is in some way better off than anyone who keeps open shop because his whole argument was that the person who was keeping open shop was enjoying all the benefits of the practice of pharmacy, and that the person who was engaged in the manufacture of drugs and medicines or the person engaged in the wholesale sale of drugs and medicines, was not benefiting at all.  If the Deputy would address himself to the question of what would be the position of the manufacturer and the wholesaler if no one kept open shop, he would realise that of course they all derive their livelihood from the fact that the man who keeps open shop provides an outlet for all the things they make and have to sell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that Deputy O'Higgins has produced an excellent argument for the enforcement of the retention fees upon all those who wish to have their names on the register. The figure of 50 per cent, is not quite accurate, but let us say that about 50 per cent. of the members of the profession are in practice as pharmacists and the other 50 per cent. do not bother to practice here at all.  The latest figures that we have, however, show that there are 2,643 on the register, and of those, 1,118 are members of the Society and pay a fee in order to maintain the register.  Of those 2,643, 1,525 are not members of the Society and do not pay anything, but we cannot assume from that that there are 1,525 persons in this country who are qualified as pharmacists and are not members of the Society.</P>
      <P>The position is rather different.  Of these 1,525 persons, about 600 to 700 are engaged here in the actual practice of pharmacy.  They are employed in hospital and dispensary pharmacies, in the business of manufacturing and wholesale pharmacy and in the teaching of pharmacy.  There are qualified pharmacists who are not practising, for example, married women who are not practising and people who may have retired into some other business. In addition, there are some more than 800 persons whose names are on the register but who have emigrated or are in practice in Northern Ireland, or have left pharmacy altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that this register as it exists at the present time is not a clean register.  It is stuffed with the names of persons more than 25 per cent. of whom have left the country and a great number of whom have ceased to practice, are no longer engaged in the business of pharmacy because, for example, they are married. Even from the point of view of having that register cleaned up it is very desirable that some retention fee should be charged.  That is the reason why it is proposed to charge retention <Col N="835" /> fees, so that people would make up their minds as to whether they want to continue to hold themselves out as engaged in the practice of pharmacy. I think the Deputy should not press the amendment and that he should give the Society power to charge retention fees and that different fees for retention would be charged to different persons.</P>
    <P>A person who keeps open shop or who is employed in an open shop or who manages an open shop and who would therefore be engaged in the direct sale of medicines to the public probably might be charged a somewhat higher fee than those not so engaged in that practice but I think it is essential that the Society be given power to charge a retention fee if only for the purpose of keeping the register clean and removing from it what, in fact, are fictitious names.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, the Minister attaches some importance to that.  I should have thought that the pharmacist who got married and who was no longer going to practise pharmacy in any shape or form might reasonably be understood to wish still to call herself a pharmacist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>She cannot do that.  She cannot, under Section 3, describe herself in any way as being a pharmacist unless she is on the register and she can only be on the register by the payment of a retention fee.  I do not think any great harm would be done even if the register were cluttered up with the names of a whole lot of pharmacists, who, in fact, were not keeping open shop.  I do not see any difficulty about that. A fee is paid for registration.  Nobody suggests that the initial fee should not <Col N="836" /> be paid but I do not see why there should be so much concern that every year the register should be examined and kept clear by charging a further fee for retention.</P>
      <P>I note from what the Minister has said that there is some slight ray of hope.  The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;some retention fee&rdquo;.  If he used it with the emphasis on the &ldquo;some&rdquo; perhaps the retention fee may be a formality.  If it is a nominal fee to ensure that there is a live register, much of my objection would be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be sufficient to ensure that the register is a live one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that it is intended for that purpose and not as revenue for the purposes of the State, much of my objection would disappear.  Perhaps the Minister might consider that aspect of the case between now and Report Stage.  The Minister said he saw some merit in the suggestion that the retention fee to be charged to persons keeping open shop should be a higher fee.  If there is to be a retention fee it does appear reasonable that there should be a differentiation between the person who is keeping open shop and the person who never intends to keep open shop.</P>
      <P>Part of the machinery of this Bill and the system of inspectors that will be needed under it are designed to ensure that only qualified persons are allowed to keep open shop and that the public are not deluded into dealing with an unqualified person.  All that expensive machinery is designed under the Acts to deal with people keeping open shop.  The ordinary pharmacist who has nothing to do with keeping open shop will not begrudge the benefits thus conferred on the person keeping open shop but he does not get any benefit from it himself.  If there is to be a differentiation made there is a strong case to have a higher retention fee for the person who keeps open shop than for the person who does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would keep these two points in mind, I would withdraw the amendment at this stage, reserving the right to raise it again on Report <Col N="837" /> Stage.  It does appear to me that some amendment would be required to the section as it stands or possibly not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,227,080 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other Services administered by that Office, and for payment of Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for my Department amounts to £12,905,080, the gross Estimate being reduced by appropriations-in-aid totalling £4,353,571.  As shown in the Estimate volume, that is an increase of £1,746,580 over 1961/62. An additional provision of £460,000 for my Department in February last in the global Vote for Increases in Remuneration has, however, to be taken into account also, and the actual net increase is, therefore, £1,286,580. As increases in the grants-in-aid to Radio Éireann, made up largely of increased licence fee revenue for transfer to the Authority, amount to £238,600, the increase in the net provision for the services directly provided by my Department is £1,047,980.  This is attributable mainly to increased staff costs and to the continuing expansion of the telephone service.</P>
      <P>The following subheads contain substantial variations:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;the Estimate Volume shows an increase of approximately £1,245,000, but to this year's provision must be added the additional £460,000 granted, since the Volume was prepared, to meet increases in remuneration in 1961/62.  The actual increase is, therefore, £785,000, and is due mainly to having to meet the cost for a whole year of the increases in <Col N="840" /> remuneration.  In addition, provision has been made for additional engineering workmen for the expanded construction programme, and for maintenance requirements which grow as the system expands, and for additional telephonists.</P>
    <P>Under Subhead C&mdash;Accommodation and Building Charges&mdash;there is an increase of £50,000 which is mainly due to the requirements of telephone development: £40,000 being for the acquisition of sites and buildings and £7,000 for rent for storage of poles.</P>
    <P>In subhead F&mdash;Engineering Stores and Equipment&mdash;the major portion of the increase of £979,000 is to meet the requirements of the expanded telephone construction programme both for the direct purchase of stores and for payments to contractors.  As in the case of the telephone buildings provided for in the previous subhead, expenditure on telephone construction is treated as a capital charge and recovered from Telephone Capital funds by way of appropriations-in-aid. Incidentally, Deputies will probably have noticed that expenditure on equipment for civil aviation and meteorological wireless services has been transferred to the Vote for Transport and Power, where it is fitted into the general picture of airports expenditure.</P>
    <P>In subhead G&mdash;Telephone Capital Repayments&mdash;the increase of practically £177,000 in the annuities which repay to the Central Fund the capital advanced for the development of the telephone service is a consequence of continuing heavy investment.</P>
    <P>Subhead K.1&mdash;Grant Equivalent to Net Receipts from Broadcasting Licence Fees (Grant-In-Aid)&mdash;provides a grant-in-aid for the transfer to Radio Éireann the net revenue from television and sound receiving licence fees.  The increase of £222,000 is to provide for the yield from a larger number of television licence fees and from the application of the increased sound licence fee over a whole year.</P>
    <P>In subhead T&mdash;Appropriations-In-Aid&mdash;the increase of slightly over a million pounds is almost entirely due to an increase of £1,000,000 in the amount <Col N="841" /> to be recovered from Telephone Capital funds in respect of the telephone development programme.</P>
    <P>In comparison with the previous year, combined letter and parcel postings rose by about 16 million or 5 per cent.  Christmas traffic set a record.  The railway strike at Cork and other southern stations seriously dislocated postal services in November and early December.  Parcel post had to be partially curtailed but the letter services were maintained, though with difficulty, by means of the Department's own transport.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this time last year that the new postal address numbering scheme for Dublin had got off to an encouraging start.  I am glad to say that it has continued to make good progress. By now 46 per cent of mail posted in Dublin for delivery there bears the district number and the overall figure for local, domestic and foreign mail delivered there is 42 per cent.  The percentage is rising steadily from month to month, fresh publicity appeals are planned and, judging from the generous initial response given by the public, the success of the numbering scheme seems assured.  It is important that it should succeed, for use of the appropriate district number simplifies sorting and reduces the risk of delay to mail.</P>
    <P>Through its membership of the Universal Postal Union, the Department keeps itself informed of experiments and developments in the mechanisation of mail handling undertaken by other postal administrations; normally it is not in a position to conduct independent research in this field.</P>
    <P>I am, however, glad to be able to mention one modest achievement of our own.  A machine for date stamping packets was invented by a member of the engineering staff and an experimental model was produced in the Department's own factory.  The machine is being tried out, under actual working conditions, in the Dublin letter office and, so far, its performance has been very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On the foreign side, the outward traffic, particularly parcels, continued to show a healthy trend.  Air mail <Col N="842" /> parcels increased by 32 per cent, and the total for both air and surface parcels went up by 19 per cent.</P>
    <P>Two special postage stamps were issued in 1961 to commemorate the Patrician Year and the 25th Anniversary of the founding of Aer Lingus. This year, in addition to the one in honour of John O'Donovan and Eugene O'Curry, we will join with other members of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations in the issue, in September, of a special stamp of a common design sponsored by that body.</P>
    <P>Telegraph and telex services followed the pattern of recent years. The estimated total number of telegrams handled during the year ending 31st March, 1962, is approximately 1,764,000 which is a drop of one per cent, on the number for the previous year.</P>
    <P>The telex service, which is now over six years old, continues to develop. The number of subscribers is now 157 compared with 140 last year and the number of messages is increasing steadily; last year there were well over 300,000 telex messages.  The conversion of the system to automatic working, which I referred to last year, is expected to be completed about mid-1963.  This will make the service even more attractive for subscribers as they will be able to dial direct any other telex subscribers in these islands and also subscribers in many Continental countries.  Under the automatic system, sub-exchanges will be set up at Cork and Shannon Airport and eventually, perhaps, at other places depending on developments.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the loss on the telegraph service will amount to about £135,000 during 1961/62 or approximately the same as for the previous three years.  Costs have, however, increased as a result of recent pay awards and an increase in the loss for the coming year is inevitable.</P>
    <P>The telephone service continued to grow in 1961.  Call traffic increased by 9 per cent. approximately to 158.5 million, comprising some 144 million local and 14.5 million trunk calls.</P>
    <P>The trunk mileage added to the <Col N="843" /> system was 18,400 miles, an increase of over 50 per cent. on the figure for 1960.  The additional circuits were provided mostly in underground and aerial cables and in the form of microwave radio circuits.</P>
    <P>The number of subscribers' exchange lines provided was 14,500 approximately as compared with 15,300 in the previous year; one large and 11 small automatic exchanges were opened; the equipment at 163 exchanges was extended and 80 extra telephone kiosks were provided.</P>
    <P>An important development during the year was the extension of subscriber trunk dialling to the major automatic exchanges.  All subscribers, apart from those with coin box installations, in the Athlone, Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, Limerick, Mullingar, Naas, Sligo and Waterford automatic areas comprising approximately 65 per cent. of the total number, can now dial calls to one another. Similar facilities will be provided at most of the other automatic exchanges within the next two years or so and will normally be incorporated from the start in all new automatic exchanges.</P>
    <P>The equipment for the conversion of some 60 exchanges to automatic working in the Balbriggan, Ballyshannon, Croom, Curragh Camp, Kildare, Kinsale, Midleton, New Ross Roscommon and Tuam areas has been delivered and the work of installation will now be carried out as rapidly as possible.  Contracts have been placed for automatic equipment for some 20 other areas comprising about 90 exchanges including An Uaimh, Arklow, Athy, Bandon, Mallow, Portlaoise, Shannon Airport, Tullamore and Wicklow. Completion of some of these schemes may, however, take up to three years.</P>
    <P>During the year trunk circuits were provided on radio links between Athlone and Galway and between Sligo and Donegal.  A microwave circuit will shortly be brought into service between Dublin and Arklow.  Completion of the microwave link between Waterford, Wexford and Enniscorthy has, unfortunately, been delayed and is now <Col N="844" /> expected early next year.  A contract has recently been placed for a microwave system between Tralee and Limerick as part of a major scheme to link Killarney, Tralee, Listowel and a number of places in County Limerick with the main cable network at Limerick.  Another contract covers the provision of a microwave link between Limerick and Athlone.  A new trunk cable from Cork to Fermoy is now in service; others in the Midleton and Mallow areas have been completed and others elsewhere are either in progress or in various preparatory stages.  These include Cork and Macroom, Waterford and Clonmel&mdash;due for completion this year&mdash;and links between Carlow and Portlaoise, Letterkenny and Lifford, Letterkenny and the Inishowen Peninsula which are due to be started this year.  In addition, substantial numbers of extra circuits will be provided by means of carrier equipment on open wire routes and by fitting additional equipment on the coaxial cables; aerial cabling will be erected on over 50 routes and some hundreds of miles of open wire will be provided on various minor routes.</P>
    <P>Forty-eight additional circuits were provided to Great Britain via Belfast during 1961 and it is hoped to provide a similar number early next year.  The question of providing additional direct circuits on a large scale&mdash;either by another submarine cable or a high capacity microwave link&mdash;is still being considered.</P>
    <P>The special television microwave link between Kippure and the studios at Montrose was also provided for Radio Éireann by my Department; we expect to complete the other links required to feed programmes to the four provincial transmitters later in the year.</P>
    <P>I mentioned last year that some reduction in the rate of connection of new telephones and a consequential increase in the waiting list could hardly be avoided because of the need to devote a greater proportion of our resources to trunk and exchange development.  In the event, as I have indicated above, the number of new connections was lower and the mileage of additional trunk circuits substantially higher last year than in 1960.  The <Col N="845" /> rate of connection of new subscribers was also affected by shortages of underground plant in cities and towns and of subscribers' equipment at some exchanges.  It was also adversely affected by storm damage in the latter months of the year.</P>
    <P>The waiting list has now risen to 10,000 and, while I would like to announce that it will not increase further, I am afraid we must, in the interests of subscribers generally, continue for some time to concentrate our efforts on improvement of the trunk and exchange services.  This is necessary because delays and difficulties in connecting calls in the conditions in which the service is now operated can have a kind of snowball effect and throw unmanageable loads on exchanges&mdash;automatic as well as manual. This increases the delay in answering subsequent callers and produces poor service generally.  Some exchanges experienced such conditions during peak traffic periods last year.</P>
    <P>The fact is, of course, that the telephone service is a highly integrated one and the intake of new subscribers cannot with safety be greatly increased without a corresponding expansion in the capacity of the system as a whole. Ideally, the latter should come first in anticipation of demand.  In recent years the connection rate has increased much faster than it has been possible to expand the trunk and exchange systems, particularly as we have had a great volume of arrears to be made good not only in local cabling schemes but in the form of more expensive schemes which were deferred in the past to conserve capital and are now urgent. The trouble is to get more than a few such schemes started at the same time. I have already referred to some such schemes which are now under way; others are in various stages of planning.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the implementation of major schemes involves the acquisition of sites, the erection of new buildings etc., and, in general, is a lengthy process.  There are long delays too in getting delivery of most kinds of telecommunication equipment owing to expansion of world demand in this field.  I hope, however, that sufficient <Col N="846" /> progress will have been made in providing additional trunk and exchange equipment by the end of this year to enable the rate of connecting new telephones to be stepped up.  In the meantime we will, of course, continue to meet applications for telephones in the priority categories and a substantial part of ordinary demand.</P>
    <P>In the light of what I have said, Deputies will understand that the capital requirements of the telephone service are heavy and are likely to become heavier.  I have persuaded the Minister for Finance to let me have a capital provision of £3.5 million for 1962/63 as compared with £2.5 million for 1961-62 and an average of well under £2 million in previous years. About half the £3.5 million is intended for trunk and exchange schemes and the other half for subscribers' and renters' circuits, subscribers' underground plant, etc.</P>
    <P>Business in the Post Office Savings Bank continues to increase.  At the 31st December, 1961, the total balance, including interest, due to depositors was approximately £91.5 millions as compared with £86.7 millions at the end of the previous year.</P>
    <P>Deposits during the year amounted to £19.2 millions, and withdrawals, to £16.6 millions, representing increases of slightly over one million pounds, and over half a million pounds, respectively, compared with the preceding year. About £1.5 millions of the withdrawals were for re-investment in Exchequer Stock, Savings Certificates or Prize Bonds.</P>
    <P>Deposits and withdrawals by the Trustee Savings Banks during the year amounted to approximately £1.34 millions and £.67 millions respectively and were roughly the same as in the preceding year.  The total amount, including interest, to the credit of the Trustee Banks at the end of the year was £16 millions, an increase of rather more than a million pounds.</P>
    <P>The mechanisation of Savings Bank headquarters accounting was successfully completed during the year.  In addition to improving the service to depositors, the change-over has produced <Col N="847" /> savings, allowing for cost of the equipment, of about £50,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Sales of Savings Certificates for 1961 amounted to £3.5 millions and repayments, including interest, to £2.48 millions&mdash;a slight increase in each case over the previous year.  The net accretion for the year was about £1 million. Approximately £150,000 of the repayments were re-investment in Exchequer Stock or Prize Bonds.</P>
    <P>Post Offices throughout the country continued to co-operate in the issue of Prize Bonds and approximately £8 millions of the £26 millions of Prize Bonds issued to date were collected through Post Offices.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity of saying that I believe that the continuing increase in savings, with all that means both for individuals and the community, is due to a considerable extent to the publicity and organising work done by the Savings Committee. The members deserve our best thanks for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Department's remittance services continued to be widely used for the transfer of funds.  The total value of money orders and postal orders issued in 1961 was £22.6 millions, an increase of about half a million pounds over the preceding year.  The number of orders issued was 10.3 millions, a reduction of over 100,000 on the previous year, and accordingly, the average value of both money orders and postal orders increased. This development is a welcome one from the Department's point of view since it tends to reduce handling charges, and obviously it also meets the requirements of the public.  It arises, at least in part, from the greater use of the higher value money orders and postal orders introduced two years ago.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare and related payments totalled £29.5 millions, an increase of over £2.5 millions on the preceding year.</P>
    <P>During 1961, seven new automatic telephone exchange buildings and one new automanual exchange building were erected.  A new public office was <Col N="848" /> provided at Shannon Airport and improvements were made to Gorey post office and to the public office at Mallow.  Work was under way on the building of a new post office at Wicklow, on the erection of six other automatic exchange buildings, and on major improvements to Carrick-on-Shannon, Ennis, Killarney and Wexford post offices.</P>
    <P>This year work has already started on one new automatic exchange building and on a major scheme of improvements at Sligo post office.  It is expected that within a few months work will commence on new post office buildings at Ballinasloe and Youghal and on a further eight telephone exchanges.  Other major projects which are also expected to start this year are a new trunk exchange for Dublin, a new district sorting office at Finglas, and improvements at Limerick post office.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposed new central sorting office for Dublin a contract for the structural steel-work has been placed and tenders have been invited for site clearance and foundation works.  It is expected that the foundation and steel erection work will have been completed and the main building work started by the end of the year 1962-63.</P>
    <P>The number of staff provided for in the Estimate is 17,066 an increase of 487 over last year's figure.  The bulk of this additional staff comprises engineering workmen and telephone operating force required to cater for the continuing growth and expansion of the telephone system.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the provision for salaries and wages shows an increase of £1,244,700 as compared with last year.  Roughly £1,100,000 of this is attributable to the pay increases.  The vast majority of post office staff come within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Civil Service and claims on behalf of all the Departmental grades within the scheme were dealt with during the year.  I am happy to say that the majority of the claims, representing over 90 per cent of the staff, were settled by agreement.</P>
    <P>During the past year, too, claims for reductions in weekly hours of work <Col N="849" /> were conceded for a number of grades, principally engineering workmen, post office clerks and telephonists and these reductions were applied as far as possible towards giving the staff concerned a half-day weekly or a day-off per fortnight.  It is, however, necessary to recruit additional staff to cater for the reduced output resulting from the shorter working week and approximately 60 of the 487 additional staff mentioned earlier are attributable to this.</P>
    <P>The Department is keenly conscious of the need to keep its costs as low as possible by good organisational practices. Methods, techniques and staffing in every branch of its activities are subject to continuous review.  The Department pioneered Organisations and Methods&mdash;O. &amp; M. as it is called &mdash;in the Civil Service and having proved its value, applied it all through its clerical operational and technical work.  To take some instances: the Accountant's Branch present staff of 694 is 35 heads fewer than in 1948 although in the interval the number of telephone accounts has trebled, and there has been a big increase in Savings Bank work and in the scale of the Department's activities.  This impressive rise in productivity has been achieved by mechanisation and by streamlining accounting.</P>
    <P>The telegraph service has been completely reorganised&mdash;morse has been eliminated and replaced by combined telephone-teleprinter transmission of messages.  This reorganisation, together with the fall in traffic, has reduced the staff employed on telegraphs by nearly 500 heads.  Since 1948 the total number of telephones has been nearly trebled and the number of new lines provided each year has increased by almost 150 per cent.  The total number of engineering staff, on the other hand, has increased by only 83 per cent.</P>
    <P>On the postal side, sorting office fittings have been modernised, mail circulation arrangements revised and mechanical aids installed wherever they would be economic; the entire rural services have been reorganised, a twelve year task which has given a better all round standard <Col N="850" /> of service and a six-day frequency of service throughout the mainland. The postman force is actually less now than it was in 1948 although (1) the volume of mail delivered is 26 per cent. greater (2) a 6-day frequency of delivery is afforded on 1,100 posts which in 1948 operated on three, four or five days a week only and (3) the sprawling growth of Dublin and housing development in some of the major provincial cities have significantly added to the distance to be travelled by postmen.</P>
    <P>It can truly be claimed that the Post Office has made notable progress in attaining greater productivity.  To all grades of the staff, from the lowest to the highest, I express my thanks for their efficient and zealous service throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The pay increases and reductions in working hours I have been talking about have had a very significant effect on the Department's financial position.  The addition of over a million pounds a year to the wages bill is by far the largest increase in the Department's history.  It cannot be offset by the normal growth in traffic which can be handled without a proportionate increase in staff or by any foreseeable improvement in organisation or in techniques.  Neither can the situation be met by reducing services or facilities available at Post offices &mdash;these are at the lowest reasonable level already.  So money must be found to meet the increased costs.  And it can be found only by increasing charges or by a subvention from the taxpayer.  I have chosen to obtain it in the first of these ways&mdash;the choice which any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would, I think, make.</P>
    <P>The Department is a quasi-commercial organisation rendering services to its customers in return for payment, and while it must carry some uneconomic services for social reasons, such as the telegraph service at present, it should in the sum of its activities and taking one year with another, earn sufficient to pay its way.</P>
    <P>I may perhaps say that over its whole life so far and over the past ten years, it has just fallen short of achieving <Col N="851" /> that.  As Deputies can see from Appendix E on page 260 of the Estimates volume which shows the trading results of the Department on a commercial account basis, the Department has earned a small surplus in each of the past five years.  In 1960/61, the last completed year, the surplus of £368,000, represented a margin of about four per cent. on the Department's expenditure.  The surpluses in the past five years were quite insufficient to wipe out the deficits in the previous five years, and over the ten years period, the loss on the Department's services has amounted to almost £1 million.</P>
    <P>In the current year, the surplus is expected to be of the order of £200,000.  Next year, however, the increase of £1 million in wage costs would produce a deficit of about £360,000, after allowing for the need to make adequate provision for pension liability and telephone plant depreciation.  Accordingly, it was decided to introduce increases in charges, calculated to yield a small surplus of about £300,000.  As expenditure, on a commercial account basis, will run to £11 to £12 million, the margin of surplus proposed is only of the order of 3 per cent.  That is a very small provision against such contingencies as rises in costs, other than staff costs, when the full effect of increased wages in transport and manufacture is felt, or an unforeseen drop in revenue, and will put the Department back into the position it has been in during the last few years.</P>
    <P>The increases decided upon have already been publicised.  As regards the raising of the minimum letter rate to 4d.  I would like to emphasise that no other postal rate is being changed, that it is only the minimum rate which is being increased to 4d. and that letters above the minimum weight will cost no more than before and that finally the new rate will not be out of line with rates in European countries generally.  On the telephone side, the main increase is the raising of subscribers' exchange line rentals by £1 10s. a year.  While this may appear <Col N="852" /> large and unreasonable to persons who will object to increases of any kind, I should like to point out that our exchange line rentals have not been raised since 1953 and that certain reductions were granted in 1959.  Moreover, the increased rentals will still be well below the average annual cost to the Department per line in respect of interest, maintenance and provision for depreciation, which we estimate as being about £14 a year but we have not been getting this return from a large proportion of lines even when call revenue from both local and trunk calls in each case is added to the rental. This is a matter of some importance when one considers that the level of rentals affects the demand for new telephones and indirectly the total demand for capital.</P>
    <P>As has already been announced the new postage rates will operate towards the end of April and the new telephone charges from the beginning of July.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Radio Éireann derives its income from two main sources: from the net proceeds of licence fees, which can be made available only by vote of this House, and from receipts in respect of advertisements, and it is under a statutory obligation so to conduct its affairs that it will become self-supporting as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>My functions regarding the broadcasting and television services are limited to certain matters specified in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960. I have no responsibility for the programmes or for the ordinary day-to-day administration of the services provided by Radio Éireann.  I do not, therefore, propose to report in detail on Radio Éireann's activities during the past year, particularly as Radio Éireann is obliged to furnish annual reports and accounts which must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. There was some unavoidable delay in preparing the first report and accounts for the 10 months ended 31st March, 1961, and they will be presented shortly, but I have been assured that a similar delay will not arise in the presentation of the report and accounts for the year ending 31st March, 1962.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> The commencement of the television service from the Kippure transmitter on New Year's Eve last was by far the most important development during the past year.  This was a very big undertaking and the service is being provided under very great difficulties.  For example, only a portion of the building at Montrose is occupied, staff and resources are scattered over a number of premises, the staff lack experience and have to make do with temporary facilities.  However, these disabilities have been overcome by great enthusiasm and effort from the staff, and the public response has been gratifying.</P>
    <P>With my approval, the Authority fixed the weekly hours for television broadcasting at 42 per week, with permission to go as high as 47 hours per week.  With my approval also, the Authority fixed the total daily time for broadcasting television advertisements at ten per cent. of programme time, subject to a maximum of seven and a half minutes in any one hour. These arrangements will be subject to review from time to time.</P>
    <P>At the moment, over 20 hours per week of the total of about 44 hours devoted to television broadcasting represents home-originated programmes. That is a much higher proportion of home-originated programmes than was originally thought possible and is a considerable achievement for any television service, particularly for the television service of a small country.  Whether the Authority will be able to maintain the present volume of home output is a matter that it will only be possible to decide in the light of experience.  It goes without saying that home-produced programmes cost much more than imported films and recorded programmes.</P>
    <P>There has been considerable interest in the television service as an advertising medium and the initial volume-of advertisements placed with the Authority has been satisfactory.  It is too early yet to make any definite predictions of television income and expenditure for 1962/63 but it is the Authority's objective to provide as good a service as it can, consistent with its obligations and capacity, and <Col N="854" /> to extend the service to the whole country as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Authority has not yet determined in what order the provincial transmitters at Truskmore, Maghera, Mount Leinster and Mullaghanish will be brought into operation.  A lot will depend on such factors as the delivery dates of the necessary equipment, which is on order, and the dates of completion of the northern and southern radio links which will carry the programmes from Kippure to the other transmitters and are being provided on a rental basis by my Department. These links are due to be completed late this year and the Authority hopes that by the end of the year viewers in practically all parts of the country will be able to receive the Telefís Éireann programmes.</P>
    <P>The present transmissions from Kippure are on 405 lines, the standard at present in use in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  As I announced on 18th August last, the Irish Television service will operate on a national standard of 625 lines using 8-megacycle channels with frequency modulated sound and negative picture modulation.  It will be similar to the Western European standard except that it will use a wider vision band and so give an even better picture than the general European system.  There will, however, be dual transmissions from Kippure and Truskmore on 405 and 625 lines.</P>
    <P>This arrangement will be subject to review, but existing and prospective owners of 405 line sets in the areas to be served by the Dublin and Sligo transmitters are assured that 405 line transmitters will not be ceased without many years' notice being given to avoid premature obsolescence of such sets.  Prospective purchasers of 405 line receivers outside the normal service area of the Dublin and Sligo 405 line transmitters should satisfy themselves about the quality of service they will obtain before purchasing receivers which are designed to receive 405 line transmissions only.</P>
    <P>Since 1st January, 1962 holders of television sets require a special licence which costs £4 and covers sound as <Col N="855" /> well as television.  Some viewers were rather slow about taking out licences, and towards the end of February, my Department instituted an intensive drive against holders of unlicensed sets. The drive has been very successful and it is expected that the number of television licences in force will be of the order of 100,000 by 31st March, 1962.</P>
    <P>I said last year that I had urged the Authority to give special attention to the problem of poor reception of the Athlone transmissions in certain parts of the country and that there had been discussions between technical officers of the Authority and of my Department but that no solution had been reached.  During the year, the Authority necessarily gave priority to the establishment and extension of the television service but this particular problem has not been forgotten.  Within the past few months some experimental work has been done on it and a modification of the earth system at Athlone has effected an all round improvement in the coverage of the Athlone transmitter.  This improvement has been most marked in the sector north-east to south-east.  The question of whether the coverage can be further improved in areas where reception is still poor is being studied.</P>
    <P>During the year I consented to the Authority's decision to publish an official programme journal.  The first issue of the journal&mdash;the <i>RTV Guide</i>&mdash; which is a valuable aid to selective listening and viewing appeared on 1st December, 1961.</P>
    <P>When speaking on the Supplementary Estimate in November last I referred to the work of the Interference Advisory Committee which has been established under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960.  I am glad to say that the first set of draft regulations based on the committee's recommendations will shortly be on sale.  The regulations will deal with interference caused by small electric motors&mdash;one of the principal causes of interference. It is the intention that the regulations shall apply not alone to users of electric motors but to manufacturers, assemblers, traders and importers of such <Col N="856" /> motors for sale or hire in the State. During a period of two months interested parties may make representations to my Department suggesting variations of the draft.</P>
    <P>The committee is now studying interference caused by internal combustion engines and by industrial, scientific and medical apparatus.  As it is simply not practicable to avoid all interference, the committee can only recommend steps which will have the effect of bringing interference within tolerable limits.  As I said before, the problem is so extensive that progress will necessarily be slow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I should say I am dealing with this Estimate on behalf of our Party because Deputy Crotty has a cold which makes it impossible for him to use his voice.</P>
      <P>The first comment that I think falls to be made on the introduction of this Estimate is that it is a little Budget of its own, calculated to impose an additional tax on our people of somewhere between £650,000 and £700,000 per annum.  The Minister says he is doing what any other Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would do.  I suppose the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of any Government, in the situation in which the Government find themselves, might do it.  It is certainly a convenient way of raising revenue for the Minister for Finance, without taxes specifically named in the Budget.</P>
      <P>The tax is now to be collected through the postage stamp which is not the exclusive perquisite of the rich in this country because it is the postage stamp that we put on an ordinary letter.  That is to be increased by 33?rd per cent., from 3d to 4d.  The Minister assures us that the stamps of higher denomination are not to be increased. The number of stamps of higher denomination used by the average citizen in this country is very limited.  It is the ordinary people who put a stamp on a letter who will pay 33?rd per cent. more for that facility now than they have ever paid before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> The net result is that they and, I assume, the telephone users&mdash;who will have their rentals increased by £1-10-0 per annum&mdash;between them, will find approximately £700,000 more in order to meet the increased cost of £1,000,000 a year which the Minister speaks of as the sum necessary to meet the arbitration and conciliation award of the employees of the Post Office. It is fair and just that employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should be compensated for the rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>Some day, the Fianna Fáil Party will waken up to the fact that the rise in the cost of living, which has amounted to 19 points in the past four years, will prove a very expensive operation on their part.  How far the taxpayers and the ordinary people who post letters and who have telephones in their houses will be able to bear the increased burdens they are now called upon to meet is anybody's guess.  One thing is certain.  They must abstain from the use of the postal service, if they are not in a position to make a very material contribution to the revenue the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, between them, are resolved to raise in the course of the coming year.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced blandly that the arrears of applications for telephones have now reached the astonishing figure of 10,000.  The telephone service is the most profitable section of the operation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Outside of Bedlam, has anyone ever heard of what the Minister describes as a quasi-commercial enterprise refusing to serve 10,000 customers who are anxious to deal with it repeatedly every day?  I find myself almost wholly unable to understand the mentality which can produce that end result.  I think I know the reasons for it.  The reasons for it are that in our last year of office, we provided £1,627,000 for telephone capital.  When the present Government came into office, they reduced that to £1,200,000.</P>

      <P>An interesting paper was read by a distinguished member of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs on &ldquo;The growth and Development of the Irish Telephone System&rdquo; before the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland&mdash;on 15th December, 1961.  I commend it to anyone interested in a very interesting sidelight on the social history of this country.  It recalls how the telephone system first started in Ireland under private ownership.  It tells how in June, 1892, a Bill was passed in the British House of Commons authorising the expenditure of up to £1 million of which £459,000 was to pay for the company's trunk system.  The Department took over the trunk system of this private company and the purpose they had in mind was to offset the loss they were making on the telegraph service. It is interesting that 60 years later they are still trying to devise a plan to offset the loss on the telegraph service.  Here is an interesting fact: in 1892 the &ldquo;development of the trunk service was very slow, however, as Treasury policy laid down that demand could not be anticipated but had to be assured before any extension to the network would be provided&rdquo;.  I believe that is the root of this whole problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is making the case that we need fresh thinking on telephone development, I agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This most admirable paper really reflects great credit on everyone concerned in its preparation because not only is it a mine of information, but it is as readable as a novel. When you go into the history of this business you might imagine that the typically Gladstonian approach of 1892 would have been watered down or abandoned as the years rolled by&mdash;but not a bit of it.  In 1940 this interesting development took place.  The paper speaks of the problems that arose following the fall of France and says that <Col N="860" /> special exertions by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had to be undertaken to connect some remote areas. It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>These circuits, together with some hundreds of miles of urgently required trunk lines, were all completed within the months of June and July of 1940.  Among these latter was a trunk line from Ballina to Belmullet, which had hitherto been without telephone service.  In previous years this project had been mooted on many occasions but had always been turned down because the demand could not be assured and, therefore, the scheme might not be remunerative.</P>
      <P>Is it not interesting to hear in 1940 an echo of the old Treasury policy laid down in 1892?  That is what is wrong. That is at the root of the whole business.</P>
      <P>My recollection is&mdash;and I am speaking from recollection only&mdash;that at one time there was a question of laying one of these coaxial cables in a trench. I cannot remember how many lines it was expected would be in the cables but it was surely 1,000 lines.  I recollect asking the question: &ldquo;If you are going to open a trench extending 100 miles, and lay a cable, and if you have a demand for 999 lines what is the point of putting in 1,000 lines?  Why not put in 2,000 lines?&rdquo; My recollection is that the answer of the Department was: &ldquo;You must never anticipate demand.&rdquo;  I found that hard to believe and, therefore, I am fascinated when I find in this most modern and interesting paper the historical foundation for that extraordinary approach&mdash;it was Treasury policy in 1892 that demand could not be anticipated but had to be assured before any extension of the network could be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I make a constructive suggestion to the Minister?  I suggest that he should hold a conference forthwith with the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;The Treasury policy as laid down in 1892 provides that demand cannot be anticipated in the telephone service but must be assured before any extension can be provided.  As of 31st March, 1962, that Treasury decision is <Col N="861" /> hereby cancelled and reversed and hereafter is to be regarded as never having been made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In my opinion that will not fundamentally alter the approach of the Post Office.  Because I have said that, it might appear that we here believe that the Post Office is an antediluvian and backward institution.  If I thought that, it would be my duty to say so and I would say it, but I want to make it clear that that is not my argument.  On the contrary, I believe the Post Office system in this country has attained, generally, a very high standard, and represents a branch of the public service with which, in my experience, it has always been a pleasure to deal.  If it has the old tradition to which I have referred for the purpose of condemning the Treasury policy which I have described, it also has other fine old traditions.  It is a Government Department set up to carry out the extremely difficult work of extending the telephone lines, cables and communications throughout the country on a purely voluntary basis, as opposed to the E.S.B. which were given very wide compulsory powers because their originating statute was enacted in 1927, in more modern times.  The Post Office carries on very largely on the basis of voluntary agreements with various persons with whom it has to deal and that has resulted generally in a very high standard of public relations.  We are fortunate to be able to boast of that and I now gladly pay the highest possible tribute to the Post Office.</P>
    <P>That does not mean I believe it is perfect.  I am quite sure it is no such thing.  There are some common defects. Why is it accepted as normal in the city post office and in the post offices in the towns and cities throughout the country that there should be queues when you go to buy a postage stamp? Surely there could be a greater degree of flexibility among the Post Office staffs.  If customers come to my shop down the country and want to buy anything from a lb. of tea to a pair of silk stockings, I do not get them to line up in a queue&mdash;they would not do it. They would go elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Yet it is a common experience of us <Col N="862" /> all that if you want to buy a stamp in a post office in Dublin, you may have to join a queue of ten or 15 people and move slowly up along to buy your stamp while, at the same time, there appear to be a number of clerks in that office doing nothing special, but they will not sell stamps.  This may arise from a lack of flexibility which should be relatively easy of correction.  It is a constant source of irritation and unfavourable comment amongst people and does a good deal to injure the public picture of the Post Office service. It is not a very formidable problem but it is one which ought to be tackled and overcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a further approach to the Minister for Finance and point out that the situation in which we have a backlog of 10,000 applications for telephones is undesirable and that further financial provisions should be made to deal with that situation.  I do not suppose there is a Deputy who is not in constant correspondence with his constituents and with the Department, looking for telephones.  That is quite wrong and it should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Finance to overcome the problem.</P>
    <P>I gather that the remuneration of the subpostmasters is a matter of some complexity.  There is a great deal of discontent amongst them about their remuneration.  I have drawn the Minister's attention to the extraordinary situation that under the method of assessing the new valuation of basic units by which remuneration is fixed, some of the subpostmasters are finding that they are getting less money for doing more work.  The Minister has said that if his attention is drawn to any such anomaly by the conciliation body, it will receive his sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I cannot help feeling that whatever was the conciliation machinery set up by us in 1956 in the belief that it would work reasonably satisfactorily and meet all legitimate demands, it does not seem to be giving satisfaction at the present time and I should like to hear <Col N="863" /> from the Minister whether he shares my view.  There does seem to be a considerable amount of discontent amongst the subpostmasters and does the Minister not think it is time to review the whole conciliation machinery?</P>
    <P>We had trouble and discontent not long ago with the Garda and some people attributed that to the fact that the established system of conciliation and consultation had ceased to function satisfactorily.  Perhaps everybody put it on the long finger and so we had a great deal of trouble we need not have had.  Now, when there has been a crisis, everybody is prepared to re-examine the whole machinery and find out where the fault lay.  I have a feeling that the same kind of trouble is boiling up amongst the subpostmasters. It may be that the present system of conciliation is not flexible enough to meet their difficulties.  If that is so, the Minister should meet them and ask them what is wrong with the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it and I hope a satisfactory solution will be found.  In view of the fact that the Minister does propose to meet them, I shall not dwell on the matter any further, save to wish the Minister good fortune in his discussions with them.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that the new postal address numbering system has got off to a good start and that he is anxious to see it progressing.  If the Post Office could explain to the public how this numbering system helps in the sorting of letters, I think he would get very substantial increase in public support.  I regard myself as a reasonably intelligent man but every time I put Dublin, 4. on a letter, I ask myself how it could help in sorting letters.  I accept by an act of faith that it does, but if the Minister would explain to the public in some way how it facilitates the sorting of letters, he would get more assistance.  The public are always prepared to help in a matter like this if they understand the system, but at present I do not understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I saw a couple of programmes on <Col N="864" /> television where a district nurse and other people were interviewed as to their daily round.  It was very interesting and informative.  I have no doubt the public would be interested to hear what the proposals of the head of the sorting department of the Post Office has in mind with this system of numbering and how it helps in the sorting of letters.  The more you take the people into your confidence, the more help you are likely to get from them. If the public understand, you usually get a good response.  While you may get a good response initially, the tendency is, when the first enthusiasm wears off and if the people are not fully informed as to what is needed, to cease to use the numbering system.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have been unfortunate in the matter I am about to mention but I feel that the system of prefixing numbers such as 042 and 041 when one wishes to get in touch with a provincial telephone exchange is not working well.  Only yesterday I wanted to talk with somebody in Dundalk and found myself twice talking to a butcher in Mullingar.  I must say that he was a very patient butcher in Mullingar but I finally had to ring the exchange and ask them to put me in contact with Dundalk, which they did.  It is rather disconcerting when you want to establish contact with someone in Galway to discover you are talking to someone in Cork.  In the eyes of the telephone people, that may not be extraordinary, but in the eyes of the ordinary user of the telephone, it is very disconcerting.  Perhaps it is that in the early stages of installing systems of this kind breakdowns of this character occur but it is right, I think, that the Minister should know about them so that perhaps something can be done to improve the facilities the Minister seeks to make available.</P>
    <P>Here is another matter on which I suggest further information should be imparted to the public.  The Minister speaking on his desire to provide additional trunk circuits says he proposes the completion of a microwave link. The Minister knows what a microwave link is.  I do not know but I suspect one of those saucer-like things standing <Col N="865" /> on a mast at the end of St. Andrew Street is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>May I suggest to the Minister that it helps if he tells the public these unsightly saucers which are seen sprouting up over the city are designed to help in expediting the provision of additional trunk circuits?  It was weeks before I could make out what on earth it was.  I thought it was some part of radar defensive measures.  It is not easy to realise you can project a telephonic message from a saucer in Andrew Street to a relatively remote area.  I do not know how far it travels.  Does the Minister know?</P>

      <P>The last matter I want to refer to is this.  The Minister referred to broadcasting and television.  I assume that when the report for the 10 months ended on 31st March, 1961, is presented, it will be available for debate in the House, if the House elects to debate it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to all the difficulties of the first year, we cannot be too critical if the first report has been excessively delayed.  I note with satisfaction that the Authority undertakes in the future to ensure that the report will be presented reasonably promptly, and I reserve my observations in detail on that aspect of the Minister's Estimate for the occasion when these reports come before the House.</P>
      <P>However, I must ask one question which is of special interest to County Monaghan.  There is a large area in north Monaghan where Telefís Éireann cannot be received at all.  By our legislation, these people are required to pay £4 for a television licence without which they may not have a television set.  Heretofore, they had to pay no licence fee at all and they got admirable reception from U.T.V. and B.B.C. television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said he hopes for some improvement when the new transmitter is established at Ben Bulben.  As regards the people in north Monaghan, it is hard to persuade them that that will give them any better reception, but I should like the Minister to feel free to say before the end of this discussion, that if that does not give them reception, he will feel bound to provide additional facilities that people who are required by law to pay £4 for a licence will be <Col N="867" /> able to receive satisfactory telecasts. It is manifestly unjust to oblige people who have a set which they had heretofore free of any licence fee and from which they were getting excellent reception from the B.B.C. and U.T.V., to pay £4 a year when they are getting no reception at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be facilities for booster stations and the Authority will, when the broadcasting is fully in operation, have a look at these blind areas and see what can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want north Monaghan to be put on the schedule as No. 1 blind area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the other two are left blind as a result of what they do, they would not like that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They would not like it at all but I am assuming that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will act efficiently and circumspectly.  These people would like to see television and they have a right to expect it when they are paying £4.  The Minister went on to say that the commencement of the television service from the Kippure transmitter on New Year's Eve was by far the most important development of the past year.  It would have been a very much better development if the Taoiseach had not appeared nine times on the first night.  I make all allowances for the immense difficulties of the television authority's undertaking and of their efforts to make live broadcasts on a wide variety of events. I make allowance, too, for the fact that the Minister and the whole propaganda machine of the Fianna Fáil Party decided that there ought to be plenty of the Taoiseach seen on the first day.  However, the thing became ludicrous before the day was over.  His appearances were received with ribald cheers in more than one house.  I am sure the Taoiseach himself realises that now as much as anybody else.  As far as I am concerned, I prefer to forget about it.  It was an error of judgment into which people might easily fall and it was so gross an error of judgment that it recoiled on those who inspired it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> There are certain aspects of this question of political broadcasts which fall within the proper ambient of our discussion here.  I am prepared to accept that generally on the Estimate we will not discuss details of the programmes of Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann, provided it is clearly understood that when their annual report comes before us, that is the occasion upon which any proper matters relating to Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann should be thrashed out in so far as the House thinks it is necessary to do so; but there are certain aspects which, I think, are proper to our deliberations and urgently require attention.</P>
    <P>In so far as Telefís Éireann purports to record the proceedings of this House, or in so far as Telefís Éireann undertakes to provide strictly political occasions on Telefís Éireann, there should be certain minimal requirements to be met.  I will give an example of a case in point, a strictly political occasion.  It is the occasion on which the Taoiseach, Deputy Corish, and I appeared in a kind of symposium, with the Bishop of Clonfert, on a matter of public interest, namely, the Common Market.  That was a strictly political occasion.  The other matter to which I want to refer is the report communicated to the public by the parliamentary correspondent on Telefís Éireann. We have a direct interest in these things.  It is open to no authority to misrepresent the proceedings of this House and we have a duty to see that, in the political life of the country, certain minimal standards are prescribed.</P>
    <P>I recognise there is a certain difficulty in dealing with any political situation on Telefís Éireann.  Some people will criticise me for being too moderate in what I am about to say, but I believe moderation is the best approach.  I recognise there are difficulties, but I think certain minimal requirements should be laid down.  If Telefís Éireann invite the leaders of the three principal Parties to partake in a symposium, the minimum requirement should be that the presentation of the three persons invited should be identical. Now Deputy Corish and I went out and said what we had to say in <Col N="869" /> connection with the Common Market. We made no conditions.  We simply placed ourselves in the hands of the Television Authority and made whatever contribution we were in position to make on what we understood was a kind of public service programme, putting, as best it could, the views of all the political Parties before the public on a matter of wide public interest.</P>
    <P>I saw that programme repeated.  I assume the Taoiseach has employed a firm of publicity agents to present him favourably over the period of the next two years.  That is his own business.  He can employ Harry Lauder, if he can get him and has the money to pay him. But I do not think the Television Authority is entitled to decide that, whereas Deputy Corish and I will appear just in the ordinary course, the Taoiseach is to be presented like Peter Ustinov, with a background of the Continent of Europe behind him, sitting at an ornate desk, with the camera approaching him in the hands of a black and mysterious figure, and then his smiling countenance portrayed on the screen.  We can all play ball, and act equitably or unfairly.  If we do not act fairly, then the whole thing will be turned into an impossible pandemonium. I think the Television Authority is entitled to say that there ought to be an understanding that, if leaders of political Parties appear, they ought all to appear in identical circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to go this far.  If the head of the Government is par-taking, it is not a matter for complaint if he should ask for 12 or 15 minutes, and get them, while the leaders of Parties have made available to them five or ten minutes.  I would not blame the head of the Government for that.  I think that would be reasonable. But I think it is wrong, and will cause ill-feeling and distress, if there is a manifest effort made to present the Taoiseach, by theatrical trimmings, on an entirely different basis from that accorded to the leaders of the other political Parties who have been invited to participate in a public service programme of the character to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>This is a matter to which, I think, <Col N="870" /> Dáil Éireann should attend, and seek to lay down some reasonable and dignified general standards which can be adopted as a guide for all of us in the time that lies ahead.  Now is the time to do that.  Unless we can arrive at some reasonable and decent understanding, the television, in the dissemination of public service programmes of that kind, will become a menace rather than a blessing.</P>
    <P>The other matter to which I want to refer is that the proceedings of this House must not be misrepresented. I do not underestimate the great difficulty there is in trying to give an objective report of the proceedings of Dáil Éireann.  I am bound to say that, so far as my experience goes of the news broadcast nightly by Telefís Éireann, I have no reason to complain of the presentation of the news relating to the proceedings of this House; but, in regard to the Parliamentary correspondent, I have reason to complain. I do not want to misrepresent this matter; I merely want to mention it.  I want to lay down what I consider to be fair, and I invite my colleagues to comment upon that.  I feel that the Parliamentary correspondent in describing the proceedings of this House should feel himself bound by a very special obligation of objectivity, that is to say, that he will faithfully report to the best of his ability what the leading protagonists of the various views said; and, if he does not feel himself free to do that, he should not seek to report them at all.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell further on that.  It may be everybody is doing his best.  I should be less than honest if I pretended that the best that is being done to date has met what I consider to be the minimal standard of objectivity, and with less than that I shall not be contented, for I believe that less than objectivity in the reporting of this House would be gravely inimical to the prestige of Dáil Éireann itself.  In my judgment, this Dáil, to which we are privileged to belong, is the most important institution in the public life of this country and all other public services&mdash;Telefís Éireann and everything else&mdash;have a duty and obligation to Oireachtas Éireann to see that what <Col N="871" /> they have to say of it will be, first, respectful and, secondly, objective. Less than that will not, in my opinion, if I know the Oireachtas as I think I do, be satisfactory to the membership of this House, which, in matters of this kind, is not, in my judgment, unreasonably exacting.</P>
    <P>What I have had to say has not been on the whole unduly critical.  I am happy to have been able to pay a high tribute to the general standard set by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, but I should be less than frank if I did not conclude by saying that I consider the present increase in the provision of a telephone service to be little less than a public scandal.  The present Minister, or any successor who may be called upon to fill the post, is bound to report to the Minister for Finance that the position is one he will no longer tolerate; and I trust the Minister will be fortified from both sides of this House in going to the Department of Finance and saying, once and for all: &ldquo;The Treasury policy of 1892 must be regarded as dead, and I must have made available to me such capital as will enable me to meet the reasonable requirements of a modern society, which I am charged to serve.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement read by the Minister will convince the House that the Post Office organisation is one of sturdy growth, that it is alert and shows abundant evidence of progressive outlook and activities in many fields of endeavour.  When you remember that we took over from the British 40 years ago with a deficit of approximately £1,000,000 or more in the first year of operation, the House is entitled to feel proud of the fact that in the current year, a surplus of £300,000 will be yielded by the Post Office, notwithstanding the fact that to-day its activities are infinitely greater and much more widespread and far-flung than they were 40 years ago.  That is a great tribute to the Post Office as an organisation, but, in addition, it is a tribute to the capacity, administrative experience and sense of dedication which actuate all those associated with the Post Office as a <Col N="872" /> great public service.  I want to record my appreciation and admiration of the competence, the high level of ability and foresight which produce results such as those which are crystallised in the speech read by the Minister to-day.</P>
      <P>There are some matters I should like to raise on behalf of the staff and some others on which I should like to get information.  So far as subpostmasters are concerned, I should like to tell the Minister I recently saw a deputation from this body and discussed with them at considerable length the problems confronting them to-day.  It was believed that the establishment of a Consultative Council some years ago would provide them with the means of meeting official representatives and discussing their problems jointly.  In that way it was hoped considerable progress would be made in meeting the reasonable claims of the subpostmasters throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to say that the Consultative Council has really broken down completely.  These people have no faith whatever in the present Consultative Council.  That has very largely to do with the fact that the Consultative Council is not producing results as far as they are concerned.  They meet the official representatives, argue the merits or demerits of the case brought before the Council but, in the long run, when the meeting is over, when they rule off and tot up what they have got, they find the results are appallingly small from their point of view.  They are meagre and give them no sense of satisfaction.  If the Minister is to retain the goodwill of these people and avoid what I am afraid will be a major crisis in the very near future, he would be well advised to examine this matter further to see whether some scheme of arbitration could not be devised so as to enable these people to have their problems adjudicated upon by an independent arbitrator when they have failed to get a reasonable settlement at conciliation level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What they are getting at present is really handed-down decisions.  There is no more irritating method of negotiating with anybody.  The handed-down decision is something they will no <Col N="873" /> longer accept, as they read almost every day in the papers that almost everybody in the country can go to the Labour Court, not only go to the Labour Court but are dragged to the Labour Court, if they have a dispute at all.  Everybody wants them to go to the Labour Court. They are told: &ldquo;You must go to the Labour Court.  That is the place to settle your problem.&rdquo;  But the sup-postmaster is told to go to the Consultative Council.  He meets the Post Office administrators at the other side of the table and they say: &ldquo;No, we cannot go another farthing above this. We have our written instructions, and beyond those instructions we cannot go.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People become very irritated with that kind of treatment.  The subpostmasters are still receiving it, and if the Minister sees them he will know about it.  I suggest to the Minister that nothing could be worse or more short-sighted than to try to make a piece of machinery work in which half the participants, namely, the subpostmasters, have no faith whatever. I believe a reasonable arbitration scheme could be devised and would give the same results and satisfaction as it has given in other branches of the Civil Service where it is in operation. Nobody wants to interfere with it and everybody recognises it has produced not only good-will and contentment but efficiency as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to consider the question of establishing an arbitration board as an auxiliary to the Consultative Council, so that if the subpostmasters do not get a reasonable measure of satisfaction between themselves and the official side, at least some independent authority in whom both sides have confidence will adjudicate on the merits of the dispute.  If they lose at that level, they have got to realise it is because impartial people do not take the same view of their problems as they do themselves; and in any case there can be no suggestion that there is an unreasonable attitude being adopted towards them.</P>
    <P>There are some matters in the Minister's speech to which I should like to make reference.  The Minister <Col N="874" /> said that the number of telegrams received and transmitted during the year was 1,764,000 and that this represented a drop of one per cent. as compared with the previous year. That one per cent. drop is probably the smallest percentage fall there has been for some years.  Within the last ten years the percentage fall has been much higher than that.  Are we to conclude from that that the Post Office feel they have got to rock bottom so far as the fall in telegraphic traffic is concerned or do they feel that the continuing extension of the Telex machine is likely to make further in-roads on the use of the telegram? Can the Post Office now plan on the assumption that the present volume of telegraphic traffic will remain fairly static or is it possible there may be another steep fall in the volume of telegraphic traffic at some time in the future?  I should like to get information in that regard from the Minister if he has it to give.</P>
    <P>The Minister on page 15 of his speech referred to Post Office buildings. Here, of course, the same problem has arisen as was manifested in connection with telephone development. The Post Office was unable to foresee the extent to which post offices would be utilised for expanded services, postal and telephone, with the result that many post offices throughout the country are utterly inadequate not only from the point of view of staff but from the point of view of the public who have to use them.  The space available is so small that a relatively small number of people at some of the public counters makes them crowded and causes disorganisation.  Quite clearly, when these offices were erected very little thought or imagination was given to the necessity to take into account the growth and extension in the use of Post Office services.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to some offices to which improvements would be carried out this year and to others where perhaps new buildings would be erected, such as, for instance, Ballinasloe and Youghal.  He spoke also of a new district sorting office at Finglas.  Could he give us a <Col N="875" /> statement setting out what towns in the country, in his opinion, need new post offices and what is the Post Office programme for supplying these new offices in these areas and in what towns are there extensive reconstruction plans so as to supply the Post Office with adequate premises for the accommodation of the public and staff?</P>
    <P>A programme of that kind is not indicated in the Minister's statement and I should like him to set out the places where the new offices are required and what is the programme for the fulfilment of the general building needs of the Post Office.  I notice on page 43 of the Book of Estimates for the current year, in Vote 9&mdash;Public Works and Buildings&mdash;that the Board of Works indicate that this year they will provide new works, alterations and additions for the Post Office Department which are estimated to cost £249,000.  Would the Minister indicate what is covered in the way of new buildings, alterations and additions by that £249,000 and to what extent will that sum make an impression on the reconstruction and new building work which is so necessary, if the Post Office is to be provided with satisfactory premises for the transaction of its constantly expanding business?</P>
    <P>I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that a contract for the structural steelwork has been placed and tenders have been invited for the site clearance and the foundation work on a new central sorting office for Dublin.  That is almost a monumental achievement, a great triumph over forces of almost satanic strength which for about 40 years, have managed to prevent a new sorting office being erected in Dublin, but I am glad the project is now looking as if it will reach maturity in the next few years. I should like to ask the Minister could he give any indication when this main building work will be completed. I notice he says he hopes it will start towards the end of the next financial year.</P>
    <P>Could the Minister say whether his Department or the Board of Works <Col N="876" /> have in mind any date for the completion of the work of erecting the building, so that we could know approximately when Dublin will have a proper sorting office instead of what it has had for the past 40 years&mdash;an old, decrepit distillery which has been utilised in a most makeshift fashion for the discharge of duties which are proper to a central sorting office in a big capital city like Dublin? Nonetheless, I congratulate the Minister on the fact that this thing is now moving and many hearts would be gladdened if a target date could be set for the completion of this monumental work.</P>

      <P>Before I pass from buildings, the Minister said a new district sorting office would be provided for Finglas and I would ask if there is any proposal to have a similar office in the Raheny area.  Is it intended that not only will these be district sorting offices but that they will be branch offices as well, officially staffed branch offices as distinct from the ordinary district sorting offices?  Perhaps the Minister would let me know whether Raheny is on the list and whether the branch sorting office at Finglas will transact all sorts of post office business as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised on this Estimate on a previous occasion the quality of the uniforms supplied to postmen.  I think the quality&mdash;I am not talking about the design&mdash;is very inferior and that it gives the postman a very untidy look because no matter what he does, he cannot prevent it from attracting dust. It seems to pick up stains of a most stubborn kind at the slightest provocation. Over and above that, whatever class of material is used&mdash;it is a dyed material obviously&mdash;when the postman <Col N="877" /> gets wet, as he is prone to do in this country, in this climate, the dye runs on to his shirt and ruins the shirt and destroys the collar.  Apart from the material being inferior, it appears to be badly dyed as well.  The dye is not a fast dye and there are complaints about the way postmen's underwear is being destroyed.</P>
    <P>I suggest the Minister take an interest in the matter and see that postmen are provided with uniforms that will stay neat, tidy and attractive.  It is in the interest of the postman himself that he should appear before the public as a credit to the great service in which he works but he cannot look attractive or tidy in the present quality uniform.  I suggest this matter should be discussed again with representatives of the staff to see if a better quality cloth could not be got in order to produce a better uniform, one which would be a credit to the service.</P>
    <P>The same goes for the protective clothing supply.  If it has any quality, it is its ability to stick.  You cannot get it open.  Efforts have been made, I know, by the Post Office to find a satisfactory protective cape but they do not seem to be able to find it.  It is strange that, in 1962, we cannot get a proper cape to provide adequate protection for postmen on walking and cycling duties. It seems to me it could be got if a proper price were paid for it.  Therefore, some effort ought to be made to explore the possibilities of providing better protective clothing for postmen on walking and cycling duties.</P>
    <P>I come to the question of the Office Premises Act which was passed by this House and which applies to the Post Office and other Government Departments in the same way as it applies to the private office.  Some of the buildings in Dublin, particularly buildings like Pearse Street, the Parcel Office in Fowler Hall, the Parcel Office in Amiens Street, are old buildings which were not built as Post Offices.  They are more store houses than offices.</P>
    <P>There are constant complaints from the staff about the lighting of those places, the inadequate heating, the draughts.  All these shortcomings are transgressions by the Department <Col N="878" /> of Posts and Telegraphs of the provisions of the Office Premises Act. The Post Office proceed as if the Act does not apply to them.  The draughts are as they were ten years ago.  The heating and lighting are bad.  The Post Office do nothing about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Post Office are obliged to observe the provisions of the Act the same as any other owner of office premises.  The Minister ought to ensure that, until such time as decent offices are provided in Dublin, the shortcomings of the present offices will be eliminated as far as technical capacity can do that.  Generally speaking, he ought to ensure in respect of lighting, heating, ventilation and the prevention of draughts that the Post Office will endeavour to comply with the provisions of the Act by which they are bound, the same as any other owner of office premises throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I want to join with Deputy Dillon in some of the references which he has made to Telefís Éireann.  I do not want to develop the matter at any length.  It is a pity it has to be discussed at all.  It is not my desire, either, to discuss it or to make a first class issue of it but I think the way Telefís Éireann starts very largely creates in the public mind the image of what it is.  I asked questions of the Minister to ascertain the number of Deputies who appeared on Telefís Éireann between two particular dates. He said that that was not within his sphere.  He suggested that an inquiry should be made from Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>The plain fact of the matter is&mdash; there is no use in trying to hide or to justify it&mdash;that, in its first three weeks or month or six weeks of operation, Telefís Éireann had-more Fianna Fáil Deputies than Deputies from all the other Parties in the House, many more.  I do not mind if Fianna Fáil want to run a television station on their own but they ought to pay for it. This television station belongs to the nation.  Every Party in the House is entitled to a fair share of it in respect of those discussions which have a political complexion or which relate to public questions.</P>
    <P>I do not object to Fianna Fáil getting <Col N="879" /> an adequate share of television publicity.  I do not object to Fianna Fáil getting half whatever time is available there for political discussion or for discussions on public questions with which the Deputies of political Parties are involved.  I do object to Fianna Fáil getting five or six times the publicity the other Parties in the House get.  It is not fair.  It is a distorted view by Telefís Éireann or whoever is responsible, whether the Authority or some top level executives, of their functions.</P>
    <P>In regard to Radio Éireann, where there were political broadcasts at the time of the Budget or at the time of an election, it was always possible to work out an even balance between Parties.  That generally gave satisfaction. Telefís Éireann starts off thinking that the best opening gambit is six to one against the Opposition and it will probably settle for five to one if you go to negotiate with them.  They ought to be told by the Minister, because of their unfamiliarity with the Irish scene, that they have not got this thing balanced out.  I do not mind who appears on it or what way it is balanced. I do not mind who is selected because of certain qualifications or knowledge of a particular sphere.</P>
    <P>When you rule off, you ought to have a certain balance between the Government on the one hand and the Opposition on the other.  That is not an unreasonable request to make.  If the Telefís Éireann authorities will not make that arrangement themselves then the Minister, as a sensible man, ought to step in and say, as I am sure he believes it to be equitable, that they ought to balance it in that kind of way.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake that should be remedied at this stage.  I hope a rectification will be applied to eliminate the necessity of discussing it on an Estimate or of having an annual row about it whenever the Report of Telefís Éireann is presented to the House.  I am sure that this matter can be settled easily if some authority takes it in hand.  If it is allowed to drift, the issue will get more angry as the weeks pass by.  Irreparable harm will be done <Col N="880" /> to what ought to be the high integrity and impartiality of the Telefís Éireann Authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicates, in relation to the telephone services, that there are about 10,000 applications on hand and that, because of the necessity to provide more junctions and outlets for existing subscribers, the most he can do in the future is to deal with the priority cases and perhaps some of the non-priority cases.  Deputy Dillon says &mdash;rightly so&mdash;that it is a great pity that, because of want of foresight, the Post Office should be so starved of equipment as not to be able to take these applications for telephones to be installed.</P>
    <P>It must be obvious today, and I am sure it will be obvious ten years hence, that rising living standards will create a situation in which people will believe that a telephone is an amenity in some cases and an essential piece of equipment in other cases and that the demand for telephones will continue to rise.  That could have been foreseen many years ago.  It is there to be demonstrated today.  I believe that demand will continue so far as the use of telephones is concerned.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will succeed in getting access to new equipment and that he will find it possible to train more personnel so that he can deal with these applications for installation of telephones expeditiously.  There was a rather bleak ring in his references to the possibility of being able to provide a service at an early date for the 10,000 who are awaiting telephones.  I imagine that number will increase as the months go by, because nowadays so many people are connected up by telephone that it is a useful piece of social mechanism and, at the same time, a very valuable adjunct to business activities.  The Minister should have another look at that matter to see whether he cannot, by recruitment and training, even in an extensive way, of more staff, and by the purchase of equipment, satisfy the demands for new telephones in a speedier way than they will be satisfied if the tempo of installation is as indicated in the tone and matter of the Minister's speech.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and the officers of his Department on the Estimate they have presented to the House.  I want to raise a few matters which concern the western seaboard as a whole.  As a result of the storms we had during the past few months, a great many lines were brought down, and the telephone system was disrupted. I should like to congratulate the men on the manner in which they got it back to working order in such a short time.</P>
      <P>We on the western seaboard, in general, are not at all satisfied with the telephone service in so far as when one makes a call, it is impossible to hear the person at the other end. There are continuous interruptions as if a drill were working on another part of he line.  I daresay that is something the technicians will look after, but when people have to pay for a call, they are entitled to hear and be heard clearly and distinctly in order that they can transact their business. Perhaps if an automatic system were provided, that problem would be solved.</P>
      <P>I would be more pleased if I saw in the Estimate that the Minister and the Department were making some provision in regard to postmen's uniforms. Their uniforms are of a baggy nature and after a few showers of rain, they are more baggy looking.  A better type of material should be provided and in the long run, that would not cost any more because they would last longer.  They would also look better.</P>
      <P>I know there are reasons for the delay in installing telephones but perhaps more men could be employed on such installations.  When they are installed, more revenue will be collected from them.</P>
      <P>With regard to postmen in general, I believe that every postman in every part of the country, in every city and town, should be made permanent and pensionable.  They are entitled to that and in this country we should not have such a person as an auxiliary or temporary postman.  They should be permanent, and pensionable at the end of their service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the Estimates we discuss on which it is true to say that the book-keeping and income are satisfactory.  The postal services, the telephone service and the general operations of the Department, have been carried out on a basis of good management over the years.</P>
      <P>When I see an increase in the Telephone Capital Repayments of almost £177,000, what strikes me is the fact that certain other Government-run organisations and semi-State companies make no repayments.  By and large, we are approaching that part of the Posts and Telegraphs Estimate in a proper and constructive fashion, by comparison with Aer Lingus, C.I.E. and various other State-run organisations.</P>
      <P>We proceed from that to the statement of the Minister that there is a waiting list of 10,000 for new telephones. The increase in the amount allotted for engineering stores and equipment is £979,000.  When we take the fact that there is a waiting list for telephones, and when the Minister tells us that we can expect no speedy solution, of course one realises that there is almost a go-slow policy in operation.  I know the highly complicated difficulties there are in the provision of trunk lines to take the volume of business.  The difficulties are so obvious that they cannot be minimised but, at the same time, I think this year we might have seen, as Deputy Dillon said, an expedition to the Minister for Finance in order to get under way a much greater effort to provide people with the telephones they desire.  No business of any size can operate now without a telephone, and as we proceed from 1962 to 1963, that trend will be magnified out of all knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one type of applicant for a telephone to whom I should like to refer.  Ten years ago, or even five years ago, it was quite unusual for a farmer to have a telephone, but the complexities of modern agriculture and the trend of modern living have meant that most farmers of any size, in the eastern counties at least, desire to have a telephone.  That type of <Col N="883" /> telephone in its little local application &mdash;it is also the telephone that calls the doctor and which the neighbours use &mdash;provides almost a public as well as a private service.</P>
    <P>The difficulty the Minister foresees in this delay in meeting the demand is unmanageable loads on the exchanges and on the trunk lines.  I do not accept that.  For instance, in my constituency in a sub-post office like Togher or Clogherhead, or in the post office at Dunleer or Castlebellingham, there are one or two operatives.  Two is the maximum and it is usually one.  They would not be overworked if there were a speeding up in the provision of telephones for farmers in those districts.  I believe the great majority of the calls made by those farmers would be to the local towns.  There would not be trunk calls to Cork, Belfast or Dublin in great numbers.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that defence is a valid one because my experience is that the number of telephone numbers in one of those small exchanges is possibly, 20, 10 or eight, and in one case I know of, it is 65.  That number of subcribers would not mean that the post post offices would be over-loaded. Perhaps the extra number of calls in a large exchange like Drogheda or Dundalk would mean increased work, but I do not accept, so far as the small country post offices are concerned, as a valid defence that there would be gross over-loading of the exchanges.</P>
    <P>The slide rule that I should like to put to the problem is: if this were being done by private enterprise would this House, which would then presumably give some sort of monopoly in certain districts, accept the present situation?  I maintain that the House would not accept the situation as it has existed over the last few years.  Private enterprise would say that the job had to be done.  Wherever they might get the money or however hard they might have to work, they would do it.  When a Government Department are asked to do something and the pressure gets too hot all they do is to close up like a clam and say to themselves that they will sit tight and draw their salaries in any case for the next month or the next <Col N="884" /> year.  I fear that is so and I think that more could be done to reduce the present waiting list of 10,000.  In relation to the figure required here for engineering stores and equipment that figure of 10,000 is relatively very small but it will grow.  A great effort might have been made to get the Minister for Finance to loosen his pursestrings for this purpose.</P>
    <P>There are 47 Fine Gael Deputies on these benches and there was one copy of the Minister's speech available to them.  At the same time, I counted five officials, all with copies of the speech and at least six Fianna Fáil Deputies came into the back benches plentifully supplied with it.  I believe it is the Minister's duty, through his officials, to see that an adequate number of copies of his speech is made available to this side of the House.</P>

      <P>There is another matter I should like to reply to and that is the method of appointment of postmen and postmasters in the country districts.  I speak of this in no critical way with regard to the present Minister.  I am glad to say that any representation I ever made to him was received with the greatest courtesy. However, there is dissatisfaction in relation to the method of appointment. As I understand it, the Minister makes the appointment himself.  He may not make the selection himself but he sanctions the appointment and in that way he is involved.  That is very unsatisfactory because whatever decision <Col N="885" /> is made the criticism can be offered to it that he gave the post to a member of his own political Party.</P>

      <P>This is an unsatisfactory situation.  I can tell you a funny story that is true.  When the new post office in Drogheda was about to be built, it was obvious that it should be on one of three sites, but eventually it was built about a quarter of a mile away from the most obvious one. The reason given for not building it there was that it would have had to have steps up to the entrance.  I remember the late Councillor Pentony giving us the full details at the Corporation meeting and then somebody adverted to the fact that there were two steps leading up to the entrance to the new post office which had cost £120,000 to build.  When things like that happen, one gets the feeling that all this is done by Party patronage.</P>

      <P>When one listens to the news in Irish from Radio Éireann or Telefís Éireann, one finds that the announcer is a man from the Gaeltacht with a great blás.  I can understand a reasonable amount of Irish, which I learned in school, but I cannot understand these announcers.  To give an illustration, when Deputy Ó Briain speaks Irish from the far side of the House, I can understand him perfectly because he is not a native speaker.  He is from Limerick, and while I may not like what he says, I can understand him.  However, when my friend, Deputy &ldquo;Pa&rdquo; O'Donnell stands up and speaks in Irish, I do not understand a word he says.  My objection to the present situation in Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann is that the ordinary people who learned Irish in school do not understand the announcer with the blás.  If we proceed to broadcast in Irish, in ten or 15 years' time, we will get down to basic Irish and the blás will go.  Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann might take note of that.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter I should like to mention.  In many business houses, a system of automatic dial telephones is now being installed. There are four or five phones to the different departments in the business but there is no exchange.  The user presses a button when he wishes to speak to a certain department.  I understand that the charge for the hire of these instruments from the Department is so prohibitive that many business people are buying their own installations from private firms, and that it is possible to instal these systems, having bought them at considerable capital expenditure.  I wonder would the Minister look into that matter because it is something of which more widespread use will be made.  Would the Minister indicate if any reduction in the hire charges of those instruments can be foreseen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start off by complimenting the Minister on what he has done during the past year in initiating Telefís Éireann.</P>
      <P>Up to very recently, it was supposed that the office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was a sinecure, that he was the Minister for stamps and postal orders, but anybody can see this Minister has not had it any way easy. He has had a rough time and we are all glad to see he has come out of it so well.  He has done an excellent job as far as that operation is concerned and as one of his severest critics in many other fields, I think it only fair I should compliment him on that aspect of his work.</P>
      <P>The amount required here is very large but in view of the explanation which has been given, I suppose the money must be found.  Almost every Deputy who has spoken here today said that further improvements should be made in various services.  Of course, if improvements in services are required, money must be found to pay for them.  It is only when we come to finding the money that the real trouble starts.  As long as we remember that the improved services must carry with them the necessity to find the money, we can view the whole matter from the correct aspect.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to go over the points which were covered so ably by the previous speakers but there are one or two points to which I think it is important to refer.  Deputy Geoghegan referred to the question of postmen's uniforms.  It is a fact that while practically every other branch of the public service has been from time to time attempting to improve the type of uniform which the employees have to wear, the postman still goes around in an old-type uniform which during the summer must be just the last word in discomfort.  We all know that under the regulations if a postman is found with his cap off while cycling along in some country district, he is likely to be reprimanded for it. Neither the cap nor the uniform is suitable for the warm weather which we do occasionally get.  The whole outfit is anything but dressy and it would be a good idea if the uniform were improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> The pay of the postmen, while it has been improved, is not what it should be.  I refer particularly to the auxiliary postmen down the country.  The time has long passed when they should be included in a pension scheme.  When these men, some of whom have given 40 or 45 years' service to the Post Office, come to retirement, they get no pension at all.  The Minister would do well to have that matter considered.</P>
    <P>A Deputy asked a question last week about postmen's pay and was informed by the Minister that they did not get a weekly rate but an hourly rate.  The trouble about an hourly rate is that if a person reports to a post office for temporary duty and is required to work four or five hours in a day, there is no point in saying he is entitled to only 12/- or 15/-, because that is his day's work.  Nobody else will be found who is prepared to accept him for other work after the best hours of the day have gone.  If these men are employed by the Post Office to do a job, they should be paid a basic weekly wage so that they can live.  The Minister himself knows of many instances where this occurs.  Quite recently, I came across a case where a man was replacing a postman who was ill for a temporary period.  For some peculiar reason, the Post Office wanted to pay the person who replaced him £2 a week less than the other man was getting. Say the rate was £5 15/-; they wanted to pay him under £4.  That is too ridiculous for words, because more work had to be done by the man who came in not knowing the route.  The Minister could look into that.</P>
    <P>I should like to add my voice to the appeal made by other speakers about the appointment of postmen.  We had one shocking case in my constituency recently and I am afraid the Minister did not come too well out of it.</P>

      <P>The Minister may have been made to carry the bag for somebody other than himself.  It is too bad if that should be so.  We know the situation where three names are sent up from the labour exchange and the Minister is entitled to select one.  If a <Col N="889" /> Fianna Fáil applicant is selected, the Minister can, I suppose, justify that by saying that there are so many Fianna Fáil people in the country, it is only natural they should be two out of three.  However, in this case, the man was in the job.  He had been on the dole, not receiving unemployment benefit but unemployment assistance. The Department had him suspended for no reason at all and had him replaced by the treasurer of the local Fianna Fáil cumann who was on unemployment benefit which was more than what he received for doing the job as postman.  The Minister has been criticised by me and others for his action.  Possibly he was not directly responsible for it and I know local pressure can be very strong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes the matter a whole lot worse.  The responsibility then rests clearly on the Minister's shoulders because the man who was doing the job was taken out of it. There was no blot on his character.</P>

      <P>We all know what the dole is.  This man was getting 28/- on the dole and he was replaced by a man who was getting something around £5 per week on the labour exchange.  The job he got was worth about £4 15s.  As a result of the investigation, the Department of Social Welfare reduced the rate of the man on the dole to 26/- a week.  I would appeal to the Minister, not in any spirit of acrimony, that in future he should himself go very deeply into these matters in order to prevent a recurrence of such a situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that the man had not the use of the farm of land because it was tied up by the courts over the years. May I refer now briefly to the question of the appointment of subpostmasters? I had a question down to the Minister and he gave an answer which was perfectly true but this again involved the right to select one of three.  The Minister selected one of three.  I agree it was a coincidence.  I would not claim it was anything more than a coincidence, but it was a wonderful coincidence. In every case the person selected was the keyman of the Fianna Fáil Party in the area.  The Minister knows one particular case better than any of the rest of us.  The man was a Garda.  As a member of the Garda Siochána he could not be appointed. He resigned on Saturday from the Garda Síochána and was appointed the following Wednesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister the information now.  With one exception, there were at least three declared suitable for appointment in every case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not, but I am, at least, in touch with my constituents. I know what happened.  I believe the Minister is a very decent man and I merely raise this matter, not for any contentious purpose but merely to advise the Minister that he should decide these things himself and should not allow himself to be coerced into doing things by other people, people who have views to which he, in normal circumstances, would not subscribe.</P>
      <P>With regard to subpostmasters, the crib is that they are not being adequately paid.  Postmen and subpostmasters are the face of the Department of Social Welfare in the country. On the way in which they act the ordinary public in the country view the Department of Social Welfare.  Every effort should be made to keep these people as happy as possible.  I should be very glad to hear the Minister has agreed to meet the subpostmasters to discuss the position with them.  The Minister said that these people have conciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that. They have consultation, and consultation only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Consultation means that they have a chat with the officials of the Department and, if agreement is not reached, the officials decide.  The <Col N="892" /> subpostmasters have no further say, good, bad or indifferent.  What is needed is independent arbitration.  It is their right and they should get it.</P>
      <P>There is another matter affecting the Minister's Department.  It is the question of children's allowances.  One section in the Minister's Department do not receive the same children's allowances as everybody else for the simple reason that they were promoted from postman.  All they ask is that there should be arbitration on the matter. There is no reason why they should not get arbitration.  Other sections are entitled to it.  It is only fair they should get it.</P>
      <P>With regard to Telefís Éireann, I have been a T.V. viewer for the past eight or nine years.  I think Telefís Éireann are doing a wonderful job. The highlight so far was not the official opening but the St. Patrick's Day programme. It is one many people will remember for a long time.  Telefís Éireann showed what can be done with good camera work.  I do not agree with Deputy Donegan's views with regard to the announcers.  I think the announcers on both Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann are doing a wonderful job in both Irish and English.  One good thing is that we have no announcers trying to adopt a mock-Oxford accent.  The announcers use their ordinary Irish accents.  The Authority is to be congratulated on its choice of announcers.</P>
      <P>On the children's programme, there is one man who can be described only as a stage Irishman.  He has the collar of his coat turned up; he takes a tin-whistle out of his pocket and he blows a few blasts; he talks out of the side of his mouth as if his mouth were full of marbles.  That does nothing for the service.  If the same type of programme were given on the BBC, it would be frowned on and there would be letters to the papers accusing the BBC of putting on a stage Irishman.  Apparently on our own programme, it is a wonderful thing.  I am sure the man is a good artist if only he would decide not to carry on in the fashion I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The result of the steps being taken <Col N="893" /> by Telefís Éireann to give reception in areas now blacked out is something that is worrying many of us.  We have been getting two free services, and now a third service, for £4 and we do not feel too well disposed towards any suggestion that we may lose these two free services in an effort to improve reception of the third for others.  It is only natural.  No matter who will be obliged, we do not want to be discommoded. I am sure the Minister is doing everything possible to eliminate interference. Admittedly there are some shocking programmes on ITV, UTV and the BBC, but people are under no compulsion to view them.  They can either turn off altogether or switch over.  The suggestion that they should be blacked out completely because of an occasional bad programme is too ridiculous for words.</P>
    <P>People now feel entitled to have these programmes.  They have been enjoying them for years.  Very often there are very fine programmes from UTV.  Céili House deserves honourable mention.  Telefís Éireann have nothing yet to compare with it.  There are no ladders in the way of the cameras.  An effort should be made to prevent interference with programmes from UTV and the BBC.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to appearances on Telefís Éireann.  On the opening night things were a little monotonous. No matter how photogenic a man may be, his continued appearance again and again, and again rather spoils things for some.  I did not mind.  One gets used to these things. Since then, however, there has been a considerable amount of difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory working policy.  I do not know whether I am within the rules of order in discussing this, but there was a discussion with the representatives of the three main Parties and I have no doubt in my mind at all that the representatives of Telefís Éireann agreed on a certain formula which was to be used with, of course, a certain amount of elasticity.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to find that the formula was not only completely ignored but subsequently disowned by the people who made it.  The Whips of the three Parties present remembered <Col N="894" /> distinctly that in fact arrangements were made and would bear out my interpretation.  We thought the arrangements were fair: that on Budget Day or any special occasion, there should be a representative of the Government, of the Fine Gael Party and of the Labour Party and then a representative of the Government to conclude; and that on any other occasion, the programmes should be balanced.  If a member of one Party appeared, he should be balanced off by a member of another Party within a reasonable time.  That was agreed and everybody felt it was fair.  But we have had a succession of members of the Government Party appearing, and only on rare occasions have members of the other Parties appeared.  So far, only two members of our Party have appeared.  We think that is not playing the game.  I do not know whether the Minister has any say in this.  If he has, I would like him to inquire into it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity, because I feel the Minister could deal with it. Sooner or later, Telefís Éireann will realise that all the people are not Fianna Fáil supporters and that there are a few, as this House shows, who do not consistently vote Fianna Fáil. If the Minister has no say, there is no point in going any further with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to put it that way.  It is a matter for consideration.  It is a matter which gives the Minister a good deal of food for thought, but I am precluded under the Act from interfering in the day-to-day administration of the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a matter I should like to raise in connection with the telephone service.  If a subscriber leaves an area and a telephone line is <Col N="895" /> no longer needed, I thought, as a layman, that it would be only natural to give that line to a subscriber in the area anxious to get a connection and to connect him as quickly as possible. I thought that would be good business, but I found it could not be done. I have in mind a case in Donore, County Meath, where somebody left the area three or four months ago, and another person asked for the line but was told he could not have it.  He could have it if he agreed to pay for a line from Drogheda, and the money was to be refunded over the years according as he repaid.  I do not think that was a reasonable way to deal with the matter.  If there is an idle line, I think it should be given.</P>
      <P>In cases where lines are discontinued, it is not right that the poles and wires should be left.  If there is one thing which mars the appearance of the countryside, it is this network of wires, E.S.B. lines, telephone lines and everything else.  Many of them are very necessary and we cannot have services without them.  But if lines are no longer needed, there is no reason why they should be left there. I had the unfortunate experience one night of driving into a line lying on the road.  I was told a few days afterwards that that line had been abandoned and that therefore it would not be reported for repair in the normal way.  These matters should be dealt with as quickly as possible. There is no reason why unwanted lines should not be taken down, thus at least improving that portion of the countryside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the new system of numbering the Dublin postal districts is a good idea and is working very well.  I was intrigued to hear Deputy Dillon say he did not know how it worked.  I assumed that everybody knew that by attaching the number of the postal district to the address, it saved a lot of sorting work and certainly helped in the delivery of letters.  In the country areas, however, something else has happened.  A change has been made in the postal addresses there.  This is an entirely different matter from the case in the <Col N="896" /> city.  This has improved the postal services in many areas but it has brought about a shockingly bad position in other areas.</P>
    <P>There is one case I should like to refer to.  The address of a certain person in County Meath was Woodtown, Drumconrath, Ardee.  Woodtown, Ardee, is three miles away from Ardee.  The new address was Woodtown, Drumconrath, Navan, which is a distance of 24 or 25 miles away from Navan.  It took letters three or four days to go out to this person's place, whereas formerly it took only one day.  There is another aspect to this.  People travelling around the country tend to go by postal addresses. If a person in Drogheda is told that somebody's address is Woodtown, Drumconrath, Navan, and goes over to Navan to find him, he discovers he has just left a place within a few miles of where the person lives.  That is something that has caused a lot of confusion.  Travelling around the country we find we are miles away from where we wanted to go, and there is nothing we can do about it but retrace our steps.  I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about this matter, but if he can, I should like him to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the matter of direct dialling in the country districts. I do not agree with him at all. Perhaps he had an unfortunate experience. However, I think it is a wonderful improvement.  I make as many trunk calls as anyone and I have yet to make one and get a wrong number.  That is more than I could say previously.</P>
    <P>The past year has been perhaps a very heavy one for the Minister, but, speaking as one who has been very critical of him in many spheres, I think he has done extremely well.  While his Estimate is much bigger than those responsible for the public purse would like, nevertheless, if services are to be given, the money must be provided.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say this: within the past few days, a new threepenny commemorative stamp was issued.  In view of the fact that the ordinary postal rate will be increased to four-pence in some weeks' time, why was <Col N="897" /> the new stamp not held up until the fourpenny rate came into force and issued as a 4d. stamp?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <P>Looking at the Minister's statement, one thing strikes me rather forcibly&mdash;the Department is paying its way.  That is one thing we are glad to hear.  The Department is being run, like all good Departments should be, on business lines.  It is paying its way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to learn that it is paying its way on sound business lines.  Taking the staff end of it, I was glad to hear of the results of this work study which was introduced in the Department.  We hear quite a lot about work study throughout the country and a lot of suggestions that the system should be adopted in all Departments in order to cut down costs.  It has had good results in this Department.  There are 35 fewer people employed in the Accounts Branch of the Department now as compared with 1948.  That is a big reduction when one considers that most Departments have been increasing their staffs.</P>
      <P>It is good also to see that the claims of 90 per cent. of the staff have been settled by agreement, but I should like to see the other ten per cent. get the same treatment.  They are the postmasters and postmistresses.  I feel that when the Minister meets them he will consider their case sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area, the automatic line from Dublin to Sligo passes along the main <Col N="898" /> road on which two important exchanges, Enfield and Kilcock, are situated not so far away.  Maynooth and Leixlip and Kinnegad are on the automatic switch.  Enfield and Kilcock are on the old system and I know they would feel very happy if they could be put on the exchange.  It looks peculiar to see the automatic line running past the door and yet to be working on the old system.  Ballivor which is only five or six miles away from Raharney, which is automatic, is connected to Enfield, a long and tedious service.  It is covering a big area, including Castlerickard, Rathmolyon and Longwood.</P>
    <P>In North Kildare, they are putting in quite a number of new exchanges. In areas such as these, postmasters and postmistresses have been for years trying to build up a service by canvassing new subscribers so that they might get higher rates of pay.  They have been rather successful, only to find that the Department came along to say: &ldquo;You have too many subscribers for your switchboard; we will have to go down the road and establish a new switch&rdquo;. Consequently, the people they had recruited to the service are being lost to them as well as a certain proportion of their pay.  They feel rather annoyed about it and if something could be done about it, they would be greatly pleased.  If there were automatic exchanges, their conditions would be much improved.  After they have worked very long hours, it is particularly galling when they see their colleagues in offices down the road free at six o'clock, while they have to work on.</P>
    <P>I see from the Estimate that 184,000 miles of telephone lines were laid down last year but it does not seem to be nearly enough because we see that the waiting list has risen to 10,000.  This is a service which is particularly paying its way.  All it needs is capital to enlarge its operations and I would urge the Minister for Finance to provide more capital so that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be able to get down to solving the problem of this long waiting list.</P>
    <P>The telephone is very important these days.  Even in the case of farmers, it saves a lot of trouble when they can telephone for the services they need.  Shopkeepers, doctors and <Col N="899" /> priests all have telephones in their houses and all people have to do, particularly in the spring and the busy season, is telephone.  It is particularly useful to the farmer if his machinery breaks down.  Instead of going from place to place seeking replacements, he can telephone the different agents till he finds one who has the required part.  Then he can go directly and fetch it.</P>
    <P>While on this subject, I should like to express appreciation of the fact that automatic exchanges are to be brought to the Curragh Camp, Ballyshannon and Kildare before the end of the year. This will definitely speed the service up and will mean a lot of relief for subpostmasters and subpostmistresses.</P>
    <P>There are still people in a few areas in my constituency, such as Croboy and Hill of Down, who have cause for complaint about the postal deliveries. They get their mail as late as four o'clock in the afternoon and that does not give them much chance of replying until the following day.  It is particularly hard on communities who do a lot of correspondence with the Meath County Council.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to the resolution agreed unanimously among the members of the Agricultural Committee of the European Parliamentary Assembly that Great Britain and Denmark should accept the basic rules of their common agricultural policy; if Ireland's position was reviewed as well as that of these countries; if it has been asked to accept these basic principles; and, if so, why no reference was made to this country in view of the fact that application for full membership of the EEC has been lodged by Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press reports of the discussion in the Agricultural <Col N="900" /> Committee of the European Parliamentary Assembly to which the Deputy refers.  I understand that this discussion was based on a report which had been prepared on certain farm problems raised by the British and Danish applications to join the European Economic Community and that the members of the committee agreed that Britain and Denmark should accept the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.  As Deputies are aware, in my statement to the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the Community on the 18th January last, I indicated that Ireland agreed with the aims and principles of the Community's policy for agriculture.</P>

      <P>I do not know what exactly the Deputy has in mind. The communiqué issued after the meeting he mentioned said that the committee has agreed that, like Britain, Denmark must accept the basic principles of the common agricultural policy.  We have accepted these basic principles, so no question arises in our case.</P>

      <P>Does acceptance of the basic agricultural principles set out in the Treaty of Rome also mean that we have now accepted what has emerged from the recent discussions on agriculture among &ldquo;The Six&rdquo; themselves?

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the same point.  Policy decisions taken by the Community are, I assume, subject to revision from time to time. So far as we can now interpret these decisions, they do not seem likely to create any problem for ourselves.  It is to be recognised that the decisions already recorded represent only about 50 per cent. of the task before the Community in finalising their agricultural policy.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy refers to the allowances which are payable under the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations, 1960, to certain classes of chronically disabled persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These regulations prescribe that the maximum rate of allowance shall be 22/6d. a week and that in determining the amount of the allowance for a particular person, the health authority shall have regard to his means other than income from public assistance. Returns furnished to my Department show that on 31st March, 1961, more than 90 per cent. of the 1,546 allowances being paid by the Dublin Health Authority were at the maximum rate. Expenditure on these allowances in the yeor ended 31st March, 1961, in <Col N="907" /> the area concerned amounted to £74,597.</P>

      <P>I presume that the information required by the Deputy relates to taxes and duties accounted for by the Revenue Commissioners, and that the direct taxes which he has in mind are Income Tax, Sur-tax, Corporation Profits Tax, Death Duties and Stamp Duties, and the indirect taxes the Customs and Excise Duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> The figures for the year to 31st March, 1961, are 34.02 per cent. for direct taxes and 65.98 per cent. for indirect taxes.  The corresponding figures for the year to 30th September, 1961, are 34.36 per cent. and 65.64 per cent. respectively.  The figures for the year to 31st March, 1962, will not be available until after that date.</P>

      <P>While we object to the principle of limitation on our freedom <Col N="912" /> to export butter and, as already indicated, do not regard our allocation as satisfactory any comments we might make on allocations made to other countries would not improve our position.</P>

      <P>I would answer the Supplementary Question in this way. In the course of discussions with the British on a matter of this nature, while it is appropriate to draw attention if you are aware of it, to the treatment meted out to other countries, in the main, I think the most advantageous approach is to base your case, as we did, on other factors that, to our way of reasoning, should have a stronger bearing on the treatment meted out to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter was issued by my predecessor to the various statutory companies and semi-State bodies for which he was responsible indicating that it was the desire of the Government that full weight should be given to the importance of Irish in connection with appointments and promotions made by them and urging that to the utmost practicable extent they should apply, in connection with appointments and promotions made by them, conditions and requirements in regard to Irish corresponding to those in the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>In the case of C.I.E. there is a provision in the Transport Acts providing that entry to the clerical grades (with certain limited exceptions) shall be by open competition and that Irish shall be a compulsory subject in every open competition held under the Act.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that when an application was recently made to a semi-State body in Irish, the application was answered in English?  The person was never subsequently interviewed but was written to again in English and told that the appointment was made.  In the light of all these facts, is it possible that the person who received the letter did not understand what was written in Irish?

Only a limited number of private carriers operate horse transport, other than by contract with the Board, to and from CIE Stations.

How this money was distributed by counties may be ascertained from the nine annual reports which have been presented to the Oireachtas.  The report for the year ending 31st March, 1962, has, of course, not yet been submitted to me <Col N="919" /> by An Foras Tionscal.  It is not the practice to disclose any of the information which will be in the annual report of An Foras Tionscal in advance of its publication.  In addition to the reports by An Foras Tionscal, there were two reports on grants by the Industrial Development Authority, covering the period from the 27th December, 1956, to the 26th August, 1959, when the Industrial Grants Act, 1956, was in operation.</P>

    <P>(i)  he has, at any time before <Col N="927" /> making his application, been ordinarily resident in any urban area for a period of five years, or for a number of periods which amount in the aggregate to five years, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  he has been ordinarily resident in any urban area for at least one year immediately preceding the application, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  he has had at least three months employment in any urban area within the year immediately preceding the application;</P>
    <P>(The urban areas for the purposes of the Acts are the county boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford, the borough of Dún Laoghaire and the urban districts of Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Galway, Kilkenny, Sligo, Tralee and Wexford.  Residence in a house owned by the Local Authority of an urban area but situated outside the area is deemed to be residence in the urban area.)</P>
    <P>(g)  in the case of widow or spinster who has no dependent, that not less than fifty-two employment contributions under the Social Welfare Acts have been paid in respect of her at the appropriate rate during the four Contribution Years preceding the Contribution Year in which application for unemployment assistance is made.</P>
    <P>Note: With regard to (a), persons affected by the two Employment Period Orders made each year under the Unemployment Assistance Acts are deemed not to be unemployed during the period specified in the relevant Order and are thus debarred from the receipt of assistance during such period.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATUTORY DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE.</P>
    <P>A person is disqualified for receiving unemployment assistance:</P>

    <P>(d)  while in receipt of or entitled to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  a pension as a blind person under the Old Age Pension Acts, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  any disability benefit or unemployment benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  any widow's (contributory) pension or maternity allowance under the Social Welfare Acts or any widow's (non-contributory) pension under the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Acts; or</P>
    <P>(2)  If he loses his employment through his misconduct or voluntarily leaves his employment without just cause.  (The disqualification in this type of case is for the period of three months from the date when he so lost or left his employment or for such shorter period, not being less than one week, as may be determined); or</P>
    <P>(3)  If he loses his employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute at the place or premises at which he was employed. (Subject to certain exceptions the disqualification lasts as long as the stoppage of work continues); or</P>
    <P>(4)  If he is convicted in Court of an offence under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  (The disqualification in this type of case is for six months from the date of conviction).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I remind the Deputy that only last week this House accepted an amendment, moved by the Minister for Finance, to a motion calling for a review of pensions, to the effect that proposals concerning pensions charged on the Public Revenue should be considered only in conjunction with the Budget when they can be related to the taxation required to implement them.  In the course of the debate on that motion I assured the House that the question of increases to pensioners and social welfare beneficiaries will be considered as favourably as possible.  Regarding the latter part of the question I might say that, in general, I do not favour schemes of assistance in kind but would prefer improvements in pensions to take the form of cash which pensioners can spend as they wish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of abolishing the means test for non-contributory old age pensions is estimated to be of the order of £3¾ million yearly. I might say, however, that its abolition would not be of any advantage to the vast majority of non-contributory old age pensioners, over 90 per cent. of whom already qualify for the maximum rate of pension under the existing means test, and it would involve payment of pension to people who are not in need of assistance from the State.</P>

These <Col N="930" /> increases are proportionately greater than the increase in the cost of living between 1944 and the present day. Consequently a comparison of the increase in the cost of living with the increases which have taken place in children's allowances since their introduction would not provide a basis for further increasing them.</P>

      <P>Demand for turbary in this district generally is being met by the current development by the Land Commission, at an estimated cost of £13,000, of 900 acres of bog&mdash;in the townland of Carrickanaghter, Garrynagowna and Clonown, about two to three miles distant&mdash;which is intended to provide turbary facilities for 400 persons.  Some allotments have, in fact, already been made on this bog. <Col N="935" /> Development, including drainage, of the relatively small area of turbary on hands in Cornafulla must await the outcome of this major scheme, and it is not at present possible, therefore, to indicate when such work can be undertaken.</P>

      <P>A proposal on the lines referred to in that reply came from a Land Commission Inspector about 30 years ago. Whilst a firm estimate of the cost of such a project does not appear to have been made at the time, the probable cost was regarded as likely to be prohibitive.  As I have already stated, no scheme was prepared by the Land Commission as, apart from other considerations, marine reclamation was not their function.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission, I propose to circulate a table with the Official <Col N="944" /> Report giving figures for the years 1959, 1960 and 1961.</P>
      <P>As arising out of the coming into operation of the Local Authorities (Education Scholarships) (Amendment) Act, 1961, entirely new schemes of scholarships will operate for 1962, it would not be possible to make, with any degree of accuracy, a projection as to how many scholarships will be awarded in that year.  It can, however, be stated that the amount of money available for new scholarships in 1962 will in the case of post-primary scholarships be over 300 per cent, greater than in 1961 and in the case of university scholarships over 200 per cent greater.</P>
      <P>Following is the table:</P>

      <P>Detective agencies are not required to have a licence and I have no official knowledge as to their headquarters or their number, though it may be taken that the number is very small. There is not, in my view, any likelihood that agencies of this kind may be used for espionage purposes and I do not propose to take any action in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister a situation in my parish where the same telegraph poles are carrying telegraph lines from two post offices.  This is happening on the line from Kinnegad <Col N="975" /> to Ballinabrackey which is automatic. There are two houses on that line and they have to get their line from Castlejordan as that is not automatic.  The line for Castlejordan is in front of Ballinabrackey post office with the result that the two houses have to wait quite a long time to get a telephone call when their neighbour down the road can, by dialling, get the service. It seems strange that that should occur.</P>
      <P>Another matter I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister is the postal service at Tyrellspass, Rochfortbridge and Miltownpass.  The delivery van comes from Kilbeggan each morning and leaves the post in these three towns but will not take out any post. They maintain there is not sufficient post to warrant delivery at this time. The people there feel that if the service were provided there would be sufficient post to warrant the delivery man delaying just a little longer to take up a small bag and put it into his van. It seems a hardship that people have to post early in the afternoon when they could post at night time or later in the evening to catch the post the following morning.</P>
      <P>I was glad to see from the Minister's speech that the amount in the Post Office Savings Bank had increased by £1 million last year.  I think all of us would agree that next to the piggy bank the savings bank and savings certificates are appropriate in encouraging children to save.  I would like to see more advertising done.  I know there are advertisements in the post offices but I should like to see advertisements in the newspapers as well to encourage children to save. They are hardly going to go to a bank at an early age.  This is the first bank that is open to them.  The Post Office is also providing a good service in relation to prize bonds Those two services alone are bringing in a lot more than what the Minister for Finance would be looking for in a National Loan.  I think the two services have brought in something like £32 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to postmen, where the occupant of a pensionable post retires <Col N="976" /> in a country area and needs to be replaced by a qualified man, that qualified man would usually be a boy who had been delivering telegrams and then been put on the postal service.  In a small place like Kinnegad, Longwood and Carbury, for instance, there are very few telegrams coming through and consequently you do not employ a telegraph boy.  Therefore nobody can qualify for the post.  I would urge the Minister that when a temporary man has been filling it to the satisfaction of his Department and the satisfaction of the people to whom he is delivering the post, the Minister should consider making him permanent.  He is doing exactly the same work as his predecessor but he does not get the same facilities. When he retires he will just go out on the ordinary old age pension because his post is not pensionable. That is a hardship on that man.</P>
    <P>I wish to congratulate the Television Authority on the good work they have done over the past three months.  We have all been very pleased with the service which has resulted.  The Authority have realised that there was a challenge to them which they have met very satisfactorily.  They have been depending on advertising from our own firms here so they had to produce a good service.  This service had to come from very limited resources.  U.T.V. have resources up to £80 million and the B.B.C. have something like half of that.  I believe our own Television Authority are providing as good a service if not a better one than that being provided by the other two corporations. They have been looking to the future. They realise that on the Continent and in America, the 625 line is regarded as better, but in order not to inflict hardship on our own viewers who are looking in on the other two programmes they decided to provide the 405 service, leaving themselves the option to change over at some future date.  However, for the people in the south of Ireland, the 625 line service will be second to none.</P>
    <P>I should like Telefís Éireann to go down the country now and again, perhaps once a week, and do a feature on amateur plays.  Drama is becoming quite popular in the rural areas. <Col N="977" /> Even in remote halls in the heart of the country drama groups are putting on plays.  Some of them are quite good.  If Telefís Éireann filmed some of these plays it would give a tremendous incentive to people to produce exceptionally well.  Someone from Telefís Éireann could go down and watch a performance.  Later in the week, if his report were favourable, a film could be made of the play, or of extracts from it.  That would bring many more on to the television screen. It would provide encouragement to these groups and would also provide them with some money.</P>
    <P>I remember years ago when every Sunday night Radio Éireann produced an Abbey play.  Most people looked forward to that feature.  The Abbey players are renowned.  They have played on Broadway and on the Continent and everywhere they have been acclaimed.  I should like to see more of these plays and players on television.</P>
    <P>I should like, also, to see a programme produced by the Department of Agriculture.  Native films on Telefís Éireann will help our tourist industry.  Our scenery is very photogenic. Killarney is famed in song and story.  The scenery of the West and parts of the Midlands is without compare.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on the good work they have been doing.  It is a matter for congratulation that the Department have been paying their way for the past five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to learn from the Minister that there is a deficit of £1,000,000 in his Department. His Department is, generally speaking, regarded as a profitmaking concern.  It is unfortunate that it should not be making a profit now, though it does seem to be improving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the minimum charge for a sealed letter will be 4d. and a heavier letter can travel at the same rate.  Apparently it is only the minimum weight that will <Col N="978" /> be affected.  This charge will be a heavy burden on those who use the postal service extensively.  A business concern with a bill at present at £400&mdash; there are quite a number of them; some may have bills as high as £4,000 &mdash;will have to pay £133 extra in future for postage.  This impost will not hit the casual who writes an odd letter.  It is business firms that will have to bear the brunt of it.  In addition to that extra charge for postage, there will be an extra charge of £1 10/- on telephone rentals.  That will be a heavy imposition on the private individual who makes, perhaps two calls in a day, or a dozen calls in the week.  He will be harder hit than the business firm making 100 calls in the day.</P>
    <P>We should examine the position of auxiliary postmen.  These men get their names and photographs in the papers after 45 years' service.  They are then thrown on the scrapheap, with an old age pension, or some other pittance to keep them alive.  It is time some superannuation scheme was devised for these men.  It is not beyond the capacity of our officials to devise a suitable scheme.  They are one of the few classes now of regular workers for whom there is no pension scheme.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that some of them work only four hours in the day, or possibly six.  They start at eight o'clock in the morning and finish at midday or two o'clock in the afternoon.  Whatever time it is, they must perform these duties.  They must be available every morning six mornings in the week to provide this public service.  It has been argued that if they finish at 12 o'clock, 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock, they can take up other part-time employment if such is available.  But it is not always possible for these men to find suitable other employment near home after a hard day's work up to finishing time.  Finishing time varies in different places, according to the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Those postmen may have gone out early in the morning, may have been drenched to the skin and braved the storm.  They have to cover their rounds within a specified time.  They are expected to follow a rigid time-table in the matter of deliveries, and the public expect them to be there on time.  I am <Col N="979" /> emphasising these points to show these men are giving public service.  They are considered to be in part-time employment and are paid so much per hour.  Surely a pension scheme could be devised for them based on each man's particular earnings and whether he works four hours, six hours or full time?  By &ldquo;full time&rdquo; I mean that he works what is regarded as a full 40-hour week or whatever the figure would be.</P>
    <P>The time has come when a pension scheme should be devised for these auxiliary postmen instead of having them retire with a few words of praise after 45 years' service when they are no longer able to go on.  Other workers who do not have to work so hard have pension schemes and can retire at 65, but in the case of the auxiliary postman it is a question of whether his health will allow him to go on until he reaches 70 and qualifies for the old age pension.  We find there is a great number of auxiliary postmen with ten, 20 and 25 years' service who have no prospect of getting a pension.  Most people in the public service have the benefit of pensions.</P>
    <P>I notice the Minister's statement that fewer telephones were connected this year than last.  In other words, there seems to be a falling back in the connection of telephones.  The previous speaker mentioned that at present 10,000 people were waiting for telephones. I am glad to see from the Minister's statement that he intends on this occasion to apply for £3½ million compared with an average of £2 million in previous years.  That is a good investment.  No Minister for Finance should refuse the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs desiring to invest money in the telephone service.  Such investment not only improves the telephone service itself but improves trade, commerce and agriculture generally.  I hope the Minister will spend that £3½ million during the coming year and will provide more and larger exchanges.</P>
    <P>At present more than 200 people are awaiting telephones in County Dublin.  There are 60 applicants in the Rush area.  They cannot be told <Col N="980" /> when it is likely they will have the service, but they are told that the existing exchange facilities are working to full capacity and that if extra subscribers were taken on those already on the exchange would be deprived of the service.  I should like the Minister and his technicians to go into this in more detail.  I shall discuss the position in Rush, because the pattern there is the same as in all areas where people are waiting for the service.</P>
    <P>First, I think these 60 applicants should be classified as to whether they are shopkeepers, farmers, professional people or retired people.  Then the average number of calls per day these people are likely to make should be worked out.  Some of them might use the telephone on only three occasions in a whole day, whereas others might use it 50 times a day.  Therefore, extra subscribers could be taken on if they were not likely to make much use of the phone and would not upset the existing service until such time as more modern equipment could be provided and all the applicants in the area were catered for.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan mentioned the ordinary mouthpiece provided, which is an extremely heavy and substantial instrument.  I understand that a lighter Swedish type is available for those people prepared to pay a substantial price for it.  I am open to correction on this, but I believe there is a regulation which prohibits the subscriber replacing the cumbersome, heavy instrument with the light and much easier to use Swedish one.  I need not describe it.  It is a combined dialling, speaking and listening apparatus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there <Col N="981" /> was some regulation that they were not really free to substitute these instruments for what is officially provided. I have dealt with the increase in the number of applicants on the waiting list to 10,000.  A very special effort should be made to provide them with the service and the classification as suggested for the Rush exchange area could be applied to those 10,000 subscribers in order to see how many of them could be connected.</P>
      <P>There are others for whom the telephone service is very important. They may be engaged in business and they would only tie up the service if their calls began to go through exchanges which were not up to sufficient capacity.  Naturally they must await their turn.  In Dublin County that situation is growing in several areas.  There are at least four exchange areas in County Dublin where there are about 25 applicants awaiting connection.  There are 60 applicants in the Rush exchange area alone.  Something must be done about improving the equipment in such exchanges.  I feel sure the equipment in the Rush exchange would be very useful if it were dismantled and taken to an area where there would not be so many subscribers.  A larger set of equipment could, in turn, be provided at Rush.</P>
      <P>The same would apply to other areas where the equipment is now incapable of catering for the heavy volume of telephone traffic.  I was glad to see that the automatic telex system seems to be expanding, albeit very slowly.  There were only about 20 extra telex sets provided in the past couple of years.  This is very important, particularly having regard to the desire to increase our export trade.  In fact most of these telex systems are being operated by people who have trading activities with the Continent of Europe and, with the prospect of the Common Market and the probability then of a considerable amount of inter-communication and trade between the member countries, this telex system seems to be the answer as far as telecommunication is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="982" /> It should be encouraged and if there is any way of inducing exporters to acquire telex sets all the better because it will certainly assist us to expand our trade and sell our goods if we can have direct communication with traders on the Continent who desire to trade with us.  We are anxious to increase our trade with a number of countries but figures have shown that in a number of countries our trade has been falling.  Improved communication, public relations and salesmanship could remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>After severe storms in this country thousands of people are left without a telephone service, mainly because trees fall across the wires and because other damage is done.  All that inconvenience lends support to the idea that telephone lines should be put underground as far as possible.  It would be desirable to encourage this underground cable system, particularly between the larger centres.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned something about post office appointments.  I understood a few years ago, after the Baltinglass racket, that arrangements were made to prevent any interference with the appointment of postmasters&mdash; that they would be selected and appointed without any reference to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">

      <P>In the course of his statement, the Minister mentioned that there are 48 extra cross-channel lines provided via Belfast but unless we are to have a completely new system&mdash;and the Minister did mention the microwave system&mdash;across the Irish Sea it seems we must face the fact that we will have to lay a submarine cable.  I feel sure the technical men have examined that question of a submarine cable across the Irish Sea in order to relieve the telecommunication burden between the two countries.  It is very gratifying to see by the Minister's speech that there is a great prospect of an internal microwave system which would improve the service very rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that deposits in the Savings Bank are more or less static.  People are not being encouraged to put more of their money in the Post Office.  Saving at the moment stand at a little over £80 million.  It is a sizable amount.  Most of that money comes from people who have deposited very small amounts.  I doubt whether there would be much money on the limit for deposit in the post office which at the moment is £1,200.  I doubt if there would be many accounts with £1,200.  I think <Col N="984" /> this £85 million is made up mostly by people who have small Post Office Savings Bank Accounts.</P>
    <P>I consider that the interest on that money, especially when it is in small amounts and considering its value to the State, should be increased.  An effort should be made to pay more than the existing rate of interest to depositors. Many people have thought so little of the interest available to them in the post office that they have invested in what they consider another gilt-edged security, namely, the Prize Bonds.</P>
    <P>Instead of waiting to accept the annual interest on the money on deposit in the Post Office they have decided instead to take it out and to take a chance by investing in Prize Bonds from which they get no interest but have a chance of a lucky draw.  I believe that if the interest on Post Office Savings Bank accounts were made more attractive, people would continue to leave their money there. Savings Certificates are certainly very attractive for people who are prepared to wait until the date of maturity.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give us much information about the activities of the Savings Committee.  Tribute was paid to them in the past for the very useful work they have done and the encouragement they have given to people to save.  The Savings Committee is considered to be very useful from the point of view of encouraging thrift amongst people who have money which might otherwise be wasted instead of being made available to the State for national investment.</P>
    <P>Some day or other, we shall have to examine the whole system of payment of subpostmasters.  Only for the fact that many of them are engaged in other activities, usually running a little shop along with their post office, they could not possibly give the service. They could not afford to keep their post office open on the small allowance given to them to run the business and pay assistants.</P>
    <P>According as our social services expand, these subpostmasters are called upon to give extra service.  In parts of the city, for instance, you will <Col N="985" /> see long queues of people on the first Tuesday of every month, waiting for payment of children's allowances.  That service has been imposed on the subpostmasters. Similarly, they have to provide a telephone service where there are no automatic exchanges.  They have to issue wireless licences, apart from postal orders, money orders, stamps and so on.</P>
    <P>The main thing is that subpostmasters have to employ assistants in order to give this service.  The amount of money made available to the subpostmasters is so limited that many post office assistants are very badly paid.  Certainly they are not sufficiently paid for the time and the amount of service they give the public.  Therefore, some time or other, we shall have to alter the system that exists at the moment whereby subpostmasters are required to provide so many services and are allowed such a small amount of money, in order to ensure that these services will efficiently be given&mdash;and they are efficiently given because there is a very regular inspection from the Post Office.  The inspectors walk into those offices and take over and check everything, and rightly so.  Post offices have to be operated efficiently in order that the inspectors will be satisfied. They are kept up to date by frequent inspections.</P>
    <P>We were to have a central sorting office for this city.  I should like to hear from the Minister just what are the prospects of having it very soon. This city has grown very large.  A central sorting office is desirable as soon as it can be provided.  I know that everything cannot be done at once but it seems that a sorting office at the moment is very desirable.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point regarding Christmas sorting.  Something should be done in an organised way regarding the sorting of the Christmas mail. If I know it rightly, what happens at the moment is that some few weeks before Christmas a number of schoolboys or, if you like, a number of juveniles, are recruited to assist with the sorting of the mail during the Christmas rush.  At the same time, there are family men who are registered as unemployed and who might <Col N="986" /> be able and willing to work the few days or the few weeks in the Post Office.  Preference should be given to such men rather than to schoolboys. It would be all very well to bring in schoolboys if we had already provided for the unemployed family man who could do with the pay available for this type of work.</P>
    <P>There was something which I wished to say in relation to the television service but I shall leave it over for the moment.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cupla focail a rá ar an Meastachán seo. From the very lengthy speech the Minister has made it is evident to everybody why it is necessary to provide this money.  There have been increases in salaries, wages and allowances, which account for quite a big slice.  The Estimate provides an opportunity for people to make reference to various branches of the Post Office and the various sections under the jurisdiction of the Minister.  I am glad to see that a sum of money is allocated to the renovation and provision of buildings and sites.  I know that in many places there is a need to replace the old inadequate and dilapidated buildings.  In particular, the county town in the constituency from which I come is very much in need of a new post office.  That was placed on the long finger for quite a while. We are hoping that in the near future something will be done to remedy that situation.</P>
      <P>I should like to make some reference to Radio Éireann.  While the programmes are balanced, at the same time, I think that very often some of the programmes come on the air at an inopportune time.  Judging from the country districts, there is no great need for having so much of the time of Radio Éireann devoted to symphony concerts.  I realise that the allotment of time to these various programmes is probably not a matter for the Minister, but I should like to refer to the matter here and now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the greatest national blunders ever made in this country in recent times was the sabotaging of our short wave station when it had almost come into existence. Radio in modern times is a very important medium whereby a nation can get its view across to neighbouring countries.  We in Ireland were very badly handicapped by virtue of the fact that we were unable to get our national programmes across to our exiles.  It is true to say that even in the cities of London, Birmingham and other places, where there are huge concentrations of Irish exiles, unfortunately they are unable to listen to our Irish programmes.  Indeed, they are unable to enjoy the many Irish programmes which our radio provides for local listeners.  The same thing applies to our exiles in America.</P>
      <P>When, in the month of September, we are faced with trying to broadcast the all-Ireland hurling and football finals across the world, we are at the mercy of some outside agency so that we can ensure that our exiles will at least hear these finals.  That, I think, is a very important link for a mother country to maintain with her exiles.  It was a national catastrophe that the short wave station was sabotaged at a time when we had actually secured an international wavelength.  I do not know whether it could be possible to remedy that situation now or whether, in view of the advances made by television in recent years, it would be worth the cost.  However, I think the cost should not be a deterrent.  If it were at all possible to start even now, it would, from the national point of view, be very desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so well versed in regard to Telefís Éireann getting their programmes across to our exiles or whether they are able to beam that far but I want heartily to congratulate them and the Minister concerned.  I can safely say that the Minister has carved for himself a niche in the history of this country by his dynamic driving power in seeing to it that we, a small and young nation with very limited resources, would not come in <Col N="988" />&ldquo;at the heel of the hunt&rdquo;, so to speak, but would take our rightful place in providing our people with the most up-to-date way of entertainment and raise the prestige of our country in the eyes of our own people and those of our exiles.</P>
    <P>The visual aids are very important methods of getting one's message across to the people in our country, our exiles and those who are watching us in other lands.  We should ensure that we will maintain the very high standard which has already been set by Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>The choice of emblem for Telefís Éireann was a very laudable one as it spans thousands of years of our country's history.  The Irish language should get, as I think it is getting, fair representation on the programmes.  I am not a constant viewer but I must compliment the service for the programme in which a ventriloquist uses both Irish and English.  It is a very laudable and very effective way of getting across the language to our people, many of whom are now bilingual. It does not bore anyone and it is one of the many ways in which a national television service can help to uplift the morale of the country.  It can also do much to ensure our survival as a nation.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to see that nothing that would take from our greatness as a nation would be allowed to appear on any of those programmes. I could mention programmes for national schools, colleges and so forth but I think it will suffice to refer briefly to the matter at present and leave it until the other Estimate comes up.</P>
    <P>I realise that this question of telephones is a very big matter for any Minister to face because in recent years the demand for public and private telephones has been more or less phenomenal. In view of the many services now sponsored by co-operative creameries and various other institutions, the telephone service has become very important and is used to a great extent by the farmers.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the various items of State aid for agriculture and for industry in respect of the years 1960-61 and 1961-62, and in so far as the Volume of Estimates already published is concerned for 1962-63, in the form of a reply of 8th February, 1961.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy in respect of 1960-61 and 1961-62 is set out hereunder. The figures for 1960-61 are of actual expenditure and for 1961-62 are the Budget Estimates as increased by supplementary estimates since passed.  As regards 1962-63 many of the relevant figures appear not in the Volume of Estimates but in the Tables in connection with the Financial Statement which will not be available until Budget day.  If the Deputy asks another question after the Budget I will be glad to provide the information in respect of 1962-63.</P>
