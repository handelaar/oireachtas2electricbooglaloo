      <P>Under the Rome Treaty, the Commission of the European Economic Community is the competent body to decide which aids granted by Member States are incompatible with the provisions of the Treaty by reason of the fact that they distort or threaten to distort competition. The Commission has the obligation to examine, with Member States, the systems of aid in operation.  Pending such an examination in our case, it would not be possible to say which aids might be regarded as incompatible with the Treaty, but it is to be understood that it is the purposes for <Col N="710" /> which aid is given, and not the total amount of the aid, which would be involved in this examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government have accepted the repercussions on the smallholder here implicit in the Rome Treaty provisions to the effect that the citizens of Germany, Italy, France and the other members of EEC will have the same property rights and the same right to acquire property in Ireland as Irish nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I indicated, in my statement to the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Economic Community on the 18th January, that the Government accepted the provisions of the Rome Treaty concerning the Right of Establishment and that we were prepared to remove the restrictions in this regard which at present exist in step with the other members of the Community. Article 54 of the Rome Treaty empowers the Council, on a proposal of the Commission, to issue a directive enabling a national of one Member State to acquire real property situated in the territory of another Member State, but this may be done only to the extent that certain principles laid down in Article 39, paragraph 2, of the Treaty for the working out of the common agricultural policy must not be infringed.</P>
      <P>The Community have not yet decided how these provisions of the Treaty are to be operated in practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that at a recent function in Tralee, the Minister for Lands stated quite clearly that in this new United States of Europe, while our people will have exactly the same rights as the citizens of the other European countries in regard to the purchase of property, these citizens of Germany, France and other European countries will have equal rights and opportunities here in regard to the purchase of property?  In view of that statement, <Col N="711" /> is there not an implication that the small farmer in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect, in any event.  While it is perfectly true, as the Minister for Lands said, that one member of the Community will have the same rights and obligations as another, the extent to which the right to acquire property will be exercised in respect of agricultural land is limited in the Rome Treaty.  In any event, no interpretation of it has yet been made, so far as I know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether Paragraph 5 of the <i>Aide Mémoire</i> of 8th February 1949 addressed to the Government of the U.S.A. which lays down that while the Six Counties of Northern Ireland are occupied by British Forces any military alliance with, or commitment involving military action jointly with, Britain would be entirely repugnant and unacceptable to the Irish people, still represents the Government's attitude to NATO or any military grouping of which Britain is a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my reply to a somewhat similar Question addressed to me in this House on the 14th of this month by Deputy Cosgrave to which I have nothing to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if, in view of his stated approval on a number of occasions recently of NATO and the objectives of NATO, he will state whether it is the Government's intention, if invited, to join NATO?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to me to be a different question, of which notice should be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The situation up to now has been that Ireland is precluded from joining NATO on account of Partition.  In view of the altered views of the Taoiseach, as shown in his recent replies to the effect that he approves of NATO and that there is nothing in the NATO Agreement to complicate our position in regard to Partition, would he now state whether it is the Government's intention, if invited, to join NATO?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>aide mémoire</i> stated that there was general agreement with the aims of the North Atlantic Treaty and if that is the position of all the Parties in the House, it certainly is the position of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>On 17th May, 1961, the Minister for External Affairs stated in the House that the Government had no intention at that time of departing from the policy laid down by the Government in 1949.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main body of law relating to the provision of health services dates back no further than 1947.  Thus, law reform as such is not at the present time a significant issue in so far as health services are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some earlier laws in operation governing specific functions of the Minister for Health.  My current legislative programme has included Bills providing for revision of some of these <Col N="714" /> earlier laws.  Such revisions have been made by the Poisons Act, 1961, and are proposed in the Pharmacy Bill and the State Lands (Workhouses) Bill which are at present before the Oireachtas.  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to a reply given by me on the 22nd February to a question by him regarding the law on marriage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that there has been considerable delay in the provision of dentures for certain eligible persons in County Laois.</P>
      <P>The supply of dentures to persons in the lower income group is primarily a matter for the health authority.  It is only fair to the authority that I should point out that, in common with most other health authorities, they are concentrating their limited resources mainly on the provision of dental services for children as that group stand to benefit most from dental treatment.</P>
      <P>A restricted service for the supply of dentures to persons in the lower income group is in operation in County Laois, preference being given to expectant and nursing mothers, and to tuberculosis and other patients who are specially recommended dentures on medical grounds.  I propose to have enquiries made from the health authority to see whether improved arrangements can be made for the supply of dentures within their limited available resources.</P>

      <P>Advantage is being taken of every opportunity to promote exports of high-class horticultural produce, raw and processed.  As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware Britain is one of the largest importers of horticultural produce in the world and our exports have free access to that market.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this matter is that, because of the public agitation stirred up by a few people in a number of areas in which railways were to be closed, I carefully collected the figures for a short period in order to indicate the general position in regard to passengers and also in order to indicate the result of C.I.E. making changes, as they have a right to do.  I have no intention of starting to answer long detailed questions as to the number of passengers carried on this or that section of the railway.  Were I to do so, there would have to be a special staff in C.I.E. and I should have to have a special staff myself to compile the figures; there would be variations from year to year.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy, in the special debate on C.I.E., which took place last year, I gave exhaustive information, sufficient to indicate the various trends in transport, and so forth, which led to the closing of the three particular railway lines involved.  No one could have given more information to prove that the agitation was unnecessary.  In fact, the traffic carried on the particular line was negligible in comparison with the traffic along the road.  I gave all the information I could.  The debate, if I remember rightly, lasted for nearly a week.  At the end of it, I made an extensive and detailed reply, answering virtually every question asked during the course of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister now admits that the undertaking given just prior to the general election is invalidated and they do not propose to stand over it, does there not arise a new situation then in which Deputies should be entitled to get from some source, whether from the statistical section of C.I.E., or the Minister's Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but there is a duty on the Minister to provide statistical material and he cannot escape that duty on the ground that it would be <Col N="737" /> too expensive to collect it.  All I am asking is: has the time not come to change that situation and collect the information so that reasonably informed decisions can be taken by this House in a matter which, I submit, is no longer a matter of day-to-day administration but is, in fact, becoming a broad question of transport policy ?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I could not agree with the Deputy in that.  If the Deputy reads the background of the Transport Act of 1958, he will see it came to this House clearly in relation to the Transport Committee report.  It would only be if action by C.I.E. were to go far beyond the scope of that originally envisaged in the Act or some extraordinary circumstance arose in which they decided to close the whole railway system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that a new situation might develop.  In actual fact, the circumstances of the closing of these lines reveal quite clearly that the undertaking is acting well within the ambit of the 1958 Act.  That was fully understood by Deputies.  Any Deputy who reads the Berry Commission report and the statements of the Taoiseach would have to agree that nothing has happened&mdash;and nothing will happen, I believe&mdash;which goes beyond the general ambit of the considerations involved in the report, considerations fully delineated and, in some respects, amended and interpreted by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the light of the information he had on the subject.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision is being made in the Estimates for 1962/63 for total net receipts of £150,000 in the financial year beginning 1st April, 1962, from the three airports.  This represents receipts for a period of 11 months.  Exemptions and abatements will be made in respect of passengers in transit, passengers travelling on very short routes, children and aircraft crews.  It is not possible, at present, to forecast the full effect of these variations at each airport.  A rough estimate is that about £125,000 would be collected at Dublin, £20,000 at Shannon and £5,000 at Cork.  The amount received, however, will be brought to account as an Appropriation-in-Aid of the airports generally.</P>
      <P>If our traffic continues to increase at the 1958-1961 rate the contribution to airport revenues should reach the figure of £250,000 in a few years' time.</P>

Would the Minister consider insisting that the assessor should inspect the car before <Col N="743" /> it is insured so that a fair premium will be charged rather than have the present position in which insurance companies are raking off at the expense of the public?</P>

      <P>I would have certainly have put down an amendment if it had been deemed necessary.  The Deputy will recall that he questioned the propriety of the short title, Poynings' Act, 1495, provided for in the First Schedule.  I have looked at the matter again.  I should like to emphasise that we are not proposing in this Bill to interfere in any way with the title of what is popularly known as Poynings' Law.  In the First Schedule the Deputy will see that the statute to which we are assigning the short title, Poynings' Act, 1495, is Chapter 22 of 10 Henry the Seventh. This statute provided for the application to Ireland of certain English statutes.  The Poynings' Law of our history books is an entirely different <Col N="751" /> statute, namely, Chapter 4 of 10 Henry the Seventh.  That statute provided that no Irish Parliament could be held until the legislation proposed to be enacted by that Parliament had been sent to the English Council and returned under the English great seal. The terms Poynings' Law and Poynings' Act have in the past been employed ambiguously both by historians and by lawyers.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 30 to 34, and substitute the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;( ) Whenever the Minister is of opininon that any coroner or deputy coroner has been guilty of misconduct or neglect of duty or is unfit for office or incapable of the due discharge of his duties by reason of physical or mental infirmity, the Minister may send by registered post to such coroner or deputy coroner at his ordinary residence a notice in writing stating the said opinion and, if the Minister, after the expiration of seven days from the sending of the notice and after the consideration of the representations (if any) made to him by such coroner or deputy coroner, remains of the said opinion, he may by <Col N="752" /> order remove such coroner or deputy coroner from office.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment is being moved as a result of representations on Committee Stage that the present law regarding the removal of coroners from office, which is being re-enacted in Section 15, is defective in that it does not give the coroner concerned any opportunity of stating his side of the case before the order of removal from office is made.  The new provision is modelled on subsection (3) of Section 25 of the Local Government Act, 1941 and provides for the Minister giving at least seven days' notice to the coroner and considering any representations he may make during that period before coming to a final decision removing him from office.  It was Deputy M. J. O'Higgins who expressed concern about the provisions of the Bill as they stand and this amendment is to meet the point he put forward on Committee Stage.</P>

It was Deputy McGilligan, I think, who suggested that the phrase &ldquo;is a beneficiary&rdquo; was very narrow and that if the phrase were changed to &ldquo;a will under which he benefits&rdquo; or &ldquo;which benefits him&rdquo;, it would be more satisfactory.  I am agreeing with that view and substituting the word &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; for &ldquo;is a beneficiary&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's point of view in the amendment but I know some representations have been made to him in relation to this section.  I think that those representations arise partly through a misunderstanding of the section.  As I understand it&mdash;and I should like the Minister's confirmation of this&mdash;it is not merely that the person must have drawn up a will but that he must benefit under the will as well ?</P>

      <P>That is perfectly clear and obviously anybody who is getting a legacy under the will remembers that fact and the case that was made of a solicitor who might have drawn up a will and might have forgotten all about it would not be operative because it is narrowed by the &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo;.  But there is one case that might very easily arise with me, if I were a coroner.  I would draw a very great number of wills under which, in the ordinary course of events, with clients of my own, either I or my partner would be executor.  We would not remember that until we had taken out the will and had a look at it.  I think the Minister will find the phrase he is now introducing would cover the case of a solicitor who is an executor and who is benefiting, therefore, to the extent that he will be paid the normal professional charges in connection with his administration of the estate.  That is not what the Minister intended&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, I think the Minister will find that is so and I would ask him to examine it.  I accept that he did not intend that to be covered, but if the person himself, or perhaps his wife, got a legacy, it would be desirable that the person might not hold an inquest.  Let me put this analogy to the Minister that seems pretty conclusive to me.  A solicitor who is an executor and who is given in the will the appropriate power to charge and be paid his fees&mdash;I am sure the Minister knows that must be included in the will&mdash;is in exactly the same position as an ordinary legatee.  If he witnesses the will under which he is appointed executor, he has no power to charge for any work in the administration of the estate. That puts him in exactly the same position as a legatee.  I think, as the section is now to be worded, the effect of it will be not merely to cut out the person getting the legacy, which is what the Minister has in mind but, to me, before a solicitor who is a coroner can say whether he is going to hold an inquest or not, he will not merely have to try to remember whether the person concerned made a will but he will also have to try to remember whether he made the will appointing the solicitor executor or not.  I do not think that is desirable and I should be glad if the Minister would examine the situation from that point of view between now and the Seanad discussion on the Bill when it can be considered there.</P>

      <P>In page 13, lines 34 and 35, to delete &ldquo;murder or manslaughter&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;murder, infanticide or manslaughter&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will recall there was a discussion on Committee Stage on an amendment by Deputy O'Higgins which is similar to the amendment I have moved.  That amendment proposed that a coroner should be obliged to hold an inquest with a jury whenever he became of opinion that <Col N="756" /> deceased had come by his death by infanticide as well as by murder or manslaughter.  At that time, my view was that it was, strictly speaking, unnecessary to include infanticide because the initial charge in the case of infanticide is not, strangely enough, infanticide but murder, because our Infanticide Act of 1949 was framed, as explained by the then Minister for Justice when introducing the measure, to avoid any suggestion that this country's legislature had become less conscious of the sanctity of human life and provided therefore that the wilful killing of a human being, whether a newly-born infant or a man or woman in the prime of life, would remain an offence that would <i>prima facie</i> constitute murder.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) of Section 1 of the Act merely provides for the District Court having power to reduce a charge of murder to one of infanticide and to send the woman forward for trial on that charge.  The initial charge against a woman who wilfully causes the death of her infant child is, however, a charge of murder.  This is the view that has been taken by successive Attorneys General since the Act became law. Therefore, if the coroner is to consider the question whether or not to have a jury from the point of view of what the woman may be charged with, there is, I think, no need to have reference to infanticide.  However, if he looks at it from the point of view of what the person is going to be convicted of, then the word &ldquo;infanticide&rdquo; would be necessary.  While there is not much in it, I think, on balance, it is better to include infanticide and accordingly I move the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on its introduction because I feel it is very much overdue.  The pharmaceutical chemist, as is well known, is operating under a very old Act introduced in 1875 and amended in a minor way in 1890 and again, I think, in 1951. According to modern trends, the 1875 Act is completely outmoded, I suggest, from the point of view both of the conduct of the affairs of the Pharmaceutical Society and of the interests of the public.</P>
      <P>There are very many necessary changes in the Bill, as I see it.  It defines very clearly for the first time persons who are entitled to keep open shop.  In other words, it defines who an authorised person is.  As the Minister said in his opening remarks, there is a minor alteration with regard to medical practitioners but, in actual fact, from my experience, I do not think that makes any difference because, to my knowledge, no medical practitioner, as such, keeps open shop except a licentiate of the Apothecaries Hall.  Medical practitioners who keep open shop are licentiates.  They take an examination in pharmacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section dealing with reciprocity is a very important one.  Being a practising pharmacist myself I know and have realised down through the years how difficult this question was.  The Pharmaceutical Society in this country had no powers to enter into reciprocal arrangements with any outside States, or with any other country.  For instance, if a pharmaceutical chemist wanted to come here from England, the Six Counties or Canada, he could not practise here as a chemist. Chemists could not come and register here and, <i>vice versa,</i> the qualifications <Col N="758" /> of pharmaceutical personnel who qualified here and wanted to go to Canada, Australia, America, England, in turn, would not be recognised in any of these places.  For that reason I think this is a very great advance.</P>
    <P>Another improvement is the restriction on the use of certain titles, emblems and descriptions.  That is also very important and it is more important from the point of view of the public than it is from the point of view of the Pharmaceutical Society, as such, because it will prevent people from masquerading, as it were, as being qualified to compound and dispense prescriptions, when they are not so qualified.  It has happened in the past that unqualified people have had the title &ldquo;Pharmacist&rdquo;, and so on and so forth, over their doors or on their letter headings, when they were not so qualified.  Under this Bill the public will be protected, as they are entitled to be, and when getting a specialised service they will know what service they are getting.</P>
    <P>I should like to put Deputy O'Higgins's mind at ease.  If my memory serves me correctly, when he was referring to the constitution of the Council of the Society he said that teachers could not be members of the Council.  He was not quite correct there.  Any qualified chemist, be he a wholesaler or a manufacturing chemist, can be a member of the Council, with the possible exception of an examiner. Examiners, by regulation, are not members of the Council, and that is as it should be in fairness to the examiner, and in the interests of having an impartial board of examiners at examination time, and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins mentioned one other point on which I must say I am in agreement with him.  He said that the State has responsibility and should have responsibility with regard to the training and teaching of students.  As happens in all modern training, teaching, lectures and so on, the Society have changed very much down through the years.  In earlier years the method of training was master and apprentice, part-time lectures, part-time teaching and so on, but with the more recent scientific or specialised training, the <Col N="759" /> Society had, of course, to modernise their laboratories, take on whole-time teachers, employ extra personnel, extra staff, and so on.  In other words, naturally their commitments are very much greater than they were heretofore, with the result that they find themselves possibly having to seek State assistance.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is a very important section because it puts beyond doubt what has been the actual practice in recent years. The 1875 Act gave the Society the power or authority to examine&mdash;not to teach, strange to say&mdash;and in the course of examining, training, teaching, lectures and so on, much had to be taken into consideration.  I mention that because the position is made very, very clear, which it was not previously.</P>
    <P>The provision with regard to the retainer fee is very desirable and fills a long-felt want.  Under the conditions under which the Society worked, the licentiate of the Society and membership of the Society were purely voluntary. People interested in the Society, in the welfare of the teaching of the students, and in the welfare of pharmacy generally, became members of the Society, but it was purely voluntary, with the result that less than half of the qualified pharmaceutical personnel were members of the Society.  I fully agree&mdash;and this applies, of course, in kindred professions and in practically all the professions&mdash;that the retainer fee is very important and very necessary.</P>
    <P>This is a very desirable and very necessary piece of legislation.  It is very important from the chemists' point of view, and it is more important still from the public point of view because, in the first analysis and in the last analysis, the public are the people who are concerned with legislation such as this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Higgins has already said on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, we welcome this Bill.  One might say, <i>en passant,</i> that the chemists are entitled to a new Act, as they appear to be operating under the very old Act of 1875 which has been much amended.  The Minister <Col N="760" /> referred to a further amendment in 1951.  I am not quite clear as to what that amendment was.  Actually, as I read this Bill it appears to be an attempt to legalise and codify existing regulations; in other words, to set up the pharmaceutical chemist as a profession.</P>
      <P>That seems to be desirable enough in itself but the puzzling thing about this Bill to me is that practically all the sections in it are already operative.  It is simply making it clear to the public and the chemists themselves what their obligations are.  But in the main, practically all the sections one looks through and the obligations they set out existed already, only perhaps the chemists themselves were not fully aware of it, and I am sure the general public were not aware of it either.</P>
      <P>Section 2 puts the ordinary medical practitioner out of the line of practising as a pharmaceutical chemist and keeping a shop open for prescribing medicines or compounding drugs or selling poisons.  As the Minister rightly said, the majority of medical practitioners, with the exception of licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall, had no interest, good, bad or indifferent in that profession.  They were fully occupied in their own sphere in which they were practising and from which they were making a living.  That section takes everyone out except licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall, the dispensing chemists and the pharmaceutical chemists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we go further in the Bill to the part where the L.A.H. is taken out as a practising chemist and is no longer allowed to compound or keep open shop for the sale of medicines, as I read it, subject to the proviso that he is already registered as such or has commenced as a student.  But as against that, if any other subsequent L.A.H. comes on the scene and qualifies as such and applies for registration, he is still entitled to carry on. That rather puzzles me.  The only reason I can see for it is to ensure that all pharmaceutical chemists will be registered as such and registered members of the Society.  I am not at all in disagreement with that.  I think it is eminently desirable but it still <Col N="761" /> seems a rather long way to go after 80 or 90 years to cover these points which are, in effect, very small points really.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of reciprocity.  That seems to be an important item in the Bill in that it is a complete innovation.  Again, I wonder.  There is a Pharmaceutical College in this country and I am aware that there are quite a considerable number of overseas students in that college.  I presume they go through the ordinary courses.  I know there are Malayans and Ghanaians and Nigerians and other students. When they qualified prior to this, were they entitled then to the degrees they hold and to practise in their own country, or are they only to be allowed to do so now by virtue of this reciprocity which is being introduced ?</P>
    <P>It also raises the point that if we are to allow reciprocity, we may have quite an influx of chemists into this country.  It is a question which perhaps the Minister might be able to clarify.  No doubt, he has had consultation as to whether this profession is overcrowded or not.  I am inclined to think it is.  I am inclined to the view that in recent years there has been an increased demand for the products of chemists' shops, an increase in the demand for cosmetics and drugs and there is quite a sizeable number of chemists' shops in practically every small town in Ireland now and two or three in the larger-sized villages.</P>
    <P>As against that, the Minister could answer that the registration in return would leave the control completely in the hands of the Society and as such, they could regulate it, but they would find it difficult all the same if they set up as an examining or tutorial body giving diplomas and degrees to pharmaceutical chemists and members of the Society.  Subsequently if those practised elsewhere and applied to the Society for registration under a reciprocal arrangement so that they could practise elsewhere, the Pharmaceutical Society would find it very difficult to refuse them.</P>
    <P>The only reason I raise this point is <Col N="762" /> that in turn the particular country concerned might say: &ldquo;We are giving reciprocity and we want full reciprocity in return&rdquo;, and we might get a lot of chemists into the country.  I see Deputy Brady looking quite anxious at the idea of the number of chemists who may come in to the very lucrative business he conducts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There are other points, too.  I have heard rumours that the Pharmaceutical Society and the profession of pharmacy are to be recognised as a Faculty and I have also heard rumours that it is also to become a Faculty in University College, Dublin.  I wonder is that true. I wonder if the Minister has any information on that point and if such is the case, if it is to come under the Governing Body of the university as an independent Faculty with its own Dean, which no doubt it is entitled to have, would it not have been better to embody it in this Bill?  Of course I may be wrong on that point.  It may be that the relevant section leaves it open for the Pharmaceutical Society to do that themselves.  It will be under Section 4 and Section 7.  It is a matter which the Minister might be kind enough to clarify so that they may know exactly what the position is.</P>
    <P>Then one comes back again to the question of doctors compounding medicines. Admittedly, the Bill stands by the word &ldquo;sale&rdquo;.  This applies to the sale of drugs and the compounding of drugs but it is specifically set out in the Minister's statement and in the Bill itself that the only people who may compound prescriptions and drugs will be licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall and pharmaceutical chemists.</P>
    <P>Now, there are many establishments in this country in which there are already qualified medical practitioners compounding prescriptions.  In all the health clinics, which were formerly known as dispensaries, doctors compound medicines regularly.  I am raising the point&mdash;I may be entirely wrong in this&mdash;only for clarification purposes. It is necessary to ensure that we are not passing a Bill which makes it illegal for medical practitioners in a particular district, in an isolated area, where there may not be a chemist's shop for ten or 15 miles&mdash;which could happen in the West of Ireland&mdash;to <Col N="763" /> compound medicines for his patients. Perhaps the Minister would look into that?  If I am wrong, well and good; I am quite happy on the point.</P>
    <P>There is another point I want to raise.  If pharmaceutical chemists are to be given professional status, as I believe they are, the point has been put to me by some members of the profession that they would be entitled to employment for the purpose of compounding medicines even under semi-State concerns, such as local authorities, where that is possible. There is no provision in the Bill to suggest that.  I do not know if it is a matter that could actually be embodied in the Bill.  In these larger dispensaries, or, to give them their correct name, health clinics, in towns, say, of a population of over 2,000, there is a sizeable turnover of drugs and appliances generally.  Therefore, it would be economical for the State to employ pharmacists.  It would be economical because of the fact that the pharmaceutical chemist would have the knowledge and skill to order the correct drugs, to order them most economically and to use them to the greatest advantage, naturally on the prescription of the medical officer.</P>
    <P>In many places in Ireland now, even in the smaller country towns with populations of around 500 or 600, there are pharmaceutical chemists available.  If they are to be registered in order to practise and if they are forced to pay a registration fee, as we are enacting in this legislation, and become members of their own Society, they are entitled to the full benefits of their profession in their own country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would look into that?  Perhaps he might be able to embody in the Bill on Committee Stage something which will more or less legalise their position to the extent that they may be happy in the assurance that they will get further employment here.  This employment will not only benefit themselves but will benefit the people for whom they will be prescribing.  Very occasionally, I have done dispensary work myself.  I once did dispensary duty in a dispensary in a town with a population of <Col N="764" /> 5,000 or 6,000.  I was on duty for three or four months and, when the stock of drugs ran down, I found I had not the time, the knowledge or the skill to restock that dispensary so that I could not really give the best service possible to the people.  The State would considerably benefit by what I suggest, so perhaps the Minister would consider the point ?</P>
    <P>I have been asked to raise another point.  I think the only section of the controversial Health Acts, which are now being revised, that the chemists opted into was the mother and child scheme.  I do not think they are allowed any dispensing fees whatever for that purpose.  Again, if they are to be registered as professional, it seems they are entitled to some recognition as such and that they should be entitled to charge a dispensing fee.  I see the Minister is smiling, because he is going to get up and tell me they have a dispensing fee.  I believe they have a small dispensing fee but it is inadequate to cover them, to normalise their ordinary profits on drug sales.  The percentage of profits on drug sales is high, in some cases as high as 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>In case Deputies think that chemists are mulcting the public and making a great deal of money as a result of being able to charge these high prices, I think I should say it is necessary for them to do so.  There is tremendous wastage in this sale of drugs, particularly for chemists practising in the more isolated areas rather than in Dublin.  They very often get a prescription from a doctor interested in a particular product.  Perhaps that product is not as successful as the doctor has been led to believe.  The chemist may have laid in a considerable stock. I forget what the professional term is, but a lot of that stock is left on his hands and he is unable to dispose of it.  Against that, he requires a high percentage of profit.</P>
    <P>I may not have got the relations between the mother and child service and the dispensing chemist quite accurately.  I think they are entitled to some small dispensing fee, but they do not get anything like the profit to which their services would entitle <Col N="765" /> them.  In view of the fact that conditions are being imposed on them, which we on this side of the House are quite satisfied to accept, they are entitled to all the privileges accruing from the fact that there is a certain amount of Ministerial control and that they are registered.</P>
    <P>The figures the Minister gave of 1,100 who are members of the Society and 1,500 who are not members should clearly indicate that, in the interests of this profession, compulsory registration is desirable.  I wish the Minister luck with the Bill.  I think he could have gone a lot further with it, or at least could have given us a clearer explanation of the future of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, so far as teaching and the principles it will follow are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill appears to be an agreed measure between the various parties concerned and there are just a few comments I should like to make for clarification.  I understand that the general tendency in this Bill is to bring the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland forward as the dominant body with the control of this very important aspect of medicine and medical services generally.  We have from the middle of the 19th century come to the point where the apothecary and the doctor are, from the point of view of medical dispensing, receding into the background and the pharmaceutical chemist is taking over control.  I think that, in the circumstances, is as it should be. At the same time, I wonder what case was made for the taking away of power from the members of the medical profession?</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that the Irish Medical Association fought their corner with their usual determination and skill and must have been convinced by the Minister that there was a good case for the taking away of the power, which the doctor had up to now, to sell, if he wished, drugs, medicines, poisons and so on.  I understand that only very few were concerned to do this.  Because there were only a few, I wonder why it was thought necessary to take away the power they had?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some vague criticism of the <Col N="766" /> courses for doctors concerning dispensing and the various other aspects of the preparation of medicines. To some extent, it appears the Minister has tended to try to hang his case on the vagueness and inadequacies of this course.  Would it not have been possible, and acceptable to the Medical Association, to have the course properly examined and have its contents, without great expenditure, made to meet the requirements of the Pharmaceutical Society, in order to allow the doctor, if he wished, to carry on with the old conditions he had?</P>
    <P>One of the odd things, it seems to me, is that one change has been made: he must register with the Pharmaceutical Society.  I do not think the Pharmaceutical Society are completely satisfied about that situation.  They should be allowed to carry on with their old position in this trade or profession without any attempt being made by the Society to investigate the quality made available.  I wonder why this is so&mdash;why the Society have not taken it upon themselves, or asked the Minister to give them power, to see that the course carried on is to their entire satisfaction and that if it is not, they could not accept any responsibility at all for its continued recognition as a source of chemists of the future?</P>
    <P>I have no idea what is the ambit of the course at present made available to doctors.  I only know from my own experience which I am not so sure is not completely out of date now, but it does seem odd that the doctor should be in any way restricted under the Dangerous Drugs Acts or the Poisons Acts, or restricted if he wishes to open a shop for the sale of these drugs because of any inadequacy in this course.</P>
    <P>The course could be brought up to date and the doctor need not be deprived of this old right.  I agree with Deputy Esmonde that the doctor should not be curtailed in any way in relation to the dispensing of his medicines if he feels he wishes to do so.  There are situations in which he might find himself isolated and in which he must have this power with the cover and protection of the law <Col N="767" /> if he is dispensing any dangerous drugs, and I hope there is no proposal here which will interfere with the present position.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister could have taken any powers in this Act, and whether the Society would have been agreeable to it, to consider the possibility of establishing chemists on a licensed basis?  What I mean is that it is generally agreed in our society that there is a system of fixed prices maintained by most chemists' shops and because of this, the consumer does not get any benefit really from a multiplicity of chemists' shops in most towns and villages throughout the country.  In fact the contrary is true&mdash;where there is more than one shop supplying the same goods at the same prices, entailing employment in a multiplicity of chemists' shops, there is a multiplicity of overheads of one kind or another and the person who pays for this is, in the end, the consumer.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I wonder whether the Minister has given any thought to the idea that he might allow the establishment of a licensing system for chemists' shops in the Society generally. In this way, he would cut down the multiplicity of shops which at present exists and which calls for unnecessary expense.  He must know as well as I do that, by so doing, he would not interfere in any way with the operation of the alleged dynamic private enterprise in the profession.  I suspect there are many of these shops which find it very hard to make a reasonable living in any of the country towns in Ireland and that it might be in the interests of all concerned if the Minister were to consider some proposal of that kind.  There are many obvious complications but it might be worth consideration by the Minister and the Pharmaceutical Society.</P>
    <P>The compulsory payments by licentiates have been, I suppose, agreed upon by the Society but, as the Minister pointed out, I do not know whether it represents the majority of chemists.</P>

      <P>We are legislating for these people who have opted not to pay any fee up to now and I wonder if it is desirable that we should impose on them the responsibility of paying a fee to the Pharmaceutical Society?  I well see the need for making funds available to the Society because of the scope and importance of the work they have to carry out, but I do not know whether it is the wisest thing to impose a compulsory contribution on the licentiates in order to keep the Society going and what seems to me to be least desirable or equally undesirable is that this money&mdash;the only source available to the Society&mdash;will go for the education of its members.</P>
      <P>I agree this is an important body. Certainly its members are very important members of any society such as ours.  Chemists have a very complex and valuable function to perform in our health services.  In consequence, I think they have a lien on any Minister for Health or any Government for support, for help, for subsidy of some kind or other, in order to see that they will not be impeded in any way in carrying out their very important work in our health services. Accordingly, I would be rather more in favour of the idea of making available funds to the Society in the same way as we do to the medical schools so that they will be able to establish and maintain their courses and bring them up to the maximum pitch of efficiency and that the people in them will get the benefit by having the highest trained and skilled chemists available to them.</P>
      <P>I wonder what the Minister or the Society propose to do in the case of a chemist who will not accept this mandatory contribution?  What steps can be taken to discipline the person who does not wish to pay a fee?  I think other societies&mdash;the Medical Association and others&mdash;have shown they can operate without this type of compulsory fee and I do not think a good case has been made out for compulsion in these circumstances.  It is a problem how properly to penalise the person who does not take any notice of a demand for such fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of that is the very important question of the disciplinary <Col N="769" /> powers to be held by the Pharmaceutical Society.  What is the present position in that regard ?  I know that under the Act&mdash; and it is a wise thing&mdash; they are empowered to establish the courses which must be followed by the intending chemist.  Examinations, lecturers and professors are all legislated for but can the Minister take any powers ?  What is the position ? I understand that there is some Constitutional position involved which arose out of the Law Society case recently.</P>
    <P>Is that what is holding back the Minister?  Is that what is making it difficult for the Minister to empower the Pharmaceutical Society to have legal sanction for any disciplinary action which they may propose or wish to take in order to maintain the very high standards of ethical behaviour in the profession under their care?  I understand&mdash;and Deputy Brady may be able to tell us&mdash;that this power does not exist at present.  If that is so, it amazes me how one manages to have such a high standard of reliability.  If these powers are not there, would the Minister consider introducing the legal power which would allow the Pharmaceutical Society to impose disciplinary measures whenever they felt they were needed?</P>
    <P>Probably one of the most important clauses in the Bill is that which relates to the establishment of reciprocity with other countries.  That is a very good development.  I understand that it is one which flows almost directly from the fact that the Pharmaceutical Society have made such notable efforts to establish a standard of teaching and education here for our chemists which allows them to fear no competition in the educational field at any rate from any other country.  They are now in a position to open their doors to any other country from the point of view of the standard of education provided and they will be fairly certain of being accepted for the purposes of reciprocity.</P>
    <P>That is a very desirable thing because many young people have gone into the profession and found that there was a very limited outlet for <Col N="770" /> them.  I understand that the result of that was a fair amount of exploitation since they had no outlets in other countries.  It is about time that the development which has taken place in relation to doctors and nurses should take place in relation to chemists.  It is a pity that many of our people have to emigrate but if they do emigrate it is an advantage for them to have some worthwhile profession.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that the Pharmaceutical Society should enter, as soon as possible, into the necessary negotiations to try to establish reciprocity with other countries.  This would be of value in that young emerging societies will be able to send their people over here to get a worthwhile qualification which will be valid in many other countries.  I hope that this Bill will get as rapid a passage as possible through the Dáil and that its main provisions will be put into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I must admit that I did not read this Bill until just now.  Therefore, I had not the opportunity of giving it much consideration.  It seems to me to be in general an attempt to upgrade the pharmacist.  As such, it will mean that he will have to have a more extensive and expensive education.  It will also mean that he will be entitled to a larger fee afterwards for his services.  In these days of increasing costs&mdash;particularly the cost of pharmaceutical preparations &mdash;this may create some increase in the cost of these services to the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that an attempt should be made to establish reciprocal arrangements but Deputy Brady, who knows more about this than I do from the purely practical angle, may find, when this Bill comes into operation, that he will have to pay his assistants more.  He will find it more difficult to get assistants because they will emigrate. I understand that a pharmacist has to employ qualified people.  While that may be all right in Deputy Brady's case in Dublin where everybody has a lot of money, down the country some of our pharmacists are not so well off. If they are expected to put up a big <Col N="771" /> annual fee for one or two assistants, it will be a big impost on them.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider the question of providing in the Bill for assistant pharmacists.  There is nothing very wrong in this suggestion so far as I can see because much of the work done now in an ordinary chemist's shop, as everybody knows, is just ordinary retail work, handing out over the counter proprietary drugs, ladies' toilet preparations and so on in respect of which the ordinary training of a shop assistant is more important than a learned course at a university.  In the interests of the public and to keep costs down to the consumer, it might be desirable to consider the question of having some kind of grade.  If we are going to upgrade the chemist proper, we should allow him to employ as an assistant a person having an accepted educational status but not the extensive education which is apparently now envisaged for the pharmacist proper.</P>
    <P>I should like, of course, to feel that the doctor's rights would not be infringed in any way because in a small community like ours we may not be able at all times and everywhere to provide a dispensing pharmacist.  It would be undesirable if anything were to emanate from the Bill that might in any way infringe the existing rights of doctors.  I do not mean doctors in the retail business selling things.  I refer to the right of a doctor to dispense or prescribe in areas where he cannot get any help.</P>
    <P>I am not in agreement with the proposal to charge an annual fee subject to the consent of the Minister. Unless the State is giving some subvention to the pharmaceutical profession I do not see how any charge can be subject to the consent of the Minister.  I pay two fees annually to two societies and I am quite happy when I do not know of any ministerial intervention.  Pharmacists should be well able to look after their own business without the Minister saying how much they should pay to their own society.  I would agree with Deputy Dr. Browne as regards the disciplinary <Col N="772" /> council in order that the Pharmaceutical Society should have their own disciplinary body as we have the General Medical Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to deal with the point raised by Deputy Dr. Browne as to the function of the appropriate Minister in approving or disapproving of the amount of fees charged by the Society.  The Deputy answered that question and gave the reason himself when he suggested that the fees might be so high as to lead to an increase in the cost of medicines and drugs to the public.  I am not going to say that the Pharmaceutical Society would operate in that way but it is desirable, for the protection of the public, that these fees should be subject to the Minister's approval.</P>
      <P>The next question was that of establishing a disciplinary body.  We all know that problem has been made extremely difficult by the interpretation put upon the constitutional provisions by the Supreme Court in the case of the Incorporated Law Society. It is a matter which has been the subject of deep consideration by myself in relation to the various professional bodies for which I have a sort of statutory obligation.  We have not been able to find a satisfactory solution to the problem but, when we do, we will be able to apply it to the practice of pharmacy, to ensure that the high ethical standards will continue to operate in that practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne also suggested that we should consider the desirability of licensing premises which are used for pharmaceutical purposes and thus putting chemists' shops in much the same position as public houses.  I do not think it necessary for us to do that.  I do not want to regulate and control all the people in the manner which Deputy Dr. Browne occasionally suggests he would like.  This is a free society and we have accepted the principle of private enterprise to the extent that it does not conflict with the public interest.  I do not think that there is any indication that the public interest is widely affected by the fact that any qualified person is permitted to open shop whenever he likes for the <Col N="773" /> compounding of medical prescriptions and the sale of medicines.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde asked if the Bill would interfere in any way with the exercise by dispensary doctors of their present functions in relation to the dispensing of drugs to their patients.  It will not.  What this Bill will do is to prescribe the persons who will be entitled to keep open shop for the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions.</P>
    <P>The dispensary doctor, in his medical practice, compounds and dispenses drugs for the use of his own patients. He does not keep open shop to sell medicines to his patients and thus will not contravene the section in any way. Only authorised persons will be entitled to keep open shop.</P>
    <P>That also answers the questions raised as regards the change in the rights of licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall.  This is not a question of keeping open shop but of the right of licentiates of the Apothecaries Hall to register as pharmaceutical chemists. The section which it is proposed to amend is Section 22 of the Act of 1875.  That provides that every licentiate of that Apothecaries Hall shall, on payment of the proper fees and charges, be entitled to be registered as a pharmaceutical chemist.  All that is involved in Section 8 is the right of a licentiate of the Apothecaries Hall who is not also a licentiate of the Pharmaceutical Society to be registered under the Act as a pharmaceutical chemist.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde also asked if foreigners who come to the College of Pharmacy here are allowed to practise in their own countries.  He mentioned a country such as Nigeria. I am not in a position to speak about Nigeria but the question arose some time ago in relation to Rhodesia and the answer was that since we would not allow persons who had qualified in Rhodesia to practise in Ireland, it was not possible for them to consider the question as to whether persons qualified in Ireland should be permitted to practise in Rhodesia.  We have other instances where that situation has arisen.  The purpose of Section 5 is to enable the Pharmaceutical <Col N="774" /> Society to enter into arrangements upon a reciprocal basis to allow those who qualify here to practise in those countries where satisfactory arrangements for reciprocal recognition have been arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also asked if it is intended to set up a Faculty of Pharmacy in one of the university colleges.  Arrangements have been made whereby part of the course of studies prescribed by the Pharmaceutical Society will be taken in University College, Dublin.  But, it has also been specifically stated to me, at any rate, by the Society that it is not intended to set up a separate Faculty of Pharmacy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde seems to be of the same opinion as Deputy Hogan in relation to Section 6 of the Bill which enables the Council of the Society to charge fees for registration, in the first instance, and then for the retention of a licentiate on the register. He seems to be under the impression that the Society would operate in an oppressive way, particularly in respect of licentiates who refrained from becoming members of the Society heretofore.  I do not think there is any reason to believe that the Society would act in that way but, even if they were inclined so to act, the Minister has the power of approval and he will naturally be concerned to see that the fee charged for retention of a person's name on the register will be fair and equitable to all concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for us to consult the people who are not members of the Society.  When the Pharmacy Act of 1875 was passed the Society was set up as a body to regulate the general conduct of the profession and the standard to be obtained by those seeking to be admitted as members of the Society and licensed to act as qualified pharmaceutical chemists.  As I pointed out, over the years, the members of the Society have taken upon themselves the rather heavy burden of regulating and controlling the profession for the benefit not alone of themselves but of every member of the profession.  It is only just and equitable that every member of the profession who benefits by the activity of the Society should be <Col N="775" /> bound to pay a reasonable fee for the services he continues to receive year after year from the Society.  There is nothing novel in that, as I pointed out in my Second Reading speech. Dentists pay annual fees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan has told us he pays two annual fees.  Under a Bill passed by this House in 1956, opticians pay annual fees.  Registered patent agents pay annual fees.  There is nothing oppressive in this.  Because of the interest which the Pharmaceutical Society has taken, members of the profession are now being put in a less ambiguous position than obtained heretofore in relation to their right to practise.  There is nothing oppressive in asking those who benefit from all that to pay a reasonable fee.  I do not think the fee will be such a burden that it will be necessary for anyone to seek to compensate himself by charging higher prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne asked what sanction will the Society have if a licentiate refuses to pay the fee.  The Society can, of course, sue him.  I would say that if a licentiate were to persist in practising as a pharmaceutical chemist, without having duly paid the fee, the Society might in future have power to move to have that person's name removed from the register. I grant that might be a rather extreme penalty.  I hope no licentiate, following on Deputy Dr. Browne's speech here to-day, will feel that he can continue with impunity to refuse to honour the obligations imposed on him by the Society acting under Section 6.</P>

    <Title>Royal Hospital Kilmainham Bill, 1961 &mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objects for which the trust of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham was founded gradually diminished and ultimately became extinct in consequence of the change of Government in 1922.  The purpose of this Bill is <Col N="776" /> to provide for the discharge of the liabilities of the trust and also for the utilisation of the remaining property of the trust, comprising the buildings, lands and chattels of the hospital, together with some trust funds.</P>
    <P>The history of this old trust goes back to 1679 when Charles II directed that a hospital should be built at Kilmainham to accommodate old and in-firm soldiers of the English Army in Ireland.  The hospital building was completed in 1684, and was endowed under Royal Charter with 64 acres, plantation measure, out of the Crown lands at Kilmainham.  In 1922, there were 126 pensioners resident in the hospital.  From then onwards, no new pensioners were received and the surviving pensioners gradually died out.  In 1926, some of the surviving pensioners were transferred to the Royal Hospital, Chelsea, and in 1929, the remaining pensioners, about 50 in number, were given the option of transferring to Chelsea or becoming outpensioners.  With the death of the last surviving pensioner at Chelsea in September, 1952, the objects for which the hospital was established, as a charitable trust, finally became extinct, and it was necessary to make other arrangements for the utilisation of the property.</P>
    <P>During the years 1922 to 1933, the buildings, lands and chattels of the hospital gradually ceased to be used for the purposes of the trust and passed, by agreement, into the occupation of the Irish administration.  Under Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, the legal title to all this property passes to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The hospital building itself is of architectural interest as one of our oldest public buildings.  As might be expected it has been affected by age and wear and the Government was advised, some years ago, that extensive works, including the renewal of a considerable part of the roof, would be required to preserve the hospital. It was considered desirable to commence the works as soon as possible without waiting for this Bill and operations have now been in progress at the hospital for about three years. This type of work is necessarily slow <Col N="777" /> and, accordingly, it will take some years more to complete operations. When the works have been completed, the hospital will be ready for a new lease of life as part of the National Museum and in this new function, it will be preserved in a worthy manner for the use and enjoyment of the public.</P>
    <P>The remaining property of the hospital consists of the trust funds, particulars of which will be found in the Schedule to the Bill.  Up to 1922, the income from these funds was paid to the Governors of the hospital who administered the hospital as trustees. The Governors expended the income from the trust funds on the hospital and its pensioners.  Most of the governorships lapsed in 1922 with the disappearance of the British civil and military offices to which they attached <i>ex officio</i>.  Only two governors were left, and as this number was insufficient to form a quorum they could not exercise any functions in relation to the trust funds.  These remaining governors were dissolved in 1955, and there is now no person competent to exercise any functions in relation to the trust funds.  Section 5 of the Bill constitutes the Attorney General the sole trustee of the funds as from the 6th April, 1962, to act until a new scheme for the utilisation of the funds has been settled by the High Court under Section 4 of the Bill.  This will enable the Attorney General to deal with any matters in connection with the funds which may require action by a trustee during the interim period.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill empowers the High Court to dispose of the trust funds.  When the Governors of the hospital ceased to function after 1922, it was not possible to determine with certainty who, if anybody, was legally entitled to receive the income from the trust funds.  Because of this difficulty no payments out of the income could be made to meet part of the cost of maintaining the Kilmainham pensioners, and the income has been allowed to accumulate.  The British authorities who defrayed the cost of maintaining the pensioners after 1922 have, therefore, a claim for the payments that would have been made <Col N="778" /> towards the support of the pensioners out of the income of the trust funds if the trust had been functioning normally. Under Section 4 (a) of the Bill, the High Court is empowered to discharge this liability by making an order, on the application of the Attorney General, for the payment of certain sums to the Commissioners of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea.  The payments comprise, firstly, a lump sum of £2,440 7s. 4d. in respect of accumulated interest on the trust funds; secondly, the proceeds of the sale of a holding of £1,096 7s. 5d. in 3½ per cent Exchequer Bonds representing interest on the trust funds which was re-invested, and thirdly, the interest received on the re-investment up to the date on which the Exchequer Bonds are sold, which will, it is estimated, amount to approximately £1,400.  These payments have been agreed with the British authorities and represent a final discharge of all liabilities as between the two Governments in respect of the Hospital.  The payments cover only part of the cost of maintaining the surviving Kilmainham pensioners, and no payment is being made out of the interest accrued on the trust funds after 17th September, 1952, when the last pensioner died.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4 (b) of the Bill, the High Court is further empowered, on the application of the Attorney General, to dispose of the capital of the trust funds, together with the accumulated interest remaining after the payments to Chelsea have been made, by making a new scheme for the management and application of these moneys for the benefit of serving or retired members of the Defence Forces.  With the making of the new scheme the old Royal Hospital trust will then pass into history, and may rest with the veterans of the Williamite Wars who overflowed the newly built hospital in the years after the Boyne and Limerick.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been in incubation for at least five years, probably seven, since the date of the dissolution of the Governors.  Of course, there is only one crucial point <Col N="779" /> which arises on it.  I am interested in a couple of points, more Committee points than anything else.  Under Section 2, the buildings and the lands are transferred &ldquo;freed from all trusts&rdquo; which means that the trust is wiped out.  That raises the point as to whether the trust has been extinguished or has lapsed on account of certain circumstances.  When one comes to Section 3, the transfer of the chattels, there is no such phrase used as regards the chattels being freed from trusts.  That is understandable, but subsection (1) says: &ldquo;All furniture, fittings... remained existing immediately before the commencement...&rdquo; That is a peculiar phrase. Does it mean remaining in existence? It is probably a draftsman's phrase, and I suppose we must accept it.</P>
      <P>The next line says that these chattels shall &ldquo;become transferred to and the property of the Minister.&rdquo; Does that mean they shall become transferred to and become the property of the Minister?  I suggest it would be all right to say &ldquo;transferred to&rdquo; because the next section deals with what is going to happen to the chattels that are so transferred.</P>
      <P>The only point arising in all this is the freedom from trusts.  The old trusts were for the ancient and maimed officers and soldiers and the Minister said this all arises out of the Williamite Wars.  That might be good history but the trust is expressed to be for &ldquo;antient and maimed officers and soldiers of the Army of Ireland.&rdquo; Therefore when the lands are being transferred freed from trusts, it means that there has been an acceptance of the fact that there is no longer an existing trust.  That was a matter that had a note of interrogation after it for a few years.  I do not know how the difficulty has been overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 deals with payments.  The Minister mentioned sums of £2,440, £1,096 and £1,400.  I think I am right in saying these are agreed sums but how are the calculations made?  The trust funds are dealt with in the Schedule.  There is a sum of £6,000 and another sum over the page of £4,000.  These are two and a half per <Col N="780" /> cent, funds.  I do not know how the calculation was made.  I cannot make any calculation on the sums that were mentioned.  I should be interested to know how the £2,440 and the other two sums mentioned by the Minister arise.  It is a Committee point.  I do not want an answer now.</P>
    <P>Under Section 4, when the Attorney General makes application the High Court may order certain payments.  If these are agreed payments, surely that ought to be &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, as far as they are concerned.  I can understand &ldquo;may&rdquo; arising in regard to settlement of the alternative scheme but the phrase would seem to give the High Court some power to inquire into these amounts, that is to say, whether they should be paid.  I do not believe that is the intention.  The legislation as I saw it in embryonic form was in the terms that the High Court should order certain payments.  The alternative is cautiously worded as far as (b) is concerned:</P>
    <P>Prepare and settle a scheme for the management and application of the trust funds (including any balance of interest accrued thereon) for some specified charitable purposes or purpose for the benefit of all or any classes or class of members or former members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The group that are always supposed to be first in line for the benefit of these funds, if and when taken over and transferred, are the Army Benevolent Fund.  I presume this is still the intention?  The Bill is acceptable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The calculation was made simply on the basis that if things are carried on without interruption, as it were, what sum would they get, taking interest, and so on, into account, subject to certain adjustments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £250,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
      <P>A sum of £650,000 was voted in the annual Estimates for payments by An Foras Tionscal under the Undeveloped Areas Acts, 1952 and 1957.  In the event this has proved to be inadequate. Up to the 31st January, 1962, all but £4,000 of this sum had already been paid and it is expected that before the 31st of March, 1962 a further sum of £350,000 will be spent.</P>
      <P>The reason for having to seek more money at this stage is partly due to the unusual difficulties inherent in the framing of annual Estimates of expenditure by An Foras Tionscal. These difficulties stem from the fact that the establishment of an industry involves a number of operations (such as company formation, site acquisition and clearance, provision of balance of capital, erection of factory premises and purchase of plant), the exact timing of which it is difficult to calculate with any degree of accuracy. Forecasting on an annual basis of payments likely to arise presents, therefore, unusual problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The excess over the estimated expenditure for the year reflects of course the beneficial results of the expanded programme undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority which has resulted in the emergence <Col N="782" /> of a number of projects not foreseen when the Estimate was first prepared. In addition, due largely to favourable conditions for factory building operations more rapid progress than was expected was made on a number of projects.</P>
    <P>Total net commitments incurred to 31st January, 1962, by An Foras Tionscal in respect of projects proposed for establishment in the undeveloped areas amount to £6,141,898 of which £2,605,264 has been paid, leaving outstanding commitments of £3,536,634. Grants paid to date in the current year amount to £646,000 and it is expected that payments to the end of the year will amount to £354,000 making a total of £1,000,000 in grant payments for the year.</P>
    <P>On 31st January, 1962, there were 70 projects in the undeveloped areas in production which have been assisted by An Foras Tionscal and there were a further 52 projects in various stages of development.  If all the latter projects come to fruition, the 122 projects approved by An Foras Tionscal to date will represent a total capital investment of £15,000,000 and will give employment to about 10,000 workers, of whom it is expected that 5,500 will be men and 4,500 women.</P>
    <P>A very encouraging feature of the operation of the underdeveloped areas scheme has been the extent to which projects related to the export trade are being developed.  Of the total of 122 projects approved, exports are envisaged in about 60 per cent.  of the cases and, indeed, in the case of certain projects, the whole of the production is intended for export.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that a provision was made in the Industrial Grants (Amendment) Act, 1961, whereby the number of persons on the Board of An Foras Tionscal could be increased from three to five.  Because of the substantial increase in work falling to be dealt with by An Foras Tionscal, it became imperative to increase the number of members on the Board and, following the Act, I have, therefore, appointed two new members to the Board.</P>
    <P>I should, perhaps, refer again to my intention to introduce legislation dealing <Col N="783" /> with the grants scheme.  Deputies will of course be aware that the existing legislation is due to expire at the end of 1963 and new legislation would then be inevitable.  I have previously made it known, however, that a review of the scheme is already in progress and I hope to bring proposals before the Dáil well before that date.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Including this Supplementary Estimate, the sums of money involved total a very large figure.  According to the Minister, the total involved in respect of capital investment will amount to £15 million. The House would be interested to get some further facts on the matters affected by it.  The Minister states that a total of 122 projects have been approved by Foras Tionscal which will represent the sum of £15 million and give employment to about 10,000 workers.  How many workers are at present employed on the projects that have come to production stage?  It is also mentioned that one of the satisfactory aspects of the matter has been the extent to which it is expected the undertakings will engage in the export trade.  I should be glad to know what percentage of established industries are already engaged in the export trade and what proportion of the total output of these industries is represented by sales on the external market.</P>

    <P>Everybody recognises, once the State accepted the idea of inviting here foreign technicians, people with technical knowledge or what is sometimes described as knowhow, in order to promote, or assist in the promotion of industrial projects here, that, while there were obvious advantages, there were also certain risks inherent in it. In the main, the work that is being done by foreign industrialists who have come here has proved beneficial.  On the other hand, undoubtedly there have been cases where, for some reason, these undertakings either prospered for a period or at some subsequent date those concerned, the foreign personnel, directors or technicians decided to leave.  In recent times, I think there has been some public concern <Col N="784" /> about the extent to which the people who have established industries here and availed of the facilities have, at short notice, indicated that they are leaving.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult, in securing co-operation and the necessary technical and skilled personnel to establish these industries, to make it obligatory on them to stay for a certain minimum period; in certain circumstances, it may even be unnecessary because our own people will have been trained and will have the necessary skill and knowledge.  It is the universal experience that they are highly adaptable and easily trained and learn quickly the various skilled undertakings which they are required to operate, but I believe there is some public concern about the fact that in a certain number of undertakings the directors or technical personnel decided to leave and return to their native country.</P>
    <P>Obviously, certain risks had to be taken.  It is conceded and recognised that in order to promote new industrial projects here, provide the knowledge necessary and the much-needed employment, it is essential to secure persons with skill and experience, but I believe the time has come when very considerable care and the most careful scrutiny should be exercised in order to ensure that persons who are establishing undertakings here can prove their <i>bona fides</i> without question. Otherwise, it will not merely affect the existing industries but may in turn cause doubts and misgivings about any new project that may be in contemplation and may upset some of the plans which industrialists and local groups have for particular industries in their own localities.</P>
    <P>This Act, when it was originally passed, was primarily concerned with the undeveloped areas.  That definition has been widened to such an extent that many projects have now been started in areas other than those originally contemplated, although I understand an effort is still made to restrict new projects to those which are of national importance or of sufficient significance to warrant approval being granted for their establishment in areas outside the undeveloped areas. <Col N="785" /> That aspect of the matter could be further reviewed.</P>
    <P>We all sympathise with the idea of establishing industries in the undeveloped areas and of encouraging projects in these places, but in the <i>Programme for Economic Recovery</i> and the comments which were made in the Grey Book published by the Secretary of the Department of Finance, reference was made to this matter and the view was expressed that the original anticipations were not lived up to and that, in fact, a change in policy in this regard might well be justified.</P>
    <P>It is obvious for many reasons that the facilities which are needed for successful industrial undertakings are not always available in some of these hitherto undeveloped areas and that many of the facilities necessary are available only in reasonable-sized towns or in the larger centres of population. There is also the natural reluctance of persons establishing these undertakings to move them to localities where not merely is there an adequate supply of labour but also readily available the facilities and services which they need.</P>
    <P>That aspect of the matter should be further considered and I should be interested to hear from the Minister what percentage of the new projects which are approved are confined to the areas originally designated as underdeveloped and what percentage of projects have been approved for the extended areas under the later changes which were made in that designation. It seems that if it is necessary to extend the areas further, then the whole position has been altered and the terms and conditions under which the areas were originally designated might be reviewed in the light of the working of this scheme.</P>
    <P>It is satisfactory to note that many of these projects have come into production, but I believe it is important that we should have the actual figures of the numbers at present employed, and also the percentage of the established industries which are engaged in the export trade, as well as hearing from the Minister the Government's view on the fact that, as I say, in certain undertakings <Col N="786" /> recently some of those directly concerned have decided to withdraw and to leave the country.  These are matters which are exercising the public mind and they are of vital concern to our industrial development and expansion programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the previous speaker because I think the grading of State assistance to industry because of its location will have to be looked at more firmly and more sensibly than is the case at the moment.  I do not think what we have been doing has been successful or that it will ever prove to be successful in the context of our whole economy.  A very strong case could be made, particularly in view of the competitive character of our external trade, for the establishment of industries where they will be most efficient, where the population is, and where the facilities for unloading of incoming materials and shipment of outgoing finished products are available.</P>
      <P>Our present sentimental policy will have to be discarded.  Whatever it has achieved over the years, it will not in the long run prove successful.  Industry must go where the labour is and where the facilities are.  We have had experience in recent months of people who contemplated going into certain areas where the grant inducements were considerable, finally deciding to ignore the advantages of the high grants and going where other advantages outweighed them.  The likely future of the country, viewing the entire economy as a single entity, would seem to indicate that decentralisation will become less important.</P>
      <P>There is located in the country a factory which designs large pieces of factory equipment&mdash;I do not want to name the firm&mdash;which have to be carted 80 or 90 miles to the nearest seaport over roads which are not fitted to carry the burden that transport places on them.  That seems to me to be senseless and it is time we looked at it again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious from what Deputy Cosgrave has said that while he considers some additional safeguards might be provided, he is <Col N="787" /> not against the granting of money to An Foras Tionscal for this purpose.  I can readily understand the point of view of Deputy Barry who has just spoken, but I should like him to bear in mind the immense difference it makes to a small country town where a successful factory is established there.</P>
      <P>In the town in which I live, the fact that the Electricity Supply Board are at present employing their own permanent employees and a number of local people in the area has made a considerable difference both to the economic and social life of the town, but it is a transient difference, which will disappear as soon as the Board have completed their activities in the area and moved on to somewhere else. How different it would be if the town had the benefit of permanent employment in a factory set up, shall we say, under the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
      <P>It is undoubtedly easier for any person, be he a national or a foreigner, to establish a factory in Cork or in Dublin than to establish it in Bantry or Ballaghaderreen.  If it is possible to establish it in one or other of the two small places, the relative difference is not comparable. One additional factory employing, say, 100 people would not make anything like the same difference to Dublin or Cork as it would make to a small town.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree that the Undeveloped Areas Act, as originally introduced and subsequently amended, has been a failure.  I cannot agree that the idea is sentimental, as Deputy Barry said.  I hope I am not misquoting him in using that word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I used it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood him to say that he regarded the concept of the Undeveloped Areas Act as being sentimental.  I think we must continue with it.  It is vital that the second son, the second daughter, or perhaps the first daughter on a small holding in the West of Ireland, should, if possible, be provided with industrial employment there when it is perfectly <Col N="788" /> obvious that their labour is superfluous on the land.  They are faced with the choice of emigrating to America or England or migrating to one of the big cities.  Whichever they do they are a loss to the countryside and they continue the unfortunate drain of the population of the Western counties.</P>
      <P>One criticism that is often heard of An Foras Tionscal is that the Board are more favourable and more lenient to foreigners than they are to our own people.  I myself have had the experience of being very closely associated with the application by an established company of entirely Irish people&mdash; young men who had proved their ability in business and now wished to expand&mdash;who put up what I was satisfied at the time was an unanswerable case.  When, in fact, they were refused, one of them was moved to say that if he were a Japanese or a German he would probably have been better received.  I should add that having reconsidered the application An Foras Tionscal granted it.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that I personally agree with the statement that there is any bias against Irish industrialists but, certainly, there should never appear to be bias against them, because surely we should encourage our own people above all.  I would say that we should be more lenient with them in their applications than with foreigners.  The Minister is aware of the circumstances under which one particular town in the West of Ireland&mdash;which I do not propose to name&mdash;has for a number of years been hanging on awaiting the establishment of a factory which was to be brought in from abroad.  The fact that the factory is not yet in being means that the people of that particular area have become rather cynical and have decided that neither the Government nor these people are sincere and, in the meantime, have lost courage and initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, I am not suggesting for a moment, either, that this Government or their predecessors or the people associated with this project are in fact insincere; what I am saying is that in cases of this kind, it is undesirable that too great a time should elapse <Col N="789" /> between the original application to Foras Tionscal and the implementation of the project.  It is quite obvious that if a local development association have the enthusiasm at a particular time and have the necessary capital available and are ready to go full steam ahead, if possible, the steam should be used before the kettle goes off the boil and the water becomes flat.  That, I should say, is a criticism that applies equally to Irish industrialists wishing to set up factories in any area.  If they are not prepared to go ahead with their project within a certain time, they should be told that Foras Tionscal are not prepared to grant the facilities.  Of course what I am saying is not to be taken as referring to any particular project such as the one to which I referred earlier.  It is a general observation designed to protect the enthusiasm and initiative of local people from being dissipated.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that there has been some public unrest and misgiving about the failure and the sudden collapse of certain projects involving foreign industrialists and also involving very heavy grants from Foras Tionscal.  It is only fair to add that some Irish projects have collapsed perhaps equally suddenly and that with the best will in the world, the Board cannot be certain of what is going to happen in the future.  The misgiving obviously arises where foreigners are involved, that they might simply take advantage of the facilities granted here and use them to their own benefit.  I am perfectly satisfied as far as that is concerned that Foras Tionscal take every possible care.  Strange things happen in industry: markets may suddenly collapse; market prices may suddenly alter and a number of things can happen in a short time to change what appeared to be a viable project into a failure.  As I say, I am satisfied that throughout the entire time it has been in operation, Foras Tionscal has made every effort to ensure that the project would be viable before they parted with the taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>In the years since the Undeveloped Areas Act was passed in 1952, a number of very desirable changes have been <Col N="790" /> made.  In particular, the old requirements regarding competititive disadvantage have now been dropped.  It is now only necessary that one should be able to show beyond doubt that the project is likely to be a success.  That surely gives a very good start to every development association anxious to provide industrial employment in their area.  But I find that people who come to me from these areas are still very much in the dark as to how they should approach their work.</P>
    <P>One tells them that the first step they should take is to go to the Department of Industry and Commerce who will be only too glad to help them and who will show them statistics of our imports and exports and thereby point the way to the type of project which would not merely be likely to be successful but would also be of benefit to the economy of the country by producing here what otherwise might have to be imported.  One tells them then to go to an industrial consultant who is <i>au fait</i> with hundreds of industries and projects likely to be successful. Finally, one says to them that they must be willing to put up a certain amount of local capital on the basis that if they do not have faith in this project, it is hard for the public board to commit the taxpayers' money to their care.</P>
    <P>All this, I am afraid, sounds very complicated to these people and in the end, many of them give up.  They had begun with the fairly simple approach that they have a site, that they have all the required facilities, that they have plenty of labour, that they have a certain amount of capital and an endless amount of enthusiasm.  They have not, of course, the necessary technical knowledge.  Most of them have no industrial background whatsoever.  I have often wondered if there is any way in which these people could be better helped officially.  I have not managed to think out any way by which they could be helped because establishing a factory is something which starts at A and finishes at Z and you must go through the various stages before you can have the completed building.</P>
    <P>I do know, however, as I have said, <Col N="791" /> that many enthusiastic amateurs fall by the wayside because they feel they do not get sufficient help or encouragement from official sources.  Perhaps if the Department were to send one of their representatives around to each of these development associations to give them a talk on ways and means of going about the matter, it might be of practical help.  If officials were to go to the other towns where they do not have development associations, they could, I am sure, have a very interested general audience of people only too anxious to establish industry in the area.  That is only a suggestion.  I feel sure the fertile minds of the Minister and his Department will be able to think up much more sensible ideas to achieve the aim I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could finish by referring again to certain agitation, particularly in the West, regarding the activities of foreigners.  It appears to me that this agitation has now largely died down. The fact is that with the probability that this country will join the European Economic Community, it is desirable that foreign capital should have an interest in this country.  Obviously, a German or Dutch factory which is a branch of a parent factory within the Six will have a vested interest in the expansion of that factory and, therefore, a vested interest in Ireland's success within the community.  From that point of view, the presence of capital from the Six appears to me to be obviously desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Department or the Board will have any greater difficulty in the future than in the past in providing the necessary safeguards.  I think that a word of thanks and congratulation is due to Foras Tionscal for the work they have done and are doing.  I believe they have much work still to do.  My hope is that the western counties, particularly Mayo, which has not done too well industrially in recent years, will have the benefit of a greater share of the work of Foras Tionscal in the future than in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that it was his intention to introduce new legislation in substitution for the <Col N="792" /> Undeveloped Areas Act, which lapses in 1963.  This is not an appropriate time to comment generally on that Act or to make any detailed suggestions as to how it might be amended.</P>
      <P>We are all fully in sympathy with Deputy Séan Flanagan when he talks about the difficulties of small towns in regard to the establishment of industries.  These difficulties are not peculiar to the West or any particular part of the country.  While Ballaghaderreen and Bantry may have their difficulties, similar towns in every part of the country have their difficulties. However, I do not want this debate to develop into a contest between the West and the rest of Ireland.  I think the Minister knows my views on the Undeveloped Areas Act and the views of the Labour Party as expressed at the last election.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister this question before and I should like to put it to him again.  I should like him either to confirm or deny that in the event of our becoming members of EEC it will be possible for us to continue with this type of legislation.  The Minister said in the Dáil some time ago that he did not see any particular difficulties in that, if we became members of EEC. I have seen a contrary expression of view, and I think it would be reassuring for the people interested in this matter to hear again from the Minister's mouth whether or not this is correct. It is possible that question may not yet be resolved within the EEC itself. Therefore, I do not want to commit the Minister to any definite statement if he cannot state categorically whether or not it will be possible to continue the Undeveloped Areas Act.</P>
      <P>I share, possibly to a greater extent than those who have already spoken, the doubts expressed in regard to the investment of substantial sums of money in industries established and controlled by foreigners.  Fifteen million pounds is a substantial sum of money to be paid by way of grant by Foras Tionscal.  Frankly, I am concerned that we do not seem to have any control over these industries, once we pay out our money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The sum of £15 million does not represent the grant. <Col N="793" /> It represents the total capital invested, which includes private capital as well as grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I think I am correct in saying we have invested something over £6 million by way of grant; yet we do not seem to have any control.  I do not say that Foras Tionscal or any Department of State should have overall control, but in recent times we have seen industries established with the aid of Government loans and grants folding up overnight.  I do not hold the Minister responsible for that; I do not hold Foras Tionscal or any other State organisation responsible for it.  But I believe the Minister, his agents or some of the institutions of State which have advanced money to these concerns should take the right, as I believe they have the right, to appoint a director, so that there will be some sort of contact with these newly-established industries, into which we have put a substantial amount of money.  I do not think that is unreasonable.</P>
      <P>I do not want to quote examples, but in the case of one industry which folded up overnight I do not believe either the Government or Foras Tionscal knew that was going to happen in such a short time.  In respect of that industry, it is good to know that it has not entirely broken down and that there is not much loss of employment.  Nevertheless, it came as a surprise to everybody, including Government Ministers.  I am firmly convinced that the Government, or any of the institutions responsible to the Government, did not have an idea. That can happen in Limerick, Galway, Mayo, or any other part of the country in the morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anyone can regard it as ultra-socialist to suggest that if we put money into any concern by way of grant or loan we should have some say in the running of the concern.  I do not advocate overall control or authority, but it would not be unreasonable to have at least one director to see how the money is being spent and why the money is being spent and to have a say in the general policy of the running of <Col N="794" /> the industry.  I had occasion to say last week or the week before that I knew one company which had got advances from the Industrial Credit Company. Whether it was the Department of Industry and Commerce which was concerned I do not know, but they exercised the right to put in a director in that industry.  Surely it would not be unreasonable in the case of a company to which we had given £200,000 by way of grant to say: &ldquo;You cannot object to our exercising the right to appoint a director on your board&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of foreign investment in this country but I do not think we should allow ourselves to get to the stage where foreigners may appear to have a strangle-hold on us and on the employment of our people.  I do not know what some of them mean by their threats to numbers of Irish workers in recent months.  Because a simple wage demand was made, they threatened to fold up and go back to wherever they came from&mdash;Germany, Japan or France.  If they think that is going to make for good labour relations they are mistaken.  We have ourselves to blame.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in considering legislation, if legislation is necessary, we should take power to exercise some partial control over the policies of these companies. I do not know whether they understand labour relations in this country or whether they know what trade unionism is, but I do know they are antagonistic to it and have told some employees they should not join a trade union.  Perhaps it is ignorance of trade unionism in general and of the Irish trade union movement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they advised the workers that they would look after them.  That is the old game of the employer: &ldquo;We will look after you much better than the trade union&rdquo;. They will do that until they have got rid of the idea of trade unionism in that area and then they will exercise whatever control they like in respect of wages and working conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> In page 2 of his speech the Minister gave us certain information which I shall quote:</P>
    <P>On 31st January, 1962, there were 70 projects in the undeveloped areas in production which have been assisted by An Foras Tionscal and there were a further 52 projects in various stages of development.  If all the latter projects come to fruition, the 122 projects approved by An Foras Tionscal to date will represent a total capital investment of £15,000,000 and will give employment to about 10,000 workers&mdash;of whom it is expected that 5,500 will be men and 4,500 women.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any information as to the actual figures of employment in respect of the 70 projects that are in production?  He does give the overall figure in respect of the 52 projects, but it would be helpful to the House if he told us what is the actual situation in respect of the projects in production.  I do not know what other Members of the House feel about the last figures he gives in the quotation I have read to the House, but they are disturbing to me.</P>
    <P>For the investment of £15,000,000, of which the State's part is £6,000,000, there seems to be a great tendency towards employment of women.  Do not let anyone get the impression that I am against women working. Apropos of that, I would point out that I am a member of a Party which has always been in favour of equal pay for women, but it seems to me that there may be a preponderance of women in these industries for a particular purpose. I suppose I will be called something of a saboteur but I should hate to see Irish workers exploited, I should hate to see a situation where employment was given to young girls of fourteen who were kept until they were seventeen and then thrown out.  I should hate to see this training of workers abused by anybody, Irish or foreign.  I would prefer to see a figure of 8,000 men and 2,000 women.  The man in this country is, thank heavens, still the breadwinner and this type of employment mentioned in the Minister's speech will not take the slack off <Col N="796" /> the numbers who emigrate from the land, because 95 per cent. of those flying from the land are male workers.</P>
    <P>Work in some of those industries may provide merely pin money for some girls even though they may work hard for it.  But I should hate to see them dismissed when they come to a certain age and a new batch brought in.  I cannot suggest to the Minister now how he could correct that situation, even if he himself thought it must be corrected, but the emphasis in employment here should be on men. There is no objection to the employment of women but it is much more important in these industries that we try to employ, in the main, adult male workers with a certain proportion of women.  If we do not do that we will not do much to stem the tide of emigration.</P>
    <P>Later on in his speech the Minister spoke about the value of these industries to our exports and he says that in respect of 122 projects approved, 52 of which are not yet in operation, exports of 61 per cent. of production are envisaged.  Could the Minister give us any figures or tell us what the percentage of exports is in respect of the 70 projects we now have in operation?</P>
    <P>That is all I have got to say except to point out that when the Minister comes to legislation in respect of the underdeveloped areas he should make certain changes designed to give a fair crack of the whip to small towns in provincial areas spread throughout the country because, as I said earlier, the distressed town, Ballina, or Bantry, need not be any more distressed than the small town in Wicklow, Kildare or Cork; and the man who is unemployed in Mayo is only as badly off as the unemployed man in Wexford, Carlow or Kildare.  He has available to him the same unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.  He suffers the same sort of hardships.  If there is a particular case to be made in respect of Cork and Dublin I am sure the Deputies representing these areas will make it for them.  As far as the whole country is concerned, there should be equal treatment for all parts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of <Col N="797" /> the House will not quarrel with the amount of the demand made upon the taxpayers with regard to Foras Tionscal. The £650,000 with a net sum of £250,000, would be well spent if there were better results shown from the previous expenditure.  The Minister opened by saying that the estimated expenditure excess over what was previously forecast reflects the beneficial results of the expanded programme undertaken by the Industrial Development Authority.  The Minister need not be reminded that, when the Industrial Development Authority was set up by a Minister under whom he now serves that Minister threatened to close it up the first time he got the power to do so.  He said it was the wrong way to go about the development of industry.  He warned those taking employment with the Board that their term of office would be short.  It would only last until such time as he was in a position to abolish the Industrial Development Authority, sack the members and establish something in its stead.</P>
      <P>It is also of interest to note that the export side of the enterprises of Foras Tionscal has been stressed.  I remember when the 1956 Act was introduced. Again, the present Prime Minister under whom the Minister serves told us it was the wrong way to approach this whole matter.  He thought, first of all, that no good result would accrue from it and in any event it was likely from his previous experience, to be the wrong way to deal with the development of Irish industry, even on the export side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we have a testimonial, first of all, to the Authority itself and, secondly, to their success on the export side.  I had taken the Minister's asking for a net sum of £250,000 as being very simple but the interjection he made to Deputy Corish makes me wonder whether it is as simple as I first thought.  Towards the end of the first page the Minister states: &ldquo;Total net commitments incurred to 31st January, 1962, by An Foras Tionscal in respect of projects proposed for establishment in the undeveloped areas amount to £6,141,898.&rdquo;  Then he divides so much as being paid, leaving <Col N="798" /> so much as outstanding commitments. I followed that down to the second paragraph where I saw reference to the total capital investment.  I thought that meant the capital investment on the part of An Foras Tionscal.  I gather that is not so.</P>
    <P>I should like to find out what is the total capital investment as between the firms themselves and Foras Tionscal in regard to the first 70 projects.  What is the first capital investment that has to be added to the £6 million which represents a commitment by the body set up by ourselves?  What is the likely commitment by Foras Tionscal in respect of the final capital investment of £15 million?</P>
    <P>I am struck by one figure in relation to the total capital investment.  Is that supplied by the firms themselves or is the division as between the firms themselves and our own board to give employment to about 10,000 people?  Deputy Corish pointed out it is rather surprising that that employment is divided almost equally as between men and women.  I do not know what the end of the matter was. Certainly, in the last couple of months, I read of certain trouble in the Shannon Industrial Estate in relation to certain firms who are accused of employing almost entirely juvenile labour and getting rid of the juveniles when they come to the point at which they are entitled to ask for a man's wages.  There seems to be some reconciliation between the trade unions and the firms themselves, but the public is not aware of what the real situation is.  It is one which caused disquiet and anxiety.</P>
    <P>That will be increased when we find that for this £15 million investment, the employment is to be roughly half and half as between men and women.  The figure emerges that about £1,500 is needed to put a worker into employment in this country.  How does that compare with similar types of opportunities held out to industrialists in the Six Counties and, I think, in England? In the Six Counties.  I saw a calculation made as to the capital investment required per worker employed. I do not know whether that varies when one thinks of the number of <Col N="799" /> women as opposed to the number of men.  There is a wage element there. The capital investment side might be of importance also.</P>
    <P>In the end, we are presented at the beginning of 1962 with 70 projects in production and 52 more somewhere coming along the line.  We are told that if all the 122 projects come to fruition, we will get 10,000 people employed.  I make the calculation that the 70 projects must be giving employment to about 6,000 out of the 10,000.  The Minister at many of these functions to which he has dedicated a lot of his working life spoke of an increase of 6,000 in industrial employment.  That figure would appear to be appropriate enough to the 70 projects already in existence. Let us see where we are to get&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is what we are talking about now&mdash;an increase of 10,000.  When is it expected that these projects somewhere under development will come to a head?  When will we get the 10,000?  From what date does this matter run?  The Minister need not be reminded because it was mainly in his constituency the promise was given that there were plans said to be in hands by the Government to put into employment 100,000 people.  We now get a boast in relation to 10,000.  We have already achieved about 6,000.  At some time, when these 122 projects are working merrily, we may have 10,000 in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It means a considerable period of delay before we get to the 100,000 which was promised nowhere more emphatically than in the Cork constituency which the Minister represents. It will be another two generations before that 100,000 mark is achieved, if the rate of progress is to be measured by what the Minister boasts about in the demand for these extra moneys.  We are told that the operation of the scheme has one very encouraging feature&mdash;the extent to which the projects relating to the <Col N="800" /> export trade are being developed.  All these incentives stem almost entirely from the 1956 Act.  They were not welcomed by the group to which the Minister belongs.</P>
    <P>I should like to find out the division which Deputy Corish asked for. What native firms, as opposed to foreign firms, are brought under review here?  To what extent are we depending upon foreigners coming here bringing in technical advice and, I hope, their capital?  It reminds me that there was a time when one of the pivotal points of the policy of the present Prime Minister was to exclude foreign capital, to regard it as something which was a disgrace and something which was a weakening of the nation.  We were told in those days in relation to foreign firms coming here with capital that the trouble, particularly with branch factories, was that any little disadvantage occurring here would cause them to close down entirely and clear out.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if any division can be made between native firms and foreign firms who are brought under review.  I did not know that the question to which Deputy Corish referred had already been raised and an answer given, but I should like to put the question again.  I read the Rome Treaty as indicating that there is to be a free trade area and it is to be a free trade in the most emphatic meaning of that term.  There is a phrase to be found in the Rome Treaty, that anything that distorts free competition or provides an advantage for the people of one country over the people of another will be frowned on and prohibited.  I should like to know if the Minister has been advised whether or not the export facilities given under the 1956 Act, before the Rome Treaty was on the horizon, will survive the application of the Treaty of Rome. The very words used in the Treaty of Rome indicate that anything that distorts competition and prevents the fullest freedom of competition will be regarded as contrary to the Treaty itself.</P>
    <P>We should get a clear understanding of these matters, instead of running along under a false impression and <Col N="801" /> then having to correct the matter at considerable cost to the country at a later stage.  I presume that some of these arrangements will be regarded as not contravening the Treaty of Rome because they were made before we applied to join the European Community but that any further development along these lines, once the implications of that Treaty were known and we had applied to come under it, will probably be dealt with much more harshly than those started earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, towards the end of his speech, that on account of the extended operations of this Board, he has appointed two new members.  I seem to have a recollection of the appointment of a Mr. Barry as one of the new members but I do not remember the appointment of the second being announced.  Would the Minister inform me of that?</P>

      <P>The demand for this £250,000 as the net sum that is required would not frighten anybody who has industrial development at heart but I do find myself in agreement with what Deputy Corish has said in regard to the way these moneys are being distributed.  It seems that we part company with Foras Tionscal the moment the moneys are provided here and all our efforts here to get information about some of these outside bodies are frustrated.  The Minister hides behind the old phrase that he cannot interfere with the day to day operations of these companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody wants him to do that but surely there is a different case when one has to deal with the natural desire to get some idea of the operation of <Col N="802" /> these companies?  Surely one should know whether any conditions attach to these loans such as the amount of the interest and the terms for repayment? There are a whole number of things, information on which would be available to the members of the House if the Minister appointed nominees to these companies.  If he did that, he would then be open to question in the House as to what his nominees did or did not tell him.  There ought to be a new look taken of this matter by the Government and we ought to have some touch through the Government which would enable members of this House to get information about the operation of these companies.  What Deputy Corish has said is worthy of appreciation and some thought should be given to the appointment of nominees on the boards of these companies by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to detain the House very long, over and above making a few points on this Estimate.  I think it will be generally agreed that the Minister, in seeking to extend the operation of the Undeveloped Areas Act, is doing good work.  We should not be deterred by the plea of the old Manchester school of economics that industry should be sited in big built-up areas. The trend now is to spread out industry as far as is possible.  That is happening in a great many countries and we are not the only country endeavouring to locate industries where there are large pockets of unemployment and where the potential exists for the training of the youth.</P>
      <P>One could say at this stage that the emphasis in technical instruction is on the teenager.  Regardless of whether they be male or female, the teenager is the best investment that could be made at the present time.  That is generally admitted.  Our natural resources have to determine where our industries will be located and the trend is to try to develop areas hither to considered barren and I think we should make every effort, regardless of whether we join the Common Market or not, to go on in this direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy who has just spoken <Col N="803" /> mentioned the Rome Treaty.  He said there was a provision in it to compel a country indulging in activities which might distort the pattern of the Treaty to cease those activities.  There is also a provision in the Rome Treaty to help out undeveloped countries.  In fact, that is its primary purpose.  If we believe in human effort, we must believe, if we are to enter the Common Market, in the articles laid down in the Rome Treaty.  I would not accept the defeatist attitude that we should pause at this stage and consider whether our action in developing and siting industries in the poorer areas is right or wrong.  I think it is right and most members will agree that Foras Tionscal are doing quite a good job of work.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate, the point was made that quite a big proportion of a large number of applications is refused.  That will happen in any effort of this description.  If a proposed industry clashes with an existing industry, especially an industry catering for the home market, then it is out.  All the emphasis is on exports; all the emphasis in Europe is on exports.  Regardless of the Common Market, we must always bear in mind that most of the European countries lined up in the Common Market are exporting countries. To that extent, it behoves us, therefore, in catering for the location of industries and training workers to man them, to invest heavily in technical skills.  The Minister, in conformity with the <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i>, is quite right in moving forward, regardless of what the trends outside may be, provided, and there is always a yardstick by which to measure, that exports can be stimulated and the new industries are able to find a market either in Europe, North America, or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago, if Mr. Heuston, the head of the Universal Stores, had considered the competition he had to meet, his concern&mdash;it was a very small unit in those days&mdash;would not be the concern it is today.  I submit there is nothing to be gained at this stage by <Col N="804" /> being hesitant.  Rather, we should be the other way.  Those who never made a mistake never made anything; in the years ahead, our investment in technical skills, plant and machinery will pay dividends in the face of allcomers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister will recognise the justice and reasonableness of the requisition upon him to tell us how much of the £15,000,000 to which he refers in one paragraph as the total capital investment, represents grants from An Foras Tionscal, how much represents foreign capital investment, and how much represents domestic private capital investment. It may not be possible to give a figure accurate to a couple of thousand pounds.  A global figure representing these three elements would, I think, help us materially to weigh up the value of the investment that has so far taken place because we will then be able to look at it in the context of an expected employment of 5,500 men and 4,500 women.</P>
      <P>I have heard it said that if you are a citizen of Japan, or Germany, or Greece, you will be received with a red carpet in Foras Tionscal; but if you are a citizen of Mayo, or Cork, or Waterford you are treated with scant respect.  In so far as my experience goes, and in so far as my information goes, there is no truth whatever in that suggestion.  So far as I know, Foras Tionscal will receive a proposal for industrial development from people at home or abroad with equal enthusiasm and with an equal readiness to help in its realisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, the Minister should face another problem, which is being mooted at the present time and which is causing a certain amount of anxiety; that is, the employment of juvenile labour without the intention of retaining it after its training has been completed.  If there is no substance in that apprehension, then let it be explained and dismissed.  But there is no doubt that many people believe that of that 4,500 women and 5,500 men, a not inconsiderable proportion will be more aptly described as boys and girls.  That, in itself, may not be wholly objectionable if these <Col N="805" /> trainees are going to be retained in adult employment when their period of training has been completed.  If, on the other hand, a high proportion of that employment represents apprentices who will not be offered permanent employment at the end of their apprenticeship, then I think such a labour practice would have to be investigated.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said a very grave thing.  He said he understood some of the foreign capital coming in here came in with a strong prejudice against normal trade union practice.  That would be a very grave situation and the Minister will have an obligation to remind Foras Tionscal they should inform intending investors that our practice is to regard the trade union movement as a responsible and permanent element in our society and that there is no section of our community which would look with favour on any proposal to initiate a movement designed to destroy trade union activity in normal labour relations in this country.  The sooner that is made perfectly clear to everybody, the better industrial relations we can look forward to.  Any misapprehension in that regard will simply give rise to labour unrest and upheavals which could spread and create endless trouble for all concerned.  It is much better for people who intend to invest in industry here to know that industrial relations here are largely based on a responsible trade union movement and that any attempt to short-circuit or avoid that will only beget labour unrest, which nobody wants, and which rational labour relations can easily avoid.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which Deputy Corish referred.  Maybe I am too understanding in this regard.  He spoke of a letter that had received a good deal of publicity in which a firm had seemed to imply that it challenged the right of a trade union to plead on behalf of its employees.  I saw a copy of that letter.  It was widely circulated. If one wants to understand it in that sense, then one certainly can, but the impression I got of that letter was that it was written by somebody who thought he spoke and wrote English perfectly but who in fact did not.  He <Col N="806" /> spoke it fluently and wrote it fluently but he did not understand fully the idioms he sought to employ.</P>
    <P>Having a bowing acquaintance with more than one foreign language myself, I realise how extremely dangerous it is to try to be idiomatic in any other language than the language which one learned <i>as an cliabhán,</i> as we say in our own language.  That letter struck me as the letter of a person who overestimated his own mastery of the English language and in his attempt to inflect idiomatically, he in fact used turns of phrase which were well calculated to give grave offence to somebody who fully understood the language: yet the letter was so fluently written that it might mislead many who read it into believing that the man who wrote it understood all the implications of the turns of phrase he elected to employ.</P>
    <P>That is a serious danger.  There can be no more deplorable misunderstanding than to take a false meaning from what another man says, because, although many people have not yet learned it, it is not what a man says that really matters&mdash;it is what he means.  Therefore, before losing one's temper with one's neighbour, one ought to be quite certain not only that one has heard what he actually said but that one understands what he really means.</P>
    <P>I know nothing is easier than to say that is all hooey but labour relations can be poisoned on either side.  The employer can be misunderstood just as readily as the worker.  If we enjoin strictly on employers the obligation fully to understand the problems of their workers, there is a corresponding obligation on responsible trade union officials and workers fully to understand what their employers say and, more important, what their employers mean.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to give us certain particulars by way of breakdown of the £15 million referred to. I will ask him for another specific piece of information.  He said on 31st January, 1962, there were 70 projects in the undeveloped areas in production which have been assisted by Foras Tionscal.  Could he tell us at this stage <Col N="807" /> what assistance those have got and what actual employment they are giving as at 31st January?</P>
    <P>In addition to those specific matters, I want to raise a much wider matter. It is not primarily associated with the Common Market; it is associated with the whole development of the world around us.  We are passing through an extraordinary revolution and I am conscious of a certain Cassandra gift which haunts me. It is some considerable time since I first told Deputies in this House that they would live to see the day of the free passage of men, money and goods throughout the free world.  When I first told Deputies that, I was looked upon as a traitor by the Fianna Fáil Party and as a visionary by a great many others.  Of course, if anybody suggested now that the free passage of men, money and goods was not a good thing, the Fianna Fáil Party would all obediently stand up and denounce him for treason again. I told you that was coming; now it is here, the free passage of men, money and goods throughout the whole of Europe and the younger ones amongst you may well see it not only throughout the whole of Europe but throughout America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and most of the free nations of the world.</P>
    <P>That development is relatively insignificant compared with another development that is silently creeping in upon us like the tide, that is, the process of automation.  Many of us have heard the word &ldquo;automation&rdquo; and have read about it, but I think very few people in this country realise what a monster it will be if we do not prepare a suitable cage to contain it and suitable harness to control it. Taking the long view, I believe if suitable measures are taken by mankind to make automation serve mankind, it can bring great blessings in its wake, but if it is allowed to march in upon us unprepared, it can precipitate as great disasters as the industrial revolution did 150 years ago, and the tragedy of it is that I do not think people will wake up to this situation.</P>
    <P>Let me tell a story.  I went recently to Germany and in the course of my <Col N="808" /> peregrinations in Germany, I visited some large factories.  One factory was a great steel factory which consisted of four great workshops, each of them 200 or 300 yards long built around a square.  In the first workshop, there were 200 or 300 men working.  They were making steel pipes.  In the second workshop there were 200 or 300 men making steel pipes of a different diameter.  In the third workshop, there were 200 or 300 men working mainly at the production of steel pipes but with a certain diversification into contract jobs as well, and that was very significant.  Then we came to the fourth workshop which had been built within the past four years.  I saw the sheet steel come in at one end and I went to the other end of the factory and I saw coming out, like drops of water falling, a 40 foot length of steel pipe every second of every minute of every hour of the day.  How many men were working in that workshop?  Fourteen: fourteen men in white coats.  I said to the proprietor of the factory: &ldquo;This fourth unit must be a great economy to you.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;It is, provided one thing&mdash;that I have a customer waiting for every length of pipe that comes out every second of every minute of every hour of every day because, if I have not, this workshop must close down.  In regard to the other three, I have all the flexibility of a labour force.  If the demand for a particular pipe is not there that any one of these workshops is producing, I can get contract work.  They are all skilled men and I can put them to that.  I can even lay them off for a while, if that is necessary.  At present, we are working three shifts a day.  I can always cut down one shift in that shop but in this shop it must not stop because, by reason of the vast capital investment, it will eat up in a week the profits of a month.  Therefore, I must have a demand to keep it working its entire normal working time.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does that mean if we look far ahead?  Does that not mean that over a whole vast range of industry, production must be matched to immense consumption?  One might think that this was a peculiarity of one particular branch of industry, if one did not read the current literature of the situation <Col N="809" /> that is developing in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that in the past ten years the production of coal in America has increased by 25 per cent. and the labour force involved has declined by 50 per cent.  The menacing character of this whole development is that while one can understand it in relation even to steel pipes or bars or coal it is now passing beyond that stage to the point where, by the most elaborate processes, the very manufacture of electronic equipment, which heretofore had been regarded as involving the very quintessence of human skill, is becoming automated.  It is coming to be discovered that once you get the prototype, automatic equipment is more reliable in the manufacture of complicated delicate machinery, which heretofore was indissolubly associated with human skill, than the most skilled operative because it can so be fixed that if it begins to do something wrong, alarm bells will ring, lights will go on and the machine can be stopped until the error is detected.  It eliminates the possibility of the human frailty which may falter at some stage of a difficult technical process.</P>
    <P>How are we going to fit large-scale industrial development here with that prospect of automation?  I think you will find that the sorts of large industries that developing countries such as ours yearn for at this time will be wholly impossible for us ten or fifteen years from today.</P>
    <P>I saw another process in one of those factories, which I shall not describe in detail, which, up to six months ago, had occupied 40 men in three shifts per day.  The entire process is now carried out by two men sitting at a thing like an organ console and pressing buttons.  Every step that hitherto occupied the close attention of forty men in three shifts is now discharged by two men sitting at a newly-installed machine which, for a variety of reasons, could replace forty men. Very well.  What are we to learn from that?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that we have to learn a lesson.  I am not so sure that the economists or the scribes of the Grey <Col N="810" /> Book are infallible.  The economists and the technicians only too often allow themselves to be dazzled by the statistical information they now possess.  It is the fate of the unfortunate politicians to be the people who have to think not only of tomorrow but of people as well as things.</P>
    <P>I am wondering if we have not got a very valuable industrial potential in the very areas Foras Tionscal are designed to serve.  May I put it this way?  In our special circumstances, might we not be better to make gaskets rather than motor cars?  I do not think, if you take things like gaskets, that it will ever be economic to automate that process; the capital investment bears no relation to the end product; and, probably, for all foreseeable time, an end product of the value of a gasket will be met by all the ordinary industrial processes with which we are familiar today whereas an end product as valuable as a motor car will become more and more and more the subject of an automated process.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is a real prospect for relatively small industries concerned to produce an essential but not readily automated product in a country such as ours.</P>
    <P>There is another thing.  Are we not better employed producing blankets from Irish wool rather than yarn from imported Australian merino?  Our future in the industrial picture rests largely upon industry founded on our own natural resources in which I include agricultural produce and its by-products such as native wool, the processing of meat and the production of industrial goods the nature of which virtually excludes them from the possibility of economic automation. But what I want to warn this House of is that the future industrial policy of this country&mdash;and not only of Ireland but of every country&mdash;can be formulated only in the light of the knowledge of what is going on and in the realisation that the silent tide of automation is rolling on much more quickly than anyone in this country at present suspects.</P>
    <P>I have recently seen it alleged on <Col N="811" /> high authority in the U.S.A. that their present level of unemployment is going to continue for the foreseeable future because no inroads that expanding production can reasonably be hoped to make upon it can keep pace with the progress of automation and the consequent displacement of labour.  One body of trade unionists in New York have recently established the necessity, I think, of a 24-hour working week.  I do not say that is directly the result of automation&mdash;I do not believe it is&mdash; but I believe that we are moving into a world which many of us in this House will live to see where a 30-hour working week will be regarded as nothing remarkable in a fully-industrialised community.</P>
    <P>That will give rise to other social problems which it may be profitable to discuss on another occasion but the point I am trying to bring to the Minister's attention and especially to the attention of my colleague, Deputy Barry, is that what seems today a highly-skilled industrial area may be the first to suffer when the full impact of automation comes upon us and what seems today to be a deplorably underdeveloped area into which an industry is being brought by the operation of Foras Tionscal may prove in the day of wider automation the more stalwart survivor in the icy blast of automated competition.</P>
    <P>I think there is a great social advantage in placing an industry in a small country town.  You would want to live in and know country towns to understand the full significance of that proposition.  Our whole structure of society in rural Ireland has been built up on a populous countryside, with towns and villages mainly occupied in the service of the surrounding families living on the land.  In the past five years, a quarter of a million of those people have gone; between 200,000 and 250,000 have left the country and they were the biggest consumers in the families from which they went and they have mainly gone from the areas which Foras Tionscal is concerned to serve.  I do not see any of my colleagues from Monaghan here: if they were, they would tell you of the spectacle of Newbliss&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is not a happy thought. When I first went to Monaghan, I do not think there was an unoccupied house in Newbliss; I think one house in every three in Newbliss is now abandoned and in the surrounding countryside, the houses are abandoned. No doubt, the reason is that the disappearance of the people from the countryside has meant a reduced demand for services&mdash;and I have seen it happen.  I have seen the small shop which sustained the family in prosperity and which sent the children to the primary and secondary schools and also to the university, gradually sinking in status from being a shop to being a hucksters.  I have seen the family in that home, which I knew when I was young, comfortable, proud and independent, becoming poor and in the most distressing poverty, the poverty that was too proud to show its rags, the poverty that kept up a brave front, the poverty that went smartly dressed to Mass on Sunday but often went without its midday meal on weekdays in the backroom of what used to be a prosperous establishment. The process is not too long delayed.  They close; the family goes and is forgotten except by those of us who remember them and who grew up with them.  But the accumulation of the disappearances means the beginning of the decline of the town.  I suppose people who have grown up in cities cannot feel as we feel about the disappearance of a town we have spent our lives in and the scattering of the neighbours among whom we grew up and whose presence constitutes home.  Is that sentiment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish Deputy Barry would accompany me to Newbliss and see for himself that it is neither highly-coloured nor exaggerated.  I doubt if there is any Deputy from rural Ireland who, if he felt free to tell the whole story as he knows it, would not say that what I say is true, that the population of rural Ireland has declined and that the small towns of Ireland are dying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> They are a very valuable element in Irish society; the small farmer is a precious asset and the small businessman in the rural towns has been one of the most stabilising influences to hold our society together.  I want to say this on good authority&mdash;I often heard it said by the leaders of the Land League&mdash;if it were not for the money from America, and the publicans of rural Ireland, they could never have fought the land war.  That is not so hard to understand.  It was very largely the small businessman of rural Ireland who financed the land war, because the people for whom the Land League were fighting were the fathers, sisters, brothers, cousins or nephews of the small businessmen of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is a good thing to tear up the whole social pattern of the life we have in Ireland.  I have travelled the world and lived in many foreign countries, and I think the life we have in Ireland is pleasant.  I might have lived in America if I had elected to stay there.  I lived there when I was young and, with the exception of Ireland, there is no country in the world I would prefer to live in than America.  I think probably people can have a better life in Ireland than almost anywhere else in the world, if it is the kind of life they like to live.  It is probably objectively a better life, and it is a better life because of the social pattern we have got of property-owning people in which there are no rich and no poor, founded very largely on the property-owning farmers of Ireland and the small towns of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe those small towns probably can be salvaged from the consequences of emigration by the establishment of small industries and when the full story comes to be told and automation has had its way throughout the Continent of Europe, and in the presence of the free passage of men, money and goods, I venture to foretell that it is the relatively small industries that some of the economists now describe as uneconomic that will survive the storm and challenge of automation, and that some of the glossier industrial units that hold their heads high today will go down before that challenge.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> Therefore, so far as I am concerned, I will take a chance on the establishment of industries in rural Ireland.  I will take a chance that I see this problem in better perspective than some of the dry-as-dust economists who would use statistics to prove that industry outside a city of less than 50,000 population is an anachronism.  I think the small industrial unit may have a real, permanent place in the world of tomorrow. The more I see of developments in the world around me the more convinced I am that it is in that sphere the industrial future of Ireland lies and that the sooner we hitch our industrial wagon to that star, the more secure the future of our investment will be.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say to the Minister is this: It is very easy to peg rocks at every failure with which Foras Tionscal are associated.  Failures are inevitable in connection with the programme Foras Tionscal have been directed to carry on.  We may see a thing quite clearly here because we are constantly discussing such matters and are in intimate contact with them, but there is a thing that we in this House sometimes forget and should not forget, that in our form of society we have not only got to do the right thing, and we have not only to persuade the Dáil and the Oireachtas that what we are doing is right, but we have to keep the people persuaded that we are doing the right thing on their behalf, because without the people's support anything we resolve to do could not long continue.</P>
    <P>It is from that aspect that I think there is real value in the suggestion that we should at least examine the question as to whether on the occasion of the investment of public money in an enterprise by Foras Tionscal there should not be some representation for Foras Tionscal in the undertaking. I throw this out merely as a thought.  I am not sure how it would work, but we are all familiar with the practice that has grown up in Great Britain, mainly since the war&mdash;and it was in operation before the war&mdash;of issuing what are called A shares in a company, that is, shares which are entitled to the full dividends payable <Col N="815" /> on the ordinary share capital of the company, but have no voting rights.  I wonder could we turn that concept upside down and, if we want to give a company a grant under this scheme, make provision that the company should issue to Foras Tionscal a corresponding number of what we could call X shares.  These would be shares which would be entitled to no dividend but which would have an equal vote with the ordinary shares of the company.  We should not have greater influence on the destiny of the company than our investment entitles us to.  We need not make the investment if we do not want to.</P>
    <P>If we make our minds up that it is desirable to contribute £40,000 to an enterprise the total capital investment of which involves £250,000, is not there something to be said for entitling Foras Tionscal to receive 40,000 shares with full voting rights which they could use at the annual general meetings or for such other purposes as the Companies Act allows?</P>
    <P>The Minister will say, naturally: &ldquo;Well, even if you had 40,000 shares in a company with a capital of £¼ million, what good would it do?&rdquo;  It would give the right to receive the accounts and attend the annual general meetings and, possibly, to combine with other minority shareholders to make your views prevail against the views of the principal shareholders if it was necessary and desirable to intervene in the management of the company.  In any case it might have&mdash; I am not sure of this at all&mdash;the very desirable effect of reassuring the public that their money was not handed over to someone without leaving behind it any lien in the hands of the donor on foot of which he could from time to time call for an accounting of what had become of the money the State had put up.</P>
    <P>We do know of cases where foreign investors have suddenly withdrawn and as a result of holdings which the State has, either directly or indirectly, they have been able to keep the enterprise going.  That is a desirable thing, rather than to create in the public mind the impression that the whim or sentiment <Col N="816" /> of the foreign investor could create a situation in which a number of people employed here could lose their employment when, if Foras Tionscal or the Department of Industry and Commerce, or the Minister for Finance, had had an adequate say in the control of the enterprise, that employment could have been preserved.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to say this: my interest in promoting industry is primarily to provide good employment for our own people, in decent conditions, in their own country.  I know of no other valid reason for the artificial stimulation of industry in this country and this is artificial stimulation of industry, and when we endorse it, we should remember that it is an illusion to imagine that this kind of thing was always necessary to get industry going in Ireland.  The greatest industries here were all established under the full blast of free trade. Guinness's Brewery, Jacob's biscuit factory, Harland and Wolff, all the shipbuilding industry of Belfast.</P>

      <P>No, but how many ships are on the slips of Harland and Wolff?  Ask Rotterdam.  But the blanket factory in Foxford that was started on a thráneen 70 years ago by a Sister of Charity is making more blankets today than it was making in 1885 when it was first established. There is a lesson to be learned there. In the times that were in it, this country was capable of producing great industries but those were the days when industry depended very largely on the skill of men's hands and when they were wanted, they were found in abundance and there was genius enough here, native genius, sufficient to match the best that could be brought from the four corners of the earth.  It was the stimulation of full free trade that brought those great industries to their glory.  I am not so sure that in the time that lies ahead, the age of automation, the prospects are the same but I believe there is an alternative and I believe that Foras Tionscal may be laying the foundation for something that will long survive, if it chooses wisely, and <Col N="817" /> that it has an immense additional advantage in that in addition to making a contribution in physical wealth, it is helping to save the social pattern of society which I think is the equal, if not the superior, of any other on earth.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister and the Board of Foras Tionscal deserve our greatest appreciation and support.  Since 1952 the progress they have been making has been good.  It may not have been as spectacular as we would have wished but it is only when one is closely associated with the amount of work and research necessary to bring a scheme to fruition that one appreciates the sometimes annoying delays that take place.  I am glad that the Board is being enlarged and I shall welcome any future assistance the Minister can give to the Board.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies here are anxious to get industries for their various areas. I should like to add that the placing of industry is not just the simple process many people take it to be.  I have met people in the west of Ireland who say: &ldquo;Place an industry with us&rdquo; and in that town there is neither an organisation nor any body prepared to receive such an industry. I may say that in some western towns development associations are helping considerably to ease this problem. Nevertheless it does require, even in those towns, one or two individual leaders who are prepared to back their enterprise with their own finance, skill and knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Industry requires more than just a dream.  It requires more than just money and more than just a building or machinery.  There is the technical know-how, the background and the experience that is necessary.  Industrial thinking is also required, which is the fundamental of industry.  Even when you have established industry for years, those earning their living from it have not come to realise how important they are to that industry or how large a part they play in it. They do not realise that their contribution and skill is needed and that if an industry is to succeed, they must acquire that skill and must apply themselves <Col N="818" /> to the job.  These, to my mind, are some of the most fundamental requirements.</P>
    <P>The most important and essential factor in all industry is manpower, the right type of manpower, and that manpower must be equipped with the right outlook and be capable of the right sort of thinking, if industry is to go ahead.  Public representatives everywhere should take careful note of what I am saying.  They will save themselves a lot of trouble if they encourage those who have the ability to read and take note of these ideas and they will then be much closer to getting that industry which they so desire.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Flanagan praised the siting of industry in any small town where there is a surplus of workers coming off the farm.  They all know that apart from one or two who may remain on the farm, the remainder will inevitably leave.  There is no place for those people to go except to the nearest town or to the city, to get a job, or to emigrate.  It is only right to sponsor and encourage industry to absorb these people.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the red carpet being put down for foreigners rather than Irishmen.  Anybody who has any experience of Foras Tionscal will know that to be nothing more than the disgruntled bleatings of somebody who did not get his own way.  I have heard it only from someone who was turned down for one reason or another. There is no fundamental truth in it whatever.  This criticism of foreigners coming here should stop.  A lot of harm is being done by people who do not understand but who talk too glibly.</P>
    <P>Foreigners come to this country with a lot more than merely their hands out to take our money.  They come with skill and technical knowledge.  They have something to give us and to leave behind them when they go.  If they fail sometimes, there is not a complete loss because they leave trained people behind them and we benefit by their industrial experience.  Foras Tionscal should not be judged by the failures that have taken place&mdash;and they are few&mdash;<Col N="819" /> but rather by the magnificent advances that have been made.</P>
    <P>A foreigner coming to set up an industry here is naturally welcome, if he brings a market with him.  Today no industry can hope to achieve anything, unless it has a market or knows where it can get one.  I laud the efforts of Foras Tionscal quickly to locate such industries here, whether they be Japanese, German or from any other country.  There are many safeguards to protect our property and to exercise control, and we should not frighten off these people.</P>
    <P>Frequently it happens that information is given to foreigners coming here that our wages are inordinately low.  That may be true in the case of road workers and other rural workers. However, we should inform these people that we have trade unions here and that they make what might be termed inordinate demands but which are, in fact, based on the wages paid in Ireland and elsewhere.  Development associations should not tell foreigners they can get workers to work in engineering or textile factories here for 2/- or 2/6 an hour.  That may be true before the plant is established, but after that, the local trade union organiser will make his demand.  I do not object to organised labour but rather do I welcome it.  I always have and I always shall.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Corish criticise the employment of juvenile labour.  I have no doubt that from his wide experience he knows of such incidents, but I think they are only isolated incidents and that, in relation to the matter we are discussing, his remarks might well have been left out.  They, too, may go abroad and give the impression that boys and girls of 14 and 15 are being exploited here.  By and large, that is untrue and should be repudiated.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with the matter of female labour.  There are some industries for which the woman worker is more suited than the man.  She has, for instance, greater dexterity in many ways, especially in the handling of small parts.  Many industries coming <Col N="820" /> here are engaged in the assembly of small parts and are used to employing female labour abroad.  I do not see anything wrong in employing such labour here.  We might as well employ them at home rather than have them go to Birmingham and other industrial centres to do the same kind of work. I do not think we should discourage them.  We should, of course, welcome greater employment of male labour, inasmuch as the men are the breadwinners.</P>
    <P>A thing we probably forget here in our striving for industry is that the same race is going on in every country of the world.  Recently I was in the New England States of America and I was surprised to find in Massachusetts and New Hampshire that the local authorities were offering great inducements to people to establish industries in those areas.  I saw there the results of the decline in the woollen industry when hundreds of factories closed down.  They were anxious to get these people back to work.  This is another aspect of the migration that took place to the Mississippi and New Orleans areas.  These demands for industries are similar to ours, and I must say our inducements compare favourably.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon sees a great change coming over the world: the age of automation.  As he was talking, I was thinking that this is the Space Age and that we expect even greater things than automation.  I was pleased to hear him say that he felt that in the western areas, in the undeveloped areas, the small industries would inevitably be the ones that would survive.  In Ireland, we can handle only very small industries.  Even though we face the age of automation, man has faced many crises before and there is no reason for us to back away from our task until the horrible giant envelops us.  Let us work and do what we can. We can deal with that problem as it arises, because I have no doubt that man will find an answer to the age of automation.</P>
    <P>Today we see demands by trade unions and workers for a shorter working week.  On the papers every day of the week, we see the results of a <Col N="821" /> shorter working week on the great industrial empire of America.  Today, because of the shorter working week and the high cost of production, their people cannot sustain themselves on one job but now have to work 80 hours a week instead of the ideal 25 hours a week or even 40 hours a week.  No matter how gloomy is the picture of the future painted by the economists, the practical thinkers know that ultimately man will have the last say.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by wishing the Minister, Foras Tionscal and all concerned with industrial development every success in their efforts.  I shall do everything I can, both here and down the country, so that we may be able to reduce, by even one person per day, the number of those who have to seek employment abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one thing which has become obvious from our deliberations here and from what we have heard and read in the news in recent weeks, it is that we must have capital invested in large measure before any grant or loan from Government sources or from Government-sponsored institutions is warranted.  I shall point to particular items that come to mind.  One is the necessity last week to provide money for the development of St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  I felt it was a very good thing for us to provide a direct loan of £250,000 for this company which had been floated on the Canadian stock exchange so that there was a sum of 6,000,000 Canadian dollars in Avoca as well as approximately the same amount from a credit company here and a direct payment from the capital side of the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we give these loans and grants, if we are in for a penny, we are in for a pound, and we go into something which becomes a social benefit&mdash;something related to the employment of hundreds of men and girls in a project.  From that point of view, I think it could not be stressed sufficiently strongly that we should insist on a pretty large measure of capital investment by industrialists before we put beside it sizeable <Col N="822" /> grants and loans from Government institutions.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the idea of the Undeveloped Areas Act is a social concept and while I am entirely behind such a concept&mdash;indeed, from my experience in County Louth where we have successful rural industrialisation, I can speak with some authority &mdash;anybody who has been in the villages Deputy Dillon mentioned can realise the necessity for bringing some employment there.  I remember in a bye-election visiting Dromod, Dromsna and Jamestown in Sligo-Leitrim and finding that two houses in three in those villages were closed.  It is quite important that something in the nature of this Act exists to try to do something about a situation like that.</P>
    <P>I do not think this is a pipe-dream because in the village of Dunleer, we have 600 people employed in a G.E.C. plant and not five miles away, in two or three industries in Castlebellingham, we have another 150 employed&mdash; two areas where there were no industries of any kind heretofore.  I met the principal of one of those factories which employed only girls.  He spoke of the 50 girls working there and said: &ldquo;I can tell you the standard of the work I am getting here is so far ahead of the parent factory at Stockport that we can undersell the parent factory as far away as Canada and the West Indies.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is proof that we have here a pool of good workers in rural areas, something they have not got on the continent of Europe.  Therefore, I believe if we do this thing well, we shall go from success to success and employ more people in these industries. But do not forget the situation also has its trouble.  I am quite certain that if the Drogheda Chamber of Commerce heard me speaking now, they would immediately go for their guns because they will tell you they lost a factory because of the lack of the extra grants paid only in the case of underdeveloped areas.</P>
    <P>They will tell you there was a proposal for a factory in the town to produce a type of fuel on the dockside but that they needed extra grants. The nearest place the sponsors of the <Col N="823" /> industry could put up a factory and qualify for the extra grants was Athlone but that would mean moving this waste fuel to Athlone and the finished product back again to Dublin for consumption and shipment so that the cost of the operation would far outweigh any advantage there was in getting the extra grants and establishing the industry in Athlone.</P>
    <P>That means that everything in the garden is not so rosy and I think we must look at this in a more flexible way&mdash;that no matter what Government is here in the next five years, unless some flexibility is introduced, it will be a case of all the Deputies of the undeveloped areas yelling to keep the <i>status quo</i> and all of us who are not in these areas shouting the other way. There will have to be flexibility, and the instance I suggested to the House where we lost an industry entirely because the extra grant was not applicable to a place which had a particular label on it is proof of this necessity for flexibility.  How we are to do that, I do not know, but there are types of industries which suit undeveloped areas and some which do not.  Is it not quite obvious that the Aspro factory should not have been established on the Naas Road but somewhere like Belmullet, because you can put enough Aspros to cure all the sick heads in the country into one lorry?</P>

      <P>The factory I mentioned which employ 600 people in Dunleer spent a fortune round the corner from Earlsfort Terrace on a building which was to be its distributing centre because they thought they could achieve more efficient distribution from Dublin to all parts of the world.  They found, however, that the range of their products was such that they could not do it, that they had to keep their stock at the point of manufacture.  That is one industry <Col N="824" /> which would not be suited at all to Belmullet. It just would not exist if it were not established somewhere like Louth or Dublin.</P>
      <P>My point is that you can get far too hidebound and that legislation as it stands is, in fact, far too hidebound and too tight.  We must not approach this matter in a parochial way but in a manner which will benefit the country as a whole.  My view is that whoever does it in the next five years, if this legislation still stands and we enter the Common Market, it will be changed and made more flexible.  You will find you are losing industries because of what I point out.  That does not mean I do not want to see an industry based in the three villages I mentioned where two out of three houses were empty and where I saw fine shops which had not seen a coat of paint for some ten to 15 years.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish made a point with regard to juvenile labour.  One of the criteria of a good employer is that he does not employ a small boy, unless he feels there is some hope of giving that boy a man's wage when he reaches man's estate.  If you watch factory employment and employment which is not messenger boy employment, you will find that the badge of a good employer is that that is what he does. He does not have three or four boys around the place for money saving purposes.  He has, perhaps, one or two boys and what he is trying to do is to bring them to the stage of 17 or 18 years when he takes them on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact was mentioned that from an expenditure of £15 million, we hope to get 10,000 new jobs, of which 5,500 will be for men and the balance for women.  The expenditure is £1,500 per worker.  I do not know whether that figure includes trading capital.  Some people thought that figure was high. I am quite certain it is extraordinarily low and I am also certain that it does not include trading capital.  If you had them putting rubber bands on bundles of match sticks which are extremely scarce at the moment, as well as sick heads, you would find that, if trading capital is included, you could not look at employing one person for £1,500.  The figure would be nearer <Col N="825" /> £3,000 or, perhaps, in some industries, it would be far greater.  I hope we will have this pool of workers and the flexibility.  I should like to see that introduced in this Act.</P>
    <P>We are merely passing a Supplementary Estimate and I wish it the very best.  I hope the money will be well spent.  I know that the people in Foras Tionscal are doing their best. Whoever is here this day five years, flexibility will have to be introduced. Did we or did we not lose the Dupont people to Northern Ireland?  I do not know.  I can only base my views on rumour and if rumour is right, we did, because we did not compete outside the undeveloped areas with the incentives offered in Northern Ireland. One does not legislate here as if one could pontificate as well as legislate. It is not a case of giving these people what you were going to give them and that they had nowhere else to go.</P>
    <P>What counts here is a change in the legislation to give greater flexibility, not for the purpose of looking after places like Louth or Kildare even though unemployment could possibly be more unpleasant especially for a man with a family in those places than in the undeveloped areas.  It is not for the purpose of giving them the advantage.  It is not for the purpose of stopping development in the undeveloped areas.  It is for the purpose of getting all the fish we cast our net for and making sure that some do not escape.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement indicated that the provisions of the Act would expire in 1963 and that long before that time, he would introduce a new Bill.  I was wondering whether, in the event of our entry into the European Economic community, the grants and subsidies would be permissible.  I think it is one of the principles of the Rome Treaty that not only tariffs but subsidies will disappear.  I should like a statement from the Minister indicating whether <Col N="826" /> I am right in suggesting that it may be necessary for us to withdraw what may be regarded as subsidies and which are, in fact, subsidies to the industries not alone in the western areas but in other parts of the country as well.  That is something we should know in advance for industrialists, especially foreign industrialists.</P>
    <P>I do not think the facilities given by the Undeveloped Areas Act are at all the greater attraction.  Having met some of these people, I find, as I am sure many people who have been in touch with them find, that the chief attraction for these people in this country is the free availability of labour.  Such labour is capable of being trained very quickly and is very receptive of training in the industrial field.</P>
    <P>I find that is the major attraction. That gives rise to a situation in most parts of the west for which the 1952 Undeveloped Areas Act was passed. It gives rise to this situation.  While larger numbers of children are at school, we find that part of the population is migratory and that the figures registered at the labour exchanges are not, in fact, true figures of the potential availability of labour at all.</P>
    <P>In any town in Donegal, there are a certain number of unemployed ready to be put on the labour exchange, if an industry is started.  Some of those would not be employable.  Some of them are possibly too old for industrial work but that number is not the number that would be available for employment but a far larger number, especially of the younger people, boys and girls, who emigrated over the past few years and who have not settled down in employment in Britain, who, indeed, do not like the employment in Britain and who would prefer to live in their own home surroundings in Ireland, if they could get continuous, steady, all-the-year-round work.</P>
    <P>I maintain that in our efforts to attract industrialists to the West of Ireland, special emphasis should be laid on the fact that not alone have we the registered numbers on the labour exchanges available, but, over <Col N="827" /> and above that, there are those who have emigrated and who would come back in the morning if suitable, fairly decently paid work were available. This idea of grants and subsidies has, due to the over-employment which the Western European countries have at the moment, been relegated to a place of secondary importance.  The important item now is the availability of labour and the type of labour that can be readily trained.</P>
    <P>I have just been wondering over the past couple of years, looking at Press reports of industries which were started under the aegis of Foras Tionscal, whether any direction was given to industrialists who came here to establish an industry as to where they should go.  I feel that the three Ulster counties of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan have not received a fair percentage of the overall industrial development under the 1952 Act.  That is a mistake.  Special emphasis should be given and special efforts made in respect of the setting up of industries in these three border counties, in view of the situation in the Six Counties. We should show here that progress is being made all over the country, so that the people up North cannot say that everything is going to the south of Ireland.  That is an everyday statement up there.</P>
    <P>While we welcome and encourage foreign investment in industry here and especially in industry in the West of Ireland I think that the dice should be loaded in favour of Irish enterprise. I think that if Irish businessmen come forward with a proposal the grants they get should be that little bit more generous than in the case of a similar proposal backed by foreign capital.  It is only right that we should try to have Irish capital invested in this country.  We all know that Irish capital is going outside and being invested in Britain and we should encourage our own people who have the capital to invest it here by leaning over a bit in their favour in the way of higher grants.  The statement has been made here that we welcome the foreigner with a bigger smile than we do the Irish.  I do not believe that but I do suggest that we should encourage our <Col N="828" /> own people by giving them higher grants.</P>
    <P>When proposals are brought before the Industrial Development Association and Foras Tionscal, it should be remembered that the people who have got together to make these proposals have put much effort into their work. Many pots are scraped to get together the necessary local capital.  I do not think it is right that these people should be told in a very brief note that their proposal has been rejected. They should be told on what grounds it has been rejected and we should go so far as to suggest to them what could be done to improve the proposal.</P>
    <P>If the proposal is a dud, they should be told in what respect it is so.  These people may try to get further capital together and go ahead with such a project, despite the fact that it has been turned down because of the expert opinion of Foras Tionscal and others who have an intimate knowledge of the set-up and the export market.  Why should that expert opinion not be passed on to the small group of people who are doing their best to bring industries to the western counties?  It is only fair that they should be told why the proposal is bad and if it is really very bad, they should be told that it has no hope of success.  If a proposal is such that it nearly reaches, but does not quite reach, the winning post, they should be told the reason, so that they may be able to come up with sufficient ammunition for success.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any effort has been made to interest people in the fishing industry.  I do not know of any industry which has such a source of raw material available and I wonder if any aid has been given by Foras Tionscal to the establishment of a fish processing industry.  If no such aid has been given, it is an awful pity.  Here we have a raw material freely available at home and, with the experience we have had since 1952, it is a pity that we should not try to develop it.  That reminds me that when an application is made for a grant to set up an industry, the grant should be slightly bigger if that industry is one which uses raw material produced here, from the farm, the sea or elsewhere. <Col N="829" /> The grant should be bigger in that case than if the raw materials have to be imported.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker more or less blamed the Government and Foras Tionscal for not having done more to capture the Dupont industry which went to the Six Counties.  I do not think he was right.  I do not think anybody here is to blame for that.  There was a rumour that we could have got that industry but that we missed it. He suggested that if we had allowed them to start in a certain place rather than in the West of Ireland, we would have got the industry.  I can say that, looking across the Foyle, on one side, you have the Dupont industry and on the other side, you have an area which qualifies for these grants.  The fact is it was not a case of their not wanting to go to a place like Donegal; they actually did go to a place right across the Foyle which probably had the same drawbacks as any of the undeveloped areas on the northern bank have.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  I hope the good work will continue.  We have had failures, and these failures have been mainly associated with foreign investors.  The latter have an unfortunate habit of pulling out, and their pulling out means that the know-how is gone; the industry comes to a full stop.  I suppose one must take a chance with these. As far as I know, greater care is taken now to ensure that the mistakes made in the past do not occur in the present or will not in the future.  I understand that before any grant is given, a complete checkup is carried out.  Experts are sent to investigate the parent company.  That ensures that we know what they are like in their own environment; if they behave in a similar fashion here, all will go well.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the Minister about a proposal concerning my own part of the country.  I think he is putting too many difficulties in the way.  He may know better than I do; he may have all the facts before him.  I know that there is always a difficulty where a new industry is established and people are put into employment, settle down and <Col N="830" /> build houses, etc., etc; if the industry folds up after a few years, then the last state is worst than the first.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I share some of the misgivings expressed by previous speakers in relation to the operation of the industrial grants policy.  I should like to make it clear at the outset that I think the Minister should avail of this opportunity to proclaim once more our willingness to receive foreign industrialists and should make it clear to all who may be in doubt that both sides of this House agree it is a good thing to bring in foreign industrialists. There has been too much ill-informed criticism in recent months.  We have heard references to the German invasion.  It is regrettable that some of our people thoughtlessly take their cue from the British Tory Press, deploring foreign industrialisation of this country.</P>
      <P>Like my colleagues in Fine Gael, I welcome the turn-about of Fianna Fáil policy in relation to foreign investment here.  The Government should pursue that turn-about to its logical conclusion and repeal <i>in toto</i> what remains of the Control of Manufactures Act.  That is another day's work.  I can recall that one of the first effects of Fianna Fáil coming into power in 1932 was the closing down of Gallaher's tobacco factory at East Wall Road because it was British controlled.  Fianna Fáil have learned a great deal since then.  That is a good thing for the country as a whole.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputy A. Barry has returned because I want to express my agreement with his general remarks on the social policy upon which we are basing our industrial grants system.  There is a good deal in what he says when he speaks of the sentimental approach to the industrialisation of the West of Ireland.  It is futile to look to industry for the revitalisation of small towns and villages where many obstacles confront those who start a manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total investment by the State and foreign participants is, the Ministers tells us, in the region of £15 million representing 122 companies.  I consider all these industries far too <Col N="831" /> small.  Deputy Dillon pointed out that the industry which will succeed in the future is the automated industry. Automation requires vast capital. We are all familiar with the concept and the economics of large-scale production. In order to have any chance in export markets resulting on entry to EEC, our industries will have to be based on large-scale production. Establishing a small factory employing 50 or 60 people, many of them girls, in a country town for the purpose of revitalising that town is not based on sound industrial economics.</P>
    <P>It is generally accepted that the industries that will succeed in the future are those which manufacture for a world market on a large scale.  They have tremendous differential advantages and lower costs of production per unit produced.  Too many people, including members of this House, sometimes get involved in local agitation for an industry here and an industry there; there is too much of that clamouring going on between one town and another.</P>

      <P>If employment opportunities are created in the country as a whole, we should welcome that evolution.  Artificial inducements to locate industry in one place rather than another can be overdone.  I am sure the Minister is aware that a growing number of people are thinking on these lines.  There have been too many failures of small-scale industries established with the aid of Government grants in recent years and a number of those failures are causing many people serious concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Even two are too many. <Col N="832" /> The question of transport costs is a very serious one for these rural industries.  I was talking to a German industrialist recently who told me that transport costs in Ireland were higher than he had experienced in any other country in Europe and he has factories in most countries in Western Europe. It might be worth considering providing a transport subsidy for these rural industries on a revenue basis rather than providing them with issued capital in the first place which may result in their entering into industry, as other speakers have pointed out, in an under-capitalised state.</P>
      <P>The principle of providing State grants is a very sound one.  We must industrialise, but I feel very strongly that it should be done on a larger scale, through larger companies.  As I have said before, if the Minister would save up all the money he has in mind for making grants, instead of giving small grants of £50,000 here and £40,000 there, and come along with £1 million or £2 million in his hand for some of the industrial giants of America or Britain, firms like I.C.I, and say to them: &ldquo;There is £2 million.  Match it pound for pound with your own money and start an industry, anything you like, in Ireland&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not baulked yet at any capital sums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that, and I should like to avail of this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on the recently announced aircraft industry which has been established with French participation and with Irish Government grants.  I feel very strongly that these large-scale industries are the ones which should avail of what should be the basic raw material for Irish industry in the future, namely, brain power.  Other speakers have expressed the idea that the best natural sources for our industries are agricultural products. The industries which succeed in other countries are those which engage in considerable research.  The industrial worker of the future will need to be a highly skilled technician.  We have no lack of brains in this country and if they are properly developed by industrial training courses and <Col N="833" /> apprenticeship schemes, I am convinced that the industries which make most use of this highly developed brain power are those which will succeed.</P>
      <P>We all know the story of terylene, the wonder fabric, which is being used more and more and which was discovered after years of research.  The firm which discovered it could afford to employ workers on research and their policy has paid off in ample dividends.  However, the small-scale industry working on capital of £25,000 or £50,000 cannot engage in such research and is unable to avail of highly-developed Irish skill and brains.</P>
      <P>Accepting the fact that foreign industry is desirable, I agree with previous speakers, particularly Deputy Corish, that we should endeavour to maintain some measure of control over these industries.  The precedent of appointing a Government-nominated director to private industry is one with which we are all familiar.  The Industrial Credit Company, when it takes shares in a company, invariably appoints its representative to the board of directors and, as Deputy Dillon said, even if the State does not draw any profit out of these companies, it is very desirable to have a watchdog-director there representing the public interest.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect of that which I should like to impress upon the Minister.  We should make it clear to foreigners coming here who are not familiar with our way of life that we are not trying to create a haven for wealthy industrialists, that we are plain simple people who live modestly, that we are not trying to create here a playground for millionaires, that we expect our workers to be well treated, that our fabric of industrial relations is based on the trade union movement and we will not countenance any failure on the part of foreign industrialists to deal with Irish workers organised in the usual manner through trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another suggestion I wish to make to the Minister.  We have too few industries which operate profit-sharing schemes with their employees. The worker who has invested years of labour in an industry is as much <Col N="834" /> entitled to a share of big profits, if they are made, as much entitled to a share in the control of that industry, as a small investor who puts £100 or £200 into it.  The Minister should use all the influence he can to persuade foreigners coming in here to operate their industry on a profit-sharing basis.  He would thereby be protecting the position of the worker and setting a very sound example to Irish industry on a global basis.</P>
    <P>Coming back to this point of the size of the industrial unit, it seems to me the Minister should concentrate his efforts on one or two towns which he should endeavour to industrialise fairly largely.  I am not for one moment suggesting that industries which should be coming to Dublin are going to other parts of the country. On the contrary, I deplore that parochial approach.  Dublin is already too big for the size of the country, but it is about time to start considering the building of new towns, which we know of from England where they built completely new towns of 50,000 population, towns like Harlowe and other places.  If the Minister were to take one or two towns in the West of Ireland and try to develop them intensively, he would find it a policy which would pay dividends.</P>
    <P>We must at all costs avoid the romantic approach in our endeavours to industrialise rural parts.  Business cannot be built on sentiment and romance, and the idea of revitalising some of these small towns in very pleasant parts of the country does not appear to be sound business in the light of current economic development.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, introduced by the Labour Party, may possibly be objected to by Government Deputies, as one was last week, because it is a <Col N="835" /> small Bill.  It ever there was an example of good goods in small parcels, this is it.  While there are only seven sections in the Bill, it covers two very important principles. The first is that the rural labourer is entitled to assistance from the local authority to purchase his home even if it is a vested local authority or county council cottage.</P>
      <P>I was rather amazed to hear a Fine Gael Deputy talk about the objection there might be to money being made available for that purpose but he did not develop the point.  The reason we want the money made available is that there are many hundreds of vested county council cottages in rural Ireland.  It sometimes happens that, for one reason or another, the tenant has to leave the district and often has to go across the water to seek employment.  The only people who could possibly use that cottage, rural labourers, have not the money to buy it and the cottage must be left there, locked up.</P>
      <P>When authority to vest the cottage in the tenant was given by this House there was a condition that such vested cottage could not be mortgaged.  The local authority and nobody else, not even a building society or a bank, can lend money for the purchase of the cottage.  The result is that these cottages must remain idle.  The local authority would be only too glad to lend the money to a deserving applicant for the purchase of such cottage. Instead, they must spend a lot of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cunningham will have ample opportunity to make his speech, if he has not already done so. Instead, the local authority must build a cottage for that person at a cost of £1,100 or £1,200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Bill is passed, the local authority will be enabled to lend the money and there will be no loss to anybody. The person will buy his home and will pay back the money to the <Col N="836" /> local authority over a period.  Instead of that, cottages are left there, and some of them are not improving over the years, while the owners are in the neighbouring town or working in England and waiting for somebody to purchase the cottage.</P>
    <P>The other problem that arises is where somebody has a cottage which he wishes to sell and the person who wishes to buy it may have some money but not all the money required.  This is where the highest bidder comes in.</P>
    <P>In some parts of the country, labourers' cottages are looked upon as a brand and some people feel that those who live in them should not be allowed in the area at all.  If some big landowners had their way, every effort would be made to wipe out such cottages.  The only way they can do that is by purchasing the cottage&mdash; which may have been erected in their grandfathers' time&mdash;in the open market.  In many cases they then turn it into a cattle shed or knock it down completely.  Examples of that can be seen every day all over the country.</P>
    <P>If a local labourer, anxious to buy the cottage, had the money and was able to compete against other prospective purchasers, he would buy it and live in it.  In that case it would become too expensive a luxury for the local farmer to buy the cottage so as to knock it down or to take the roof off or to put the cattle into it.  For that reason the Bill is worthy of support.</P>
    <P>As in the case of every Bill that passes through this House, there will be people putting forward opposite points of view.  I realise that many people will find numerous reasons, real or imaginary, as to why the Bill should not become law.  I feel sure there are sufficient sensible and honest people in the House who will realise that the Bill represents an effort to help a certain section of the community who very badly need help.  There is no political kudos in it for anybody.  If the Bill passes this House, I believe it will be considered by sane people as an excellent effort.  For that reason, I believe the House will give the Bill the necessary support.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the lending of money to a tenant of a local authority <Col N="837" /> vested cottage who is anxious to do repairs.  It was rather amusing to hear a Fianna Fáil Deputy talk about the excellent repair in which county council cottages must be before the county council will allow them to be vested.  I suggest that that person was speaking from ignorance rather than knowledge of the situation.  We know that a limited amount of money is made available annually by each local authority for the repair of county council cottages.  While practically every local authority are doing their best to get the cottages vested in the tenants, there are many tenants who are not financially able to carry out the repairs necessary for vesting.</P>
    <P>We all know the system.  Somebody applies for vesting and sends in a list of repairs.  The local authority engineer goes out and looks at the cottage but does not decide to do everything that is needed.  In his mind and, possibly in his pocket, he has instructions that he is to do the least amount of repairs which the local authority think the tenant will accept before he or she vests.  As a result, we have those cottages throughout the country being repaired by contractors, by local authority employees or somebody else and when they are finished, the local authority engineer inspects them and says they are all right and fit for habitation and should be vested.  I do not think there is anybody in this House who has ever seen the inside of a labourer's cottage who will not admit that in most cases there are very many things which still need to be done after the local engineer has said the cottage is all right.</P>
    <P>What happens?  Either the tenant digs his heels in the ground and says he will not vest until the repairs are carried out, in which case he gets a letter from the county manager telling him his cottage is in good repair and unless he vests, the local authority will have no option but to raise his rent.  He is then between the devil and the deep sea.  He must vest or pay extra rent and, in nine out of ten cases, he will vest the house.  When he gets the vesting instrument he will receive with it a registered packet telling him that he has 30 days in which <Col N="838" /> to appeal to the Minister against the condition of the house.  In almost every case, he does so.  When the appeal goes to the Department, the Department, having a list of the repairs which the tenant considers should be carried out, will send that list to the local authority and ask them if they are prepared to carry out those repairs.  The local authority, having originally decided that the house is in good repair, will almost certainly say they are not prepared to do so.</P>
    <P>Then an inspector goes down from the Department and examines the house and usually decides that certain repairs should be done and in very few cases do these include all the repairs listed by the tenant.  Then, the same routine is gone through again.  A contractor comes in and proceeds with the repairs and when these are finished, who do you think inspects the work?  The engineer who originally said the cottage did not need any repairs.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is democracy and that the local authority will take responsibility for their appointed employees and will say: &ldquo;That is all right.&rdquo;  But the unfortunate tenant who has vested his house and gone through the full rigour of the law to see that the house is put in proper repair now finds that he can get no further repairs carried out, that the house is still in many cases a veritable hovel.  He must then start racking his brains to find alternative accommodation or carry out the repairs himself.  That is where this Bill comes in because in most cases&mdash;I might say in almost every case&mdash;where there is a question of several hundred pounds being required to carry our repairs to any house no matter what grant is given by the Department or local authority the tenant will be unable to find the one-third which he must find in order to put the house in good repair.</P>
    <P>Recently, the Department began to do something they did not do over the years.  They became very strict.  They may be right or they may be wrong. Up to very recently, if one of those houses needed an extra room&mdash;and it is a quite common thing for a worker <Col N="839" /> in the country with perhaps a very big family and very little accommodation to be anxious to build an extra room, which could be done under this Bill&mdash; when the inspector came to see whether or not the room could be added he was told exactly what the tenant wanted and he then decided that in addition to the room there were many things which the house required to put it into good repair before the grant could be given even though his colleague had quite recently stated he thought the house was in excellent repair.</P>
    <P>The argument in favour of the Bill is so strong that I am surprised that there are not very many more Deputies anxious to take part in this debate, because this Bill proposes to do something which is in the nature of a follow-up of the Act which this House passed giving authority to tenants of local authority houses to purchase or vest. Because there will not be any extra cost either on the Department or on the local rates, there is absolutely no answer to the proposals in the Bill.  If it could be argued that the cost would be too great, that the rates would have to go up, that the money could not be recovered, then there might be a case against the Bill.  If we sought, as I think we might rightly seek, a substantial increase in the grants to have repairs carried out, there could be an argument against it but when we suggest a loan which ultimately will be paid back in full, there is absolutely no reason why the Bill should be opposed.</P>
    <P>Before the Bill was introduced the matter was taken up directly with the Minister's Department and the Minister was asked was there any hope of having the matter dealt with in any other way than the way in which it is being dealt with here.  His reply was that the local authority, before making an advance under the section, should be satisfied that the repayment to the local authority was secured by an instrument vesting the ownership, including any interest already held by the purchaser, in the local authority, subject to the right of redemption by the applicant, but that such instrument <Col N="840" /> should not contain anything inconsistent with the provisions of the Act. The Act referred to was of the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, 1899, Section 2.  That was the information with which the Minister supplied us and we are grateful to him for making the matter very clear but it did not solve our problem.  Because there was no other solution to it, we decided to bring in this Bill.  Incidentally, the tail-piece to the letter is that Section 21 subsection (1) of the Labourers Act, 1936, provides that &ldquo;a cottage purchased under this Act shall not during the payment period in relation to such cottage be mortgaged or charged.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the matter and that is why we are asking the Dáil to support this Bill.  I am quite sure most Deputies present are aware of the situation.  I am equally sure that since the debate began they have heard something they had not known. For that reason, I would ask that it be given the most careful consideration. I would ask also any Deputy&mdash; particularly a member of a local authority&mdash;who was here when the Bill was being discussed and who believes that his own local authority is the shining star and the exception to the rule, having done everything that needed to be done to put the cottages into repair &ldquo;for ever and ever, amen&rdquo; to have another look at some of the cottages in his own area.  When he has done so, he will be perfectly satisfied that this Bill, as introduced by the Labour Party, should be passed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept entirely that the Labour Party were sincere in their efforts in drafting this Bill which enshrines some principles which most of us in this House would not oppose. However, I am afraid the Bill is, shall I say, rather woolly.  I shall explain very briefly my reason for that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the Bill does not deal effectively with many of the problems of the city.  I have studied the debate that took place here last week and I note that it dealt almost entirely with the question of vested cottages.  Under the 1936 Act, those eligible to become <Col N="841" /> a vested tenant are an agricultural labourer, a person who was an agricultural labourer at the time he got the tenancy, or a widow or relative of a deceased tenant who was an agricultural labourer at the time the tenancy was created.</P>
    <P>This Bill, apparently, does away with that definition in the 1936 Act and substitutes for it that the purchaser should be an approved person. It is not clear, to me at any rate, who will decide who is an approved person.  I take it it is the intention that this decision would be made by the local authority.  This is an enabling Bill, to enable the local authority to carry out certain functions.  It might lead to a situation in which the purpose of the 1936 Act would be defeated, which would be rather regrettable. Furthermore, it does not include any provision which would eliminate the abuses that have been referred to in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>My interest, naturally, is in the tenants of local authority houses in the Dublin Corporation area.  The Bill refers to people living in local authority houses.  I know that Councillors and others interested in the Dublin problem have made representations and suggestions regarding the possible purchase of houses in Dublin by existing tenants.  There is the question of subsidies, among other things.  All these representations have been received with interest and are being considered.  I understand that at the moment the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation are considering the entire position with a view, perhaps, to making further representations to the Minister before he makes the final draft of the Bill which is due from his Department this year.</P>
    <P>The problem has also arisen in Dublin Corporation that unless the entire block of tenants agree to purchase their houses no noticeable saving will be made on maintenance.  The question of maintenance of local authority houses is of extreme importance in Dublin.  It represents a tremendous impact on the rates of Dublin city.  When one considers that there are well over 40,000 houses in the Dublin Corporation Estates one can imagine the cost of repainting <Col N="842" /> these houses at least once every seven years, when the product of the rate in the £ is in the region of only £11,000 or £12,000.</P>
    <P>The problems of Dublin have not, to my mind, been effectively dealt with by any speaker to this Bill.  The Bill is drafted to deal mainly with the question of the vested cottage and the agricultural labourer and for that reason it is a shot-in-the-dark Bill dealing with problems which have been under discussion.  That is a popular move.  The Labour Party have, to a certain extent, framed this Bill with a view to gaining rural popularity rather than going a little further.  In fact, if I may say so, the Labour Party would have been far wiser to put down a motion for discussion here which would enable the House to expand the debate beyond the immediate scope of this Bill.  There are many things I should like to say which are very closely related to the Bill, but which I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would rule out of order.</P>

      <P>As I say, the idea behind the Bill seems to be a good one, but I think it just selects one subject and does not deal adequately with the rest of the problems.  There is no provision that would prevent abuses.  Believe it or not, in Dublin we now have vested cottages.  I came across one in the constituency I represented before the last revision of constituencies.</P>

      <P>No; Dublin city boundary has been extended.  The widow of an agricultural worker was anxious to sell, and the sale was not <Col N="843" /> approved.  We found out subsequently that the intended purchasers were a very large petrol company which, so far as I know, would have paid a very large sum for the cottage.  The application was made out by an individual who might have been found to be a suitable person and, while he would have paid the prescribed amount, the petrol company would have come along with the intention of building a petrol station, I gather, and when it eventually changed hands it would have run into at least £1,000.</P>
      <P>From that point of view this Bill, if passed, would, to a large extent, tie the Minister's hands in framing the new legislation.  He should be very careful in considering the sections of this Bill because to tie his hands at this stage would be a retrograde step. I am nervous about the Bill because, when one reads it first and hears the excellent speech made by the proposer, one would be inclined to say: &ldquo;Yes, that is all right; I go for that,&rdquo; but on deeper consideration one sees the weaknesses in it.</P>
      <P>I should like to make one comment on Deputy Desmond's opening speech, in which he referred to the valuation for extensions and improvements being made by the officials of the Department of Local Government.  I take it that his intention was to show that the officials of the Department so cut down on the cost of these repairs, or extensions or improvements, that it meant that in fact the applicant did not get his full one-third from the Department and his full one-third from the local authority and as a result, had to pay a larger cash amount himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept this, from my experience in Dublin city.  I do not know how they do it in Cork, but Deputy Collins explained how it was done in Limerick, and he agrees with me that if they vest houses in Cork that are not in a proper state of repair, then the Cork local authority should be held to blame for that.  In Dublin also, it does not apply to local authority houses, but in the ordinary repair and improvement of private dwellings <Col N="844" /> which are handled by the Department of Local Government, I have received no complaint regarding the cutting down of the estimates made by the contractors doing these extensions or improvements, so that I should like to refute that suggestion by Deputy Desmond.  As far as Dublin is concerned, the officials of the Department of Local Government are entirely equitable and just in that type of matter.</P>

      <P>At all events, there are several matters to be considered so far as abuses are concerned, which I think are the main thing.  There is the definition of a suitable person, the situation that exists in Dublin, and other matters, which I think are not adequately dealt with in this Bill and I would ask the Minister to be very careful about accepting this as a piece-meal, small part of legislation before he has the opportunity of introducing his own Bill later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is before us because of certain difficulties which have arisen in connection with vested cottages, difficulties and problems both for the vested occupier and for the local authorities.  It is quite natural that these difficulties should have arisen and it is also very proper that we should have this opportunity of discussing these difficulties and considering what solutions can be found for them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the first part of the proposition, that loans should be provided for repairs, I want to say that I am in complete agreement that in the case of extensive repairs, reconstruction or extensions, it is absolutely necessary and desirable that money should be provided to enable people to have this work carried out.  These are loans to bridge the gap between the available grants and the actual cost of the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we come to the second part of the proposition, I am not so sure that what is proposed is the best solution. There is a problem there and a problem about which we should be trying to do something.  I see the position arising in which, if we should say loans should be provided for people to purchase these vested cottages, if <Col N="846" /> they come on the market, a difficulty arises for the local authority in deciding which of perhaps five or six applicants for a loan should get that loan to enable him to buy a particular cottage which comes on the market.  I feel, as well, that even in that case, the wrong person could get the cottage and in spite of those loans, some outsider could come in who would not require a loan and get the cottage. The solution lies more along the lines of inducing local authorities to exercise the power they seem to have of purchasing back these cottages and then giving the cottage to the person in most urgent need of housing.  I see certain difficulties arising in that case, too, and certain safeguards would have to be taken.  I can see that it might have the effect of increasing the purchase price of the house.  If it became known that the local authority were interested in a house, goodness knows at what price the house might finish.</P>
    <P>It would also be necessary to give the local authority priority in the purchase of these vested houses.  At the same time, I would not like to curtail in any way the ownership that has been conferred on the tenant who has vested the house.  In that way, we should insist that while the local authority have priority in purchasing these houses, the house should be purchased at its market value, that is, the market value put on it by the local authority valuer.  Some steps must be taken with regard to vested cottages.  In County Dublin, we have offered many inducements to people to vest their cottages.  In fact, it might be said that we have exerted a certain amount of pressure.  I am all in favour of vesting cottages.  I believe in the good effects of ownership and the respect it begets for property that has been built with public money, but I am afraid that the time has arrived when something might go wrong in the sale of these houses and if they are built with public money, I think we should ensure that these houses will continue to pass on to the most deserving people, the people most in need of houses.  If we can do that without limiting the ownership people have been given as a result of vesting, we should proceed along those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind the Bill is good because anything designed to advance housing is for the good of the country.  When canvassing around the country before the election, I was struck by the fact that it was the people with the good houses who kept them well, looked after the gardens and improved the fronts.  Generally, they were more tidy.  We have seen the same thing in Dublin where the people went from the slums to the built-up areas on the edge of the city such as Crumlin.  The improvement has taken some time to show itself, but when the children of those people eventually moved into homes of their own, they began to improve their houses.  A big percentage of the generation that has come up now are in the professional classes, while their parents before them were in the working classes.  I believe that is due to good housing.  In some way, good housing encourages a feeling of pride and gives an uplift.  Therefore, I think the idea behind this Bill&mdash; to help people in their housing&mdash;is a good one.</P>
      <P>Looking at the Bill, however, I am rather surprised that it does not cover water and sewerage.  These are fundamental in the matter of housing and I feel there will be a call for them.  For some time in County Kildare, we do not build new houses or cottages, unless we can provide them with water and sewerage.  You can imagine people in a vested cottage who are thinking of making improvements. When they see that the new house down the road has water and sewerage, naturally they will look for that amenity.  It would not be right to pass this Bill unless it provides that those who need water and sewerage can have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill says that the administration shall be paid out of money provided by the local rates. The present is not an opportune time to be talking of increasing the rates. Even Deputy Desmond, when introducing the Bill, was not quite sure that it would not increase the rates. He said he felt it was &ldquo;a good bet&rdquo; that it would not increase the rates. Dealing with anything on a national basis, you cannot talk of betting. <Col N="848" /> Bookmakers rarely die poor, so we should not be inclined to bet on anything connected with housing.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill says the Act may be adopted &ldquo;by resolution&rdquo; but further down in the same section, we find &ldquo;shall be a reserved function&rdquo;. I always felt that a resolution was a reserved function.  It seems to me that the Bill is a hurried Bill, a Bill which has not received a great deal of thought.  Apparently, its proposers felt it would not be approved but that it would be a good idea to spend a little time debating it.</P>
    <P>I agree that it would be a good idea to provide loans for vested cottages, but I think that idea is a bit premature. I should like to quote the reply of the Minister for Local Government to a question on loans for vested cottiers asked by Deputy Corry in November, 1960:</P>
    <P>Mr. Corry asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that vested cottiers who have purchased their cottages are unable to obtain a loan from local authorities or elsewhere for the improvement or reconstruction of their homes because section 21 (1) of the Labourers Acts, 1936, provides that a cottage, during the payment period, shall not be mortgaged or charged and because the Act does not enable a tenant to purchase his cottage by lump sum or to redeem the outstanding value of the annuity; and if he intends to bring in legislation to remedy the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister answered him as follows:</P>
    <P>The position is as stated by the Deputy.  The statutory provisions in question were devised to safeguard the long-term interests of the general body of cottage tenants.  I appreciate that the difficulty mentioned by the Deputy arises in some cases.  I have had this matter under consideration in conjunction with other proposals to amend the Housing Acts and any amendment of the law that may be found necessary or desirable will be embodied in the next amending Bill.</P>

      <P>Volume 185, column 38 of the Dáil Debates.  From that, it will be seen that the Minister has this very proposal in mind.  A Housing Bill comes before this House every few years.  I gather he intends to bring in a Housing Bill this term.  We must remember that the Minister has at his disposal the experts of his Department who have devoted their lives to problems of housing.  With all due respect to the proposer of the Bill, I feel they have not the resources at their command. They have the best intentions in the world, I agree, but when it comes to considering it on a national basis, I feel we must leave it to the Department to provide us with a Bill.  Then we may be able to add our recommendations to it but we would be dealing with a measure which would give us the main ground upon which to work.  For that reason, and taking into consideration the fact that there is a Bill coming up this term, I have no hesitation in saying we should reject this Bill and wait for the Minister to produce his.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the Bill has some merit, but if there are any merits in it, it is in regard to the question of loans being made available to tenant purchasers who wish to carry out reconstruction work.  I certainly would be anxious to see legislation introduced&mdash;I am looking forward to such legislation during the present year &mdash;to enable local authorities to make available to tenants of vested cottages sums of money to help them bridge the gap between the estimated cost of the work and the amount of the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have particular reason to support that aspect of the Bill because, if for no other reason than to ensure that the moneys made available by way of grant will be used to the best possible advantage, loans should be put at the disposal of such tenants.  Unfortunately, over the years, there has been in operation in certain parts of the country a scheme whereby handymen come along and carry out reconstruction work for the grant money. The grant is supposed to cover only two-thirds of the estimated cost of the work and naturally, when the entire job is carried out without addition to <Col N="850" /> the grant money, something must suffer.  It is the workmanship and the work itself that suffer.  If we are prepared to give the maximum grant of £280, we should see to it that the money is spent to the best advantage. The way to ensure that is to get competent tradesmen on the job.</P>
    <P>As I see it, most local authority houses are put into a reasonable state of repair by the local authority before vesting and if there is any question of a grant at all, it is for the purpose of providing additional accommodation.  That can run into a fairly big sum and it is quite possible that the estimated cost would be anything between £300 and £400.  In that case, the tenant must raise £100 and that can be a hardship because it is not easy for a tenant to lay his hands on such a sum to be paid to the contractor.  There should be some way in which a local authority would come to such a tenant's assistance.  I am satisfied from a reply given by the Minister 18 months ago that he will make provision under which local authorities will be able to afford such assistance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of making available sums of money to people who, in the opinion of the local authorities, qualify for the purchase of vested cottages, I do not think anything should be done in this House to encourage people already entitled to council houses to go into debt to buy a house.  In making that case, I think Deputy Desmond pointed out that it was quite possible in a certain area that a man with a young family living in bad housing conditions, even though he qualified under the Housing Acts for a house, should have the opportunity of purchasing a cottage and should get assistance from the local authority to do so.</P>

      <P>A person living with a young family in a bad house is entitled to be rehoused by the local authority.  It would be wrong, therefore, for the House to encourage a man to spend £300 on the purchase of a house, when he should have a house from the local authority for nothing.</P>
      <P>Another aspect of this was referred to by Deputy Clinton: who is to decide between the five or six who will apply for a loan to purchase a vested cottage?  Is the decision to be reached before or after a bargain has been struck with the person selling the house?  As I see it, it would be wrong to encourage the spending of such a sum of money in respect of a person who is entitled to rehousing anyhow.</P>

      <P>We are not trying to discourage people paying too high a price for these cottages.  On one occasion, over £550 was paid for a county council cottage.  Under the Small Dwellings Acts, a loan of up to 80 per cent. is made available.  If the same provision were made to operate for the purpose of purchasing cottages, the gap would be something in the region of £100.  Where will a man with a large family, in poor circumstances, lay his hands on such a sum of money?  I think the Bill is contradictory in this respect and that this House should not do anything to encourage people to involve themselves in debt, particularly, as I have said, when they are qualified for rehousing under the Housing Acts. The local authorities throughout the country are doing everything in their power to achieve that aim.  They are generally anxious to solve that problem and I do not think there is any holdup in the Department.  That has been our experience in Wicklow. The housing problem is near enough to being met. The few outstanding cases are being <Col N="852" /> held up more locally than in the Department of Local Government.  I do not think there is any necessity for this Bill at this stage.  As far as I can see, no case has been made for it, either by the mover or by Deputy Tully this evening.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that the Minister will be introducing his legislation this year.  He indicated to us that he would consider the question of loans for reconstruction. Those Deputies to whom I have referred availed of this opportunity to make political capital in the hope that it would win them support down the country.  I am looking forward to the Minister's legislation this year.  I hope he will give an opportunity to the local authorities to make loans available to cottage tenants who are anxious to provide additional accommodation for their families.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  In view of the undertaking given by the Minister over 12 months ago, there is no immediate need to try to push through a Bill of this nature.  We are all very proud of the fact that the housing situation has changed for the better all over the country and that in every town and village, we have secured adequate housing for our population.  Indeed, many local authorities have come to the end of their programme.  Now they are adding on water, sewerage and other amenities.</P>
      <P>Most county councillors know that quite a large sum of money is spent on the repair of cottages each year.  Naturally, a council is anxious to see that cottages are vested so that they will become the property of the owners.  It is a well known fact that in all areas where people own their own houses, they have a better regard for their property and treat it much better than if it were the property of the local authority. Unfortunately, there have been occasions when county engineers and their repair staffs have been requested to remove a door handle, regardless of what the cost would lead to.  It is a very laudable trend to try to have houses vested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="853" /> I also submit it is very laudable that people should own their own houses. So far as loans for that purpose are concerned, we have the assurance of the Minister given over 12 months ago. He will, I know, if he thinks it wise, include it in the terms of the forthcoming legislation in relation to housing.  I should like to see included in that legislation some plan in respect of design.  Somebody spoke about the uniform type of local authority house being built.  It might be a good thing if the stigma of the cottage were removed by getting rid of the unsightly gates so often placed in front of these houses.  A nice tidy approach should be provided.  The building should be given more of the appearance of a house built by an individual himself so that it will fit into the surrounding district.  If the tenant purchases it, it cannot be pointed to in later years as a house given to him by the local authority, not that there is anything wrong with that but some people might be afraid of the so-called stigma.</P>
    <P>It would be well for the Department to ensure that the county council engineer keeps a very close eye on the building of local authority houses because large sums of money often have to be spent on repairs.  In fairness, the fault does not lie with the tenants because most of them are fairly careful of the property but there are often serious defects in the building material, due to the use of inferior blocks.  That should be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>I have been hesitant to encourage people to avail too freely of loans, irrespective of how well off they may be.  I do not think it desirable to encourage people to get loans and go into the market in competition with somebody else so as to become the owner of a vested cottage.  It is wrong to go into a market such as that with money received as a loan, money which eventually will have to be paid back. It is a wrong approach to saddle one-self with a burden such as this, probably at a time when the family are small and when the money to be paid back might be used to better advantage.</P>
    <P>Might I suggest that, when the Minister is producing his new legislation, he <Col N="854" /> pay particular attention to a request regarding the sanctioning of grants for houses.  It has been brought to my notice&mdash;I do not know how true it is &mdash;that housing engineers are reluctant to pass grants for 4-roomed or 3-romed houses without a corridor.  In other words, a house with only one room on the breadth would cost £100 less to build than a similar one with two rooms on the breadth.  These matters may be irrelevant at the moment but in view of the fact that they are to be examined in relation to the legislation to be introduced, I am putting them forward.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill is ill-timed.  It is submitted only to gain a slight advantage because the sponsors already know that the Minister is considering the situation.  However, anything that will help to give people ownership and pride in a dwelling and tend to encourage them to keep their houses in a neat and tidy condition, with proper gates and flower beds, I welcome.  I welcome any proposals that will add to the beauty of the countryside and give a favourable impression to visitors coming here.</P>
    <P>Good housing at all times tends to improve greatly the health of the nation because people who are well housed are a contented people.  Anything that can be done within our limited resources, both at local authority and Government level, is being done and done very effectively.  We should see that a decent type of house is designed and that adequate facilities are provided so that the people may avail of the opportunities that are there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rather lengthy discussion on the Bill has quite rightly been adverted to and has been somewhat deliberate as far as I am concerned.  I have been anxious to hear the views of the House on the various aspects of housing that were discussed although they were somewhat wider than the terms of the Bill.  In the very near future, this House will be considering a Housing Bill and the matters contained in this private Bill are really more relevant to a Housing Bill.  We hope the Bill will come before the <Col N="855" /> House during the present session and the matters discussed here to-night are certainly of value, especially when we are considering generally the form that the Housing Bill will take.</P>
      <P>So far as the Bill that is before us is concerned I should like to reiterate what has been said by quite a number of speakers here to the effect that the overall general intention of it is not one with which many Members of the House would find fault.  Again talking in general terms, it has also been said here that in November, 1960, in reply to a question by Deputy Corry, I did go as far as it is possible for any Minister to go in reply to a Parliamentary Question and said that the matter raised, which was this one of loans for vested cottiers, was one which I was aware of, was one which we were examining in the Department and one in respect of which we hoped to bring in the appropriate amendments or legislation at the appropriate time.  That appropriate time is coming to hand and that housing legislation will come before the House in the coming months.</P>
      <P>Taking the Bill as we find it at present and looking at it with sympathetic eyes, I should like the Labour Party who sponsored it to know that I regard their intentions as <i>bona fide,</i> to appreciate that my interest is not less than theirs and that what I have to say of the Bill is not casting aspersions on their good intentions.</P>
      <P>We find that there is quite a lot wrong with Section 1 of the Bill in the sense that it says &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in other Acts&rdquo; so and so may be done.  That cannot be taken in the light in which it is intended.  To give effect to the intention of Section 1 would necessitate an amendment of the Labourers Acts. There is no provision for security for loans advanced as one of the terms of the Bill.  That is why it falls across the Labourers Acts to which I have already referred and would bring about the situation that the Labourers Acts would need to be amended under this wording &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in other Acts&rdquo;.  That cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> Coming to Section 2 we find that there are terms used in it such as &ldquo;approved tenant purchasers&rdquo;.  There is no statutory meaning attached to that phraseology.  All of us associated with local authority housing understand what it means but the fact is that there is no statutory meaning for these three words.  In Section 3 we get the words &ldquo;approved applicants&rdquo; and also &ldquo;local authority houses&rdquo;.  The words &ldquo;local authority houses&rdquo; are without any statutory meaning and no definition of this phrase is enshrined in the Bill.  Without a definition, this phrase would not stand in the legal sense.  It would not secure in a legal way what the sponsors of the Bill intend.</P>
    <P>Coming back to Section 2 we find from the reading of it that advances may be made to &ldquo;approved tenant purchasers&rdquo; and in Section 3 we find a clause stating that persons other than approved tenant purchasers may get loans.  There seems to be a certain amount of contradiction in saying in Section 2 that only approved tenant purchasers may get loans and in Section 3 that persons other than approved tenant purchasers may get them.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 3 indicates that no applicant may be approved for a loan who does not qualify for the tenancy of a local authority house.  If we are to read subsection (2) of Section 3 together with Section 2, we find that approved tenant purchasers are ruled out.  They are not eligible for the tenancy of a local authority house as they are already tenant purchasers of local authority houses.  In addition, these two terms are used which are not defined in the Bill and do not carry any statutory meaning and, therefore, would not have any legal standing. There is the further obvious contradiction in that one section advocates a group and a later section seems to exclude the same group.</P>
    <P>There is the provision in Section 4 that the cost of administration will be paid out of moneys provided by the local rate.  It has been said that that is objectionable because, no matter how infinitesimal the cost, it will represent quite an addition to the <Col N="857" /> rates.  There is the question of determining, if we agree to put these costs on the local rates, what the cost will be.  A certain calculation would arise.  I do not think anybody associated with the administration of this section and the making of loans under it would be in a position to make any such calculation.  There is no formula laid down.  It would not be possible to ascertain the actual cost involved in making loans available to local authorities so far as this Bill is concerned. As it stands, the section does not seem to make sense.  If one cannot determine the costs, it will be impossible to ensure that the costs will be paid by anybody.  One would be asking local authorities, perhaps, to pay something incapable of proper definition.</P>
    <P>Probably the section was designed so that the Labour Party could move to have the Bill passed by this House. If there were any costs involved for the Exchequer, the Bill could not be moved.  I believe that is the reason for Section 4 in its present form.  I do not think the intention was that it should have the application it would have, were we to accept the measure. I believe it was put there so that the sponsors of the Bill could put the motion to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion dealt with Section 5 and the question of the reserved function.  Section 5 says that the Act may, by resolution, be adopted by any housing authority and the passing of any resolution under Section 1 or Section 2 shall be a reserved function for the purpose of the City and County Management Acts, 1940 to 1955.  In actual fact, the passing of a resolution cannot be defined as a reserved function and the terms of the section would not give to the council what is intended by the sponsors, namely, the adoption of a scheme under the Bill as a reserved function in the sense that it would be done by the elected body rather than by the county manager.  Clearly, that <Col N="858" /> is not what is in the section.  In fact, the section does not appear to convey any semblance of sense whatever.  I understand what was intended, but the intention does not take away from the fact that the section is faulty and could not serve the purpose intended by its sponsors.</P>
    <P>The question of housing, the repair and improvement of houses, and the provision of amenities was discussed in detail by various speakers.  Unwittingly, this Bill has left out very important services.  There is no specific provision for water and sewerage.  It might be argued that the provision of such amenities would be included in the reconstruction or improvement of a house, but, if that were challenged, it is possible that, under the terms of the Bill as it stands, these services would be excluded.  In the future, it is more than likely that these will be essential services in every instance in which loans are sought.  No matter how well intentioned this Bill is, it will not secure the ends for which it is designed.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of argument about local authorities advancing money to prospective purchasers of the interest in a council house.  It was said that the ordinary labourer could not compete with the big farmer, if the big farmer wished to purchase the interest in a cottage.  I do not agree with the implication that big farmers want to get rid of cottiers and cottages on their lands.  Let us look at the suggestion of unfair competition If the big farmer wants the cottage, no matter what loan is given, the big farmer will still be in a position to purchase the cottage, if he wants it badly enough, he will simply outbid the other prospective purchaser.  Indeed, any such provision might have the effect of inflating the purchase price.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 1st March, 1962.</P>

      <P>(a) Information as to the earnings of workers in transportable goods industries for the fourth quarter of 1961 is not yet available. However, it is possible to state that between the March quarter of 1960 and the September quarter of 1961 the index of average weekly earnings of industrial workers employed in transportable goods industries rose by 9.3 per cent.</P>
      <P>(b) The minimum rates at present payable to agricultural workers are those prescribed under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum Rates) Order, 1961, which came into operation on 30th October 1961.  The minimum weekly rates prescribed under this Order for males aged 20 years and over represent an average increase of 8.4 per cent on the corresponding weekly rates prescribed in the Order which came into operation on 28th March 1960.</P>
      <P>(c) The index of hourly rates of wages of workers in Transport in the Dublin District is provisionally estimated to have risen by 10.4 per cent between the beginning of 1960 and the beginning of 1962.</P>
