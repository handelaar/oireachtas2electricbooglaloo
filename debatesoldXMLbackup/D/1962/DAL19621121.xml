    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Committee of the European Economic Community, formerly known as the Fouchet Committee, has met recently and considered the political implications of the European Economic Community; if any similar Committee has considered this matter; if there is any further information available on the possible political implications of membership; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to a change of Chairman, the Fouchet Committee became known as the Cattani Committee. As far as I am aware, neither the Cattani Committee nor any similar Committee has met since the 17th April last when the Foreign Ministers of the member States of the European Economic Community failed to reach agreement on a draft treaty to implement the Bonn Declaration.</P>
      <P>The present position appears to be that the member States are giving priority to the negotiations on Britain's application for membership of the Community.  It is thus not possible at this stage to give any further information as to how the Bonn Declaration will be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach if it is a fact that, in regard to associate membership, <Col N="1436" /> facilities designated in the Rome Treaty as not being available to an associate member have in fact been granted to Greece under her recently negotiated associate membership agreement; and, if so, what are the facilities so made available</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach what are the safeguarding measures permissible under Article 226 of the EEC Treaty under which an associate member is regarded as a full member for the resolution of serious difficulties which might arise in the transitional period of a member state granted associate membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>In the first place I should point out that it is not correct to speak of &ldquo;facilities designated in the Rome Treaty as not being available to an associate member&rdquo;.  The only article of the Rome Treaty which refers to association with the Community is Article 238 which is in general terms. As Greece is the only country with which the European Economic Community has so far concluded an agreement of association, it is not possible to generalise on conditions of association.</P>
      <P>As indicated in paragraph II of Appendix IV to the White Paper of 30th June, 1961, on the European Economic Community, the agreement for the association of Greece with the Community provides that Greece will be regarded as a full member for purposes of the application of Article 226 of the Rome Treaty.  This article envisages that member States may in certain circumstances derogate temporarily from the provisions of the Treaty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach, because of the uncertainty of the terms of the association which can be negotiated, whether it is conceivable or possible that one could have access to the European Social Fund, should one want access to it for the purposes of meeting redundancy problems during the transition period as an associate member?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he would refer to paragraph 101 of the first White Paper issued by the Government in which it is stated that the extent to which this Fund can be used in respect of associate membership cannot yet be predicted?  There is no finality, I presume, as to whether or not this Fund can be used by associate members?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach why, in connection with his statement of 15th November, he considers that recent developments within the EEC made it reasonably certain that both Britain and Ireland would be admitted to membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the decision of the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community to enter into negotiations on our application for membership, the goodwill for the application which was shown on all sides during my recent visits to the Continent indicates a favourable outcome.  As regards Britain, the progress in the negotiations, to which member States are now devoting an increasing amount of time, suggests that agreement will be concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach seriously suggest, without any information apparently available to him, that he expects, without Ireland's case either being discussed or active negotiations taking place in regard to it, he has some inside information that our application, and indeed Britain's, will be accepted by the 1st January, 1964?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put it this way?  Apart from the fact that the Taoiseach has taken all responsibilities with regard to prediction on the British application, may we take it that the position at the moment is that this state of things is a supposition or, shall we say, taking a gamble that it is suggested in this House will come off&mdash;or has the Taoiseach made any promise to those people whom he visited in Europe with regard to defence commitments or political commitments?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if he would take the House into his confidence and say that the <Col N="1439" /> Irish case is being run on this basis: that, because of the inter-dependence of the two countries in trade and in economic matters generally, the aim is to process both applications simultaneously so that if we get into the Common Market we go in at approximately the same time as the British, because that is calculated to cause the least amount of dislocation in our trade <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain?</P>

This information shows that substantial economic progress continues to be made this year, with industrial output and real national income increasing and does not support the Deputies' implication that Ireland is unfit for membership of the European Economic Community.</P>

      <P>I have seen a recent press report to the effect that the Irish Medical Association are anxious to see an Institute of Biological Assay set up here for the purpose of testing drugs.  It was also reported that a spokesman of the Association pointed out that there was no independent authority here to test drugs, and that clinical trials were left to the individual doctor, a respect in which, I may say, we are not unique.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Biological assay&rdquo; means the determination of the potency of a substance by biological methods instead of by physical means; the word &ldquo;biological&rdquo; implies the use of living organisms, such as animals or bacteria, as test subjects.  I take it that the Association, if correctly reported, has it in mind that all imported drugs of which the safety has not been established should be tested in this manner here.</P>
      <P>The establishment of an Institute of Biological Assay would require resources such as are at the disposal of highly developed industrial countries with large populations and considerable wealth but are not available to us.  Further, biological assay would not necessarily give a complete assurance of safety as untoward complications or side-effects might not manifest themselves until a drug had been in use for a considerable period.</P>
      <P>The problem is of such complexity and requires such resources that the 15th World Health Assembly last May felt that it could be most effectively dealt with by international co-operation. The Assembly, by resolution, decided to arrange for the study of the scientific aspects of the clinical and pharmacological evaluation of pharmaceutical preparations, and also the study of the feasibility or otherwise on the part of the World Health Organisation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  of establishing minimum basic requirements and recommending standard methods for the clinical and pharmacological evaluation of pharmaceutical preparations;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> (b)  of securing regular exchanges of information on the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical preparations; and in particular,</P>
    <P>(c)  of securing prompt transmission to national health authorities on new information on serious side-effects of pharmaceutical preparations.</P>
    <P>Any general policy evolved by the World Health Organisation in the matter will, of course, receive my careful consideration.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, as a result of the thalidomide tragedy, legislation was enacted in the United States of America which will give the Food and Drug Administration new powers of factory inspection and quality control; in particular, detailed records, which will be available to the Administration, must be kept of clinical trials, and these trials may not be carried out except in accordance with prescribed conditions.</P>
    <P>Early this month, a committee set up in Great Britain under the chairmanship of Lord Cohen of Birkenhead to consider the matter advised that experimental laboratory testing of new drugs before they are used in clinical trials should continue to be the responsibility of the individual pharmaceutical manufacturer and they rejected, as being neither desirable nor practicable, the idea that the responsibility for testing new drugs should be transferred to a central authority.  In a further recommendation, the committee stated that they believed that one of the many safeguards which may be needed is that there should be an expert body to review the evidence and offer advice on the toxicity of new drugs, whether made in Great Britain or abroad, before they are used in clinical trials.  This is a matter on which the committee will report further when they have formulated detailed advice on the terms of reference and composition of this expert body.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that the legislation in the USA and the recommendations so far in Great Britain make no mention of Institutions of Biological Assay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> The bulk of the drugs used here are imported and it may be that in our circumstances and with our limited resources we must depend to a great extent on the controls exercised in the countries of origin.  As I have stated in reply to previous questions, however, I shall continue to keep this matter under constant review and I shall take all reasonable steps which are open to me at all time to safeguard the public interest.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the Minister's reference to the World Health Organisation and, indeed, his reference to the Irish Medical Association, does he not appreciate that this step was also advocated by representatives of the Irish Drug Association and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, and would he not be disposed to taking advice from such bodies in so far as Ireland is concerned without waiting for world-wide decisions?</P>

      <P>The special relief from tax on profits from new or increased exports of manufactured goods was introduced primarily to encourage the expansion of Irish manufacturing industry by inducing manufacturers to seek outlets for their products in the export market.  The measure was at the outset confined in its application to profits derived by companies from the sale abroad of goods manufactured within the State and, while there have been exceptions, it is in the main still confined to exports of manufactured goods.  It must be remembered that this temporary exemption from a general tax was brought in for a particular defined purpose; and it is clear that it must be contained within the compass originally visualised unless it is to be allowed to extend on a virtually unlimited scale.</P>

In view of this and of the importance which the EEC attaches to the question of harmonising the taxation systems of the Member States, all of which have general sales taxes or turn-over taxes of one sort or another, the Revenue Commissioners are, at my request, examining the technical questions which would be involved in the adoption of various forms of broadly based taxes on expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent cut in industrial protective tariffs was described in the official announcement as an initial move in the dismantling of protection. It may, therefore, be expected to be followed at appropriate intervals by further reductions.  No decision in detail has been taken about this as a further cut would not be appropriate before 1st January, 1964, and it is possible that by that date Ireland will be a member of the European Economic Community and be obliged to apply a particular rhythm of tariff reduction.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to somewhat similar questions from the Deputies on 12th April, 1961, I explained our attitude in regard to clauses in apartheid resolutions calling for the breaking off of diplomatic relations with South Africa and the imposition of trade sanctions.  I pointed out then that we supported resolutions and clauses of resolutions condemning apartheid but that in our belief resolutions calling for sanctions would hinder rather than help the ending of apartheid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1464" /> At the present session of the General Assembly the Irish delegation voted against the Afro-Asian resolution on apartheid on the grounds that it contained sanction clauses and called on the Security Council, if necessary, to consider the expulsion of South Africa from the organisation.  We had supported a motion calling for a separate vote on the contentious clauses. As these objectionable clauses were retained in the resolution, we were obliged to vote against it.  Had the motion been carried we would have, as in previous years, voted for the clauses condemning apartheid and calling for its abolition and voted against the clauses calling for the imposition of sanctions and the expulsion of South Africa from the United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and second parts of the Deputy's <Col N="1465" /> question is in the affirmative and to the last part in the negative.</P>
      <P>I may add that I satisfied myself last year during my visit to the town and refugee camp of Elizabethville that a situation existed there on the 13th September which would have necessitated vigorous action by United Nations forces if the Katangese authorities did not cease their attacks on the UN officials and troops and on the Balubas.</P>
      <P>Action, however, should not have been begun without the authority of the late Secretary General&mdash;then en route to the Congo and due to arrive within a matter of hours&mdash;and above all the action taken on the 13th September should not have been alleged to be an operation undertaken by the United Nations for the purpose of ending the secession of Katanga by force.</P>
      <P>Much as everyone connected with the United Nations fervently desired to see the Congo reunified, no one, not even the Secretary General, had the right to authorise the use of force to achieve that desirable goal without the specific authority of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the action taken in Elizabethville on the 13th September, 1961, was begun without the late Secretary General's knowledge.  I am satisfied also that he did not regard the existing UN resolutions as empowering him to authorise any attempt to end the secession of Katanga by force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A preliminary inquiry under Section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, was held into the loss of this vessel.  At the time of sailing the vessel was a well-found ship in seaworthy condition, properly loaded and furnished with life-saving appliances as required by law.  The inquiry showed that there was no evidence of neglect or incompetence on the part of any person or any departure from the practice of good seamanship in the operation of the vessel. The Inspector advised that the casualty was caused by the extreme weather conditions.  In the circumstances, I did not consider that a formal investigation under Section 466 of the Act was called for.  A formal investigation under this section is held only if there is reason to believe that the casualty was preventable.</P>

The total number employed in the Limerick locomotive works on 5th January, 1958, was 305; the total number at present employed in the works is 243. The Board expects that there will be a further reduction of about ten employees at the end of the present year and employment in the works will then probably stabilise.</P>

      <P>No.  It is proposed to finish the Estimates on the Order Paper and there will be a couple of Supplementary Estimates.  There is the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill which is down for Report Stage to-day.  The Minister for Local Government will make his opening statement to-morrow on the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1962.  There is also the Exchange Control (Continuance) Bill and four small Bills dealing with military service pensions which will be introduced and circulated shortly; there will be two Industrial Grants Bills, a Bill to provide for the nitrogenous fertiliser project and a Bill dealing with Irish Steel. Possibly in this session there will be a Bill arising from certain proposals from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges involving Amendment of the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act.  In addition, there will be a short Bill dealing with the National Gallery, the Trade Marks Bill and the Copyright Bill.  There will be a motion dealing with the agreement in relation to double taxation with the Federal Republic of Germany and three motions dealing with Defence Forces (Amendment) Schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the number of unfinished estates in the county and city of Dublin.  The developers in certain cases have failed to carry out their responsibilities. There are certain estates the developers of which have either died or gone into liquidation.  There is one estate in County Dublin&mdash;St. Mary's estate&mdash; where the people are paying their rates, though they have no services and the roads are not equipped.  I was hoping that in cases where we cannot place the responsibility on the developer, the Minister might be able in future legislation to deal with matters of that kind.  My own cure for that would simply be to collect the ground rents and let the local authorities develop the estates.  It is not fair to the people who have to pay high rates; neither is it fair to the local authority.  It is too bad to let those people get away with it.  That is a headache which we have had in County Dublin for quite a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to reconstruction grants, I should like to see greater co-ordination between the inspectors of the local authority and the Department. One inspection should suffice in <Col N="1487" /> respect of the payment of the grant. When the Department of Local Government send their inspector there and when the matter is approved by their inspector, the local authority should automatically pay their supplementary grants.  We have found in the city and county of Dublin that where the Department have paid their part of the grant, the local authority will again delay and send out their inspectors.  They will always pick holes in something&mdash;there is always something wrong.  For instance, they may find that everything is not in accordance with some town planning specification. There should be co-ordination between the local authority inspectors and the Department's inspectors.  This would eliminate the delay.</P>
    <P>A number of my friends in County Dublin have had some difficulty in getting contractors to do their business because of delay in the payment of grants.  They have found that that is due to the divergence of opinion as between the local authority inspectors and those of the Department.  I should be grateful if the Minister would look into this matter to see if one inspector would suffice and ensure that as soon as the Minister for Local Government pays the grant, the local authority would also pay their agreed portion for reconstruction.</P>
    <P>We are also concerned about the local authority's power to acquire or allocate sites for factories.  The difficulty arises sometimes when people want to establish industries in Dublin, that directly they start negotiations, the price goes sky-high because people know the site is required for a factory. I suppose everybody wants the best possible price and I do not want to interfere with that but it is nevertheless retarding progress to a great extent.  There is great difficulty in getting sites passed and getting into an area properly serviced.</P>
    <P>If a zoning arrangement were adopted by the Corporation, it would at least assure industrialists they would not have to encounter delay in acquiring a site and further delay in getting plans passed.  We have the position now in south County Dublin, from Robinhood to Clondalkin district, that <Col N="1488" /> the drainage scheme there is unable to cater for the number of factories we could have in that area.  I understand Dublin Corporation plan to have a proper drainage scheme for the area. This will give the local authority a chance of letting sites in the district.</P>
    <P>At present Dublin Corporation have no authority to develop any seaside resorts outside the city boundary but they are faced with the problem that Portmarnock is in County Dublin and is specifically used by Dublin citizens. The Corporation are anxious to develop Portmarnock because thousands of people from the city go there in all weathers as it is so near and has one of the finest strands along our coast.  Would the Minister consider amending legislation to give the Corporation authority to develop Portmarnock for the benefit of Dublin citizens?  As a member of Dublin Corporation, I can say that the members are most anxious to see this development take place but they are prohibited from taking action in that respect because the Corporation's legal adviser states we have no authority to spend money on the development of Portmarnock.</P>

      <P>There is something in the Planning Bill that might be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe there is. We have another problem in the city and county of Dublin at present.  Due to the industrial activity of Fianna Fáil and the number of factories established in several areas, there is a great need for more and more houses.  While both local authorities are doing their best, I feel that to get over the transition period and expedite building of houses a co-ordinating committee should be established by both local authorities and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also have the problem of sub-tenants, even where there are 13 in family and two families in the house. It arises when the mother or father allow in a married son or daughter, or perhaps a nephew.  The problem has become serious because of the industries established in these areas.  I am dealing now with County Dublin where the council is forbidden to give them the house as they will qualify for only <Col N="1489" /> one-third of the grant, being sub-tenants. If they were transferred from a condemned house, the local authority would get a two-thirds grant from the Department.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this burning question with the Minister on other occasions and he promised that as soon as he got a housing survey made by all the local authorities, he would have another look at it.  The matter is urgent; it arises almost daily.  We have a housing meeting of the county council next Friday and these burning questions are coming before us. Naturally, the local authority want to avail of the two-thirds grant, but if they give the houses to people who do not qualify, they will get only one-third, notwithstanding the fact that there may be seven, eight or ten people living in one small house.</P>
    <P>I know there was just cause when action was taken originally in regard to subtenants because families were just going into cottages when they knew houses were to be allocated or were being built in the area but now, due to industrial development, the overcrowding is unavoidable and I should like the Minister to look into the matter and see what can be done to improve the position.  Even if he were not prepared to go as far as paying the whole two-third grant but would clear the arrears existing at present, that would be very much appreciated in County Dublin.  I was at a house allocation meeting recently and we had to turn down people who should have got priority on the list because they were subtenants.  The county manager advised us what we thought should be done could not be done because we would not get the two-third grant.</P>
    <P>While the Minister, on numerous occasions, has advocated the establishment of swimming pools&mdash;and I thank him for the generous grants he has given towards such amenities&mdash;I feel that we as members of local authorities have given him very little help in these matters but we should like these swimming pools to be heated as they are in England and elsewhere and not just pools that can be used only in good weather.  We have over <Col N="1490" /> 700,000 people in Dublin and we have only one properly heated public bathing place provided by the authority. Of course, we have the Iveagh Baths. On the other hand, there are large, populated areas on the outskirts of the city with no such facilities.</P>
    <P>I suppose Ballyfermot is as big as Limerick city.  There are no proper swimming pools for our children and for people who want to avail of them in these large areas of population.  I know the Minister has been in touch with the local authorities on the matter.  I urge him to avoid the holein-the-ground type of swimming pool which cannot be properly heated and which people cannot avail of every day in the year.  Unless the water can be heated they are of no use to us.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned a few days ago the subsidisation of public lighting is very much appreciated in the city and county of Dublin.  There have been a number of fatal accidents due to bad lighting in the smaller towns and on the main roads into and out of the city.  I am delighted the Minister has agreed to subsidise lighting by 50 per cent. in such areas and in built-up estates which require it.  If we can eliminate or reduce the loss of life on our roads, we shall achieve something. A properly lighted road is a safe road; a badly lighted road is a dangerous road.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing a jolly good job.  In County Dublin, the piped water schemes have enabled a number of my friends there to obtain piped water, thus eliminating the necessity to use wells.  That scheme is very much appreciated by the people whom I have the honour to represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. T. O'Donnell Mr. T. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to avail myself of the opportunity provided by this debate to spotlight some local government problems in my constituency.  In the city of Limerick, which forms the major portion of the constituency, the most serious problem is the housing shortage.  The housing situation in Limerick is now so bad that nothing short of emergency measures can solve it.  It is estimated that there are close on 2,000 families in Limerick city in need of housing.  The <Col N="1491" /> plight of some of these families is so bad that, on a number of occasions recently, people looking for houses had to be forcibly ejected from the Town Hall in Limerick.  In the past fortnight, the Garda and the fire brigade had to be called to remove some of these house-hunters.</P>
      <P>There are families in Limerick city living in conditions almost too dreadful to contemplate.  I have personally inspected the housing conditions of several of these families.  I have been shocked and horrified at the appalling overcrowded and unhealthy conditions in which so many people are compelled to live.  I do not want to dwell at too great length on it.  The housing situation in Limerick city is a social scandal in 1962, and reflects no credit on the housing policy of the Government.</P>
      <P>The housing crisis in Limerick did not come about overnight.  It has gradually been developing over the past five or six years.  The present situation is due entirely to the slowing-down of house building, particularly since 1957.  Let us look for a moment at the figures for house-building.  In a reply to a question which I tabled on 9th May last, the Minister for Local Government gave figures for houses built by the Limerick Corporation, which show that in the financial year 1956-57, 200 houses were built; in 1957-58, 159; in 1958-59, none; in 1959-60, 175; in 1960-61, 108; and, in the financial year 1961-62, none.</P>
      <P>As a matter of comparison, I have here the figures for 1954 to 1957. During that three-year period, a total of 360 houses was built, an average of 120 houses per annum.  In the five-year period from 1957 to 1962, a total of 442 houses was built, an average of 88 houses per annum over the past five years, which is a reduction of about 30 per cent. in the annual output of houses.  This is the situation existing today in the City of Limerick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody in Limerick needs statistics to prove that there is an acute housing shortage there.  Strangely enough, there is quite a lot of controversy raging in Limerick at the moment.  It was put in motion, mainly, by the Minister who, prior to his departure to the United <Col N="1492" /> States in August, caused a veritable furore in Limerick when he said that we in Limerick have the distinction of having the worst slums in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Personally, I was not surprised at the Minister's statement but I was very surprised at the reaction it provoked in the city and particularly at the self-righteous indignation expressed by certain people there.  The general feeling seemed to be that if the situation were as bad as the Minister said, then he himself was the person mainly responsible for it.  However, there is another side to the story.</P>
    <P>On last Saturday, in a week-end edition of the <i>Limerick Leader,</i> a long letter appeared from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Malley, in which he dealt with the housing situation. He said:</P>
    <P>My Department is responsible for the administration of the Local Loans Fund.  We have ample funds available and there is no hold up whatsoever in providing the necessary finances.  The Corporation can rest assured the Government will provide all the necessary finances for its housing programme. </P>
    <P>The fact is that there is an acute shortage of houses in Limerick.  There is no point in laying the blame on one side rather than on the other.  I shall not engage in that type of futile discussion. I would ask the Minister, on behalf of the many families in Limerick who are in the desperate plight I have described, when replying to this debate, to clear the air regarding the housing situation in Limerick. If his Department is in any way responsible for delay in the sanctioning of housing schemes, and so on, I would ask him to ask his officers to get a move on.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if Limerick Corporation is not facing up to its responsibilities in the matter of housing, I would ask the Minister to apply the necessary pressure.  The situation is desperate and drastic measures are called for.  I would go so far as to warn the Minister that unless something is done about the matter, there will be a revolution in the city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Another matter arises in connection with Limerick city, a matter for which the Minister is fully responsible.  Possibly it comes under the heading of town planning.  A year ago, the Minister made a decision permitting the erection of a ballroom on a site adjacent to the Ennis Road in Limerick.  In making the decision, he overruled a previous decision of Limerick Corporation turning down the application.  The Minister also ignored the rights of the local community in whose neighbourhood this structure is now going up.  When people have gone to the expense of setting up a home, they should not be disturbed.  The area on Ennis Road is a residential area where the families concerned have purchased houses at considerable expense.  They now find that, almost overnight, due to the erection of this monster in their midst, the value of these houses has depreciated.</P>
    <P>I do know that a number of these families are making arrangements to move from the locality.  The decision to permit the erection of this ballroom was a bad decision.  I sincerely hope there will be no repetition of it.  The Minister's decision was very difficult to understand, in view of the fact that there were several alternative suitable sites available for the ballroom.  However, the Minister has made his decision but I would ask him to bear this matter in mind in future.</P>
    <P>With reference to the rural part of the constituency which I represent and which comes under the administration of Limerick County Council, first of all, I wish to say the major problem is one of roads.  We have very good first-class roads and secondary roads but we have very bad farm roadways, <i>culs de sac</i> and so on.  Over the past twelve months, since I became a member of this House, people have been coming to me almost weekly in connection with the repair, in some cases, of small roads serving perhaps two or three families, in other cases serving 10, 12 or more families.  This matter should be tackled and funds should be made available, even at the expense of neglecting major roads for the moment.  The present policy in my constituency seems to be to make <Col N="1494" /> good roads better.  Instead, we should try to make the bad roads good.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, in the part of County Limerick which is in my constituency there are perhaps more cottages locked up than there are in any other part of the country.  Side by side with that situation, there is quite a considerable number of people seeking housing accommodation.  The big problem at the moment with Limerick county council is to secure contractors to build cottages.  In one or two cases I made representations to Limerick county council that they should purchase a cottage which had been put on the market.  I understand that the problem in that connection is that there is a limit beyond which the local authority cannot go in the matter of purchasing a cottage which is offered for sale.  In one case that I came across the limit was £200.  The applicant was very badly in need of housing.  The local authority went to some trouble in securing a site and a cottage is being erected for the applicant. The total cost of the site and of building the cottage will be many times greater than the £300, or so, for which a cottage could have been purchased.  There is need for greater flexibility in this matter.  The county council should not be restricted to a certain figure.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to refer to the matter of rural water supply, a matter in which I have very deep personal interest because prior to my election to this House I was very closely associated with Muintir na Tíre and the promotion of a number of group schemes.  I am a firm believer in the group water scheme and regard it as an ideal method of solving the problem of bringing piped water to rural homes.  I am very pleased indeed to have been associated with the promotion of group water schemes in south-east Limerick where the original scheme, started two years ago, is now serving about 30 families and another scheme is serving 25 families and, in the past couple of weeks, another scheme has been promoted which will serve something like 55 families.  I am convinced from what I have seen of the group scheme in operation in various counties and particularly in <Col N="1495" /> my own constituency that every encouragement should be given to the promotion of such schemes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Local Government covers a greater number of schemes than any other Department.  While I cannot say to the Minister, as I did to other Ministers, that I believe everything that has been done under his auspices has been correct, nevertheless there are certain things in regard to which the Minister and his Department seem to be doing a reasonably good job.  There are, of course, some sections with which I would disagree violently.</P>
      <P>The question of housing has been dealt with in a critical tone by Deputy O'Donnell of Limerick, and with paeans of praise by Deputy P.J. Burke of County Dublin.  My approach will come somewhere in between.</P>
      <P>In County Meath, for a number of years, we have been trying to overcome the housing shortage, to see to it that those who need houses and who cannot afford to build them for themselves, who qualify in other ways, would have houses built for them by the local authority.  One objection we have is in regard to the prolonged delay which occurs from the time a scheme is submitted to the Department until it is finally sanctioned and the green light is given and the council can go ahead with the building of the houses.  I regret to have to say that we have experienced delays of as much as six years.  All the blame may not rest with the Department but certainly the Department must accept a fair share of it.  If the Meath county council or any other local authority inspects sites, considers them suitable for building, has them inspected by the engineers and submits the schemes to the Department it is a rather stupid idea that the Department should then find it necessary to send somebody down from Dublin to inspect the sites in order to decide whether or not they are suitable. That means duplication of work which should not occur and which causes unnecessary delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem that we have to deal with has been referred to by Deputy Burke.  Deputy Burke got a <Col N="1496" /> little confused in the percentages and vulgar fractions.  He referred to a figure of two-thirds per cent.  I assume he was talking about the two-thirds subsidy.  The position in County Meath and elsewhere is that if persons qualify for the two-thirds subsidy the county council is willing enough to build the houses and, if they do not qualify for the two-thirds subsidy, the council will not build the houses.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister can get out of it by saying very simply that it is a matter for the county council.  The Minister would be perfectly right in making that statement, but when we consider that the people concerned are either (a) living as sub-tenants in county council cottages or (b), living in good houses for which they have no security of tenure, houses which were lent to them when they got married on the strict understanding that they would be provided with alternative accommodation inside 12 or 18 months, it is wrong for the Minister to say that they qualify only for a one-third subsidy.  Thereby they are effectively prevented from having a house built for them by the local authority.</P>
    <P>I understand that about 12 months ago a decision was taken by someone in the Department that the county council cottages which were being built were too big and too ornate.  It was decided to reduce the floor space and to reduce the size of the cottages. In some cases, it was suggested that one fireplace was sufficient, on the plea that now that everyone has ESB current and can have an electric fire, or can use an oil heater, more than one open fireplace is not required.  The result is that in the last scheme of houses built by some local authorities, including Meath County Council, some of the rooms are so small&mdash;and without a fireplace&mdash;that when the windows and doors are closed, and two or three people sit down for the evening, you cannot see across the room because of the smoke from their cigarettes.  A very bad mistake was made by someone when those houses were being planned, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider that matter.</P>
    <P>We should not reduce the size of these houses.  Where it is at all possible, we should attempt to increase <Col N="1497" /> it.  The old cottages which were built were small enough for rearing a family and we should not reduce the size of the houses now being built.  If the fault lies with the local authorities, I should be glad if the Minister would let me know, when he is replying. From the inquiries I have made, I am informed that inspectors came from the Department.</P>
    <P>To go to the other side of the picture, I consider that very many more people could help themselves by building their own houses.  Very often you find a person who has a site but wants the local authority to build a house. When the house is built, he may have to pay a weekly rent of anything up to £1 and, in addition, rates which may run to 3/10 per week will be added on.  If that person builds a house and avails of the full grants from the Department and the local authority&mdash;£300 in each case&mdash;it means he has a free gift of £600 to start off.  If the House costs £1,200 or £1,300&mdash;and it can be built to his own design or very close to it&mdash;he gets a rates remission for a period of 10 years.</P>
    <P>It is only fair that the Department should get full credit for the assistance they give when those new type houses are being built.  I know that in County Meath any time they have been requested to give full co-operation in planning and building houses and in passing them for grants, they have done so.  On the other hand, the local authority have also been helping in every way.  The Minister and his officials should do everything possible to encourage that type of building. It will provide homes for people who might have to wait until they were 80 years of age for the local authority to build houses for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Can you get a house built in Meath for £1,300?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>House built by the local authority are costing something like £1,200.  If people are satisfied with houses which the local authority build for £1,200, it is a reasonable assumption that they will be satisfied with houses they build for themselves for £1,300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another fault I find with the Department <Col N="1498" /> is that when a local authority house is built, immediately the tenant takes possession, he is required to pay rates.  There is a remission on private building for ten years but the local authority tenant gets no such remission. As soon as he takes possession, he is liable for rates, and must pay them from the first week he is in possession. Some effort should be made to try to deal with that matter.  After all, what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>In addition to the new houses being built, in Laytown, the village in which I live, a group of people formed a utility society or a building society and built their own houses.  They are lovely houses.  The people living in them have reasonably good jobs and the repayments are something around £2 per week.  They are excellent houses and the people are well satisfied.  The Department should be congratulated on the wonderful co-operation they gave.  The local authority were also very co-operative.  The scheme has been so successful that I imagine it will be copied and we will see many people helping themselves.  Self-help is the answer, and I am sure it will get full co-operation from the Department as well as the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The question of the employment of road workers has been dealt with.  My biggest complaint about road work is that we have reached the stage where, if a job can be done by machinery, even if it costs more than it would cost to have it done by hand, those who plan these jobs consider it should be done by machinery; that it is more up-to-date, and the more modern thing to do.  The fact that perhaps 20 or 30 men are left without a week's wages does not seem to worry those who plan these jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is generally realised that up to ten years ago the local authorities and county councils who were employing 800, 900, or 1,000 men for the whole year, have now cut down their staff by the use of machinery to roughly 300 or 400.  If one asks where have the other 400 or 500 gone, the answer is very simple: most of them have had to emigrate.  It is all right to say that the jobs are <Col N="1499" /> being well done and are perhaps costing a little less&mdash;although, in my opinion they are costing much more&mdash; but the Department should decide that we have gone as far as we possibly can in the use of machinery and attempt to cut down on it.  In my opinion&mdash;and this is a personal opinion &mdash;if we buy machinery which is made abroad to do work which could be done as cheaply by hand&mdash;perhaps not as quickly&mdash;that is a false economy.  I ask the Minister and the Department to do everything possible to discourage that kind of thing.  While we may talk at local level or in this House if the Minister sends down a circular, it is considered in the same light as the Bible and is obeyed immediately&mdash; indeed, perhaps, far more quickly than that which is laid down in the Bible.</P>
    <P>There is an improvement, I admit, in the road workers' conditions in general.  The superannuation scheme is working very effectively.  The five-day 45-hour week is operating for nine months of the year&mdash;except in the Minister's county where they are dragging their feet like the Government&mdash;and is working very well.  We hope next year to see a 45-hour five-day week operating over the whole country.  We expect that it will be quite easily operated, or an average 45-hour week anyway.  We must thank the Minister for the way in which he dealt with the applications for sanction in these matters when they came before him.  He did not hold them up but apparently decided that if the local authority were satisfied and the Labour Court made a recommendation, it was good enough for him.</P>
    <P>There is a question which I think has been very badly dealt with by the Minister, and I am glad that Deputy Faulkner is here while I am referring to this.  It is an individual case of a gentleman in County Louth who was appointed as an overseer by Louth County Council.  When he was appointed, a number of people who had been acting as overseers for a long time were asked if they would agree to an enlarged area to work in on the retiral of some of the overseers, with <Col N="1500" /> the consideration that they would get an extra £1 per week.  The men accepted the £1 per week.  The man to whom I am referring now was appointed subsequent to the change being made and the Department of Local Government decided that though he was doing the same type of work, was covering the same area, had the same costs as, and as a matter of fact, a little more than the other people who were doing the job, he was not to get the £1 per week.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to the Minister's refusal in this matter, my trade union took a number of cases to the Labour Court which I considered were exactly similar.  The ruling of the Labour Court was in favour of my members; the cases were sanctioned by the Department of Local Government, and still the Minister says he cannot give sanction in the case of this man.  There is nothing political in this.  As far as I am aware, this man is a supporter of the Minister's Party.  Despite that, he has been prevented from getting this increase of £1 a week to which he is definitely entitled.  I intend to have the matter raised again but may I say now that this sort of thing does not help the good relations that should exist between employers, employees and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>Another speaker has referred to the question of development along the seaside.  We have a seven-mile stretch of coast in Louth and I should like to see development there very similar to what has been done in Salthill, Galway. An excellent job seems to have been done there.  There are one or two things that could possibly be improved but they have spent lots of money which has been worthwhile.  They are able to bring visitors there and cater for them.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that places like Laytown, Bettystown, Mornington, Gormanston, which are within striking distance of Dublin and Drogheda, have received little in the way of help from the Department.  The local authorities over the years have succeeded in getting money to build houses but very little has been devoted to developing the seaside.  The Department should <Col N="1501" /> endeavour to channel some of the money which they make available into places such as those.  That would benefit the whole country and would particularly benefit those who cannot travel as far away as the West of Ireland for a holiday but who would wish to go for a holiday to some of the nearer seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>Public lighting has been mentioned. Twelve months ago, the Department issued a circular about public lighting. They referred to what I assume was the ideal form of lighting.  I do not know who they expected would be able to pay for the lighting they thought ideal.  Certainly, the local authority to which I belong did not feel inclined to look for the money needed to do the job.  It would cost very much more than the present system.  While the present system is not ideal, it must be remembered that many villages even in the thickly populated parts of the country have not yet been lighted publicly.  It is a pipe-dream to suggest we should improve greatly the standard of lighting before some attempt is made to light the villages which are still literally in the dark.</P>
    <P>In the course of his opening statement, the Minister referred to piped water and, if I am not misquoting him, may I say he seems to have had a change of mind since he first went into ecstasies about the regional water schemes.  I have been trying to read the two of them one after the other to find out if there is anything there which I have missed out.  I can be corrected if I am wrong but I understood that earlier this year, and perhaps last year, the Minister and his advisers were of the opinion that there was only one solution to the lack of piped water, that is, the piped scheme.  There should be a central scheme as far as possible which could be used to pipe water to practically every part of the country.  Local authorities, I understand, were advised to carry out a very extensive survey in order to find out what the position was in their areas. Many of the local authorities have spent a very substantial amount of money doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister the other day said he <Col N="1502" /> is not to be taken as saying that is the only solution, and maybe that is what he meant first.  I did not understand it from what he said, any more than the local authorities seem to have understood it from the Minister's statement.  Anyway, the Minister is entitled to interpret his own words but when he is concluding, I should like to know what exactly he did say.  I agree with his second views rather than with his first ones.  I am aware of one local authority with a number of small piped water schemes in their area and, when they got what they thought was the green light from the Minister some time ago, they started carrying out investigations into the piping of water from a lake which would supply the whole county.  That piped water supply would cost the ratepayers of that county £5,250,000, less, of course, what the Minister would contribute by way of subsidy.</P>
    <P>Now it seems they have to tear up their blueprint and start off on what is a reasonable way of doing it, using all the existing supplies of water, thereby trying to improve the general position.  It should be remembered that very many farmers&mdash;and they are the people referred to as needing this water &mdash;have provided their own private supply.  There are many substantial farmers in the country who already have their own private supply and I am sure they would not welcome paying extra rates for the purpose of supplying their neighbours or anybody else who had not got that supply.</P>
    <P>There is one matter my Party tried to introduce in a Bill earlier this year, that is, a provision in regard to sewage disposal.  I think the Minister is well aware the sewage disposal units which are supposed to operate in many towns are non-existent.  In most villages, they are still using the old septic tanks or, worse still, pumping sewage into the sea or open rivers.  In 1962, an all-out drive should be made to prevent that sort of thing.  Every town of any size or any place where there is a sewage system should have a sewage disposal farm.  There is nothing so appalling as to find an open sewer pouring into a river and find half a mile further down 20 or 30 children bathing in that river.  That has been happening all over <Col N="1503" /> this country in the summer and, apparently, it is nobody's job to see that it is stopped.  I would ask the Minister when he is concluding the debate to offer an opinion&mdash;I am sure he has very decided views on such things&mdash;as to what he thinks can be done about it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the difficulty in some counties of finding contractors to build labourers' cottages.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony Barry asked about the cost of these cottages.  I suggest the reason it is so difficult to get contractors to tender for the building of such cottages is that over a number of years, a group of people have been contracting for the erection of cottages who have paid very bad wages, whenever they could get away with it, and who produced a very inferior house very cheaply.  It is up to the local authority to see that each contractor does his job properly, pays the proper wages and observes the correct conditions. The authorities should see to it that no others are allowed to erect these cottages.  If this is done, decent contractors who pay good wages and who do a good job will be only too anxious to tender for such work.  They are not tendering at the moment because people who do inferior work are prepared to tender at hundreds of pounds cheaper and are accepted as contractors by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In recent legislation, the maximum income limit for qualification for supplementary grants for house building was fixed at £832.  The Minister should have a second look at that figure and he will see it is ruling out quite a number of people who feel they are in a position to build houses.  When a person has an income of anything between £800 and £1,000, he feels he can build a house at the moment under this scheme.  However, such people are ruled out because of the limit of £832.  In my county, we had the suggestion that the regulation be graded so that the limit would be £1,040.  It is rather a pity the Minister did not accept a Labour Party amendment to the recent legislation that the <Col N="1504" /> maximum limit should be £1,040 instead of the present £832.  If the Minister is amending this legislation in the future, I suggest he could do something about this qualification limit for supplementary grants.</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish to raise&mdash;I have done so several times by way of Parliamentary Questions&mdash;is the matter of appeals against the state of repair of council cottages when they are being vested.  I should like to know now if the Minister has done anything to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>The present position is that when a local authority decide that a cottage does not require repair, the tenant due for vesting may appeal to the Minister. The Departmental engineer inspects the house and sends a list of the necessary repairs to the local authority concerned.  Ultimately the repairs are carried out but the final inspection to find out whether the repairs have been properly executed is carried out by the engineer who originally said the cottage did not need repair&mdash;the engineer employed by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Such an inspection should, of course, be carried out by the Departmental engineer.  The Minister has said he does not consider this to be the ideal way of doing it.  I suggest that was the understatement of the year.  I believe that repairs to vested cottages should be inspected by the Departmental engineer who originally stipulated that the repairs were necessary.  The question of cost may enter into it but I think it is highly undesirable that the present system should be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We can all agree with the Minister's desire for a further increase in house building next year. There is at the moment a boom in the building trade generally and as such a state in the building industry is regarded as an indication of the prosperity of the country in general, the pointers are in the right direction.  Most of the important features of this Estimate have been discussed.  I wish to deal here with one aspect of it&mdash;the inter-dependence of building and the development of industry in certain areas in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> This is a problem certainly which we did not have to deal with previously but the general signs at the moment are that it is something we must give consideration to now.  It is, I suggest, a matter to which the Minister and his Department must give special consideration. My constituency is highly industrialised.  In it there has been a considerable increase in industrial employment during the past few years and all the signs appear to indicate that there will be further industrial expansion there in the relatively near future. If we are to ensure that we will have sufficient workers in such areas I am convinced from a close study of the problem that we will need to build in advance of requirements.</P>
    <P>If more workers are needed in certain areas than are available it will have a serious detrimental effect on existing industry and a bad psychological effect on foreign industrialists who come here to establish industries, very often mainly for the reason I am referring to.  It will not be difficult to get workers provided houses are available for them.  I am not to be taken as suggesting that at the present moment we have not got sufficient workers or that workers are not available for employment, but I can see that the problem is likely to arise.  It may be said I am looking too far into the future in this matter but I am raising it mainly because of the fact that a situation of this kind is developing in one part of my constituency and I feel that if present plans come to fruition this area may be detrimentally affected and that the problem will develop in other areas as well in my constituency.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I would urge the Minister and his Department to face up to the situation now.  It is a happy development but it could be very considerably hampered if the problem is not tackled now and if consideration is not given to what can be done to help.  In Drogheda a certain amount of progress has been made in the building of houses in the past few years, I might say mainly through the foresight of the late Deputy L.J. Walsh, who was instrumental in buying Ballsgrove, against considerable opposition.  One scheme has been completed <Col N="1506" /> there and another is being prepared but these will not be sufficient to cater for present needs.  The needs in respect of future industrial expansion are not catered for at all.</P>
    <P>The provision in recent legislation which gives powers to local authorities to formulate their own supplementary grants schemes for housing is very useful, and I was delighted to learn from the Minister's statement that there has been a considerable increase in private building.  I feel that if housing authorities make full use of the powers given to them under this legislation, it will give a considerable shot in the arm to this type of housing and will encourage young people to build their own homes.  I have very good reasons to believe it will be so in my constituency because even now, when no supplementary grants are available, a large number of young people have approached me seeking information about the loans and grants available.  In fact many of them have already built houses.</P>
    <P>We all realise that private building will never supplant local authority building, but it can do a lot to supplement it.  If we are to develop private building to the extent we should like it to develop, we could do a lot to ease the problem I mentioned at the outset.  At the present time, we find groups of people coming together and forming utility societies, to build their own schemes of houses.  That is certainly very encouraging.  I was at a meeting very recently in my constituency where a new utility society was formed for this purpose.  Further in regard to this question of industrial development, I think that if existing industries would make more use of the powers available to them to build houses for their managerial staffs and for their technicians, it would ease the situation with regard to this particular problem.</P>
    <P>I am fully in agreement with the Minister that houses should not be built at present without all modern amenities.  I was going to make a suggestion to him with regard to allowing people to provide these piecemeal because of the fact that, in certain income groups, the cost of a <Col N="1507" /> house causes considerable difficulty but now that housing authorities are taking a much greater interest in the supplementary housing grants, I think these supplementary grants would overcome the problem I have in mind. I was glad to note that the Louth County Council are asking for particulars of figures so as to give consideration to the formulation of a scheme for the provision of supplementary grants.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note from the Minister's statement also that, as was to be expected from the amount of work in progress over the past year, there was an increase of 22 per cent. in the number of reconstruction grants.  These grants are doing excellent work by providing better homes, more habitable homes and more comfort for our people.  I often felt that if reconstruction grants had been available during the time when Fianna Fáil began their housing drive in the 1930s, many of our housing problems which arose later might have been eliminated then.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is an increase in the water and sewerage grants of 30 per cent. is also a great achievement. Deputy Tully mentioned this matter and stated that the Minister had a change of mind with regard to what is the most adequate manner of providing water for our people.  He said, as far as I remember now, the Minister had said that the regional schemes were the be-all and the end-all in this matter of the provision of water.  We, on this side of the House, never thought for one moment that this was the Minister's intention.  It had always been my opinion&mdash;I have stated it on many occasions in my constituency&mdash; that the Minister's view was that the regional, group and private schemes should be availed of, depending on which was the most suitable and most economic for a particular area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned, as one of the reasons why he believed the Minister favoured regional schemes only, that the county councils had been instructed to make a survey of their areas in connection with regional schemes.  My feeling on that point was that the county councils made this <Col N="1508" /> survey, in relation to these regional schemes, to find out in what instances it would be more economical and more suitable to provide water by regional schemes.  In fact, I think the county councils generally understood that that was the reason for carrying out these surveys.</P>
    <P>I know that in my own constituency, the Louth county council carried out a survey and that they have now decided on schemes for certain areas where the cost of providing water would be under a certain figure per house.  They intend proceeding with these particular schemes.  The people in those areas are naturally enough anxious to get the water as soon as possible.  The county council informed me recently that they intended to proceed very shortly with the provision of water by regional scheme in the areas in County Louth where it is considered an economic proposition to do so.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister has in his statement cleared up a misconception with regard to this thing.  Perhaps, I might go further and say that he has cleared up a matter which has been very thoroughly misrepresented in certain quarters.  The grants for derelict sites are being availed of to some extent in my constituency, but I still feel that very much more use could be made of them.  We still have eye-sores along our roads which could be eliminated by taking advantage of these derelict site grants.  I feel, however, that by degrees our people will make use of them to clear finally all these old ruins.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made by the Minister of the amenity grants&mdash;the grants for developing parks and so on.  There is no doubt that these grants are of very great value.  They improve the appearance of the district and provide parks and so on to which people can come during the summer-time, particularly old people who have nowhere else to go.</P>
    <P>My experience in one instance was not very encouraging.  A particular group of people decided to develop a park without any grant as far as I can remember but I am not too sure of that.  When the job was finished the Valuation Office stepped in and spoiled the whole effect.  I do not want <Col N="1509" /> to deal any further with that because it is still for negotiation and it may be possible to do something about it.  If it is possible to do something about it, something should be done.  In this instance people gave their free time and subscribed money themselves. They worked very hard to develop this park only to find themselves saddled with a high rate demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that he intends to bring in the regulations under the Traffic Act with regard to speed limits in built up areas.  So far as my constituency is concerned, we are particularly anxious about this matter. We hope that the Minister will bring in the regulations as soon as possible. We find, particularly in our villages on the main Dublin-Belfast road, that nobody is safe.  In fact, our people are in constant anxiety about the danger, particularly to the children.  I was going to deal further with this particular matter but owing to the fact that very recently there was a shocking tragedy in one of our villages in connection with this speed business, I prefer not to now.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider making a regulation introducing the double white line system, particularly on main roads, as at present used in England.  I advocated this previously. At present, to give an example, if a motorist is travelling north and comes to the brow of a hill and has a clear view for perhaps two miles, he may still find himself, if he is travelling behind other traffic, hemmed in for a quarter of a mile.  The white line is there for the purpose of preventing south-bound traffic from passing out. The temptation is very great for the motorist with a clear view of two miles to pass out if travelling behind a slow vehicle and thereby cross the white line.  I believe that once he gets into the habit of doing this when he has a clear view, he will develop a contempt for white lines.  I think this is very often the cause of accidents.</P>
    <P>It will be generally agreed that despite the efforts of the Garda, the regulations regarding the white lines are not being observed.  I feel this is very largely because of the situation I <Col N="1510" /> have described and if we were to introduce double white lines, as in England, one line in the exact centre of the road and one either to the right or the left of it to show that in no circumstances may you cross from that particular side, people would have more respect for white lines and we would possibly eliminate some accidents of the type at present happening.</P>
    <P>I agree that high speeds are responsible for the vast majority of road accidents but I also want to draw the Minister's attention to the hazard caused by the very slow driver on main roads.  I see this frequently travelling on the main Dublin-Belfast road which is carrying very heavy traffic. The driver who travels at 20 m.p.h on that road, a very winding road with only about three straights of about two or three miles between Dublin and Dundalk, forces all other traffic to pass him out.  This very often results in accidents.  I am not suggesting we should have speed mechants but there is no question that on a winding main road the very slow driver of about 20 m.p.h. is a very definite hazard. What can be done about it is difficult to say.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Garda on the very good work they are doing in regard to road safety propaganda.  They give lectures at schools and these lectures are very much appreciated by both teachers and pupils.  Teachers like to see somebody in uniform giving these lectures because they feel that possibly the children will give more attention to road traffic lectures from a garda than from the regular teacher.  We could, however, make more use of television for road safety propaganda.  Some time ago the BBC had an excellent film on this subject portraying the different risks taken by a man leaving home and travelling all day in a car. It showed what thoughtlessness did and simple lack of care and the different things that, I suppose, most of us do when driving.  Films such as this help us to be more careful.  I think that when the figures for road deaths over a period are shown on television, it brings much more vividly <Col N="1511" /> to our mind the gravity of the situation.</P>
    <P>The relief of rates on agricultural land was very much appreciated, particularly in my constituency.  Deputy Tully referred to an overseer who was refused the extra £1 a week given to other overseers in an area because he was appointed after the date of the increase.  I have made many representations to the Minister without success on this matter and I should be very glad if he would take another look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points on which I should like to comment. The first concerns the provision of piped water in rural areas.  I do not believe the Minister at any stage intended that the answer to this problem should be regional water supply schemes.  I believe that, genuinely or otherwise, that statement was misinterpreted, but, seeing that the majority of people accept the necessity for piped water supplies, I think it only right to get down to brasstacks and be practical about providing it.</P>
      <P>In areas which I know pretty well, the most economic and efficient type of supply could be provided through group schemes and it is on these I wish to comment.  No worthwhile consideration has so far been given by the Department to group schemes. The Minister may think this is nonsense, but, I understand from figures given here, that we have only one or two inspectors full-time on the co-ordination and investigation of group schemes in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having a group scheme initiated and put into effect means direct contact between the group in a parish or locality and the Department.  There is a very strong feeling at present in rural areas that the cost of piped water will be outrageous.  I do not know who put that out but it is out.  Many responsible, or so-called responsible, bodies seem to believe that it is only the regional system that will be applied and I have had personal experience in various areas of trying to convince groups of people that there is no intention whatever, either by the Department or the local authority, to go ahead with regional schemes where <Col N="1512" /> group schemes can be provided and that they will get prior consideration.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult in rural Ireland, to get a group of ten or 12 or 14 people or families to come together for any desirable communal effort. That difficulty has existed for the past 50 years.  If we are to get communal effort, and the advantages of uniting for a purpose appreciated, we must have leadership.  There must be immediate advice and assistance by the responsible authority in charge of group schemes.  I find that the position in the local authority in Roscommon is that there is no responsibility whatever on the local authority to administer, advise or help in connection with the group schemes.  At a recent meeting of the county council, I suggested that there was only one possible way out of this.  I understand that as a result of a resolution passed at that council meeting, the Minister has been communicated with by the Roscommon County Council on this matter and requesting that the county council should provide a liaison between the group and the Department.</P>
    <P>There is nothing wrong with providing, in the county council's staff, a special officer&mdash;as a housing officer was established in the Department of Local Government&mdash;to deal with group schemes.  He would be in a position to go into the various areas at two or three day's notice and have the necessary information, in full, available for the people in the local authority area concerned.  He would calm their fears with regard to the idea that the scheme will cost them an outrageous figure on the rates.</P>
    <P>I shall believe that the Department and the Minister are serious about implementing this piped water supply scheme only when I see proper machinery brought into operation to get the group schemes on a practical basis.  I can say definitely that at present in County Roscommon, no apparent practical effort is being made to get the group schemes working in a proper fashion.  If the liaison I am talking about is provided, the Department would be inundated with applications. I hope the Minister will count on that.  I am in complete agreement <Col N="1513" /> with the idea of the piped water supply.</P>
    <P>The next point I should like to mention is in connection with rural housing.  I find, from figures provided by the Department, that my county seems to have fallen behind in the erection of council houses in the past nine months.  The officials in our local authority have, time and again, pointed out to the council that the trouble is lack of contractors, that nobody seems interested in taking up the contract. I should like the Minister to give us his experience of the situation in other counties.</P>
    <P>It is far too serious a situation to have people waiting for five or six years, living in condemned houses, and told by the authorities that this is due to the fact that they cannot get contractors.  I should like to know the experience in other counties and whether the Minister can take any steps to alter that situation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to restore the funds under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not know whether mention has been made of it so far&mdash; I presume it has&mdash;by other speakers. It is essential at this stage to provide funds so that that Act can be put into operation without any further delay. What amazes me is that every member of the present Government is up in the moon.  They talk about the wonderful benefits that lie ahead of this country in the Common Market.  We are sick and tired of being told how the small farmer will be protected, how we shall have markets, how his livelihood will be protected, and so on, as a result of our admission to the Common Market.</P>
    <P>We hear that kind of talk while, at the same time, the very small farmer, in particular in the West of Ireland, has to wear wellingtons for 12 months of the year to go around his land.  Is there any commonsense in the minds of the members of the Government? Can they not see what is going on around them?  There is little use in talking to a small farmer about increasing his output or about guaranteed markets if, every morning before he goes out, he has to put on his <Col N="1514" /> wellingtons before he can get to his front gate.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to talk about Europe, and so on, and what we shall do.  The surest proof that we are serious about the welfare of these people is to make it possible for them to utilise the small amount of land they have at present.  There is no good in promising them pie in the sky and that things will be good when the Common Market or some other thing looms up in the future.  The situation in my county is absolutely desperate as far as drainage is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am speaking on this not as an individual.  I am also representing the views of the Fianna Fáil members and of other members of the Roscommon County Council.  They are unanimous in their request to the Department of Local Government to restore the funds under this very worthy Act.  No other county in Ireland is as badly off for drainage as Roscommon.  The only trouble so far is that the people in that county have been too patient.</P>
    <P>I do not think Deputies from other areas realise how bad the situation is. County Roscommon is bordered by two major rivers, the River Shannon on one side and the River Suck on the other side.  Both of them run parallel for about 18 miles.  The distance between them, across, ranges from 14 to 18 miles.  When both of those rivers are in flood, and when the streams running into both of those rivers are flooded, the entire countryside in between those two rivers is, you might say, subject to water-logging, if not to extreme flooding.</P>
    <P>The people concerned are the small farmers.  They are the backbone of this country.  They are finding it almost impossible to hold on to their holdings. It is absolutely exasperating for them to have to listen to the drivel uttered by Ministers at present about the wonderful Utopia that faces them while no attempt is being made to relieve the flooding of their land.  It is all very well for the Minister to tell me that it will need arterial drainage to remedy the situation.  That will not wash any more.</P>
    <P>On one side of the River Shannon, a major drainage scheme is under <Col N="1515" /> way: the River Inny, into the River Shannon.  If that can be done on the east flank of the River Shannon there is no justification for suggesting that the small streams on the west of the River Shannon, in my constituency, cannot be done until arterial drainage work is carried out.  All of those small streams could be done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  It would give tremendous help and encouragement to a community that is at present put to the pin of its collar to pay its rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I know, may be fed up listening to my talk about drainage. I happen to notice the severe lack of it every time I visit any portion of my constituency.  I cannot understand how the Deputies of the Minister's Party have not impressed more upon him the necessity for the restoration of the Local Authorities (Works) Act. These men in his own organisation are given the facts by people in their organisation down the country and surely the Minister will listen to the voice of his comrades in the Fianna Fáil organisation?</P>
    <P>A request is being made&mdash;I do not know whether it has gone in yet to the Minister&mdash;by the Roscommon County Council to receive a deputation of all interests in the county.  I do not want at this stage to jump the gun as far as that deputation is concerned, but I want to put it to the Minister that it will be one of the most representative deputations sent to his Department from any county in Ireland.  The reason it is representative is that all sections of the people of the country are united now in demanding that either the Local Authority (Works) Act funds be restored or that the Minister make special provision as he has already done on another occasion by way of finance in order to put under way the very necessary drainage schemes in that county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very glad to hear the Minister inviting local authorities to increase their output of housing.  Taking this in conjunction with some remarks the Minister passed before he went to America, I think he must have included Cork in that <Col N="1516" /> invitation.  I was very glad to hear Deputy T. O'Donnell say that as far as Limerick was concerned he believed the Minister's remarks were quite justified.  Possibly technically the Minister's remarks are not justified in relation to Cork&mdash;I do not know what the technical definition of a slum is&mdash;but certainly, as regards the spirit in which the Minister spoke, I think he was quite right because there is a definite need for more local authority housing in Cork.</P>
      <P>It is quite true that we have done a very great deal and anything I have said is not meant to reflect in any way on the excellent work the City Manager we now have has done since he came.  It can be said in mitigation of the fact that we are not building as many houses as I personally and some members of the Corporation would like to see, that some of the work done over the past two years is the tedious kind of work you find when you are engaged in demolition and slum clearance generally.  Personally I should hate to find Cork Corporation becoming complacent about the housing situation.  We were told by the Minister in reply to a Question I put to him some months ago that 60 people who were looked upon as urgent cases could not be housed because the only houses being built are for people from slum clearance areas and this indicates clearly that Cork Corporation are not producing as many houses as they should.  I hope the Minister's words will be taken to heart in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we do get over the problem we have at the moment in getting people out of overcrowded dwellings, I hope it will be remembered that there is such an institution as Christian marriage and when a young couple get married, they are looking for a house. Unfortunately, unlike Dublin Corporation who, I believe, provides some houses by lot for newly-weds, as far as Cork Corporation is concerned the institution of marriage might as well not exist at all.  We have no place for them and I am not surprised that the marriage figures for this country are as low as they are if other local authorities take the same attitude towards newly-weds.  I would ask the <Col N="1517" /> Minister, when we break the back of the problem of crowded and unhealthy dwellings, to look to the future and see what can be done for them.  Small houses should be built for young couples who are starting out as a family unit and have nowhere to go except to their mothers-in-law.  In Cork, they sometimes split up and go back to their respective mothers and families which is a bad thing socially and otherwise.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Tully saying that in Meath they could build a cottage for £1,200 and I heard Deputy Barry asking in surprise if that were so.  I thought this was rather symptomatic of what is happening.  I often wonder if the Minister ever tabulated the cost per house per local authority or if he ever tabulated the output per tradesman per local authority.  If he did, he might find amazing discrepancies in these figures and this might be very useful to him regarding the question of housing.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Tully was wrong&mdash; though he might be right as far as his own county is concerned&mdash;when he said that some local government houses were too small.  I think the manner in which the Minister imposes on local authorities such as Cork an obligation to build houses of a certain size is wrong.  We have many owner-type small houses in Cork which are very adequate.  The test is the strong healthy families who were reared in them and who continue to live in them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister's promises regarding staffing difficulties and grants are fulfilled.  It is a very important matter and we are told there is a hold-up in it at the moment.  The Minister, in his opening remarks, said there were difficulties in recruiting and maintaining an adequate staff of inspectors, but if he offered proper conditions, I am quite sure he would have no difficulty whatsoever in getting the proper type of inspector to fill this very important need at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister has expressed his disquiet at the number of fires, fatal and otherwise, which have occurred and intimated that more interest would be <Col N="1518" /> taken in the control of fires generally and that arrangements would be put in train for a more effective fire prevention programme.  I should say that he should pay special attention to places like cinemas, theatres and dancehalls.  Up and down the country there are cinemas which would prove veritable incinerators if a fire occurred in them.  I have been in them myself and the thought uppermost in my mind was that, if there were a fire, I would be by no means underdone before I got out.  They are not only in small towns but in cities like Cork and Dublin, too.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that the first parking bye-laws under the 1961 Road Traffic Act in Dublin city and county would be in operation in January.  I should like to indicate to him that I understand that Dublin city and county naturally would have priority in a matter like this but the citizens of Cork city and county are most anxious that the parking bye-laws, which are with the Minister's Department at the moment from Cork Corporation, should also be brought into operation as soon as possible. Parking is daily becoming a bigger problem in Cork city and, if the bye-laws were put into operation, it would assist both the commercial and the social life of the city.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that he has a very difficult task on his hands regarding regulations under the Road Traffic Act generally.  Regulations regarding the dimensions of vehicles will have to be made and I hope that very particular attention will be given to the dimensions of vehicles carrying trailers which, on the main roads at the moment, are an immense danger to traffic generally.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister did not indicate whether there were regulations in relation to the use of lighted reflectors. The Minister has told us he has issued illustrated booklets about various things.  It is very important that, in addition to any regulations he might make, the Minister should issue a special booklet for cyclists, pointing out the danger they can be to themselves and to other road users.  If he were to issue regulations making it <Col N="1519" /> mandatory on anybody using any sort of vehicle, bicycle or otherwise, to have a lighted reflector, he would be doing a good day's work.  I do not know what the statistics of deaths or injuries to cyclists are but half of them could be avoided if it were mandatory to have lighted reflectors on bicycles.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also bear in mind, when dealing with lighting regulations the experience of Birmingham Corporation recently where they had two test periods during which persons driving in the city drove not on sidelights but on dimmed lights. The incidence of traffic accidents during those test periods was much reduced.</P>
    <P>It has been whispered in Cork that the Minister has plans in train for introducing the ward system in the city. That would be a very bad thing.  Cork is not big enough for it.  It is a selfcontained unit.  The city at the moment has a corporation of 21 members. They are working well together.  As soon as the Minister introduces the ward system, Cork Corporation will be broken up into little sections, each man looking after his own ward, jealous of anything any other ward may get, anxious to ensure that there will be no growth of housing in another man's ward but that development will take place in his own ward. As soon as the Minister does this, he will damage the material fabric of the Cork Corporation; he will reduce its efficiency and dispel the good feeling which exists between all members of the Corporation at the moment in regard to municipal problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputies representing Cork city are here because what I have to say may help them.  Some 11 years ago, the Cork Corporation applied to the Cork County Council for an extension of boundaries.  I, with other members of the council, regarded it as anomalous that we should be collecting rates from houses built by the corporation. So, we freely gave our consent to that, on compensation.  Subsequently, we had a row over the compensation and the matter was finally referred to the <Col N="1520" /> Minister, on 1st April, 1955.  We may be &ldquo;April fools&rdquo; but surely it should not take from April, 1955, to November, 1962, to get a decision from the Minister's Department?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In the meantime, the Cork Corporation were quite happy in drawing the rates out of the area they got.  We have been at the loss of the rates for the past 11 years but the Minister's Department have not yet decided on the compensation that is to be paid for property handed over to the Corporation 11 years ago.  Still, we had the farce of an inquiry into a further extension of that borough boundary last year.</P>
      <P>I was rather amused to hear Deputy Barrett talking about the housing position.  In our preparation of the case for the borough boundary, we found that there were 75 acres of derelict sites within the boundaries of the present Cork city.  That should give enough room to build, without moving out.  Unfortunately, due to the Corporation's neglect of their duty to house the people, the burden fell on the area close to the city and some hundreds of houses were erected by Cork County Council outside the present borough boundary of Cork city.</P>
      <P>That brings me to a further problem, namely, the anomaly that exists between the Housing of the Working Classes Act and the Labourers Act and the absolute necessity of co-ordinating these two Acts.  The Corporation insists that they have a right to extend out and to embrace all those housing schemes of the county council. If they do so, the unfortunate tenants will be put in the position that, if they ever want to own their houses, their rents will be doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a Question in the Dáil at the time and was told by the Minister that they would come under whatever authority was in charge of them at the time of purchase.  There is a difference of which I was not aware until I came up against it in the town of Cobh.  Many years ago, Fianna Fáil adumbrated the policy that every man <Col N="1521" /> should own his home.  We introduced legislation towards that end, enabling local authorities to sell houses to tenants.  During the period that I was chairman of the housing authority in the southern area of Cork, I was very careful, every five years, to bring in further purchase schemes to embrace the houses built during the previous five years.  Due to the increase in industry and consequent increase in employment, Cobh urban council built some 52 new houses and the local authority has built some 180 houses outside the urban area.  I would say that the work is about 25 per cent completed.  There remains the large task of providing houses for the enormous number of people now finding employment there.</P>
    <P>Under the county council purchase scheme, those people will get a reduction in rent from 11/- to 9/- and they will own their houses after a period of years.  Two sets of houses were built, one in the urban area and the other in the rural area.  In regard to those built in the urban area, we found that the rent on purchase would be increased from 11/- to 32/- a week because, under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, the subsidy ceases on purchase.  Under the Labourers Act, the subsidy continues on purchase.</P>
    <P>In plain words, if the large number of houses owned by the Cobh urban council were all purchased by the tenants, the State would gain £1,800 a year out of the town of Cobh.  The Corporation extended their holy hand and said: &ldquo;`We will embrace all those,&rdquo; and the unfortunate people are placed in that position instead of being allowed to purchase at reduced rents. Their subsidy ceases on purchase and their rents go up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of my observations on this Bill last week, I dealt with the general question of CIE and my reasons for recommending the rejection of the Bill.  I have had an opportunity since of studying all the points made, and I have something further to say.</P>
      <P>I note that the sponsors of the Bill have suggested the elimination of the section of the Act which impels CIE to become a self-paying organisation within a period, and that in connection with many observations made by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan, the idea is put forward that for the sake of better services for the public, we should consider subsidies as a permanent feature of CIE administration.</P>
      <P>I want to say straight away in that regard that, assuming what I think is impossible&mdash;that this Bill is passed by the House and adopted by the Government&mdash;if the board of CIE with the new directions given by the Government felt they need no longer pay their way by a certain period and took it from that that no railway line should be closed, I think it would be a ludicrous decision on their part.  I want to make it quite clear that my view is that even if the impossible were to happen and this Bill were passed, CIE should still take the point of view that, for the sake of the public in general, and for the sake of the taxpayers in general, they should provide whatever service is best, most convenient and cheapest for the majority of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I would recommend CIE to go ahead and continue closing railway lines which have ceased to be of any economic importance to the communities concerned. I am not certain from Deputy Dr. Browne's remarks whether he himself is really a dedicated railway hysteric, as some people are in this country, or whether he really believes in keeping railway stations open where only one person gets into the train every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that having studied the whole question of railways, not only in this country but in others <Col N="1523" /> with comparable social conditions, I repeat what I said before.  I see railways more and more in the future as fast conveyor belts for the comfortable carriage of passengers over reasonably long distances, and for the haulage of goods of the kind which, first of all at present can take double handling &mdash;with the exception of the very small minority of goods that may actually be produced in or removed from some place which is practically touching a railway station&mdash;and which secondly are of a character which lend themselves to transport by train.  The whole community ought to realise that that is what is happening in connection with railways, not only in this country but all over Europe.</P>
    <P>It is simply no use not facing the issue in regard to double handling.  I do not see why the taxpayers should pay a large sum of money every year in order that some difficulty or other of double handling should be got over by CIE making uneconomic charges in their rail services for that purpose. Why should we have any particular approval of double handling?  What is the purpose of this House supporting or subsidising double handling of goods, when, as everyone knows, because of increases in wages which have quite rightly taken place, particularly in the group of staff concerned with handling merchandise, it has become completely uneconomic?  I wanted to make that point clear so that everyone would understand the position that if, as I have said, this Bill were passed, any sensible board would still continue to adopt the attitude of the present Board of CIE which is fully supported by myself, and not have any prejudice in regard to any particular form of the transport services which they use.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that empty trains and empty lorries confer a prestige value upon the towns through which they pass.  I just do not believe it.  I have seen any number of towns in Europe and in England where the existence or non-existence of a railway has nothing to do&mdash;or shall we say little to do, in the main&mdash;with the existence of a railway station in the area.  The people who believe that <Col N="1524" /> empty trains equivalent to just a handful of lorries confer some sort of wonderful benefit upon an area are, in my opinion, out of date completely. The people of the country have decided that it is out of date and they are not supporting the railways in those areas where there are short branch lines.</P>
    <P>They prefer to travel by their own motor cars within the region or by bus.  They prefer to take the bus services and the lorry services where stops are frequent and where a great number of small scattered areas are served.  They prefer in the case of the lorry services to have the personal attention of some one they know, who calls regularly every week, or every day, or every two days, and who collects their small parcels of produce and conveys them to another area. They prefer the personal relationship between the lorry driver, the local inspector and the customer.  Where there are a large number of scattered villages and communities, the lorry service is of immense value.  No matter how perfect people may be on the railway lines&mdash;no matter how kindly the stationmaster or the porter&mdash;they cannot give the personal service because the train does not run up to the door of the farm house.</P>

      <P>I next wanted to stress something which has not been appreciated sufficiently, I have said too little about it when I dealt with the Bill on the last occasion, and that is the relation of this Bill with all the implications of our joining the Common Market.  I have read everything I can find about the transport policy of the Common Market, much of which has not yet been defined, none of which is fully in operation, but I can go this far: I can say that it is more than likely that there will be some degree of liberalisation in regard to transport which will affect CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My general deduction from making a study of the proposals that have been made in relation to transport if we join the Common Market has had this result that I have told the Chairman of CIE that he should proceed as fast as possible to reorganise the company and to reduce the subsidy because whatever will be the final decisions in this country as to our co-ordination with the EEC for transport <Col N="1526" /> purposes, I am perfectly certain greater efficiency, a lower rate of subsidy than at present and a position whereby we can avoid all subsidy will be the best ground on which to conduct any negotiations required for our co-ordination with the EEC rules.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody, no matter what opinion he has about the value of railways or the operations of CIE, who reads the reports that have been prepared so far would suggest that it would be wise or politic for us at this moment to pass a Bill which in effect says to CIE: &ldquo;You do not need to worry about Government subsidies. Carry on making further losses if you wish.&rdquo;  Anybody who has read these documents would agree it would be ludicrous to propose that.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear I do not know what the result of the transport policy decisions will be.  You can read the various proposals and the general resolutions passed, and you can interpret them in different ways.  It is quite possible in the case of this country there may be limiting factors which will be the result of our negotiation on these matters as in regard to other matters.  Having said that, I am perfectly certain it will be wise for us to continue the present policy and that it will be to our advantage in the end, that whatever the final decision is, the more efficiently CIE is run the better for ourselves, the better for our exports and the better for our transport position generally.</P>
    <P>I wish to say something about Deputy Dr. Browne's observation to the effect that the Government approved of subsidies and had already instituted them in connection with other services.  I thought I made it sufficiently clear that, first of all, there is a very big distinction between current operating subsidies and capital subsidies, subsidies that are given once and for all for the establishment of industry, for the reclamation of land, for arterial drainage and for many other purposes in which there is no element of current, operated subsidy to pay for current operating losses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where the person who receives the subsidy proceeds from then on to carry out his business as efficiently as possible without State assistance.  So far as agricultural subsidies are concerned, I need only refer Deputies of the House to the observations that have been made by the Minister for Agriculture and by the Taoiseach last night on the occasion of the Ard Fheis in which we have made it perfectly clear we much prefer an organised marketing system for agricultural produce as proposed by the EEC to a system of subsidies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which we operate partly because of the tremendous assistance afforded by some industrial communities whose cost to them is negligible and whose cost to us is a very considerable percentage of the gross national product.  If anybody thinks there is any comparison between the subsidy on butter, which is paid for the reason I have stated, and the subsidy to CIE then he had better have a second thought on the matter because there is no comparison.</P>
      <P>Taking it by and large, this Government has never believed in establishing permanently the principle of subsidies which cover current operating deficits, and, if they have, it is only for very special reasons and under very special circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said in regard to capital grants, there are grants which are sometimes free grants to the community; sometimes they are loans on which interest and repayment are required.  We have a great many of these and now we have applied the principle to CIE.  We have written off a great deal of their capital on which they had no hope of paying any interest and we have advanced other fresh capital on which they will pay interest for the development and modernisation of the transport services provided by them to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think people understand <Col N="1528" /> what happens when a subsidy is paid to CIE, a current operating subsidy, the taxation for which is raised in each financial year.  Deputies constantly talk as though you can pay subsidies without causing any reduction in purchasing power anywhere else.  I do not see why the public should be asked to buy fewer goods, to employ fewer people in factories, to save less for their children's education, in order to support CIE to an even greater extent than they are at present.  This is a most doubtful argument.  The economic rules about this are pretty remorseless.  For every £1 we put into CIE a £1 is being subtracted somewhere else which would have an employment effect.  If anyone can defeat that argument I should like to hear it being done.  It is accepted by both communists and capitalists alike. The only thing one can say is that in certain circumstances it may be necessary to eliminate purchasing power from other services in order to give special aid under special circumstances to some service.  That is all that can be said about it.</P>
    <P>The taxation now required to pay the past losses of CIE and the present subsidy, amounts to £3,000,000 a year, roughly a bit over £1 per head of the population per year, or about £4 10s. per year per household.  I wonder what would happen if that money were collected from householders in this form: that the less well-off would pay a little less than this £4 10s., and the more well-to-do would pay more.  And then if we were to go to these householders and say: &ldquo;We do not want CIE to break even; would you mind each giving us £2 a year more on top of what you are already giving,&rdquo; what would they say to us?  People would talk very differently about our transport services if we were to put the matter to them in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy S. Dunne made some references to the cross-subsidisation that exists in CIE whereby some services make profits and subsidise other services which make losses.  One could argue endlessly as to what degree of cross-subsidisation there should be in relation to any public service.  All I <Col N="1529" /> can say about it now is that cross-subsidisation exists to a considerable degree in relation to the operation of a great many State companies, both in this country and all over the world. The urban dwellers subsidise the rural electrification operations of the ESB on a very considerable scale, to the tune of nearly £1,000,000 a year, for the simple reason that in a country which has fewer villages than any other in Europe, and a more scattered population, it is absolutely essential that the people living in urban and more highly industrialised areas should assist those living in the scattered districts.</P>
    <P>The same is true of many private companies where the accountants will inform the directors that they do not make a profit on the distribution of some of their lines of goods in certain areas, but that they do make a profit on such goods elsewhere.  Therefore, cross-subsidisation is a very common feature of State company operation of this kind and is quite inevitable in certain circumstances like those of CIE.</P>
    <P>I did indicate that the bus fares paid in Dublin compare reasonably with those paid in provincial cities in Great Britain.  That, I thought, was a very fair comparison.  The difficulty faced by CIE is that we have a very low density of population&mdash;one of the lowest in Europe&mdash;and that the provision of any form of public transport is extremely difficult because of that low density of population, because of the scattered nature of the population.</P>
    <P>I should make clear also that I do not think anyone will deny that the tremendous growth in the private car population in this country in the past few years has had nothing whatsoever to do with the operations of CIE. People have made their personal decisions in this respect and even though their incomes are extremely modest, they are determined to own private cars.  There is now one car for every 14 persons in this country.  I do not know whether that is one to every three or four households but it is roughly between three and four.  Let no one imagine that that simply means <Col N="1530" /> only the wealthy have cars.  One has only to go to any building site to see the very large number of cars owned by operatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made an examination of this personal decision made by the public in relation to the purchase of private cars.  This was done by the Beddy Committee and it is a fact that has not been stressed sufficiently.  The position is that back in 1957 the number of private cars per £1,000,000 of national income in this country was the highest for any country in Europe, with the possible exception of France, where it was equal or slightly more.  It was very much higher than in a great many countries.  As I have said, the reason lies in the great absence of villages which would provide a centre for public transport and the enormous number of scattered farmsteads.  Sweden is <Col N="1531" /> the country nearest to us in these physical conditions.  The people here are scattered all over the country over an immense mileage of roads and it therefore becomes essential for them to have transport of their own.</P>
      <P>This all means a fairly heavy cost on the incomes of many of the people, particularly to farmers in the 30 to 40 acre categories.  If they do not own private cars, they possess utility vans which they can use for their personal transport and for the carriage of produce. There is nothing we can do about it and it has nothing to do with CIE, but it will undoubtedly provide CIE with most tremendous competition in the next ten years.  Deputies know very well that the period from 1951 to 1961 would be a fair period to take in the matter of the growth of the private car population in this country.  It includes periods of economic difficulty as well as periods of economic growth and if you apply the trend during that period to the years from now to 1970, assuming again some economic growth, it will be found that, by 1970, one person in every eight in the country will own a car and that one person in every four will own one in Dublin.</P>
      <P>It would therefore be ludicrous to suggest that it has anything to do with CIE policy.  It involves private decisions of thousands of people who will be earning greater incomes with the greater prosperity.  Deputies will notice that I have not taken the near boom period in our economy.  The quickest economic growth has taken place in the past two years.  We must be realistic about the position of CIE and our public transport services in relation to those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred in a quite ridiculous way to the report of CIE in which mention was made of the eighth round increase in wages and suggested that the Board imagined that wages could go up every year elsewhere but that they could not go up in CIE because CIE were not yet showing a profit.  The Board never suggested anything of the kind and Deputy Dr. Browne must know himself that the Board of CIE are quite aware of the <Col N="1532" /> general increase in wages that has taken place over recent periods.  But, in fact, the wage content of CIE costs is so high that the eighth round wages increase had a very serious effect on the economy of the company.  The company, with a turn-over of some £20,000,000 to £22,000,000 and which had a wage increase in one year of £2.35 million, naturally find their economy affected very severely.  CIE found themselves unable to pass their costs on to the public completely.  Some of the rates were raised but it was impossible to pass on the whole of that wage increase all at once.</P>
    <P>Then Deputy Dr. Browne went on to suggest that CIE were acting like a private company and in order to retain their accustomed dividend, had increased the cost of the commodity or the service to the public.  CIE have not made any profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Increased fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not make a profit.  The company are still losing. I wonder what the taxpayer would have said if the Government, prompted by Deputy Dr. Browne, had added £2.35 million to last year's Budget in order that the passenger rates and the freight rate should remain the same for this year?  I just wonder what would have happened if the public had been asked to pay that sum?  They would have regarded it as ridiculous.  They would have regarded it as the sort of economic action which would eventually bring chaos to the whole economy of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make my attitude clear in regard to this whole question of wage increases.  I hope, in relation to CIE and enterprises which have the difficulties of CIE to face and enterprises such as those that would be affected by the Common Market, that the proposals made by the National Employer-Labour Conference Economic Committee will be studied very carefully and will in some form be adopted finally when all the decisions of that Conference have been considered and put into general operation. I hope that Deputy Dr. Browne does not disagree with planning nationally in relation to wages and incomes.  I <Col N="1533" /> do not suppose he does.  I do not suppose he objects to the proposals made by this Committee which suggested, and I quote :&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Sub-Committee agrees it is desirable that efforts should be made to establish a more rational and better-informed basis for wage discussions and negotiations at whatever level they normally take place.  It should be appreciated that the significance and importance of the factors depends largely on the scope and nature of the discussions and the level at which they take place. </P>
    <P>Then they said that in relation to any discussion of wage increases, there should be a national level of consideration and the factors that should be examined would be&mdash;changes in the level of prices, effect of price changes on the purchasing power of wages and salaries, import price changes and effect of changes in home prices on the economy's competitiveness in exports, price changes in other European countries.  Then also on the national level should be discussed national production, distinguishing between agricultural, industrial and other sectors, labour costs in relation to gross output of industry, changes in productivity.  Another matter that should be discussed should be the overall employment situation, and incidence of overtime or short-time, changes in employment in particular sectors of industry and then emigration and employment problems.  Also, the question of relative incomes should be discussed, the profits made by the community during the year, the investment in savings undertaken, a general economic forecast, external trade and balance of payments.</P>
    <P>When individual wage discussions took place in relation to a particular industry, the Committee said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the intention to introduce a more rational and better informed approach to wage discussion should be made and to that end it is considered that the following factors are relevant to wage discussions taking place at other than national level. </P>
    <P>They then set out the following:&mdash;<Col N="1534" /> the period since the previous adjustment in wages, changes in wage rates in other occupations and industries, alteration in standard working hours, changes in other conditions of employment, incentive payments schemes, the level of wages in relation to other industries, the economic and financial position of firm or industry, the position of firm or industry in relation to exports, changes in productivity, change in the nature of work, the skill involved, the responsibility, the extent of supervision, labour costs in industry or firm in relation to other costs and the impact of change in wages on labour costs and effect on prices, availability of labour and the future prospects of industry or firm.</P>
    <P>All I have to say in relation to wage negotiations for any of the State companies over which I have supervision is that I look forward to the application of these principles in an intelligent way to future wage negotiation discussions. If the Board of CIE and the trade unions bore those kinds of considerations in mind, it would be possible for the workers of CIE to have greater chances of promotion, greater chances of employment and greater chances of employment for their families when they grow up.  Such will be the result if, as I have said, they have an intelligent and rational discussion on the future of the company as it moves forward from one year to another.  I know that the Board would agree with me in that.</P>
    <P>Therefore, anything that has been said in the Board's report in relation to the eighth round relates to the particular effect in that particular year of the eighth round.  As I have said, it is not possible for every company, private or public, to absorb the effects of the eighth round.  What is wanted is more intelligent, rational thinking and action on the whole subject.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the general question of exactly what CIE is supposed to do.  I know Deputy Dr. Browne is a confirmed Socialist and therefore I must point out that, so far as I am concerned and so far as the Government are concerned, CIE have not been appointed by the Government under this or any other Act to <Col N="1535" /> take over the private transport of the country.  From the Government's point of view there is no special virtue on national grounds in CIE taking over in the private sector of transport.  What CIE is supposed to do is to provide the very best national transport service possible and fill in the gaps where private enterprise is not adequate to take over transport services which can be more economically provided by CIE.  That is the job.  There is no suggestion that CIE, fortified with Government capital and tremendous subsidies, should gradually eat into the private sector of transport.</P>
    <P>The package deal is a perfect example of where comparisons are made between private transport and public transport.  A company carrying goods in its own lorries is asked to do some cost accountancy to find out the real cost of carrying those goods, allowing for depreciation of vehicles, wages, fuel, maintenance and so on, and having done that, CIE examine the figures to see if they can offer a contract of service for an amount lower than that applicable to the private transport used by the company.  It is perfectly obvious that is the way the transport system should be conducted partly because we believe in private enterprise and partly because the special conditions in this country, which I have already indicated, are such that in a great many cases private transport is the normal answer.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked why it was that although some 850 people had been paid redundancy compensation in one form or another on retirement, the total staff of CIE had not been reduced by more than 200.  The answer is that some services of CIE declined, those that were uneconomic, not sufficiently utilised by the public.  Other services have expanded.  Expansion has taken place in the road passenger service, the volume of which increased between 1958-59 and 1961-62 by four per cent.  That includes a very much bigger increase in connection with provincial traffic taken by itself.  The increase in volume in road freight was 68 per cent.  The increase in the carriage of livestock by road was 76 per <Col N="1536" /> cent; the increase in rail freight was five per cent.  The number of passengers carried by rail went down 13 per cent.  There was an 80 per cent. increase in the number of passengers carried on tours and there was a very considerable increase in the hotel business.</P>
    <P>The actual changes of staff can be inspected in the <i>Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i> They show that in a recent two-year period&mdash;I have not got the figures for the same period as that to which the traffic relates&mdash;there has been a reduction in the rail staff. There has been a reduction in the hotel and canal staff which would be largely related to canals.  There has been a slight reduction in relation to road passenger services; there has been an increase in the road freight service staff and there has been some increase in the higher salaried staff, largely due to the fact that in CIE there was not a proper commercial sales organisation or a modern accountancy system. These had to be installed and the whole conception of selling service had to be instituted by CIE.  Obviously CIE would have taken over those who were, in fact, found redundant if they were suitable for the new posts but in a great many cases they were people without the necessary skill.  CIE did transfer very many&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But the trade unions and the Board of CIE managed to collaborate in arranging for these redundancies in a manner which enables me to say that there has been no major complaint made to me of any kind in regard to the system.</P>
      <P>One or two Deputies suggested that the CIE service was inadequate and that I did not know what was going on in regard to it.  I can assure the House that we do receive some complaints of poor service in relation to the State companies and we receive complaints of poor service in regard to CIE.  Some of the complaints can be classified as occurring where a particular service does not suit a particular person and it would be impossible to alter that service without making someone else complain.  A great many complaints fall into that heading.  We examine all complaints and we refer them to CIE or the company concerned and, if any of them appear to be repetitive, we have formal discussions with CIE or any other company concerned.</P>
      <P>I am glad to say we do not get very many complaints and I am perfectly certain, from examining the services abroad, that CIE bus services, for example, are of a very efficient order.  I want to make it clear to Deputy Dr. Browne, when he suggested that he does not care a hang about international comparisons, that I completely disagree with him. I do not know whether, as a great admirer of the United Nations, he would like to go there as a delegate and recommend the complete abolition of all the elaborate comparative tables that are prepared there for no other purpose than to enable people to compare the services provided in relation to income in one country with another, and the general circumstances in one country with those in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a perfectly normal thing to do.  I have no apology to make when I give comparisons between this country and other countries, between the services provided here and provided elsewhere for people who have twice the income per head that we have here, and when I say that a far <Col N="1538" /> greater proportion sit going to and from work in this country than in countries where people have 60 per cent., 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. or even 100 per cent. more income than we have, as they do in Northern Europe, I am stating the absolute truth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am coming to that point.  Deputy Dr. Browne referred to some particular service going to Enniskerry.  He also suggested there should be services going up to Glencree and Deerpark.  He also mentioned Roundwood and did not know there was a private bus service going to Roundwood.  I do not want to take the Deputy too literally.  I know those areas fairly well.  I know that if you were to provide publicly-run bus services operated by CIE, under CIE trade union conditions, in an the areas of the country which correspond with that network of roads, people would be pretty tired of paying the millions and millions of pounds of deficits that would be involved by trying to run a service of that kind because the population is too thin.</P>

      <P>Even if a bus were running, it would not necessarily suit the personal needs of people living in all the houses, people working on farms, and so on.  The moment that kind of proposal is made, I look at the bus network in any county of this country and compare it with that of other countries.  I compare the bus network of this country with that, for example, of the most mountainous part of western Wales.  I cannot see that we are offering a bad service, comparatively speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Private bus services are licensed to operate and they operate very successfully in areas where CIE would find it uneconomic to do so.  Deputy Dr. Browne will no doubt be mortified to learn that the private bus service does not charge profiteering rates to the passengers because it is private and <Col N="1539" /> not public.  The passenger charges are very reasonable.  My Department license private operators of small buses &mdash;mini-buses, if you like, or any kind of bus&mdash;in areas which it is not possible for CIE to operate without enormous loss</P>
    <P>We have some 50,000 miles of public road in this country.  We have one of the largest road mileages in the world in relation to the population because of its scattered character.  A public bus service established over networks of that kind would cost a fortune in the year.  All CIE can do is to provide the best possible service under existing conditions.</P>

      <P>Another observation that was made is to the effect that the Government and I are practically creating murder on the roads by permitting CIE to close some of these railways.  I do not know whether anybody really believes it in the country but because there are so many railway hysterics around still&mdash;both here and in every other country: they exist everywhere&mdash;I might as well point out, in connection with the closing of the Portlaoise-Kilkenny, Clara-Banagher, Roscrea-Birr and Portlaoise-Mount-mellick lines, that it will require only six additional regular lorries and 12 lorries during the beet season&mdash;18, altogether, at certain times of the year but, when the beet season is not operating, just six additional lorries&mdash; and only one additional bus.</P>
      <P>The number of commercial vehicles in Kilkenny, Laois and Offaly at the moment is 2,103 and the number of private cars operating in those counties is 11,373.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the six lorries or, if you like, the 18 lorries will create murder on the roads.  It is absolutely a ludicrous suggestion that I am committing a sin by permitting these railways to close on the grounds of the extra murder which will be done.  One really must have a sense of proportion about these things.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say what the circumstances will be when the Clara-Banagher service closes but I know that the substitute lorry services for the West Clare Railway got a higher tonnage than the railway. People must have been reasonably contented if the tonnage carried went up.  The number of passengers on the substitute bus service went up, too. So far as I know, there has been no decline of any note in traffic carried by lorries&mdash;and people, therefore, must be fairly content.</P>
      <P>Another suggestion was that CIE should be subsidised to a greater extent than at present and that we should cast a blind eye on its economic worth on the ground that there had been no serious approach to roadbuilding in this country.  I must utterly disagree with that statement.  We spent I do not know what but it was over £120 million on improving the roads of this country since the war. We have the most uncongested roads of any country of Europe, without exception and, even if traffic doubles on our roads, they will still be relatively uncongested.  The only exceptions are certain areas close to cities.  We have roads so pleasant that tourists are delighted when they come here to drive on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot enter into that.  We cannot really debate on this occasion what conditions would have been if we had 6,000,000 instead of 2,800,000 people.  The fact remains that our roads are uncongested and of pretty good quality.  Again Deputy Dr. Browne may not like it, but I intend to make comparisons.  I have travelled over a great deal of Europe myself.  I have seen figures but they are not so pleasing or so significant as personal inspection and I will say that the roads of this country are very satisfactory.  Allowing for our income per head, we have done a very good <Col N="1542" /> job and they are getting better every year.  The idea that CIE should be subsidised to a greater extent because of a complete absence of planning regarding road construction is, I think, ludicrous.</P>
      <P>The question was asked why we bought expensive diesel engines to replace steam engines.  The main reason was economy and not increased speed.  They would have to be bought anyway, whether the speed of trains increased or not.  I think it is true to say that in the past year, if CIE had not made economies of various kinds and had not changed over largely to diesel engine running, the loss would have been much more like £3 million to £3½ million.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Browne referred to the Netherlands railway system.  I spent a day inspecting that system and the company partly due to war destruction adopted as their policy the kind of thing proposed in the 1958 Act.  At the end of the war, they deliberately did not open miles and miles of railway and in consequence of re-organisation, the Netherlands railway system closed 67 per cent. of stations. How they got over the railway hysteria &mdash;unless perhaps it was absent in the Netherlands because it was the end of the war when the whole railway system had to be reconstructed&mdash;I do not know.  Maybe there was not the railway hysteria there which there would be here if we closed 67 per cent. of stations quickly and got rid of them.</P>
      <P>The basis of the Netherlands railway system is that they run fast trains stopping infrequently allowing for the immense congestion of population.  Of course, when you compare the infrequent stopping, where trains run very fast and are mostly electric, you must remember that they have 872 people to the square mile compared with 104 here.  In other words, the whole Netherlands population manages to live in an area the size of Munster, plus Galway county.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>An absolute comparison is not possible.  We can make only a relative comparison and the <Col N="1543" /> closing of 67 per cent. of their stations has to be related to the number to be closed here, where there is a much less dense population.</P>
      <P>Another suggestion made was that CIE were not improving their coaches.  They have a scheme for building new coaches.  There are many new coaches and many reconstructed coaches in the service but on occasions, when there is very high super-peak traffic, they do use old coaches.  Even in countries as modern, up-to-date and streamlined as Sweden, they use older coaches, sometimes, relatively speaking, quite antique coaches, during super-peak traffic periods.  There may be some railways which use no old coaches when there is tremendous traffic in special circumstances but I very much doubt it.  The Netherlands may be one because their stock was very largely destroyed during the war. It is not an unusual thing for a railway to use older stock during super-peak periods of traffic.</P>
      <P>Another question which was asked was why the apparent average rate per ton for CIE for direct road services&mdash; it is reckoned on page 44 of the report and accounts&mdash;was lower in 1961-62 when it was ten shillings 6.2 pence than in 1960-61 when it was ten shillings 6.9 pence.  The suggestion was made, again with absolute malevolence, that it was deliberate design on the part of the board to tax the poor people of the country for the benefit of rich businessmen.  The reason for that was that CIE in the later part of the year carried an additional 400,000 tons for county councils and the additional revenue was only £62,000.  The rate was three shillings and one penny per ton because, of course, this is lowly rated traffic.  CIE have increased package deal rates, as and when rates were increased generally.  For example, all package deal rates were increased by ten per cent. in February, 1962, so there is not a plot to tax the poor people of the country by charging less and less on heavier goods for the benefit of the rich manufacturer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt very exhaustively with every question that was asked and I have covered the ground with <Col N="1544" /> the utmost detail.  I propose to speak about my responsibilities in relation to CIE and the asking of questions in the Dáil, which is at your discretion, a Cheann Comhairle, on the general Estimate for the Department.  It would be far better to make a general statement if I am asked to outline in relation to State companies, my responsibilities, those of the Government and those of the Oireachtas then rather than here in connection with this Bill.  I heartily recommend the rejection of the Bill by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak just now.  I intended to wait until we had the Estimates but seeing that the Minister is absolutely determined to support the policy of the Chairman and Board of CIE on closing the railways, I get up to say something.  They are infallible, according to the Minister.  I do not know any of these gentlemen.  I see the odd photograph in the papers now and again but I would ask the Minister how many of the board grew up with the railways.  How many of them know how railways should be run?  Is it not a fact that some of the members of the board know more about buses and trams than they do about the railway service?  I would ask the Minister to consider that.  I know they have done great work in clearing up stations and making stations presentable.  Let us give them all credit for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It shows a policy of despair on the part of CIE to close the railways in such a manner.  Think of having the railway from Mallow to Waterford closed down.  Something may be said for closing the smaller branch lines, even though they feed the main lines. However, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position in regard to the country generally.  The railways should be regarded for the present as a social service, pending the implementation of a policy of full employment.  The Minister has spoken about there being no people to travel on the railways. That is so because of a dwindling population.  But surely we do not expect that position to continue?  Do we not expect that, with the introduction of industry, the rural population will increase?  No matter what the Minister <Col N="1545" /> says subsidies are being given to various things and I do not see why we should not continue this subsidy for the railways.  Let it be used to lower fares and freight rates and thus attract more passengers and more business.</P>
    <P>Before CIE took over the canals, I understand the canals were able to pay a small dividend, but immediately they were taken over they lost money year after year.  Did it ever strike the Minister that the gentlemen out looking for business might have attracted business from the canals on to the roads?  It would be no harm if the Minister made inquiries in that regard. When CIE took over the buses here in Dublin, they made so much money in the first two years that they thought that was the service that would pay. Their idea was to get rid of the railways and get the traffic on the roads. Does the Minister not realise that it would take from 50 to 100 years before our roads would be suitable for such traffic if we closed our railways?  Does he not realise the cost?  CIE will not be paying for it, but the general taxpayer will be paying for it.  It is immaterial to CIE.  Their only concern is to make their services pay before 1964.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another talk with the chairman and members of the board.  As I said, I do not know any of them personally.  They may be the best in the world, but I do not agree that their policy of closing the railways is a good one.  Millions have been invested in the railways. Even though railways are closed, the lines should not be torn up, as was done in the case of the Waterford-Tramore railway.  If these railways are ever required again, they will have to be rebuilt.  It would not cost much to leave them and keep them in repair. We look forward to an improvement in our economic position and an increase in population.  We look forward to full employment.  When that comes, the railways will be even more useful than lorries or buses.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of statistics have been quoted by the Minister.  We should ask ourselves the question: <Col N="1546" />&ldquo;Who is losing employment in CIE?&rdquo; Is it not the ordinary worker, the small man, the man who cannot detend himself, the man who is rearing a large family?  That is a very bad policy for anyone to introduce.  Is it not possible to modernise the railways?</P>
    <P>When speaking on this matter previously, I mentioned that the buses and trains were running in competition. The Minister told me I was exaggerating.  Let us take a timetable and we see on it that there are buses from Dublin to Galway, Limerick, Cork, Waterford and Wexford.  At the same time, you have trains going to those places.  Why not integrate the services by using buses to bring passengers to the railways?  I am sure the gentlemen in Kingsbridge, who are wonder workers in the eyes of the Minister, would consider some such proposal instead of tearing up the railways.</P>
    <P>I remember, as a member of Dublin Corporation, going on a deputation to the predecessor of the present chairman of CIE.  My impression of some of the gentlemen I met there was very poor.  When we looked for a weekly ticket for workmen in the areas to which we had to send people out to be housed&mdash;areas such as Finglas and Ballyfermot &mdash; the then chairman of CIE said: &ldquo;Ah, how do we know whether they are work people or not? They may be going in to Mass to the city of Dublin.&rdquo;  What can you expect when you get an answer like that? Has there been any move by CIE to provide a ferry service for heavy lorries on the railway lines in the same way as people travelling by sea now run their cars on and off the deck? Has anything like that been suggested? Apparently there has been no suggestion of modernisation at all. The policy seems to be to tear everying up.  The railways cost millions. The policy is to tear those millions up and substitute a service giving less employment, but a service which will make more money, without advertence to the toll on the roads, without considering that it will be anything up to 100 years before our roads will be <Col N="1547" /> suitable to take this increased volume of heavy traffic.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider the position.  He has given facts and figures in answer to other Deputies. Figures! One can prove black is white by statistics.  I say that will not do. We must be human in our approach. We must come down to matters of fact.  Deputy O'Connor in the Minister's Party made, I thought, the best speech I have heard on this matter. To paraphrase, he said: &ldquo;Let us come together; let us see what we can do with what we have; let us hold the railways, if we can, rather than tear them up.&rdquo;  That is what I, too, suggest the Minister should do.  Judging by what he has said this evening, he intends to agree all along the line with CIE in their policy with regard to the railways: tear them up.  In a very short time, we will have nothing left of our railway system except what is left in the Beddy Report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not mention it if I had not read it.  I did not interrupt the Minister.  I heard the Minister say that the substitute bus service from Waterford to Tramore was better than the railway service because the buses brought the people down to the shore.  That is not the fact.  The buses bring the people to the Railway Square.  I do not talk about what I do not know, but the Minister did in that particular reference.  What I have to say I am saying in the national interest.  I do not represent a constituency in which there are railways.  I have no axe to grind.  I have nobody belonging to me working on the railways. I speak in the national interest and I should like the Minister to remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said railways are out of date.  He compared this country, with its 2,800,000 population, with countries like France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  These comparisons are useless.  We should work for ourselves in the national interest, in the interest of our people.  The only people who will suffer by the closing of the railways are the ordinary workers <Col N="1548" /> whose numbers will be reduced.  That will not be in the interests of the country.  That might eventually be the cause of people looking forward to another system, a despicable system to some of us.  We do not want anything like that to happen.  We want the ordinary worker to be treated in the same way as the highest.  I think the Minister knows what I mean.  I need not explain further.</P>
    <P>It is true that some of the railways are not paying.  They are not paying because the country is denuded of population through emigration.  There is emigration because we cannot supply work for our people.  But is there any real reason why the railways should be torn up and sold for scrap?  Why not leave them until such time as our population increases and things improve? We will then have people to travel by rail and goods to transport by rail.</P>
    <P>We have failed lamentably to decentralise industry.  There has been no comprehensive scheme&mdash;rather has it been a haphazard one.  The country should be considered as a unit and those who want to establish industries here, with the aid of grant and subsidy from the State, should be told where to site those industries.  At the moment they can start where they like. That is not in the interests of the rural areas.  There is no rationalisation of industry.  In a small town, in which I worked for years, there was just one industry, employing some 35 people.  It was a flour milling industry.  It is now being closed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps not.  I merely mention it to show that there is no comprehensive decentralisation of industry. I give it as an example.  If there were decentralisation, the position in the rural areas would be different. If people are not willing to site industries in these areas, then the responsible Government Department should do so, put a representative in it, and hand it over to private enterprise to run.  If necessary, the operatives could be sent away to be trained outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite understand the position of <Col N="1549" /> the railways.  I quite understand our low population.  I quite realise that there are buses and cars on the roads. I quite realise that cars are coming on to the roads in ever-increasing numbers. I quite understand that there is a difficulty in getting passenger and goods traffic for the railways.  Surely if a subsidy were given in order to lower fares and reduce freight charges, that would provide an incentive to people to use the railways?  I suggest the Minister ought to consider that.</P>
    <P>With regard to safety on the roads, I cannot understand the Minister's remarks at all.  Our roads are not suitable at the moment for heavy traffic.  Consider the cost of making the roads suitable.  Yet CIE are tearing up the railway lines, railway lines which could be used to ferry heavy lorries from one place to another.  In that way, a lorry going to the Midlands could entrain at Kingsbridge and be ferried to the nearest railway station to its ultimate destination.  It would then have to travel a distance of, perhaps, only ten or 15 miles as against tearing up the road from Dublin right down to the Midlands, making the maintenance of the roads so much more costly.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the extraordinary position of two Local Government Acts, the Labourers Act and the Housing of the Working Classes Act and the very unfair position in which a large number of <Col N="1550" /> people in urban areas in my constituency would find themselves and the very grave injustice that would be caused to a large number of tenants who are the happy possessors of houses in the environment of Cork, if this outrageous proposal to extend the borough boundary is carried out. I appeal to the Minister to bring in amending legislation to prevent that anomaly between these two purchase Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely draw attention to the injustice that is being done.  In Cobh, we have two bodies of tenants, all of whom are working at the one job, in Irish Steel.  One body of tenants is on one side of the road.  They can purchase their houses under the county council and on purchase get a reduction of 2/- a week.  Across the road there is another body of tenants, in the same type of house and paying the same rent as the county council tenants pay before purchase, but who, if they purchase their houses, will have their rents increased to 32/- a week. As I pointed out, if all the houses which are the property of the urban council of Cobh are purchased, the State would gain £1,800 a year.  That would be regarded a considerable grant to any urban area by the Department of Local Government. This is holding up what has been set up as the ideal, that every man should own his own house.  It is preventing that, and, in many cases, preventing it injustly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Owing to the fact that as this country, thank God, is rapidly becoming industrialised, we have the position that practically throughout all my constituency people have to travel 12, 15 and in some cases 30 miles to work and I suggest that the Minister should issue instructions to the managers in Cork County that he is prepared to sanction, and pay the subsidy for houses built for people, who, no matter in what class of house they live at present, are too far from their place of employment.  In Mallow today, buses have to be sent 16 to 25 miles <Col N="1551" /> to collect workers working in the Mallow sugar factory.  A large number of those workers are losing overtime to which they would be entitled because they are not living a reasonable distance from their work.</P>
    <P>It is high time that in all those areas the local authorities purchased land for house development.  I do not know whether they have compulsory powers to do that but I would urge that they should be given compulsory powers. They should build their own houses on that land and where they find people are prepared to build their own houses, they should be able to rent the sites for these houses.  That is now essential, when there are a large number of workers pouring in from all directions and rapidly creating slums in rural towns and villages.  That is a state of affairs which the Minister is anxious to eliminate as quickly as possible and I suggest that is the one way in which he can eliminate it. Those people find it impossible to get sites to build their own houses convenient to a town or village.</P>
    <P>We heard complaints about the difficulty of getting contractors to build local authority houses.  I suggest that is largely due to the fact that it is very difficult for the contractor to collect his money.  I have come across contractors who, three years after the houses were finished and the tenants were in possession of them, were still looking for the balance of their money. I do not agree that there should be a hold-up in housing in that respect.  In Cork, we found, when we had difficulty in getting contractors, that as soon as we brought in a direct labour scheme under which the houses were built by the local authorities, there were plenty of contractors seeking the contracts.  If there were a direct labour team in every county for that kind of job, we would get over any kind of hold-up.</P>
    <P>Where housing is not being provided satisfactorily, it is due, in 90 per cent. of cases, to the local authorities shelving the matter.  In Cork, we cannot afford to shelve the matter.  In the town of Cobh, there are some 2,500 people <Col N="1552" /> in constant employment with Irish Steel and Rushbrooke Dockyard.  In those circumstances, we could not afford to neglect housing.  If there were neglect in this matter, the town would be turned into a slum land where single rooms would be let at weekly rents of 35/- to £2.  It is essential that sufficient houses be provided.</P>
    <P>I would further suggest to the Minister that there should be less interference with the local authority.  In 90 cases out of 100, the manager is sufficiently strict in regard to building houses which qualify for a subsidy and there is no reason whatever for withholding sanction, on the ground that some person should not get a subsidy because he is living in a house that could be repaired.  I know thousands of persons living in houses that could be repaired but the question is who will repair them.  The landlords are not prepared to carry out even essential repairs.  The tenants have to remain in the houses just because some official of the Department says that the houses are capable of repair.</P>
    <P>In regard to water supply, I would urge the Minister to expedite sanction in the case of the urban area of Mallow.  Forty houses were built there by the county council in the belief that water would be supplied by the urban council.  The tenants are paying serviced house rents but they have no water.  A similar position obtains in Kanturk where people have been paying for serviced houses for 25 years and have not got the service.  Now, when the local authority is considering supplying them with the service, it wants tenants to pay again for the service.  There are too many anomalies in regard to housing and water supply. There is one firm in my constituency, in Whitegate, which has a special bus to and from Cork every day taking people to and from work.  I suppose we will be asked later on to agree to the extension of the borough boundary to Whitegate.</P>
    <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the position of Drommahane in the vicinity of Mallow and request him to take steps to get the North Cork Board of Health or the Housing and Sanitary Services Committee <Col N="1553" /> to take action there in regard to housing.  The Irish Sugar Company has buses travelling up to 20 miles around the country collecting labour that should be living within half a mile of their factory.  The provision of houses within half a mile of the factory is vitally essential.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion about increasing rates.  As the largest ratepaying member of the Cork County Council, I consider that the question of rates should not prevent housing development.  I should like to thank the Minister for the general reduction of rates in agricultural land. I know it is only a first step.  Deputy McQuillan spoke here this evening about the Common Market.  He should realise that our competitors in Britain and Northern Ireland pay no rates on agricultural land.  In this country, the subsidies have to go to meet Common Market conditions.  The only way to put our people in a position of equality <i>vis-á-vis</i> farmers in England and Northern Ireland in the concept of the Common Market is to remove rates on agricultural land.  I think our Government have grasped that fact and that the first step was taken this year.  I hope to see it followed up until we reach the position that we will be able to compete on equal terms with farmers in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>With regard to regional water schemes, I have only one complaint. In a large number of cases, a water supply could be obtained much more cheaply if an attempt were made to find water locally.  For instance, in Crossnaloch, a mile above Blarney, where there are 14 labourers' cottages along one road, there were three pumps, two of which used to go dry every summer and from one of which there was a never failing supply. There was a scheme to bring a water supply from Glenville, nine miles away.  Why should water be piped nine miles to supply 14 people when a supply could be found locally?  It was admitted by the engineers that there would be no trouble in making a supply available out of the water in the third pump.  I should like the matter investigated.</P>
    <P>In regard to Castlemagner, I was <Col N="1554" /> informed that there is only a local pump there in a pretty big village. When I inquired of the manager as to the position, I was told that the regional scheme would reach this village in six years' time.  That may be a very short time in the eyes of the Department or some of the managers, but it is the dickens of a long time for the man drawing water.  Surely, there should be some speedier way of supplying water to these villages than to tell them : &ldquo;Wait for six years and you will get it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for his action in regard to rates and to thank him also for the manner in which he is expediting housing in Cork county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We have made great progress since the War years in our housing programme but there is still a tremendous amount of progress to be made.  Leitrim County Council got a request from the Minister some time ago to carry out a survey of the housing problems of the county.  The result of that survey reveals some rather interesting figures.  It was carried out in a very comprehensive way.  Of 3,842 houses inspected, 965 were found not to be fit for human habitation, despite the fact that they were occupied.  It was also found that the 965 houses could not economically be reconstructed or put into any reasonable condition at a justifiable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we examine this figure of 965, we find that 296 houses were each occupied by one person; 265 were each occupied by two persons; 165 were each occupied by three persons, and 239 were occupied by four or more persons each.  It dawned on me when I saw the result of the survey that it is a pity the Minister would not give a substantial grant for building, say, a small type of two-roomed house or a house with a room and a small kitchen that would be quite suitable to serve the needs of the people who are now living singly in those houses.  The survey also revealed that 75 per cent. of the total were people who were living on holdings of under £10 valuation or had an income of less than £6 per week.  Those people could not possibly <Col N="1555" /> build any type of house with the grants that are being offered today.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on the general scheme of building and reconstruction.  He has got rid of the waiting list that existed some year and a half ago.  When a man reconstructs his house and asks an inspector to call, he comes now within a reasonably short period.  If the progress that has been made over the past 18 months is kept up, we will find that delays will be entirely eliminated.</P>
    <P>I have found on a few occasions that inspectors call on applicants for grants for building or reconstruction and convey to them that they will get the grant or payment within the next fortnight, and then within the fortnight they get a letter from the Department pointing out that there were some minor defects in the house such as a faulty septic tank, or that they used 1½ inch or 1¼ inch instead of two inch timber on the doors or that there was dampness under the windows.  It would be much better if the inspectors discussed those matters there and then with the applicant, instead of conveying to him that everything is all right, and subsequently notifying him that he will have to have these defects remedied before he qualifies for a grant.</P>
    <P>I do not say that is a usual occurrence&mdash;I do not want to be misunderstood&mdash;but it has happened on a few occasions, or it was happening up to the past few months.  It also happened that when one defect was remedied another inspector came along &mdash; usually it would not be the same man&mdash;and he found something else wrong.  Ultimately it meant holding up the application.  If the Minister would consider leaving one inspector to a particular area, it would eliminate a certain amount of red tape, if I may use the expression.</P>
    <P>I found a most interesting point recently on the supplementary grants paid by county councils.  Some Deputies referred to it here today and felt that the figure should have gone up to £1,000.  A particular person applied for a supplementary grant. His income was £793 per year and he had five children.  He worked for the <Col N="1556" /> Department of Education and got an allowance of £28 for each child which brought him in another £140.  His total income was £933.  If that man were not married and had no children, he would qualify for a supplementary grant but for the simple reason that the Department of Education were paying him £28 per child he is now being victimised by the local authority in that he cannot qualify for a grant. I should like the Minister in his wisdom to look into that point.  If a man qualifies for children's allowance on his salary, it is unfair to victimise him in other respects.  If he is being victimised, the scheme is not serving the purpose it is intended to serve.</P>
    <P>I heard various figures mentioned today about the cost of housing in Meath and Cork but I have had experience of a four-roomed house being built inside the past three weeks or month in my constituency at a cost of £1,880.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Four bed-roomed or four-roomed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Four roomed.  The grant which an applicant would receive is £550 and that means he would have to find another £1,330.  There are various ways in which he could find it. He could probably borrow it from the county council under the small dwellings loans scheme but I think with the way the prices of materials have been moving for the past few years, and the price of labour, it is time the Minister looked into the possibility of increasing these grants. In my constituency, the policy in regard to road making that seems to have been adopted is to make the good road better.  You often find that a certain amount of money is allocated for a tarred road and the day the job starts, there are bulldozers, loading shovels and a fleet of county council lorries.  If there are not enough in the county council fleet, they employ the CIE lorries, for the sole purpose of making the good road better.  I have often wondered what a man living on one of our by-roads thinks when he passes by one of these jobs and sees this procedure, probably after he has travelled two or three miles of a bad <Col N="1557" /> by-road with pot holes.  I am sure he must think the county council and the Department of Local Government have gone stark raving mad.</P>
      <P>The by-roads particularly in my constituency are in a desperate condition for the want of repairs.  The county council did transfer all the money it could this year into our by-roads but still there is no great improvement there.  We do not seem to be getting very far in repairing our by-roads. In answer to a Parliamentary Question recently the Minister stated that County Roscommon has only 18.8 per cent.  dust-free roads, and there is the same percentage in County Leitrim.  This compares with 23.6 per cent. in County Donegal and 98.4 per cent. dust-free roads in Dublin.  It is quite clear from these figures that we have a grievance. Somebody may say it is a local grievance but I would ask the Minister, in his generosity, when allocating grants, to keep County Leitrim in mind.  It receives less income from rates than any other county in the country. A penny in the £ in Leitrim yields only £600 whereas in a neighbouring county a penny in the £ yields £1,200 and in another neighbouring county, £1,300.  For that reason alone, I think we are entitled to special treatment.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to consider restoring the LAW schemes. Various speakers here have referred to their advantages, that they served a great purpose as regards drainage.  In the Roscommon constituency, particularly, there seems to be no sign whatever of getting arterial drainage executed. If we had schemes such as the LAW schemes and if the Minister in his wisdom decided to allocate to us a certain amount of money each year, it would be well spent.  It would give a certain amount of employment within the county, which is very badly needed. I do not want to make a political harangue out of this but would appeal to the Minister to consider the restoration of the LAW schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to water supplies, Deputies referred to the group schemes.  The Minister's Department or the county council will have to make up their minds to sell the group scheme.  It is very hard to get a number of people <Col N="1558" /> to agree among themselves about something.  They need some direction and we would then find the scheme would ultimately work out cheaper and more satisfactory than the rural scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a problem which applies to other counties but which applies particularly to County Leitrim, that there are areas to which, due to the hills, the rural water scheme could never be extended.  The only other means of giving these people a water supply is to have a pump erected.  I would ask the Minister to consider making grants available for the erection of pumps where it is not feasible or economic to initiate a scheme.</P>
    <P>As in most other counties, the ratepayers in my county believe they are over-burdened with rates, with which we all agree.  No later than last Friday, the farmers of the county had a meeting at which they asked the local authority not to adopt a rural water scheme, the reason being that they believed it would increase the rates. These farmers were prepared to do without the service of water for the sake of keeping the rates within bounds.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank the Minister and the officials of his Department for the courtesy they have extended to me since I became a member of this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It was heartening to learn from the Minister that private building is on the increase.  It would increase a good deal more if there were an arrangement whereby a person could build a four or five-roomed house and repay the loan at the same rate as that paid by a person who owns a county council cottage.  The person who borrows a sum of money to build his own house may find that he has to pay 27/- a week, while his neighbour who may be lucky enough to get a council house, having waited for a very long time, may be paying from 15/- to £1 per week.  If an improvement could be made in that situation I am sure more people would build their own houses instead of having to go in to live with their parents or with their neighbours until such time as the county council build <Col N="1559" /> a house for them.  More and more people are now looking for houses with full amenities and it is good to see that only fully-serviced houses will be given grants in future.  Of course this will mean that the cost of these houses will go up and that naturally the repayments will be higher.</P>
      <P>One aspect of council housing programmes to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the time lag between the date on which a person gets approval for a house and the date on which he gets the house. Sometimes five years go by from the time the application is approved to the date on which the house is allocated. During that time, many applicants get tired waiting and housing authorities find that out of their original list of approved applicants, only about 50 per cent.  remain, the other half having gone away or found some other accommodation in the meantime.  In such cases it means another survey must be made by the council of people requiring houses in the area.  I suggest that from one year to one and a half years would be adequate time to allow a council between the time a scheme is approved and the allocation of the houses.</P>
      <P>I feel there should be some proviso in the contract whereby the contractor will be compelled to complete each house within a period of three or four months from the date of starting. As far as groups of these houses are concerned, contractors can now finish the houses literally when they like. There is a time limit of one year in the contract but that can be extended indefinitely.  I have complaints of these delays from people in such places as Tyrrellspass, Killucan and elsewhere. The people in these areas feel they have been neglected.  They cannot be expected to make efforts on their own to build houses while their applications for council houses are under consideration and, in many cases, approved.  Because of these delays, sometimes people have barely left their old houses when they collapse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of one case in which a man was waiting for a council house when his old house collapsed.  He was fortunate enough to be working for a <Col N="1560" /> man who gave him a house temporarily but he recently changed his employment and the owner of the house requires it.  During the time he occupied that house as a temporary convenience, the house he had applied for from the council was re-allocated because the council, finding him living in a good house, rejected his original application.  All these hardships make it imperative that delays in the building and allocation of houses should be eliminated as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister say that he intends to increase the grants for main road repairs from 40 to 50 per cent. this year.  The necessity for county councils to contribute so heavily for main road repairs has always been a bone of contention because councils feel that, in cases where main roads need repair and maintenance, the State should pay a higher proportionate contribution because these roads are largely used by traffic of a national character. This particularly applies to County Kildare through which pass the main arterial roads between Dublin and Galway, Dublin and Cork and Dublin and Limerick.  It means these roads must be kept in a high state of repair. This is a very costly matter and the increase of ten per cent. in State allocations for that work will be very welcome.</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn from the Minister's speech that local authorities are to be encouraged to provide facilities for water safety.  During the summer months, far too many tragedies occur through lack of knowledge of swimming and the best place in which water safety can be taught is in a swimming pool.  The more of these that are provided throughout the country the fewer deaths there will be from drowning.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the need to provide caravan sites equipped with necessary amenities.  There has been a growing need for the provision of caravan sites equipped with water and sewerage amenities.  Caravans are becoming increasingly popular; more and more people are anxious to rent caravans for touring holidays. Developed caravan sites would be a <Col N="1561" /> great boost to the tourist industry. They are very popular in other countries, particularly in England.</P>
    <P>An innovation has been introduced into County Meath.  I am glad to see that the Minister is giving a subsidy towards the provision of car parks in the vicinity of churches.  At least 80 per cent. of the churches in my constituency are very badly served from the point of view of such parking facilities.  At Mass on Sunday or attending a funeral, one finds the roads quite often obstructed.  This is particularly so in the case of funerals. Car parks near churches are badly needed and I thank the Minister for his initiative in this respect.  What one council does today, another council will do tomorrow.</P>
    <P>I very much welcome the grants for the clearing away of derelict sites.  In this respect, I should refer to the stimulating effect on towns of the Tidy Towns competition.  It is literally amazing the amount of good this competition has done.  It has focussed attention on the derelict sites throughout our country.  It has encouraged the private individual to apply for grants and also the county councils. There is nothing so ugly in a town as disused weed-covered sites.</P>
    <P>With regard to the roads, I should like the Minister to encourage the local authorities to take over all the laneways leading up to people's houses.  In some cases, people have to travel a distance of half a mile or even a mile over very bad roads or laneways, as they are commonly called in the country, before they come to the better thoroughfare.  This is a great hardship in wet weather, when the laneways are waterlogged and full of puddles.  We all like to have a decent road leading from our houses.  You cannot expect a group of people to come together and keep those laneways in as good a condition as the public roads are kept and it would be appreciated if something could be done whereby the county councils would take over these roads.  In my own county, Meath, they have done so, but I should like to see the councils in County Kildare and County Westmeath doing the same.</P>
    <P>In regard to the dangers associated with the roads, I should like to have <Col N="1562" /> more &ldquo;Yield right of Way&rdquo; signs erected at all our crossroads.  I know of places, particularly in County Westmeath, where the Guards suggested signs should be erected but the council seemed reluctant or very slow to erect them.  I should like the Minister to encourage the council to put up all the signs which the Guards recommend.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention other hazards to road users.  When driving, at night, it is very hard to pick out a person walking on the road.  That applies also to people cycling without reflectors.  Perhaps some of the officials of the Minister's Department might consult with industry with a view to evolving some luminous device which, incorporated in clothing, would have the effect of pinpointing those walking on the roads.  Such a device would eliminate quite a number of accidents.  One encounters the same difficulties in dark city streets.  Very often, too, the footpaths are not as well lighted as the centre of the roads. Consequently, when you are driving on dimmed lights, it is extremely difficult to see pedestrians or cyclists.</P>
    <P>I have received nothing but courtesy from the Minister's officials during the past year.  I have been in communication with them quite often and I have always found them extremely helpful.  I very much appreciate the courtesy they have shown me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickTierney" hpid="Mr. Tierney Mr. Tierney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tierney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put a few points before the Minister about which we are concerned in North Tipperary.  In North Tipperary, we are between the devil and the deep sea, as far as the Minister for Local Government is concerned.  On the one hand, the Minister advocates a regional water supply for all of North Tipperary, while on the other, there is advocacy of group supply schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We debated this very fully at the county council and we find that a regional water scheme to give every householder a supply will cost almost £1 million.  While we are debating that in the particular councils concerned, the Minister's inspectors are going around helping the people who are trying to get away from the high cost of regional water supplies and <Col N="1563" /> trying to do it by the cheaper method of a group scheme.  Would the Minister tell us on what side of the ditch he is standing&mdash;whether he is in favour of the group scheme or the regional scheme?  That would not only help our two county councils but county councils all over Ireland.  Perhaps, the Minister would answer a few questions regarding group water supply schemes now sponsored by his Department.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of North Tipperary, we have at least seven group schemes almost completed.  I know people who have put down £40, £60 or £70 for the group supply scheme and I think that amount of money is small for the service they will get.  Then we have the Minister forcing the county managers to adopt, by fair or unfair methods, or to induce the various councils to adopt, the regional schemes.  I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me if a group of people in the parish of Kilbarron or Ballina have already paid a substantial deposit towards a group water scheme and if a majority of the county council in the same area decide, in six or eight months, to impose the regional scheme on the people, is there any provision in the Minister's scheme to refund the amount of money paid by these people who are now sponsoring the group scheme?</P>
    <P>At a meeting in North Tipperary only yesterday, our county manager stated that as far as could be understood, no refund could be made to any group of people who, through the Minister's kindness and help possibly, have undertaken and perhaps finished or fostered a group supply scheme. People who have paid £50, £60 or £70 for the group scheme will find themselves paying almost for ever afterwards the cost of the regional scheme for the remainder of the country.  The only way we could find in North Tipperary in which we could relieve the people involved in group schemes was not an abatement of what they paid or repayment of what they paid, but the allowing of a small amount off the water rent.  If the water rent, as we are told, will cost a cottier or small farmer less than £3 a year and if the people who have now invested in a <Col N="1564" /> group scheme must wait until their money is paid back on a rebate of £3 per year, it is their children who will benefit.</P>
    <P>We are in a very awkward position in North Tipperary.  We are told that if we do not have a regional water supply scheme, we could possibly hold up one of the most progressive factories to be started by Major General Costello.  I want to be quite clear about this, and I want it on the records of the House, that I regard Major General Costello as one of the most enterprising, most industrious and one of the best brains in the country and I, among other members of the council, do not want to be in the position of voting against a regional water supply scheme and being told we are casting a vote against having a factory started by him in the Thurles area.  Much of that responsibility can be cast on the Minister.</P>
    <P>If the Minister would make up his mind and tell the people that he will encourage either regional supply schemes or group supply schemes, it would be of great help.  He has inspectors going around under the group supply scheme giving lectures and valuable assistance by their expert knowledge and behind them he has the county managers' association with the managers and the county councils working for regional supply schemes.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter because in Tipperary many group schemes have already started.  The people are in a dilemma.  There may be no refund of the money they have paid and those who have already contributed to the group schemes may have to pay for both.  Our county manager always maintains that anything inside the fence is not his responsibility.  In running a drain beside the road, he never takes responsibility for extending it into a man's property because he maintains&mdash;perhaps rightly; I do not know&mdash;that he would be responsible for maintenance afterwards, if he did. If we carry out group water schemes in the cheapest way possible, that is, by running the pipes not beside the road, but across John Nolan's field into John Burke's field or to the nearest point to the nearest house, the <Col N="1565" /> county council, when they take over with the regional water scheme, will not accept responsibility for the group scheme in that area when it has not been done under the supervision and inspection of their county engineer.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, if possible, to make it clear that where these group water schemes are already almost complete and where they do cross fields, as they do, the county council responsible should bear that in mind and that when they take over, with a regional water scheme, they will be responsible for the group water scheme, even though it goes through another man's property.</P>
    <P>I have a small complaint in regard to the repair of vested cottages in cases where tenants who are not satisfied with the repairs appeal to the Minister against the county council's decision.  Only very seldom do I find that the tenant is very well treated.  I know there are some tenants who would be dissatisfied, no matter what was done, but I have seen a few jobs done by the county council with which the tenants were not satisfied.  They appealed to the Minister, who sent down an inspector and, although the inspector passed the work as perfect, I found the tenants had plenty of cause to grumble.  These cottages are still there for any inspector from the Minister's Department to see.  I should like the Minister to tighten up his regulations in that respect and give a little more consideration to the people who complain.</P>
    <P>I find that there is a delay of some two or three months between the completion of a house and the final inspection. Sometimes there is a similar delay, after the walls are built, before the first inspection.  I am not reflecting on the inspectors working in North Tipperary because they are not confined to North Tipperary&mdash;I think we have two inspectors looking after three or four counties.  As other speakers said, all due praise to the Minister for the great progress made in housing, but I do not think that two inspectors are nearly enough.</P>
    <P>When a person is doing a reconstruction job or a new building job, he cannot afford to wait five or six <Col N="1566" /> months before he pays the contractor because the contractor is usually waiting on the doorstep for payment when the job is finished.  I would ask the Minister to try to speed up the inspection of cottages as much as possible. In saying that, I do not want to cast any reflection on the officials in the Custom House.  I find them very courteous and good people.  They are doing the best they can but I think they are overworked.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to make a statement, if not now, then to the county managers, regarding the group scheme and the regional water scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that perhaps the importance of this Estimate is minimised by the fact that the actual cash figure in the Book of Estimates relates largely to the funding of loans, and access to the Local Loans Fund means that perhaps certainly more than ten times the amount of money voted here to-night is devoted to local government.  I saw some figures recently which gave £65 million as the total expenditure, from rates, from central exchequer and from the local loans fund, on local government.  That would be, in fact, approximately £23 per person in the State or 10 per cent. of the gross national product.  That represents a colossal figure.  It makes this Vote a Vote for one of the major ministries.  It is one in which a great deal of detail comes into play.  It is one in which there is very little simplicity. It is one in which there is perhaps also very little opportunity for political generalisations and arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true also that, each year as this Vote comes before us, if one were to analyse the total sum spent from the Local Loans Fund, from central exchequer and from contributions through rates, one would find that the sum is increasing annually by a colossal figure and that there is a heavier load each year on the ratepayers. That was recognised by the Government this year when they gave a remission of rates to the farmers. That remission is necessary but it did not remove all the load.  It would not have been given, if it had not been <Col N="1567" /> necessary, the position being that, even with that remission, there is still a constantly increasing burden on rates at the same time as we have not got an increasing agricultural income.</P>
    <P>That is a situation which, I think, will eventually burst.  I think that, over the years, a situation will develop whereby we shall have to move more of the expenditure on local government from rates on to the central exchequer. In other words, we shall have to pay for our local government expenditure by having something more on our bottle of stout or something more on our packet of cigarettes or something more on all our other taxes, direct or indirect, rather than something extra on our rates.</P>
    <P>Only one in five people pay rates themselves.  Therefore, when you get this colossal and growing increase, you find that the load bears heavily on a few.  As we all have our ups and downs in business, farming, and so on, very often the few carry an inordinate load for the many.  It is something to think of that in the future you may find that either you will have to slow up your expenditure on local government or transfer more from the central exchequer.  It was mentioned that there was some increase&mdash;ten per cent. in respect of certain roads.  That is a trend: I believe it will continue.  It is quite a crushing burden on rates as it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>Housing is perhaps one of the most interesting facets of local government and also one of the things most necessary.  There are constant delays in relation to housing.  It is natural that there should be.  However, it is also, I think, wise that we should&mdash; I say this in an entirely non-political way&mdash;accept the fact that there are delays in housing based on the amount of money available for it.  At column 1279 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 14th November, 1962, the Minister referred to the volume of private housing and the volume of housing by local authority activity.  At that column, he is reported as saying:</P>
    <P>This tendency is to be welcomed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" />&mdash;&mdash;this expansion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I would also welcome a further increase in the output of local authorities. </P>
    <P>This reminds me of a time when I was a great deal more innocent than I am now and when I put down a Question to the Minister for Local Government of our time asking about the delays in relation to the granting of permission to proceed with local authority housing in all the years Fianna Fáil were in office.  I think the then Minister would very much have liked to have met me before Question Time to get me to withdraw the Question. You can look back over five or six years and you will find the answer that there was a delay of only 48 hours.</P>
    <P>The real answer is that the plans go up to the Department and it is found that the windows are half an inch too wide.  The plans are returned and when they are again sent to the Department, it is found that the doors are half an inch too narrow, and so on.  That sort of thing may continue until Finance or the Local Loans Fund can give its allocation.  It reaches its place at the top of the queue, and back it goes&mdash;the county manager or the city manager, or whoever it may be, knowing, as he sends up the file and plans, that they will come straight back, sanctioned.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that no Department of Local Government could approve of plans in 48 hours.  I freely concede that in our day the situation was the same.  It is nothing but a political facade to produce this situation: &ldquo;We want you to build more houses&rdquo;, and so on.  It is all a question of what money is available; I freely admit that, no matter what Party are in office.  It would be a lot wiser if the Minister would approach it from that point of view.</P>
    <P>A rather disquieting decision was the decision to change the rate of subsidy in respect of rural cottages.  As I understand it, up to some time ago, the position was that all farm labourers being housed under the 1936 Act enjoyed the higher rate subsidy. Now, the position is that they vary, <Col N="1569" /> based again on where they come from. I think that decision was a mistake. While it is true that, in the first years, under the 1936 Act, you would not even rehouse in a labourer's cottage a blacksmith, or an artisan, in following years the situation was loosened up and you did rehouse these people and they have perhaps better wages than the farm worker.  At the same time, it is a bad trend because the wage level in country areas is considerably lower than that obtaining in urban areas.  That decision, in my view, was a mistake on the part of the Government, the Minister and, to whatever extent they were involved, the Department.</P>
    <P>Again, the question of subsidy on houses is very vexed.  I think you will also reach the stage where you will have to change your system whereby you give 66? subsidy on the loan and repayment charges to a local authority to rehouse somebody who comes from an overcrowded house, from a house in respect of which there is a Demolition Order, from a house where, unfortunately, there is tuberculosis, and so on, while, at the same time, you give a subsidy of only 33? per cent. in respect of somebody who comes from somewhere else.  You could understand that a person might come from a condemned house and walk into a new house; he could have five sons working and have £50 or £60 coming into the house each week. At the same time, a person coming from rather better housing conditions could be on unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance or even on home assistance.</P>
    <P>The case could be made by the Minister or by the Department: why not pool all the subsidies and put all on the same rent or introduce a differential rent system?  But the fact is that local authorities usually pass on direct individual subsidies as they come.  That was possible in the first years because the difference was very little.  I am thinking of Pearse Park in Drogheda where the difference was 1/11 or 2/-.  That was big enough in those days, 20 or 30 years ago, but it was not all that big.  The difference is now colossal, forcing local authorities <Col N="1570" /> to take up differential renting or pool the subsidies.  At the same time, we hope that with the ending of the pressure to rehouse people from slum dwellings, it should be possible to look into the whole question of subsidies. Perhaps it could be done on the basis of the income of the applicant, even on the basis of a changing income. That may or may not be so but I am not convinced that the present method is the best one.</P>
    <P>One thing is happening, that is, that I have not the slightest doubt that it is becoming as cheap to build your own house under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, if there is any supplemental grant from the local authority as it is to go into a Housing of the Working Classes Act house. Under the Housing of the Working Classes Act, people generally have to wait four or five years.  If you can get a site it is easier to build your own house.  We had a meeting the other night at Dunleer and we were discussing the Small Dwellings Act houses, and rents and repayments were discussed. These were people who had built five-roomed houses with water, sewerage and bathroom.  There was a man who had built a house five years ago with bathroom and all the rest and he was paying 29/- a week, and there were people who had just gone into Housing of the Working Classes Act semi-detached houses, with three bedrooms, water and sewerage who were paying&mdash;though most of them had enjoyed a two-thirds subsidy&mdash; 35/- a week.</P>
    <P>I know that the tendency is that the first day you go into a new house, you find that repayment of any sort is tough, but the result of creeping inflation is that after five or ten years, it is not so tough.  You get to the stage with SDA housing when the difference is perhaps 6/- or 7/- a week and at that stage there is a great opportunity of housing our people through Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act operations.  I am convinced also that we will not get the expansion we would wish to get here, unless there are supplemental grants from county councils.  I welcome the regulation made by the Minister in the new Act extending the figure up to which a <Col N="1571" /> supplemental grant may be received from £520 to £832.  We in Louth County Council and in Drogheda Corporation and Dundalk Urban Council could not give supplemental grants which we wished to give.  We examined the position and found that we could not give a grant if an applicant had more than £520 a year or £10 a week.  Obviously, few people with £10 a week would be building their own house.  Anyway, in my opinion, the Minister was right and wise to extend the limit to £830 a year.  Personally, I think he should put the limit up to £1,000 for the supplemental grant, as other speakers have said.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to the ledger. You might say that I have been talking about the rates and that this is a further imposition on the rates.  Of course it is, but in the first year, you will get one-tenth of the rates and after seven years, you will get full rates on a Small Dwellings Acquisition Act house so what the local authority gives with one hand is taken back with the other.  Over 20 years, the imposition is very small indeed.  As well, there is the fact that the gap between Small Dwellings Acquisition Act houses and Housing of the Working Classes Act houses is gradually becoming smaller.  If you give a decent supplemental grant, you will get people to rehouse themselves who would otherwise have to be rehoused under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.</P>
    <P>You do not get a subsidy from the Minister for Housing of the Working Classes Act houses unless there is a generous contribution from the rates and we feel, in all honesty, that we would like to do better.  Yet we have our responsibilities to the ratepayers at the same time.  If we could get a good scheme of supplemental grants and even extend the limit beyond the point to which the Minister has extended it, we would get more people to build under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and with the repayment of rates by people who owned their houses, we would do far better. In that way, you would get more people housed and leave fewer people <Col N="1572" /> in the abominable queue for houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.</P>
    <P>I should like to say that I am glad that a particular facet of the situation regarding housing which I attacked from the very start has now apparently blown itself up or petered out. I am referring to houses regarded as suitable for reconstruction.  Under Section 19 of the 1931 Act, we had the abominable situation in County Louth that people who had been passed for rural cottages were suddenly told they were no longer eligible because, under the Minister's new policy, their houses were judged fit for reconstruction.  I do not know what standards were applied to these houses, but I saw some of them myself and they certainly were not fit for reconstruction.</P>
    <P>The county manager told us of the regulations governing house reconstruction and they were pretty firm regulations.  First of all, if the house were not reconstructed under grant or loan provision by the tenant, the county council could request the landlord to do it.  If the landlord did not do it, they could enter the house and do it themselves.  If the landlord did not pay him, they could take his goods and if he had no goods, they could place an instalment order on him. That sort of thing to me stinks of the landlordism of the past.  We in County Louth never yet, thanks be to God, had to use our powers of compulsory acquisition.  A few times we reached the stage with landlords when county councillors went to see them and over a bottle of stout, arranged the price of a plot of land.  We never resorted to compulsory acquisition with landlords or anybody else.</P>
    <P>The position where people were placed in that impasse was wrong policy.  It got people's backs up.  I doubt if any house adjudged by the medical officer of health or by his officers as a house from which people should be rehoused in a new cottage is fit for reconstruction.  It may have sound walls and somebody could build a room on to it but I do not think that means it is suitable for reconstruction. In 1962, if the people are to be rehoused and if money is to be spent on them, they are entitled to a minimum <Col N="1573" /> and the minimum, in my opinion, should be five rooms, a bathroom, sewerage and water.  That is the target. I do not think at this moment it is possible to reach the target in farm workers' houses but I hope that with the coming of the Common Market and a change in the whole pattern, we will get a policy from some Minister &mdash;I hope one from this side of the House, Deputy Jones perhaps&mdash;where the minimum we will provide, whether we rehouse by reconstruction or by new houses, will be five rooms, water and sewerage.  That is the aim.</P>
    <P>The old pattern under Section 19 of the 1931 Act was never implemented until this new plan to reconstruct came into being.  It was completely against the whole concept and I am glad that it petered out.  It was obvious even when introduced that it would. These things sink slowly into the sands and are never heard of again.  It is no harm to remind the Minister that some of the things he did failed to go through with a flourish but fell flat.</P>
    <P>The vexed question of differential rents is one that has been agitating the minds of people connected with local authorities.  Many people did not worry about it, so long as the figures remained relatively low.  They merely passed on the subsidy and let the people pay the extra couple of shillings, or they levelled out the rents at the one figure.  With the increased cost of rehousing, differential rents will be forced on local authorities.  The policy of differential renting has been the policy of the Department over the years, and personally I am entirely in favour of it.  It has some unfortunate features, such as the fact that you have to investigate people's means.  Many tenants regard that as an intrusion on their privacy.  Nevertheless, if you are paying two-thirds of the loan and repayment charges, you are entitled to try to see that the unfortunate poor devil on home assistance does not have to pay 30/- or 35/- a week in rent.  He simply cannot do it and he ends up by being evicted.  The only way to rehabilitate him is to make it possible for him to exist during the period he is &ldquo;on his uppers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, the differential <Col N="1574" /> rent system is right.  On the other hand, it seems to me a strange anomaly that a person with £50 or £60 a week should receive a two-thirds subsidy towards the cost of his house. That may be an over-simplification of the problem.  However, where rents have become high enough to make a difference, I have always supported a differential rent scheme, and I hold that the Minister and his predecessors were correct in introducing differential rent schemes to offset the increased cost of housing.</P>
    <P>The remarks here on regional water schemes proved they received a mixed reception.  Everybody agrees that one of the amenities the rural population must have is an adequate water supply.  There are always mistakes and waste at the start, and in defence of the Minister&mdash;though it is not my job to defend him&mdash;I must say that you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs.  In many cases, regional water schemes have been wasteful.  I could instance one scheme where they ran the water off so that it would not go stagnant in the pipes.  That sort of expenditure is wrong and, in my opinion, can never be justified.</P>
    <P>In our local authority, we took a certain interpretation of the line of the Minister and the Department on regional water schemes.  If we were to run water along a road, we counted the number of houses that could be supplied and calculated the cost per house at £x.  I found out afterwards that that was not the interpretation placed on it by other local authorities where the officials went from house to house, got signed acceptances from people that they would take the water and based the cost per house on the number of signed acceptances.  On the basis of the number of houses in Louth and without taking account of acceptances&mdash;I have a report in front of me as thick as my wrist&mdash;the cost worked out at £2,090,000 or £400 per house.  The Minister recommended a maximum of £350 per house.  I do not know whether he has changed his mind about that figure since the last Estimate.</P>
    <P>If I take those figures as substantially correct, Louth County Council would have to put up £1,000,000 from <Col N="1575" /> the rates, and repayment of interest alone, without taking the capital cost into account, would be £67,500 or 5/7d. on the rates.  Speaking at column 1282 of volume 197 of the Official Report the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>As regards prospective rate increases arising out of the sanitary services programme, the general picture presented by the programmes adopted to date shows for the 17 county councils who have so far adopted comprehensive or interim programmes that the average ultimate increase would be about 2/- in the £ and that the various rates making up this average would be subject to some reduction by the income from water charges. </P>
    <P>That presents a rosy picture.  It is unfortunate, however, that the figure of 2/- in the £ was mentioned.  It reminds me of the statement of Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Finance, that the health services would never cost more than 2/- in the £.  Deputy Tierney asked which side of the fence the Minister was on&mdash;was he for group or regional schemes.  I believe he has a leg on each side of the ditch.  We should use regional schemes only where it is obvious they are an economic proposition and where a satisfactory number of people agree to take supply.  In such cases, the cost can be estimated as, say, £70 or £80 per house, of which half will be paid by the rates and half by the Department. The alternative is group and individual schemes.  I may be leaving myself open to criticism locally, but I believe a considerable amount of the money we have spent in Louth on our regional schemes was&mdash;not wasted&mdash;a bad investment in relation to the advantage gained by the ratepayers and by the residents.  The regional water scheme, as such, should be played down in favour of group and individual schemes.  The very nature of our countryside and our mode of living supports this.  A pipe running along a road where there is a house only every half-mile is an absurdity.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable delay in the granting of individual water grants <Col N="1576" /> because applicants are told they should try to organise a group water scheme.  Like previous speakers, I have received every facility and attention from the officers of the Department. I have nothing but good to say of them.  It is rather irritating, however, where you have a man prepared to run water 300 yards across a field, to find he is told he should try to organise a group scheme just because down the road there are two or three houses which should have demolition orders on them.</P>
    <P>The person who owns the houses lives in England, or somewhere else, and the people living in them in this real case are agitating fiercely to get themselves rehoused.  I believe there is too rigid a line in relation to this. Even if an odd mistake were made and someone got an individual grant where there could have been a group scheme, it would be far better to make that odd mistake rather than have delay after delay.  These delays very often end up with some decent fellow, who really does not want to trouble anybody, knocking on a politician's door.  A less rigid line on the question of group water schemes would be much better.</P>
    <P>I should have preferred not to take up any political points, but, when they come my way, I have to reply to them. On Thursday, 15th November, at column 1421 of volume 197 of the Official Report, Deputy Dolan and I got into a slight argument.  Deputy Dolan will not mind if I take him up on it now because &ldquo;every dog has his day&rdquo;.  Deputy Dolan said the &ldquo;onward march in housing was interrupted in 1956-57&rdquo; and I said: &ldquo;It was not.&rdquo;  The Report continues:</P>
    <P>Mr. Dolan: I refer the Deputy to my own constituency of Cavan.  In the middle of winter the housing scheme stopped overnight.  The supplementary grants were cancelled. We were unable to get any money from the Central Fund.  There were people with houses half built.  There were stocks of cement blocks ready for sale.  Everything collapsed overnight.</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: Look up the figures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> Mr. Dolan: I have the figures and I have the facts.  The Deputy may know something about Louth&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Donegan: I am talking about the whole country. </P>
    <P>Deputy Dolan then made a statement to which I take the gravest exception. It is to the statement I take exception, not to the Deputy.  He said:</P>
    <P>I am talking about my own constituency of Cavan.  If the Deputy doubts my word, I can tell him even worse; cheques issued by the county council were not honoured for months afterwards. </P>
    <P>That was a despicable statement.  If it were true, then the country was bankrupt. That did not happen.  I do not believe it will ever happen.  The investment proceeding in the new National Loan at the moment is the soundest investment anybody could make. Things do not change that much in four or five years.  The kind of poverty Deputy Dolan was talking about does not become cured in four or five years. Of course, the fact is there never was such poverty.</P>

      <P>I listened to the Deputy.  I will now give the Deputy and the House the benefit of the correct figures.  In Volume 180 at Column 1193 of the Official Report Deputy Ryan asked the Minister for Local Government &ldquo;if he will state in respect of each year from 1945 to date the number of new houses built by (a) local authorities and (b) private enterprise.&rdquo; The Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, replied as follows:</P>
      <P>As the reply is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to bore the House with the figures from 1945 on.  If Deputies want to, they can look up the reference for themselves.  In 1950, local authority houses, 8, 117; in 1951, <Col N="1578" /> 7,258; in 1952, 6,938; in 1953, 6,320; in 1954, 5,697; in 1955, 4,143; in 1956, 4,218; in 1957, 4,123; in 1958, 2,033; and in 1959, 2,399.  I come now to private enterprise houses: in 1950, 3,762; in 1951, 4,867; in 1952, 6,080; in 1953, 5,538; in 1954, 4,703; in 1955, 4,873; in 1956, 5,859; in 1957, 3,925; in 1958, 2,904 and in 1959, 3,066.</P>
    <P>In volume 192 of the Official Report of 16th November, 1961, Deputy Rooney asked the Minister for Local Government &ldquo;if he will state for each full year since 1955 the number and cost of houses built by Dublin Corporation.&rdquo; The question is No. 77.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>Particulars in the precise form requested by the Deputy are not available in my Department, but I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a tabular statement of the information at present available to me. </P>
    <P>The number of dwellings completed by Dublin Corporation in the financial year 1955-56 was 1,311; in 1956-57, it was 1,564; in 1957-58 it was 1,021; in 1958-59 it was 460; in 1959-60 it was 505; in 1960-61 it was 277.</P>
    <P>The capital expenditure, another good indicator, was in 1955-56, £2,504,669; in 1956-57 it was £2,689,259; in 1957-58 it was £1,631,378; in 1958-59 it was £1,136,856; in 1959-60 it was £881,859 and in 1960-61 it was £841,719.</P>

If the landlords were not prepared to do the work we were prepared to go in and do it.  No matter how Deputies may try to hound me I intend to persist in giving the true picture to the House.  On 1st March, 1961, at column 1012 of volume 186 of the Official Report the Minister for Local Government replied to a question <Col N="1579" /> asked by Deputy P. O'Donnell. Deputy P.

    <P>I do not propose to go any further except to say that every time this horrible political ramp, which was perpetrated largely by Deputy Briscoe, is embarked upon in this House, one just has to take five minutes off to give the figures.  I warn Deputies that every time this occurs, we will take five minutes off and give the figures. Just as a certain leader for many years in this country succeeded, by repetition, in getting things across, we will succeed, also by repetition, in getting the truth across.</P>

      <P>The institution of the National Building Agency was a good policy.  Certain people get an <Col N="1580" /> advantage where the provision of housing is concerned but, by and large, there is not much difference as between what is provided in this instance and what is provided by the ordinary building societies.  The idea was that this agency would provide houses for executives and technicians in industry by helping the employing companies.  These companies could either hold the houses themselves or pass them on, but the companies are liable for the repayments and must give the ordinary sureties themselves on the houses, in respect of title deeds presumably.  I regard this policy as a good policy because it does allow companies, without entering on their own financial resources, to provide houses for executives, technicians, and even ordinary employees.</P>
      <P>I understand that one of the first activities of this agency has been to provide houses for the Garda Síochána.  That is an excellent idea. The only pity is that the rate of interest, as far as I can understand from the National Loan&mdash;I do not want to criticise it; I suppose when you issue a loan you have to pick a number&mdash; will hardly go down.  The National Building Agency is a good thing, I welcome it and I commend the Minister and his Department for introducing it, even though I may have been a little bit acid for the past few minutes.</P>
      <P>The allocation to the Road Fund has been increased.  Of course the increase is relatively small compared with the expenditure.  Presumably it represents only the loan and repayment charges, but we may face up to the fact that as the volume of transport on the railways goes down, the volume on our roads will increase and that is going to mean a colossal expenditure. It appears there is no reason to doubt that the economic way of moving heavy goods in the future will be by heavy trucks.  If that is to be so, we will need main arteries across the country which are quite expensive to build and maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so doing, we should not lose sight of our county roads, or of those roads not yet taken over by the county.  We <Col N="1581" /> have to cut our cloth to measure and decide what we can spend and allot to the two matters, the county roads and the main arteries across the country.  It is obvious that this increase will have to take place.  It is a normal consequence of the increase in heavy road traffic.  I should like to see the county roads, particularly in the counties referred to by Deputy Reynolds, Leitrim and Roscommon, and even Louth, which is a poor county as far as rates are concerned, being looked after and rendered dust-free, as well as considerable expenditure being made on main county roads.</P>
    <P>This now perhaps is something against my local authority and against myself as a politician and perhaps it could be used against me at home, but I do not approve fully of 100 per cent. grants from the Department for main roads.  If you are not going to do the job yourself, there should be some small contribution and the most stringent approach to expenditure on the part of the Department so that there will not be waste.  I do not suggest that on a certain main road which has just been created, very close to where I reside, there was waste.  I want to exclude that road.  If there were a small contribution from the county, it would bring county councillors to look on this with more attention&mdash;I can see the chairman of a county council waving his pencil at me; that is natural because he wants to get the most out of it&mdash;but I should like to see the county council, the chairman and the manager adopting a more stringent view.  I should like our engineers to make that little extra effort to get the job done that little bit cheaper and exercising their brains to save the county rate.  I believe the county managers and engineers and all the rest become loyal to their counties in the same way as politicians do.  If there is to be a small contribution they will feel that they have to produce the goods in a more economic way.</P>
    <P>That may be unpopular but it is a suggestion in which I believe.  I also think that if the farmers are to be the premier ratepayers, you will have to think of the roads that have not been taken out by the county council.  You <Col N="1582" /> might say that if a man lived up a long lane and you decided to &ldquo;take it out&rdquo; on the county council and build it up to third-class county council standards, you would be increasing the capital value of his holding and that that would be something we should not do.  A large number of lanes have never been taken out of the county council at the end of which there are large ratepayers and it is not right that these people should have been left from 1952 to 1962 and now for the following decades, without something being done for them.</P>
    <P>It is a colossal job.  I gave the figures, on the Estimate for Employment and Emergency Schemes, for Louth, of the estimated capital cost of building up these lanes and accommodation roads which have not been taken out by the county council up to third-class county council standard and it is £212,000, or, in round figures, 212 pence on the rates.  If we had them completed, the estimated maintenance charge is £8,500 or 8½d. a year on the rates, from which we get half.  In fact, if we could only get these lanes up to third-class county council standards, we would do the job for 4d. a year on the rates.  I know the capital sum is large and the job is difficult, but it is one that in part at least will have to be faced over the years.  It could be faced not on this Vote but by increasing the Rural Improvements Scheme Vote in the Employment and Emergency Schemes. If that were done, the opportunity would be there for the farmers to build up their lanes and apply to get them taken over.  I think most county councils would take them over but I believe publicity from the Minister and his colleague in the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote would be the way to do it.  That is really what I am pressing on the Minister, he has to think about it.  It would be a pity if he became completely hypnotised by the main arteries and forgot about the man at the end of the long lane.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, progress has been reasonably good.  The housing and water schemes of the Department have been reasonably efficient.  I do not <Col N="1583" /> agree with the present policy of regional water schemes.  It should be played down and we on this side of the House do not believe it is a practical proposition. We think the group and individual water schemes are to be preferred.  We also believe more can be done in housing and given the opportunity, we could under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act get more people to house themselves rather than depend on the Government to rehouse them.  We believe every person should own his own house and there should be greater facilities for repairing local authority houses which could be vested. These are the things we believe.  We think the county roads and the third-class roads should not be forgotten. That is the policy on this side of the House.  We do not think it is being implemented fully from that side and we hope that this debate will result in changes in the future.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Estimate, but, having listened to the speech made by Deputy Donegan, I felt I would miss a golden opportunity if I did not reply to the material he provided.  When this Estimate was introduced, a motion to refer it back was moved by Deputy Jones.  The main point he made in supporting the deferring of the Vote was that local taxation and rates were too high, that they had reached such a height that some contribution to the cost of providing more houses for our people and providing them with water supplies was required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was amusing to listen to Deputy Donegan admonishing the Minister for giving 100 per cent. grants for main roads.  He went on to say that local authorities should be asked to subscribe to the maintenance and construction of main roads as against the system at present in operation whereby local authorities get 100 per cent. grants. He reminded us three times he was speaking not only as an administrator but as a politician.  He introduced a political note into his speech.  He went to great pains to give information from reports and extracts, freely supplied by his secretariat in Fine Gael, to answer some charge that <Col N="1584" /> was made some time ago by Deputy Dolan about the activities of Fine Gael when they were the dominant Party in the second Coalition Government period.</P>
    <P>They feel very sore when they are reminded of the fact that they clamped down on house building during that period and they are relying on figures for the years from 1945 to 1960 in an effort to cloud the issue and further to delude the people. They quote the figures for 1957-58 and 1958-59 to show a 60 per cent. reduction in house building as compared with the previous years.  I repeat and support the statement made by my colleague Deputy Dolan when he charged Fine Gael with clamping down on house building during that period.  I challenge Fine Gael to address their remarks more forcibly to the Minister for Local Government. It is clear that during the period of Coalition Government, 1956-57, before Fianna Fáil again took over control of this country, instructions were issued to county authorities, principally through the medium of the county managers, for an easing off in house building.  I am making that suggestion and that charge, that such instructions were sent directly from the Department of Local Government to local authorities at that time.  I was chairman at the time of the Limerick County Council and I am satisfied from the information I got then, which has not since been contradicted, that such instructions were sent out at that period.</P>
    <P>It has been clearly shown that, as a result, during 1957 and 1958 building of houses in rural Ireland fell by 50 per cent.  They may ask: were Fianna Fáil not in power in 1957 and in 1958? They were, but the houses that should have been built in 1957 and 1958 should have been planned and prepared in 1955-56.  I have experience in local authorities.  If any local authority initiates a scheme of house building in rural Ireland in any year, it will take at least two months to acquire the sites and to clear all the necessary preliminaries.  In some cases, it is very difficult to get clear possession.  There may be legal problems. <Col N="1585" /> It can be assumed that, on average, it takes from 12 to 15 months to clear the decks and to make any real progress.</P>
    <P>I feel rather sorry for Deputy Jones, for whom I have great regard, when he has to listen to Deputy Donegan advocating that the Minister should be asked to cut down on the 100 per cent. grants we are getting for main roads and that the local authorities should be asked to make a contribution.  I read Deputy Jones's speech and I agree to a great extent with some of the points he made.  I agree that the time has come when the whole structure of poor law valuation needs complete review.  I hope that in the very near future some scheme will be devised to change the pattern of poor law valuation, which is not equitable under present conditions.</P>
    <P>While conditions are as they are, while the poor law valuation system is in vogue and while there is need to erect houses in rural Ireland for people for whom we are obliged to provide houses, I shall never make an apology for any rate that I subscribe to being made in the Limerick County Council, when the question of housing the workingman is concerned.  Taking the long view, the more houses we build in any part of rural Ireland, the more we enhance the rateable valuation of that area.  In time, the money will be recouped by way of rates and rent. It is good, sound investment.  It may be a long-term investment but, in the long run, it is a sound investment in many respects, apart from the immediate advantage.  Regard must be had to the importance of housing from the point of view of health, which comes before any other consideration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the 100 per cent. grants for main roads and in that connection there is one point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  We all appreciate the 10 per cent. increase made available last year and which possibly will be made available for the coming year.  In the constituency which I and Deputy Jones represent, there was a grant of £80,000 for main road construction, maintenance and improvement. When it was intimated at a <Col N="1586" /> council meeting that we were to receive that amount by way of grant, I asked a question as to the mileage of main road construction or maintenance that could be carried out for that amount of money.  I was amazed when I was told that for £80,000 only 4¼ miles could be done.  That represents approximately £20,000 per statute mile. Arguments may be adduced justifying that figure.  I have not the professional training to enable me to dispute it but it strikes me, as an ordinary layman, as being a colossal sum of money to expend on one mile of road.  I would ask the Minister to make a note of that fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan has left the House and I do not like to take advantage of his absence.  I agree entirely on the point he made as regards group schemes and regional water supply schemes.  My personal view is that we should encourage group schemes as much as possible.  I am convinced of the importance of encouraging group schemes just as it is of the utmost importance that people should be encouraged to build their own homes. We have very wide powers under the recent Act and can go beyond the terms and the ambit of the 1926 Act that allowed us to build houses for agricultural workers.  Every man would feel much happier if he could be helped to provide his own home. There are several small farmers who might find it very hard to build their own homes.  A suggestion was made that the local authorities should come to their aid but I think that should be discouraged and that we should rather encourage them by helping them in a practical financial way.</P>
    <P>In the recent Local Government Act passed by the Oireachtas, the local authorities got every opportunity of dealing with the problem of providing homes for small farmers.  Every member of the House is aware that there is a permissive section in that Act giving authority to the local authorities to create their own supplementary grant schemes.  We took advantage of that the moment we had the power to do so, and in Limerick, we are giving £ for £ without any difference whatsoever to farmers with <Col N="1587" /> valuations of from £1 to £50, to the worker whether he is a white-collar worker or a non-collar worker, and to the wage earner, whether skilled or unskilled, so long as his salary does not exceed £832.  We believe we are doing the right thing.  We are satisfied that a sliding scale was not equitable. We came to that decision, although some members thought that it was too much and that some people would be too well off.  My answer, and the answer of other people, was that, in the long run, the farmers with valuations of £49 and £50 will be playing their part in the contribution the local authority must make towards interest and sinking fund and repayments on the money we borrow for such purposes.</P>
    <P>We have another problem which I regard as very serious.  I did not read all of Deputy Jones's speech but I am sure he will agree with me when I say that we are determined to provide a home for every person in Limerick who needs one.  We have 300 cottages cleared and ready for advertisement to continue with the great scheme of cottage building which we have undertaken for years in Limerick.  We have to our credit 6,000 cottages in the county and we are ready to go ahead with 300 more.  I understand we have a waiting list of 240.  While we have that number of people to house, we are determined to go ahead with the building of houses for those people, notwithstanding what little extra impost will be involved for the rates to meet the cost of erection.</P>
    <P>Our problem is that we are finding it exceedingly hard to get contractors for our building schemes in the nonmunicipal villages and so forth.  I believe that we are being held to ransom to a great extent, not only in Limerick but in many other counties in the 26 Counties.  There never was such a boom in building.  It is unprecedented, but we are finding it very hard in Limerick to get contractors to take on building for our local authorities. We are told that the Minister is at fault because he has laid down a ceiling in the amounts he will sanction for the erection of rural cottages.  I <Col N="1588" /> do not think that is correct.  I do not think the prices we have been quoted by contractors for the erection of rural cottages can be described as fair.</P>
    <P>Up to about three months ago, we could build rural cottages for an average of £1,000 to £1,200 and I understand that the latest tenders we received have gone up by something like £300 or £400.  That is excessive and unwarranted.  I would be the first to recommend to our council the rejection of such tenders.  They are unjustifiable. Taking 1955 as the basis, I understand that there has been an increase in the price of materials of about ten points.  Wages have gone up by about 22 points&mdash;perhaps that is stretching it a bit&mdash;but taking the figure at 22 points and the increase in the price of materials at ten points, the demands made on local authorities for the erection of houses in rural Ireland are still not justified.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the National Building Agency.  I believe that we should use that agency to a greater extent than was first envisaged.  When it was being introduced here, we were led to believe it had a specific type of work to do and nothing else.  In view of the great difficulty local authorities have in getting suitable contracts at the right price for the building of houses, and the fact that other Departments erecting houses in many parts of rural Ireland&mdash;such as the Land Commission who, I understand, have the same problems in places which they intended to divide&mdash;I believe we should extend the scope and activities of the National Building Agency.  They are at the moment committed to building houses for the Garda but I think they should go further afield and engage in the building of schools.</P>
    <P>I know that schools, while they are essential, do not come under this Vote, do not come under the baton or within the ambit of the Minister, but, at the same time, I would advocate that the National Building Agency should be asked to widen their scope and take on building on a wider scale.  I believe the local authorities should have first claim on them if we are being held to ransom by contractors with prices which we could <Col N="1589" /> not consider economic in the sense that we could not let the houses afterwards at economic prices.  The National Agency should step in on such occasions.  I know it is not easy to build up such an organised body to deal with all the matters that present themselves but some efforts should be made to widen their activities.  As I say, I had no notion of speaking&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A good deal of criticism is being levelled at the Department because of delays.  We all experience that.  I suppose it is due to the fact that there are not enough inspectors.  Then of course we are a very impatient people.  We fill in an application form to-day for <Col N="1590" /> a reconstruction grant or for a new house grant and we expect to see the inspector the week after.  That cannot be done.  In the main, that seems to be the complaint.  Efforts should be made to employ more inspectors to deal with this work.  I heard a Deputy say that in North Tipperary, Laois and Offaly, there were two inspectors employed for a big stretch of country.  It is impossible for those inspectors to cover such a wide area. We have the same difficulty in Limerick.</P>
      <P>It is good to see Fine Gael especially becoming as house-minded as they are and so determined to criticise the Minister in relation to it.  It is great to see the changeover and to see Labour determined, too.  Housing is something on which we could all find a common ground.  We should pool our views and our energies in order to speed up the building of houses.  The more houses that are built, the more prosperous the nation will be.  We will be cutting down on health bills, hospital charges and so on.  Whatever other Deputies might think, I am very pleased with what the Minister has done.  He is an excellent man who knows his job in all its details.  He has plenty of energy and initiative. That is the type of man I like to see in control of a Department and I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Department do not lose any opportunity of advising and encouraging local authorities to get on with the job of housebuilding.  Even though I say it myself, the North Cork Housing and Sanitary Authority of which I am a member has a pretty good reputation for housebuilding and the initiating of schemes.  We are quite prepared for a certain amount of delay between the initiation of a scheme and the acceptance of tenders but it is an extraordinary fact that it has taken four to five years fully to implement a scheme and have the contractor cut the sod.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a progressive Department, it is hard to understand that.  When any of us at a local authority meeting make inquiry about the progress being made on such-and-such a scheme, we are informed it is with the Department. <Col N="1591" /> Of course our reply to that is that it is going through the incubation period.  At times, one is nearly forced to think and say there was deliberate delay in these matters.  There is a case in point in regard to a building scheme in Mallow where some years ago we took over some land there and built a scheme of houses.  In later years, we took over more of the land and it is extraordinary that while the land was being given voluntarily and there was no difficulty about title&mdash;it was the same title as in the case of the previous lands&mdash;it should have taken such a long time to get the Department to give permission to go ahead. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the long and unnecessary delays in that connection.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the manner in which housing surveys are carried out. The inspectors interview all applicants and indeed do a very good job but by reason of the regulations some people are excluded.  I am referring not to flat dwellers in the city of Dublin or in the city of Cork but in rural towns.  This has occurred in Charleville where there are a great many old houses with three storeys. Unfortunately, young people in order to have some place to settle down take over these flats.  I need hardly remind the Minister the difficulty a housewife will have in carrying on a house in such a place three storeys high and with a family, the difficulty becomes more acute.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why these people are not included in local authority housing schemes.  We have raised the matter time and time again but we are told they will not qualify for the subsidy.  There is another type of applicants who have been obliged maybe by neighbours or farmers who allow them into an outside house on the farm.  They are applicants for new houses and like the flat dwellers, they are also excluded because the inspectors and the engineers say the house could be reconstructed.  That may be so, but it is taking an unfair advantage.  First of all, the farmer may have been only obliging the person who is living in the house, and it <Col N="1592" /> may impose a hardship on that farmer.  The farmer or the landlord who owns this house would probably use it only for storage purposes when it became vacant.  Those people have been included in some schemes.</P>
    <P>In my own experience, in my home town, 26 applicants for houses have been approved in respect of one scheme but, when all the inspectors, doctors and everybody else were finished, we had whittled the list down to six and six houses were eventually built.  We had immediately to proceed with another survey which is now being carried out for a further scheme and in this new survey we are dealing mostly with the original applicants who should have been included in the first scheme.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand how inspectors should adopt such an attitude towards deserving applicants for new houses. As in the delays I mentioned earlier, I think that at times we want deliberately to reduce the number of applicants for new houses and this is most unfair to people who have been living under unsatisfactory conditions for years.  If we are to have a further scheme in my town, deserving applicants will have to wait for a further five years before being accommodated. The Minister must give this problem his urgent attention because it is the main factor in compelling people to leave rural areas.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy J.J. Collins and others, I feel that contractors generally have lost all interest in house building. In one scheme the Minister did not accept the contract price.  On two occasions later the scheme for the building of several new houses was re-advertised until finally we had to do it by direct labour.  Direct labour is admirable in its own way but it is rather difficult for a local authority to recruit a big direct labour gang and to get the necessary skilled tradesmen in that gang.  I note that the Minister now intends to accept the inevitability of higher costs in respect of material and labour&mdash;something like a 12½ per cent. increase.  That would probably tide over most local authorities and might get a number of contractors <Col N="1593" /> interested again in this type of business.</P>
    <P>Much work is being done in the reconstruction of houses.  Undoubtedly the grants being given have encouraged people to improve their houses and generally a good job is being done.  The only complaint I have on that matter is that there are too many delays in inspection.  I do not blame the inspectors because I honestly think they have a very big territory to cover and that it is impossible for them to be on the job everywhere at once.  I know that recently more inspectors were recruited and I hope that consequently the work of inspection of reconstruction work will be expedited.</P>
    <P>Another matter I would urge on the Minister is to speed up the payment of grants when the final certificates have been issued.  It has already been said that many small contractors are waiting on people's doorsteps for their money.  We cannot blame them for that because they, in turn, must pay their tradesmen and it is a little frustrating for a man to have carried out a first class job and then have to wait for his money.</P>
    <P>In the matter of roads, undoubtedly we have travelled very far during the past ten or 15 years.  We have carried out big improvements, but to my mind we are pouring an extraordinary amount of money, comparatively speaking, into our main roads.  There is some justification for that policy but it is very hard to make the general public appreciate that, particularly the ratepayers, while the little county roads are so neglected.  We in Cork have adopted a policy which has given little encouragement to people who have such bad roads leading to their houses. Many of them are little better than boreens.  About 12 months ago, however, it was suggested to those people to come together under a rural improvements scheme through which the council would automatically take over such roads for maintenance.  Great progress has been made in that way but unfortunately there have been some districts in which local co-operation has not been what it should be.  Still on the main roads, I suggest there should be a re-classification of all <Col N="1594" /> major roads because with the fantastic increase in traffic, when we now come to a crossroads, we find it very hard to distinguish the main from the secondary roads.  It is probably a good thing, because we are all anxious to see as many dust-proof roads as possible.</P>
    <P>I would now draw the Minister's attention to the problem created by heavy lorries on the roads.  Many of them draw trailers and they are not alone hard on the roads but also create a terrible driving hazard, particularly at night.  I cannot describe them as anything but monsters.  Subject to correction, I believe there is some control over them but I believe there is no control whatsoever over their overall laden weight.  We have trucks with trailers now carrying anything between 45 and 50 tons and when we see these passing over railway bridges, designed to take only between 6 and 10 tons, we see the problem that is being created.  The bucket will go into the well once too often and something will happen unless there is better control.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, more attention should be paid to the lighting of vehicles at night.  They should be compelled to have something luminous on their sides in order to indicate to pedestrians, cyclists, motorists or anybody else that there is a trailer attached to such vehicle.  We all from time to time have had the experience of meeting some of those monsters at sharp bends.  Accidents are barely averted. I hope the Minister will take some cognisance of what I have said because I think there are a great many people interested in this matter, not only for their own good but for the general good.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another matter, that is co-operation between his Department and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I had an experience two years ago in one of the towns in my constituency where the county council were doing an admirable job in relaying a concrete footpath.  They were just coming to the finish of it when the Department of Posts and Telegraphs moved in and immediately cut a trench right through the whole <Col N="1595" /> scheme.  It was an extraordinary state of affairs.  I can assure the Minister that there were some very unfavourable comments on both Departments that such a thing should be allowed.  It should be very easy for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to communicate their plans to the Department of Local Government.  I should like the Minister to take note of that.</P>
    <P>Only a week ago in this same town, they had to be persuaded by an engineer not to go on the footpath again.  Their objection was that to go out on the roadway would have involved them going down too deep and then the job would be too big, whereas if they were to operate on the footpath they would not have to go so deep.  I think that attitude by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is all wrong.</P>
    <P>With regard to water schemes, the question of regional schemes and group schemes seems to be a contentious matter among all the councils.  In my constituency we have experienced them all.  We had regional water schemes long before the Minister suggested them as a national policy.  They were admirable and successful.  Naturally, of course, there is a great deal of dead ground to be covered, which makes it expensive at times.</P>
    <P>The group scheme, which came into being a few years ago, is an admirable one and is to be encouraged.  In my constituency, we have two such schemes but as the old saying puts it: &ldquo;You never miss the water until the pumps go dry.&rdquo;  I should like if the Minister would make available to those people the best expert advisers in his Department so that such things would not happen.  It is very discouraging for people who displayed such initiative and put money into the scheme to make a success of it.</P>
    <P>It is rather a pity that the Minister does not see his way to provide a little money under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  There was some very excellent work done under that scheme.  I know very well that the Minister will tell me that the Local Authorities (Works) Act is there and <Col N="1596" /> that we should get a contribution from the county council but my reply is that the rates are high enough and that we should like to get a bit from the national purse.</P>
    <P>There was a time when a great deal of flooding of roadways and damage was done to land.  Until we got tidy town minded, the handiest and nearest dump was the river.  Consequently, with the accumulation over the years, you had little islands built up in the rivers.  I recall at the time it was initiated some very fine work was carried under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We have been asked again and again why such work is not allowed now.  Naturally, we have to tell the people that we have no money.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider the matter.  I can assure him it would not be abused. It would be for the general good.  I appreciate very much the manner in which I have been met over the past 12 months by the Minister and the members of his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the present day responsibilities of a Minister for Local Government are not fully appreciated.  If we only consider that upon his decision may depend whether many of our people ever have a home of their own, where this home is to be located, the size of it and what amenities they are to enjoy or be denied, and when we consider, too, that he is responsible for the adequacy or otherwise of our roads and for their safety, we get some idea of his position.  The growth of the Department of Local Government has been enormous in recent years.  Many factors, indeed, have contributed to this growth.  First among these I would put the tendency of very many of our people to leave rural Ireland and flock into the cities and larger towns.  This number is likely to be increased in the future but I think the problem up to the present has been accelerated because of the neglect of agriculture over the years, because of low incomes and lack of amenities in the country, while, at the same time, the rural population were expected, through increased rates and taxes, to provide amenities for the <Col N="1597" /> people in the urban areas when there was no possibility that they were likely to have these amenities themselves for many years to come.</P>
      <P>With regard to the road situation, the decision of the Government to close down many of our railway branch lines and close down the canals and so divert all this traffic on to the roads has created an enormous problem.  The decision to give a monopoly of transport to CIE has not helped here.  I say that because I remember the days when the local carrier did the work.  He knew where he was going, went directly there, picked up his load and went to Dublin or elsewhere, returning with another load.  In that way, there was a load carried in both directions.  Now, that operation means double transport.</P>
      <P>These are the problems which confront a present day Minister for Local Government.  In county Dublin, we have two big problems.  I should probably stay with roads as I am dealing with traffic.  I hold that practically all our roads in county Dublin are main roads and should be so classified. Some time ago the Minister gave some indication that he intended to have a reclassification of roads and I should like to hear whether or not that work has been begun.  I mentioned before that in county Dublin we contribute from the rates twice as much for main and county roads as any other county in Ireland.  I believe that is the Minister's responsibility and I expect him to find a way to rectify it because we are facing many other enormous problems in the county.</P>
      <P>After Deputy Burke had spoken about the housing situation in county Dublin, I met him on the way out and told him that I thought he handed out all the Fianna Fáil bouquets.  Obviously, I was mistaken.  I did not know Deputy Collins was to follow.  Deputy Collins amused me when he spent about 20 minutes in an effort to oppose Deputy Donegan.  He said he did not like speaking in public about a man who was absent, but when he said that, he had no more to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be realistic about housing The facts are there.  Deputy Collins <Col N="1598" /> said there were very few houses built in 1957.  I have before me the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> which gives the number of houses built in 1957 by local authorities under State-aided schemes as 4,784.  By 1960, that was down to 2,414.  The number of men engaged in building in those years is even more remarkable.  In 1956, 1,943 were employed in the county borough of Dublin on local authority houses.  That was reduced in 1960 to 383.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to know what happened exactly in Dublin city.  I suspect somebody was guilty of a serious error of judgement; otherwise, we would not have the appalling situation we have there today.  I know what happened in county Dublin.  I have been a member of that local authority since 1958 and I have not missed eight meetings in eight years. I know the efforts we made to get houses built there.  Deputy Collins spoke about this fictitious advice issued to county managers by the inter-Party Government warning them to close down on building but it is rather peculiar that advice did not appear to become effective until 1958, 1959 and 1960.  I know that the present position in the city and county of Dublin is simply appalling.  We have recently completed a survey in county Dublin and we have over 1,000 unfit houses.  At the same time, we have between 800 and 900 current applications for houses.  This in no way indicates the complete picture because there are many people in county Dublin who are badly in need of houses but know they are just wasting time in applying to the county council as they have only one or two in family and that rules them out.</P>
    <P>Last year, Deputy Dunne quite properly said that we built 52 houses in county Dublin.  If we continued building at that rate, it would take us 20 years to cope with the number of unsuitable houses alone, not to speak of current applicants and new applicants. Dublin city and county are confronted with a special problem that requires national consideration. The prospect of entering into the Common Market aggravates the problem. <Col N="1599" /> Everybody knows what that will mean.  More and more people will flock to the cities and towns and the problem will continue to become greater.</P>
    <P>To return to the secret circular of which Deputy Collins seems to be aware, I believe that when the present Government returned to power in 1957 and when they produced the plan for economic expansion, one of the planks in that plan was to close down local authority building because it was regarded as unproductive expenditure.</P>
    <P>No matter how local representatives tried to get houses built, they failed.  I do not know any member of Dublin County Council who was not at all times exhorting the manager, the engineers and everyone concerned to build more houses and at no time was there a decision to slow down house-building in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>What happened?  We got our inspectors to investigate the position in any particular area.  I have numerous areas in mind.  Take Lucan, for instance.  We decided that 88 houses were needed.  We put that proposition to the Department.  They sent out their inspectors although our doctors and inspectors had covered the ground. The Department decided that only 40 houses were needed.  Forty-two houses would have completed a block, but it took us several months to get sanction to include the extra two.  When we came to allocate these houses, we had 110 applications and the scene was next to murder.  A local authority representative was not safe in Lucan for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>The present position is that after all those years we have decided to complete that job and we have accepted a tender simply because the Department have now said to the county managers: &ldquo;We are in serious trouble; start building again.&rdquo;  There is no doubt that it is the Minister's responsibility and if the Minister does not tell the county managers to get on with the job, they will not go ahead.  Every excuse will be put forward&mdash;the difficulty of getting staff, the enormous job that is to be done, the other amenities that must be considered, the regional <Col N="1600" /> water scheme, the swimming pools the Minister talks about and so on. Reference to other amenities only helps to cloud the position and to conceal the fact that on many occasions we have a number of families in night shelter accommodation in County Dublin, families that have to be pushed out in the mornings and cannot return again until night.  That is a situation for which the Minister must accept responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We remember that, on 14th November, Question No. 47 was addressed by me to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs concerning the appointment of a postman for the St. Johnston district.  I asked the Minister this Question:</P>
      <P>....if he has appointed a postman to St. Johnston Post Office, County Donegal, the date and nature of such appointment, and the circumstances he took into consideration in arriving at his decision. </P>
      <P>The Minister replied:</P>
      <P>An auxiliary postman was appointed at St. Johnston Post Office on 12th November, 1962.  The appointment was an unestablished one.  The most suitable qualified person was appointed from a list of persons nominated by the Employment Exchange.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to practice to furnish any information regarding the claims or qualifications of applicants as this would entail disclosing information obtained in confidence concerning these persons.</P>
      <P>Arising out of that question and reply, certain supplementary questions were put by me to the Minister.  The major question I asked was if the Minister would explain why two interviews were held for this post.  The Minister told me he had no supplementary information that two interviews were held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> I have evidence here that an interview was held for this post on 30th January, 1962.  I understand that that was held because the man who, previous to that, was carrying the post had resigned for some reason or another.  The person appointed by the postmaster in Lifford from that interview was a man named William Edward Carlin, Church Street, St. Johnston.</P>
    <P>I might read this letter from the postmaster to Mr. Carlin, written on the day of the interview:</P>
    <P>With further reference to the interview held in this Office today, please report at St. Johnston Post Office at 7.35 a.m. on Monday the 5th February, 1962, for duty on the St. Johnston-Ardagh post.  In the meantime, you should take steps to get a Birth Certificate which you should send in to me when obtained.</P>
    <P>Two days later, the same man received a letter from the postmaster which read:</P>
    <P>With reference to your proposed employment as Auxiliary Postman in St. Johnston, I have to inform you that owing to the fact that I have not completed all the necessary formalities in the matter, I will have to defer your temporary appointment until a later date.  In the meantime you should take steps to procure your Birth Certificate. </P>
    <P>Might I ask the Minister who instructed or at what time did a person instruct him or one of the officials in his Department to change or reverse the decision of two days previously?  In any case, I am very suspicious that a Deputy in the North-East constituency of Donegal played a major part in having this man sacked from his post.</P>
    <P>Carlin is married, with four of a family.  He has a part-time job at something like £60 a year as a care-taker for the local waterworks.  He also has ten weeks' fishing on the River Foyle as a crew man.  He is ideal for a post such as was offered to him on 30th January&mdash;a post which carried a pay of £4 16s. 0d. per week; a pay that no other man, unless he <Col N="1602" /> had a sideline, could live on.  But Carlin appreciated this post because it supplemented his then income and left him an income on which he could support his wife and four children.</P>
    <P>Carlin, to my knowledge, gave very good and satisfactory service during the six months he held this job.  I have made inquiries locally and I am at a loss to imagine what legitimate reason the Minister could take into consideration in arriving at his decision. The obvious one is that when a boy of 18 years of age displaces a married man, with four of a family, particularly when that boy is closely associated with the Fianna Fáil cumann in the village of St. Johnston, the whole thing reeks of political suspicion.</P>
    <P>It has come to my notice that a certain Deputy in the North-East constituency of County Donegal made a promise that if this lad applied for the job he would make him a present of it.  I should like to put it on record that I have no objection to any member of this Parliament trying to help everyone&mdash;boys of 18 and married men.  I would do it myself but not at the expense, as would appear in this case, of the livelihood of a married man with a family.</P>
    <P>I do not object to the boy getting a job but in this instance I think a man with four of a family should get preference.  The Minister knows and will agree with me that an unmarried person seeking unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance will receive a lesser weekly allowance than a married man with four of a family.  An unemployed married man is a greater burden on the Exchequer than an unemployed single man.  Therefore, it is good economics, apart from everything else, to allow a married man to earn the money to enable him to rear his family and to let the younger lad, who has no ties in the country, emigrate&mdash;because emigration faces Carlin and, if he emigrates, another home is closed.</P>
    <P>I should like also to put on record that any time that I have visited the Minister's Office I was received with courtesy.  I feel it difficult to come in <Col N="1603" /> here tonight and to accuse the Minister of listening to political talk from the North-East constituency of Donegal. It was common knowledge in the parish of St. Johnston, and it had been common knowledge for a month before the appointment was made, that Carlin was out and Joseph Peoples was getting the job.  I should like to remind the Minister and the House that that was not peculiar to his Department. We in Donegal at the moment experience jobbery at its worst.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying I firmly believe that if a person who supported the Fianna Fáil Party up to now applied for this job, he would not be considered because the person who got it was either a secretary or acting secretary of the local Fianna Fáil cumann.  In discharging his duties, the Minister should take into consideration the human aspects involved. He should not be persuaded by political influence to give a boy of 18 a job over a man with four of a family.  It is not peculiar to the Minister's Department alone.  The position in Donegal since I came into politics has been jobbery, jobbery, jobbery.</P>

      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to consider the facts I have put to him.  I know he is an honest-to-goodness man and I would ask him to reconsider this position or to give another job to this man. Unless this man gets justice, the emigrant ship is starting him in the face, and like many of his friends in the village of St. Johnston, he will have to emigrate simply because he was not a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy mind the stones in Connemara? I am glad you have adopted the Connemara scheme described in Deputy Dillon's time as £300 an acre. Here we have a young man not 18 years of age applying for the job of postman.  We have a married man with four of family&mdash;the sole support of a wife and four children&mdash;also applying for the post of postman.  What happens?  An interview is held and he gets the job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>But that does not satisfy the local Fianna Fáil cumann.  He is notified he has got the job, that he should attend and he is asked for his birth certificate.  The next thing that happens is that a Fianna Fáil Deputy gets on the job. A second interview is held, knowing that on the date of this interview, a young officer of a Fianna Fáil cumann will have reached the qualifying age of 18.  The second interview is held and this official of the Fianna Fáil cumann is appointed postman down in the village of St. Johnston.  Does it not stink of political corruption?</P>
