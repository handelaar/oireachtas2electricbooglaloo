    <P>1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of the accession to associate membership of the EEC by Greece and the fact that the Government have had thereby an opportunity of studying the immediate implications of associate membership on an economically backward country comparable to Ireland, the Government intend to study these implications in relation to Irish conditions, where possible, so as to enable the desirability of looking for associate rather than full membership of the EEC to be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject the implication in the Question that Ireland is an economically backward country, unable to assume the obligations of membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>The principal features of the terms governing the association of Greece with the Community were known when the Government decided to apply for membership of the Community. As regards the considerations which caused the Government to decide for membership rather than association, I would refer the Deputies to the reply I gave to a similar Question on the 28th March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply in which he states that he rejects the suggestion that Ireland is an economically backward country, is he aware that in the White <Col N="924" /> Paper published in 1961, it is stated that Ireland, Greece, Turkey and Iceland were looking for special consideration, in view of the fact that those countries were in the course, only, of economic development, and in the light of the Government's view at that stage that Ireland and Turkey were on the same basis so far as the Free Trade Area was concerned, would the Taoiseach now state how Ireland has developed so fast in such a short space of time as to enable the Taoiseach to apply for full membership instead of associate membership for which Greece has successfully applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Good government would be one answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that it is some time after the EFTA discussions, I would ask the Taoiseach whether he has read the CIO reports investigating the present position of Ireland's industries, whether he has seen their conclusions, and whether he accepts from those conclusions that Ireland is completely unprepared to take on full membership at present without inflicting very grave hardship and bringing about a very considerable amount of unemployment instead of looking for associate membership under which we would have a longer period for the reduction of tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I arrived at a completely opposite conclusion from reading the reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's facile reply that good government was possibly the reason for the change, surely the Taoiseach does not suggest that between 1961 and 1962 revolutionary changes in Ireland's economic position took place which would warrant an alteration in the Government's view on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is postdating the statement which he has quoted by about five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach deny the statements published in the White Paper of 1961 that &ldquo;Ireland participated throughout in the Free Trade Area negotiations and took a <Col N="925" /> particular part in efforts to find solutions to the problem of member countries in course of economic development&mdash;Ireland, Greece, Turkey and Iceland&rdquo;, and that the solutions envisaged extended transitional periods, special arrangements for agriculture, and long-term dismantlement periods in respect of industrial tariffs? Does the Taoiseach now go away from the stand he took in 1961?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is well aware, the European Economic Community is an entirely different proposition from the old Free Trade Area plan and much more attractive to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach appreciate the serious and cowardly implication that once he had got rid of the stumbling block of his predecessor, he was able to get the country moving into this condition of alleged prosperity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary estimate of the number of turkeys in June 1962 was 819,100.  This total is 224,100 less than the preliminary estimate of 1,043,200 for 1960 and 159,300 less than the final figure of 978,400 for 1960.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is customary for the Central Statistics Office to submit their provisional June turkey figures to the Department of Agriculture before they are made available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is customary for the Central Statistics Office to communicate to Government Departments, before general publication, the results of statistical inquiries with which those Departments are directly concerned, particularly when estimated figures are involved.  This procedure is followed in connection with the provisional results of the June agricultural enumeration (including the figures for turkeys) which are communicated to the Department of Agriculture before publication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it that the Central Statistics Office reserves and exercises the right of publishing what, in their judgment, is the authoritative figure in the event of a difference existing between the estimates of the Statistics Office and a Department of State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that this question relates not to authoritative figures but to estimated figures and he will understand there is always a certain scope for debate in preparing estimates.  The purpose is to make these estimates as reliable as possible and the Central Statistics Office will, of course, endeavour to ensure that in all circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy perhaps will realise from what I have said that all early cases, that is, the pre-1952 or pre-1953 cases, all had to be calculated individually.  There was no opportunity of doing them in classes and it meant a very big number of individual calculations. It is expected, however, that the greater number of the cases, with the exception of a few difficult ones, will be finished within the next week or two and that there will be no case left before Christmas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider instructing valuers to consult, where possible, owners requiring a revision of valuation; and if he will indicate the powers and duties of valuers both to the Government and to individual ratepayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Valuation Acts, the revision of valuations is entrusted to the Commissioner of Valuation.</P>
      <P>Valuers have instructions from the Commissioner to get in touch with the occupiers, owners or other persons interested in premises under revision so as to obtain from them all necessary information.  It will be appreciated, however, that, owing to pressure of work caused by a marked increase in recent years in the number of requests for revision of valuations, it is not possible in all cases for Revising Valuers to await the convenience of owners, occupiers and their agents in arranging for such consultation before the valuation is made.</P>
      <P>In this regard the duty of Valuers is to revise the valuation of the tenements listed by the rating authorities each year as requiring revision.  For this purpose they are empowered by the Valuation Acts to enter property if necessary and, if such entry is opposed by the owner or occupier thereof, the Valuer may serve on him three days' notice requiring to be permitted to enter the same, and at any reasonable time after delivery of such notice may make such entry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already stated, a survey of the River Suir catchment, which is the largest so far tackled and comprises about 870,000 acres, was commenced in June, 1960, and can hardly be completed before 1964, or even 1965.  After that a further period will be required for the preparation of a detailed scheme and compliance with the provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 in relation to exhibition etc.  The need for arterial drainage in the catchment is fully appreciated.  It is hoped to be able to start work about 1970, but, at this stage and in a proposal of this size, I cannot make this <Col N="934" /> a definite commitment.  No works have yet been carried out in the catchment area under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The average price at which maize, including milo, was imported in the period from 1st January, 1962, to 30th September, 1962, which is the latest date up to which statistics are available, is, £19.18.0. per ton c.i.f. Statistics regarding milo are not separately available.  The average price at which wheat offals were imported in the same period was £20.9.0. per ton c.i.f.</P>
      <P>The price of unmillable wheat of the 1962 crop sold by An Bord Gráin on the home market is approximately £22 a ton.  Details were published by the Board on 27th October, 1962.</P>
      <P>Export sales by the Board have been at prices ranging from £16.10.0. per ton f.o.b. to £17.15.0. per ton ex-store.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister how he justifies the imports of large quantities of maize and milo and of large quantities of pollard of inferior feeding value, while we have such enormous quantities of unmillable wheat which, comparatively <Col N="944" /> speaking, is of high feeding value for export?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the House on a number of occasions the several reasons for that decision.  I suppose I must try to repeat some of them.  As the Deputy is aware, the acreage under feeding barley has been increasing substantially in recent years.  There is a guaranteed price to the grower.  When a guaranteed price is given, it is necessary to make arrangements for the taking up of the crop and paying for it at that price.  These announcements have to be made early on&mdash;in fact, the announcement this year of the confirmation of that arrangement with the compound feeding stuff manufacturers was announced some time in July&mdash;and it is not possible to visualise what the wheat crop will be like at that time. These are considerations that have to be kept in mind, as well as the additional consideration that in a year such as this, when you have a large percentage of unmillable wheat, and when you have increased acreage and increased tonnage of barley, as we had this year, it is necessary at the same time to think in terms of convenient and economic storage.  Any decision made in this regard was made in full consultation with the Grain Board and other interests before this necessary course was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister first, how, outside of Grangegorman asylum, a scheme can be operated by the Irish Department of Agriculture under which we export wheat at £16 10s. per ton and import inferior Russian pollard at £20 9s. per ton; secondly, if it is not true that the transport used in emptying the ships of Russian pollard was not in fact withdrawn from the task of moving Irish wheat from Irish fields to mills; and thirdly, whether it is not true that Russian pollard taken off ships at the North Wall occupies just as much storage space as Irish wheat taken off a field in Ireland?  Outside Grangegorman, how could any scheme of that kind commend itself to an Irish Minister for Agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, as the Deputy knows very well, very easy at <Col N="945" /> Question Time to misrepresent the situation with which the Department and myself are confronted in this regard. But I can assure the Deputy and the House that when it is necessary, as it is every year, to make an arrangement for the taking up of the barley crop, all the problems which strike us in regard to the wheat harvest are not apparent to everybody.  The arrangement made in regard to barley for the past three years or so, was entered into in an experimental way with my full approval.  I found it a very excellent arrangement, indeed, which worked splendidly in comparison with the situation that existed prior to this method of purchase of the barley crop.  But when you strike a year like this, when more than 50 per cent. of the wheat crop is unmillable and which also gives a heavy yield, we cannot at that stage simply say that the arrangement which we made with the compounders is no longer workable from our point of view, that we abandon that arrangement.  That cannot be done.  Barley is encouraged for the purpose of providing as much of our feed requirements as possible.  Wheat is grown for an entirely different purpose&mdash;for conversion into flour for human consumption.  Some years, as a result of a bad harvest, we find ourselves having to handle, in addition to the barley, that unmillable wheat. There is nothing daft about the decisions that have been made in this regard.  They are the only practicable decisions any sensible person could make, having regard to all the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want a specific answer to this question, which I think is a reasonable one.  How can you justify selling Irish wheat at £16 10s. per ton and, on the same day, buying Russian pollard at £20 9s. shipped here?  If that does not sound daft, what does?</P>

      <P>Our understanding with the compounders is that they will provide <Col N="946" /> a ready market at a fixed price for all the barley grown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of that agreement, they are allowed licences for the import of maize and milo following discussions with my Department. In addition, they are reasonably free to import offal.  We entered into that arrangement with them deliberately because we were convinced it was the best arrangement and much more attractive than the previous arrangement in the sense that, under it, feeding stuffs are provided at a cheaper rate than they otherwise would be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me (1) whether he has now imposed restrictions on the import of feeding stuffs that can be replaced by millable wheat and (2) how much this arrangement he refers to is worth to the compounders or millers, whichever it is?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first year in which this arrangement was operated satisfactorily.  There has been no scheme for the purchase of grain in respect of which I received fewer complaints.  It is an ideal scheme.  I know that when we get harvests such as the one through which we have passed, wheat can become a problem. But you cannot blow hot and cold on these matters.  You have to face up in an honourable way to the problems presented by a bad harvest, and not by attempting to sidestep the contractual obligations you have entered into and which have worked satisfactorily in a normal year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if the issue of licences for the import of coarse grains, including maize and milo, is restricted to any group of persons or companies; if the issue of such licences is conditional on the uptake of the native barley crop; if so, who the persons <Col N="947" /> or companies are (a) who guarantee the uptake, and (b) who have received import licences for coarse grains, including maize and milo, since 1st January, 1962.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Licences for the import of maize and milo are granted only to members of the Federation of Irish Feeding Stuffs Manufacturers in consideration of their undertaking to provide a ready market at the guaranteed price for all home-produced feeding barley.</P>
      <P>When imports of milling and feeding oats are necessary, due to a shortage of home supplies, the import licences are granted to oatmeal millers and horse feeders, respectively.</P>
      <P>The question of licences for the import of feeding barley does not arise.</P>

      <P>Seven new merchandise licences have been issued since 14th November, 1959, to date.  Three licences were for the carriage of newspapers; one licence was for the carriage of chilled horse meat in refrigerated containers from Straffan, Co. Kildare, to the Border, and one licence was for haulage on Valentia Island.  The two remaining licences were replacements of existing licences; one replaced an existing licence on Achill Island and one, which issued following a change of ownership of the transport firm concerned, replaced the existing licence for the carriage of horse meat.</P>
      <P>Particulars of all merchandise licences issued under the Road Transport Acts including the areas of their operation are contained in the Statutory Register of Merchandise Licences prescribed by Section 29 of the Road Transport Act, 1933, which is open to inspection in my Department at all reasonable times.</P>
      <P>Seventy-one passenger licences authorising the operation of passenger road services have been issued since 14th November, 1960, to date.  The routes of the services authorised by these licences are shown in a tabular statement which I propose, with the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose taking Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Inquiry into Internal Transport did not recommend any particular reduction in the numbers of staff employed by CIE but accepted that substantial redundancy would necessarily arise as a result of the implementation of its recommendation for reorganisation of the undertaking. This reorganisation included not only drastic pruning of the railway system but a major improvement in the productivity of the railway which, measured by European standards, was extremely low; rail traffic density and utilisation of rolling stock were the lowest in Europe and this was reflected in the number of railway employees in relation to volume of traffic being more than twice the European average.  In calculating the cost of compensation on the basis of the redundancy likely to arise the Committee envisaged the possibility of 40 per cent. of the entire railway staff becoming redundant.</P>
      <P>The total sum paid by CIE in redundancy compensation from 1st January, 1959, to 30th September, 1962, was approximately £800,000 and this amount has been or will be recouped by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Further redundancy is likely to arise in connection with further closings of branch lines and under the various schemes for reorganisation of CIE in respect of which Orders applying the redundancy compensation provisions have already been made under Section 14 of the Transport Act, 1958.  No firm estimate of final figures of redundancy is yet available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> The total number of staff employed by CIE on 4th January, 1959, (excluding staff employed by the Hotels and Catering Services now the responsibility of Ostlanna Iompair Éireann) was 21,961.  The corresponding figure on 14th October, 1962, was 21,764.</P>
    <P>This reduction is accounted for by a substantial redundancy on the rail side offset by a considerable increase in employment elsewhere, particularly on road freight.  Full particulars of CIE staff by grade at March in each year are published in the Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the apparently mad hatter economics of CIE, which asks the public to pay the best part of £1,000,000 in redundancy payments of one kind or another for persons who are declared redundant, while they bring about a virtually static situation in the employment position by reemploying other persons and, at the same time, close down existing stations?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the warranty which purchasers of new motor cars in this country are generally required to sign operates in fact to curtail the rights of the purchaser, having regard to the Sale of Goods Acts; and whether, as most people sign these warranties in the belief that they are receiving a special facility, he will arrange that it be required of those selling new cars in this country to attach to the warranty a simple statement setting out what the warranty means, somewhat on the lines of the requirement under the Hire Purchase Acts, so as to inform the purchaser of exactly what he is committing himself to if he signs the warranty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, generally speaking, prospective purchasers of cars who refuse to sign the standard form of guarantee would not, ordinarily, be unable to complete the purchase.  I have no reason to depart from the view which I expressed in reply to a similar question on this matter on 11th April, 1961, that, from the information available to me legislation on the subject is not called for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not know that where a car is sold to a member of the public and that person has been misguided enough to sign a warranty, should that car break down due to a major fault in the car as sold to him, he then has to pay the labour costs of repairing the car?  Does he not agree that this is the only group of manufacturers who have this right and that if it happens in the case of any other article which is sold, the purchaser is covered by law?  Does the Minister not think that this is of major importance to thousands and thousands of people throughout the country and will he not take some <Col N="956" /> steps to protect the public against being fleeced in the manner in which they are being fleeced by car manufacturers and dealers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The most practical step I could take in that connection would be to require that the obligation on the purchaser to pay for transport of parts and extraction of parts would be set out in the agreement but that is, in fact, the case.  That is clearly set out in the agreement the person signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that door-to-door canvassing is an aspect of hire-purchase sales methods.  All hire-purchase transactions are subject to the requirements of the Hire-Purchase Acts and I have no evidence that those requirements have proved inadequate to protect purchasers from being exploited.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Acts do not lay down requirements in relation to hire-purchase charges, which are a matter for settlement between the contracting parties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal submitted to me by the Donegal County Manager with the consent of the county council was for the creation of an additional office of rate collector to enable the local authority to give effect to their decision to divide Districts Nos. 16 and 20 between three collectors on a salary and bonus basis.  In sanctioning the proposal, I took into account the local authority's view that District No. 16 was too big for one collector on the standard salary and the fact that the cost of collection by three salaried collectors would be less than it would be if two collectors were appointed at the poundage rates of remuneration which applied to the former holders of the offices.  No alternative proposal was submitted to me by the county manager.</P>
      <P>The making of a surcharge as suggested in the Question is not a matter for me, but I do not think that expenses of the nature involved here have to be specifically provided in the Estimate.  There is an overall economy in the arrangements now approved as compared with the former arrangement of two collectors on poundage rates of remuneration.</P>

      <P>The Leader of the Opposition does not understand what has been replied to.  There are two districts in question in this particular case, Nos. 16 and 20.  The two districts combined heretofore were collected on a poundage basis at a cost which, had there been no additional rebate in the agricultural grant last year, would amount, this year, on the present rate in the £ in Donegal, to £2,250.  That would be drawn by two people, as heretofore, on a poundage basis.  The proposal from the county council which I have approved of will bring about a situation wherein three collectors will be employed on these two districts on a salary and bonus basis, the sum total of which salaries and bonuses will amount to somewhere over £1,900 and it is three districts made out of two, not two made out of one, as would appear to be the suggestion here at the moment.</P>

      <P>The claimant to old age (contributory) pension referred to by the Deputy did not fail to qualify as a result of Departmental error.  His claim was rejected because he did not satisfy the contribution condition which requires that he must have a yearly average of not less than 24 contributions paid or credited.  As he reached the age of 70 in 1954 this average fell to be calculated in his case over the ten or fifteen contribution years which ended in December, 1953. His employment by the Cork Harbour Commissioners from April, 1928, to December, 1952, was excepted from insurance under the National Health Insurance Acts and accordingly no contributions were payable in respect <Col N="966" /> of him for that period.  His employment was, however, insurable from January, 1953, under the Social Welfare Act, 1952.  Contributions paid or credited in respect of this insurance were not sufficient to give him the required average of 24 contributions per year in either of the periods mentioned.</P>

Are there many people disqualified as a result of these exceptional circumstances and, if not, would the Minister consider this limited category of cases and consider amending legislation whereby people who were in ordinarily insurable employment but for some exceptional statutory reason did not in fact stamp cards could be brought within the general intention of the contributory pension scheme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>There would be, I am sure, a number of cases of people who were not insurable until the Social Welfare Act of 1952.

A vast body of the people of the country are not in insurable employment &mdash; shopkeepers, self-employed persons and so on&mdash;but there were limited categories of people who would be in what would be ordinarily insurable employment but were by statute exempted from stamping cards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>When I moved to report progress on Thursday evening last, I was referring to the fact that the Gaeltacht has declined.  The numbers of those within the Gaeltacht, despite the best efforts that have been made under the schemes so far in operation, show that those who speak the Irish language and remain as that type of entity, have been declining in each successive census.  One is tempted to ask now whether the impact of what has been done, and is being done, economically for the Gaeltacht has not, in fact, defeated its own ends.</P>
      <P>The building of hotels and motels in the Gaeltacht, bringing in their train an influx of tourists to the Gaeltacht, was undoubtedly a type of economic improvement everybody would wish to see the people in the Gaeltacht achieve.  But, simultaneously, it has also brought a further assault on the language itself, on the traditions of the people and on their outlook in regard to the language.  Remembering the type of life introduced and the kind of people who go to these areas, I wonder has the Minister considered whether this has not had the effect of making the people of the Gaeltacht feel that there is something inferior in their position, with the result that they attempt at the earliest possible opportunity to rid themselves of this kind of badge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> The Gaeltacht will now have the further impact of television.  The impact of wireless has had a most disturbing effect in that traditional life in the Gaeltacht has been effected. If we add television to that, is the Minister satisfied that the moral fibre of the people with regard to the language is so good and so consistent that it will not be affected in the same way?  Those who have gone to the Gaeltacht to learn Irish have seen for themselves the present trend, even though they bring back from the Gaeltacht a better knowledge of the language.  I mentioned earlier that I think it is absolutely essential that the Minister and the Department of the Gaeltacht should very seriously consider this aspect of the whole situation.</P>
    <P>It seems to me rather an anomaly at the present time that where an effort is being made by young people to speak the language, and also by people willing to devote a great deal of their time to encouraging young people outside the Gaeltacht areas to speak the language, that that effort is not being appreciated in the way it should be.  I refer to the scheme of scholarships operated under the auspices of the Department of the Gaeltacht. Under that scheme the Department makes available to outside bodies, such as Coiste na bPaistí and the Gaelic Athletic Association, sums of up to £4 10s. annually to supplement their efforts in sending young people to the Gaeltacht.  That is very laudable. One finds, however, that that scheme operates to move people to send children into the Gaeltacht area, children who might otherwise go to one of the colleges doing the same type of work in, I suggest, a more praiseworthy fashion because they operate under disadvantages.</P>
    <P>One is tempted to ask why it is that these colleges cannot have the benefit of that annual £4 10s. also?  Surely it was never intended that the Gaeltacht would be confined to certain areas if, by the Gaeltacht, we mean the advancement of the language as the spoken language?  People quote, often very glibly indeed, the dictum of that famous Irishman who went to the <Col N="1011" /> Gaeltacht and who conceived the phrase &ldquo;Ireland not only free but Gaelic as well.&rdquo;  But Pearse never envisaged the Gaeltacht kept behind a stone wall or in one particular portion of the country.  Surely the ambition at that stage was the spread of the language as the spoken language of the people.  Surely it was envisaged that its very existence nowadays would depend upon the effort put into the movement by the people of the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, there is a body, Comhar-Chumann Ide Naofa; this body has set up colleges at Foynes and Ballybunion.  Children have been going to these colleges during the summer holidays.  Surely schemes put into operation now, should not have the effect of lessening the number of children who might avail of the opportunity provided for them in these colleges.  If Coiste na bPáistí and Cumann Luithchleas Gael and kindred organisations, are sending children to these colleges they are deserving of support.  If they send them across the Shannon they can get £4 10/- extra under the schemes.  Would it not be a gesture on the part of Roinn na Gaeltachta to give equal treatment to all who are endeavouring to further the cause of the language and apply this scholarship scheme with a view to extending the use of Irish as the spoken language in other parts of the country?</P>
    <P>I inquired from the Department of Education and I found that the scheme is operated by the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that he and his Department owe it to the people who are struggling to advance the language outside the Gaeltacht, to assist them in that fashion, by not discriminating or making it appear to be discriminating against people who are making every effort in the cause of the language. That would be a help, and it would certainly be a mark of appreciation which the State owes to the people who devote their spare time to organising these courses and indeed, very often, to teaching in those centres.</P>
    <P>I said the last evening that if the number of people within the Gaeltacht <Col N="1012" /> proper is declining and if the number of people who speak the language is declining, a more serious effort should be made to encourage an increase rather than a decline outside the Gaeltacht areas, in the Breac-Ghaeltacht or the Galltacht.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to Gaeltarra Éireann.  The Board are now outside the ordinary procedure of being inspected in this House.  Although their report is laid on the Table of the House, it required a series of Questions to the Minister to find out what exactly is the state of affairs in Gaeltarra Éireann.  The Minister's statement makes it clear that in the past year they suffered a loss.  That is nothing new, I am sorry to say, despite the efforts of the sub-division of the Department previously and the Board.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister tell the House why it is, or in what fashion, Gaeltarra Éireann are losing these amounts?  I know that on previous occasions it was ascertained by questioning the officials that the efforts they were making to develop the industry, the lace and other industries, were not meeting with commercial success.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us whether the same difficulty exists at present and if the commercial methods being employed are not achieving results.  I notice that there has been an increase &mdash;I am glad to say&mdash;in the export of tweed.  I should like to hear from the Minister what is the position in regard to the toy industry and whether there has been any further expansion in that industry.  Anyone who looks at the statistics can see that a lot of cheap toys are being imported.  What impact have we been able to make on that market from our native resources?</P>
    <P>Again, specifically, I should like to ask the Minister what is the position in regard to lace.  On a previous occasion, we found that some of the articles being made were not required evidently.  Of course, that is to be expected. In any industry which is starting off, there will be a period of trial and error.  I should like to hear from the Minister if that period is over and if we might now say that the industry is on a sound basis and will become an economic proposition commercially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1013" /> I want to suggest to the Minister that all this effort at commercial improvement in the Gaeltacht and the making of the lives of the people there more economic is not the whole purpose or the sole purpose of the Department of the Gaeltacht.  Its purpose really is to preserve the living culture of the people and the native language of the country.  We may make the people there better off&mdash;that would be the aim of any State Department&mdash;but when we speak of the Gaeltacht, and when the Minister speaks of the Gaeltacht, we should be thinking in terms of the preservation of the spoken language of the people.</P>
    <P>If that has not been achieved, it is time for the Minister to ask for the advice of those bodies who are working towards that aim, irrespective of where they are located to try to find for consideration by himself and for putting before the Government a scheme whereby one Gaeltacht area&mdash; and I would suggest the largest, the Connemara Gaeltacht&mdash;would be made a pilot scheme to ensure that the efforts of the Minister, his Department and his predecessors are not wasted.</P>
    <P>Mar adúras cheana, is oth linn go bhfuil líon na ndaoine sa Ghaeltacht ag dul i laghad agus é sin in ainneoin na n-iarrachtaí atá á ndéanamh ag an Aireacht ó bunaíodh é.  Béidir go bhfuil staid na ndaoine atá fágtha ann níos fearr maidir le cursaí airgid, ach ní h-é sin le rá go bhfuil staid na teangan agus an cultúr Gaelach níos fearr.

Cuirfear siar an éileamh ar feadh sé mhí go dtí go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ag an cailín.  Níl sé sin ceart, beag nó mór.

Cinneadh an tráth úd go gcuirfí timthirí imeasc na ndaoine chun iad do ghríosadh chun an teanga a labhairt.  Cuireadh cúrsaí ar fáil do mhúinteoirí agus do dhaoine a thug gean don teanga agus tugadh duaiseanna do mhuirghineacha a bhain an chraobh leo i gcomortaisí.  Lean an scéal mar seo ar feadh scaithimh agus tig le duine ar bith a chur spéis sa ghluaiseacht a rá go raibh spiorad agus borradh, ní h-amháin sa Ghaeltacht, ach sa bhreac-Ghaeltacht chomh maith.  Tamall ina dhiaidh sin, cuireadh Coimisiún na Gaeltachta ar bun. Bhí na heólaithe ba mhó tábhacht sa tír ar an gCoimisiún sin.  Deineadh scéal na Gaeltachta a chíoradh go mion agus cuireadh tuarascáil mhaith mhór fé cló i 1925-26.  Léirítear dúinn ins na léirscáileanna a ghabhann leis an dtuairisc cad iad na limistéirí a bhí sa Ghaeltacht; an líon daoine a bhí i ngach limistéir díobh, agus an méid faoin gcéad don phobal go raibh an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil aca.  Léiríodh freisin na limistéirí a bhí sa bhreac-Ghaeltacht maraon leis an méid faoin gcéad den phobal a bhí indán Gaeilge a labhairt ionta.  Tá cóip den tuarascáil <Col N="1016" /> sin sa leabharlann anso thíos agus táim cinnte nár léigh trian de Theachtaí an Tí seo riamh í.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Coimisiún moltaí áirithe agus glacadh le cuid acu.  Tugadh deontaisí le haghaidh tithe, cróite agus rudaí nach iad do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus tugadh screapall airgid do na leanaí go raibh an Ghaeilge mar úrlabhra aca ar theacht ar scoil dóibh. Acht in ainneóin na ndeóntaisí is na screapall, thosnaigh an Béarla ag brú thar teórainn isteach agus rug buaidh ar an nGaeilge i gcuid de na limistéirí a cláraíodh mar Ghaeltacht ag an gCoimisiún.  Tá daoine ann a chuireann milleán ar mhuintir na limistéir i dtreis agam ach, dom dhóigh-sa, ní bhfuaradar cothrom na Féinne ó Rialtas ar bith dá raibh againn ó 1922 gus an lá inniu.  Ní h-aoibhinn liom&mdash; is oth liom&mdash;é seo a rá, ach creidim gur gá é rá.  Creidim go raibh de dhualgas ar gach Rialtas a bhí againn sa tír seo féachaint chuige ná béarfadh an Béarla oiread is órlach amháin ó Ghaeltacht, beag nó mór.  In ionad an dualgas sin a chóimhlíonadh, deineadh sceanairt, blúire ar bhlúire, ar na limistéirí beaga go dtí gur cuireadh i ndísc iad agus ansan dúbharthas ná raibh na haicmí a lonnaig ionnta seasmhach ná dílis don Ghaeilge. Cuireadh Acht i bhfeidhm sa Tig seo do chum leasa na gceanntar neamhfhorbartha. Shíleamar go gcuirfí tionnscail de shaghas éigin, beag nó mór, ar bun agus go gcoimeádfaí na Gaeilgeoirí óg ag baile, nó ar a laghad, cómhgarach don bhaile.  Ní call dom a rá cad do thárla.

    <P>Tá an Ghaeltacht ag dul i laghad in aghaidh an lae agus ní thiocfaidh feabhas ar an scéal go dtí go mbeidh slí bheatha ag pobal na Gaeltachta. Ní h-aon tairbhe dhúinn bheith ag cuimhneamh go bhfanfaidh na daoine óga ann ar an mbeagán a bhí acu go dtí seo.  Creidim gur gean leis an Aire an Ghaeilge agus lucht a labhartha. Más gean, baineadh sé an bréid de fhéin agus téadh sé i gcomhairle le gach eagraíocht atá ag obtair ar son na teangan féachaint a bhféadfaí an cneadh a leigheas.  Ní h-aon tairbhe <Col N="1017" /> na ceitiní beaga atá sa Mheastachán. Ní h-aon tairbhe cleas an philibín a imirt a thuille.  Déantar gníomh maith mór sul a gcreimfear an t-anam as an nGaeltacht.  Deintear go luath é nó eirítear as.  Obair atá de dhíth ar an nGaeltacht.  Obair mhaith sheasmhach agus má níonn an t-Aire fiú amháin tús a chur leis, beifear buíoch dó.</P>

      <P>Tá mé buíoch des na Teachtaí a labhair ar an Meastachán seo.  Is maith liom i gcónaí tuairimí agus moltaí a fháil ó na daoine a bhfuil spéis acu sa Ghaeltacht agus sa Ghaeilge.  Níl éinne lántsásta leis an dul ar aghaidh atá á dhéanamh ach támuid go léir ar aon aigne go gcaithfear leanúint leis na h-iarrachtaí agus go gcaithfear gach dícheall a dhéanamh cun feabhas a chur ar shlí beatha mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
      <P>Labhair an Teachta Ó Dómhnaill ar roinnt ceisteanna spéisiúla agus ba mhaith liom a thuille eolais a thúirt dó.  Is maith liom go bhfuil suim aige san obair atá ar siúl chun páistí a chur ag foghluim Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Admhaím go mba mhaith an rud é dá bhféadfaí páistí ó ó'n Ghalltacht a bheith sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh na bliana uilig ach tá tosach déanta ar scéim den tsaghas sin cheana.  Na páistí a théann go dtí na bun-scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht, caitheann siad trí mhí as a chéile sa Ghaeltacht agus téann páistí ann gach téarma scoile.  Mar sin féin. bíonn roint páistí ó'n Ghalltacht sa Ghaeltacht ar feadh na bliana agus tá súil agam go mbainfidh páistí na Galltachta a thuille feidhme as an scéim seo ins na blianta atá ag teacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní féidir liom ghlacadh leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Ó Dómhnaill faoi Ghaeltarra Éireann.  Ní féidir Gaeltarra Éireann a chur i gcomparáid le cólucht gnótha.  Ní chun airgead a dhéanamh a bunaíodh Gaeltarra Éireann ach chun obair a sholáthar agus seirbhís soisialach a chur ar fáil ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta agus na gceanntracha cumhang.  Is léir domsa go bhfuil iarracht mhaith á dhéanamh ag Bord Gaeltarra Éireann. Tá feabhas ag teacht ar thionscail bréidín agus níl éinne anois nach bhfuil sásta go bhfuil dul ar aghaidh déanta, go mór mhór i measc na <Col N="1018" /> bhfíodóirí i gCondae Dún na nGall. Tuigim ó'n Bhord go bhfuil súil aca go mbeidh feabhas maith le fáil de bharr na gléasanna nua atá acu agus go dtiocfaidh forbairt mhór ar an tionscal uilig.</P>
    <P>Tá athrú ar an scéal go raibh fíodóirí ag gearán faoi trí mhí ó shoin.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an chúis ghearáin céanna acu anois.  Ar chuma ar bith, is féidir liom a rá gur tháinig forbairt mhór ar an tionscal agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an fhorbairt sin ag teacht ó bliain go bliain.</P>
    <P>Rinne an Teachta Ó Dómhnaill, freisin, an-chaint faoi ghnó Gaeltarra Éireann.  Is ait an rud é agus is ionadh liom é nach gcloistear ach gearáin ó dhaoine áirithe i gCondae Dún na nGall faoi Gaeltarra Éireann.  An tionscal bréidín, ar ndóigh, a bhíonn i gceist i gcónaí aca.  Níor chuala mé ó na daoine sin gur chuir Gaeltarra Éireann suas le £90,000 agus gur chuireadar obair ar fáil do bhreis is 100 fíodóirí agus suas le 140 oibrithe nach fíodóirí iad san muileann atá acu sa chontae sin i gCill Charra.  Im thuairim féin, tá an brabús is mó bhí ag Ghaeltarra Éireann ag dul go dtí Condae Dún na nGall faoi fíodóireacht agus an obair eile atá ar siúl san chontae sin.  Mar dúirt mé cheana, is ait an rud é, mar sin, go mbíonn gearáin mar seo ó Teachtaí as Dún na nGall.</P>
    <P>Fuair mé amach go bhfuil suas le 500 daoine fostaithe tríd an chontae sin faoi Ghaeltarra Éireann, faoi na gnóthaí éagsúla atá ar siúl ag an mBord ins an chontae sin.  Tá mé cinnte go mbeadh muintir na Gaeltachta i gContae Mhuigheo nó na Gaillimhe an-shásta ar fad, cuir i gcás, go raibh an méid fostaíochta sin ar siúl ins na Gaeltachta éagsúla.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ina ghearán faoi Gaeltarra Éireann go dtéann siad i gcoimhlint le daoine príomháideacha atá ag obair ins an gnó céanna.  Sé mo thuairim féin, gurab é sin an chúis go mbíonn clamhsán mar sin ag teacht anseo ó am go h-am.  Bíonn an rud sin ann i gcónaí nuair a bhíonn daoine gnótha i gcoimhlint le n-a chéile.  Ó'n scéala atá agamsa, tá an t-airgead atá ag dul do na daoine atá fostaithe ag Gaeltarra Éireann mar fhíodóirí i gContae Dún na <Col N="1019" /> nGall i bhfad níos aoirde ná an méid atá ag dul do na daoine ins na gnóthaí éagsúla eile ins an gcontae sin. Sin é an scéala a fuair mise.  Mar adúras, is ait an rud é go mbíonn gearáin mar sin ag teacht anuas anseo ó am go h-am tar éis an méid fostaíochta agus an méid oibre atá ag dul ar aghaidh ins an chontae sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Gaeltarra Éireann i gcoitianta, tríd is tríd, tá mé sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh ag an mBord.  Tá ceithre tionscail éagsúla le na chéile acu agus d'réir na bhfigiúirí atá le feiceáil ins an Tuarascáil Bhliantúil a leagadh ós cóir an Oireachtais le goirid, tháinig feabhas nacht beag ar ghnó an Bhoird i rith na bliana airgeadais seo caithe.  D'fhéadfadh an scéal a bheith níos fearr, ar ndóigh, ach má thagann an lá nuair nach mbeidh aon chlamhsáin le cloisteáil beidh a ndóithin déanta ag an mBórd.</P>
    <P>Go h-áirithe, caithimid cuimhniú ar an bhfirinne gur gnó é seo a bhíonn ag brath ar chúrsaí fáisiúin.  Is olc an rud é go mbíonn tréimhsí gan lán-obair a bheith i lámhaibh fíodóirí.  Is oth leis an mBord go dtarluíonn sin uair ar bith.  Ach tig liom a rá gur ag dul i bhfeabhas atá an scéal agus go bhfuil gach dóchas ann i láthair na h-uaire gur fíor-annamh a bhéas na fíodóirí gan a ndóithin oibre as so amach.  Le firinne, bhí obair le fáil ag gach fíodóir le sé seachtain anuas.  Is maith an rud é go bhfuil an scéal céadna ann i láthair na h-uaire.</P>
    <P>Bhí ceisteanna éagsúla eile ag Teachtaí as Gaeltacht an Iarthair, Muigheo agus Gaillimh, agus Dún na nGall, chó maith, faoi'n scéim tithe gloine agus is oth liom go raibh an mhoill sin ar an scéim as ucht an damáiste stoirme a rinneadh do na tithe sin.  Is trua go raibh a leithéid de mhoill ar shocrú an scéil.  B'éigin d'oifigí Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí a bhí mar fheidhmeanaigh ar son mo Roinne, an damáiste d'aimsiú agus d'iniúchadh agus na deacrachtaí a d'éirigh idir an Oifig agus na connradhthóirí a réiteach maidir le conus ba cheart an obair a dhéanamh agus an méid oibre a bhí ann.  Bhí ceist na hatógála féin le réiteach agus táim díreach tar éis meastachán d'fháil ó <Col N="1020" /> Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí ar cad a cosnóidh sé chun tógáil as an nua.  Bhí orainn socrú cad is fearr a dhéanamh. De ghnáth, nuair a bhíonn trioblóid mar seo idir conrathóir agus Roinn nó éinne eile, bíonn deacrachtaí dlí ann agus bhí deacrachtaí móra sa chás seo.  Ach anois, buíochas le Dia, creidim go bhfuil an cheist beagnach socruithe agus tá súil agam to dtosnófar leis an obair seo i gceann tamaillín bhig.  Is trua nach raibh leigheas eile ar an scéal, ach, mar is eol do chách, bíonn moill mhór idir dlíodóirí i gcásanna mar seo.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the points made on this Estimate and try to remove some obvious misunderstandings in connection with the work of Roinn na Gaeltachta that emerged in the debate.  The question of policy as regards roads done under Roinn na Gaeltachta was raised by Deputy O'Donnell and others and I should like to explain something I thought was well known, that is, that my Department do not carry out these works themselves.  We rely on the SESO office to carry out these road works for us where that Office has an organisation in the counties in which the Gaeltacht areas are situated.  In County Donegal, however, SESO has no local organisation and the work carried out by that office, as agent for me, is actually done by the county engineer.  It is incorrect to state that there is any such occurrence as the county engineer waiting in Donegal or elsewhere for a budget from my Department or an indication of what is to be done.  In actual practice, my Department get from our stiúrthóirí in the different Gaeltacht areas or from Deputies or other representatives, reports about roads in the Gaeltacht. As a matter of practice, we get the SESO officers to go into these with officials of my Department and they give us an estimate as to the cost to my Department.</P>
    <P>In the case of Donegal, we get the county engineer&mdash;or, to be strictly accurate, the SESO Office get the county engineer&mdash;to carry out the work for them.  It does not matter if it comes to 31st March before any such job is done because this is a continuous scheme.  No matter when the county <Col N="1021" /> engineer in Donegal gets an indication to do a certain job, he can do it whether the work runs beyond the financial year or not.  The money is not taken back by my Department.  The money is available for him to complete the work as soon as possible.  Deputies will appreciate that these schemes are designed, outside their utility value, to give employment during the winter months and therefore it is generally towards the end of the year when they are being carried out.  As I have said, it is not correct to assume that if they are not completed by the end of the financial year the money is finished with and comes back to the Department. That is not so.</P>
    <P>As regards road policy generally in the Gaeltacht areas, I should like to point out to Deputy O'Donnell that we have deliberately laid down a policy of doing those roads for which county councils are not responsible. We have many of these to complete yet.  These are what are generally regarded in the area as accommodation roads and I am satisfied that very good work is being done in completing these roads.  They are of the utmost benefit to the people concerned.  Let me say, in passing, that many county councils in areas where Gaeltachta are situated have been very slow in giving cothrom na Féinne to the people of the Gaeltacht area in doing steamrolling work and other work. The Gaeltacht areas are isolated areas with very little political significance. When it comes to planning programmes, I find that local authorities are in many cases very much inclined to forget about the Gaeltacht when they are making up their programme and their budgets for roads in their counties.</P>
    <P>Indeed, I found that as a result of my road scheme in Gaeltacht areas, some local authorities were inclined to say they were well enough off because of this particular road scheme and were not making the provision they should make for them in the normal course of events.  I hope Deputies on all sides of the House who are members of county councils in areas where there are Gaeltachta will co-operate with me in ensuring, <Col N="1022" /> irrespective of any schemes I may be able to provide for the people in these small isolated areas, that their county councils will also do their full share in providing amenities and road services for them.</P>
    <P>It may be that at some future time Deputies might convince me that policy should be changed in this matter as to the type of roads we are making in the Gaeltacht areas but we should give the present policy a trial because it is essential to do these accommodation roads which were left undone for so many years.  Deputy Geoghegan and others suggested that perhaps we should devote some of this money to main roads going into centres of population and so on.  I still feel that for the maximum benefit of the people of the Gaeltacht areas we should continue for at least another while confining ourselves to putting these accommodation roads in order.  Where we do put these accommodation roads in order, I again want to say that we leave them in such a way, that if the local authority is willing to take them over, they can be taken over when we finish with them.  When we are doing them, we try to leave them within the regulations whereby they will be acceptable to local authorities for taking over for future maintenance. I hope local authorities will do so wherever feasible in order to ensure that these roads will be kept in proper condition, once they are constructed under the grants made available by my Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell asked whether any help was given under Scéim na Muc in County Donegal.  I am glad to be able to tell him that, although Donegal traditionally is not a pigproducing area, 55 sows have been allocated to applicants in the Donegal Gaeltacht and in fact there were 24 allocated this year to the Gaeltachta up there.  Therefore Donegal, whether Deputy O'Donnell knows it or not, is getting its fair share under Scéim na Muc and indeed, depending on the interest of the people in the scheme and the demand from the area, we will provide more sows.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment Deputy <Col N="1023" /> O'Donnell on his conversion to the glasshouses.  He said he never believed in them, but he has now changed his mind.  The fact is that these glasshouses have been making a considerable contribution to the economy of the Gaeltacht areas in which they are located. The Deputy talked about providing heat for glasshouses being erected.  I should like to assure him that is being done.  Since the establishment of my Department, heating installations have been provided in every new glasshouse erected.  Since I came into the Department a few years ago, a scheme has been going ahead to provide heating installations in the old glasshouses throughout the country and quite an amount has been done to bring that scheme to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>The figures for the Donegal Gaeltacht are that heating is being installed in 25 houses at the moment, the total number of applications received at present.  In addition, heating installations have already been completed in 34 houses in the county.  As Deputies will appreciate, the applicants themselves must be satisfied to have these installations made.  My Department cannot go in and instal heating, unless these people want it.  The position in Donegal is that every individual who has a glasshouse and who wanted to have heating installed is now either in the position of having it or else it is in the course of being provided for him.  I hope I can relieve the Deputy's mind on that score.</P>
    <P>A beginning has been made in respect of the scheme to send children to the Gaeltacht for 12 months.  They are now sent for the whole school term of three months to a national school in the Gaeltacht.  My Department pay a grant of £19 per child towards this scheme.  Already 700 or 800 children have taken advantage of it.  It is a very successful scheme and is, I understand, having a very good effect in providing the children with the desirable liomhacht and getting them interested in the language.  If Gael Linn succeed in increasing the number of children participating in the scheme, my Department would be happy to co-operate in the matter of grants.  This <Col N="1024" /> scheme, together with the Coisde na bPáistí scheme, has made great strides in recent times and we hope that that trend will continue.  There is no question of cutting down on the financial provision being made for schemes of this kind.  Indeed, we shall be happy if the demand increases year by year, because it indicates the interest parents and organisations have in sending children to the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>The complaints made in connection with the tweed industry are particularly surprising, coming from County Donegal.  It is amazing that, remembering how many people are gainfully engaged in the tweed industry in Donegal under Gaeltarra Eireann, we should have these complaints from Deputies. Last year, £90,000 was spent in Donegal alone on the tweed industry.  The number of people engaged in activities under Gaeltarra Éireann in that county is something over 500.  I am quite sure that other Gaeltachta would be very happy if they had the same story as Donegal to tell.  The tweed industry is, of course, subject to the vagaries of fashion.  Like every other clothing industry, it has its ups and downs.  Gaeltarra Éireann have very nearly half&mdash;46.5 per cent. &mdash;of the total turnover of the tweed industry in the whole country.  Surely that is an indication that they are operating on the right lines in their present expansion?</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic to suggest that one can judge Gaeltarra Eireann in the same way as one can judge private industry.  Those who talk about ordering industry into the Gaeltacht should be realistic in their approach to this matter.  The Gaeltacht areas are the most isolated in the country.  The location of industry depends on the promoters of the industry.  The Gaeltacht areas are isolated areas in which costs of transport are high.  There are other difficulties.  Some of the Gaeltacht areas are situated on islands.  I should be delighted to see more industrial activity in the Gaeltacht.  I should be quite prepared to give whatever help I could to those willing to promote industry in these areas.  But one cannot overlook the realities.  One <Col N="1025" /> cannot take an industrialist by the scruff of the neck and tell him that he must go to this, or that, area.</P>
    <P>There are grave difficulties in locating industry in the Gaeltacht.  That is quite clear to those who know anything about industry or business.  At all events, there is this to be said about Gaeltarra Éireann: while the board have been making losses, their financial position has, in fact, been improving. They are interested in other products than tweed: they are interested in the manufacture of toys, knitwear, lacemaking and so on.  Some of these are carried on in these isolated Gaeltacht areas in a very small way. A business man would naturally be solely concerned with the materialistic side, inspired by the profit motive.  He would not have his activities scattered about in these isolated areas.  The very fact that Gaeltarra Eireann are making the progress they are making, considering where they have to operate and the way in which they must operate, is a matter for satisfaction.</P>
    <P>A new toy factory has gone up in the Connemara Gaeltacht.  It is already in production and it should be going ahead pretty well in a very short time. Judging by the reports I have got from the board, there are good prospects for its success.  I hope we will see a good deal of improvement under that heading of the board's activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask a question? I understood the Minister, when speaking in Irish, to say that Gaeltarra Éireann was not set up to make money but rather as a social service in order to give work in various areas.  That is not what the Minister said in English. Would the Minister reconcile the two statements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was very concerned about Gaeltarra Éireann and the making of money when he was speaking here last week.  It was obvious to me that the Deputy had no knowledge whatever of the Gaeltacht areas, or even of their location.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Minister says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1026" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in Irish&mdash;I repeat it now&mdash;that the first reason for setting up Gaeltarra Éireann was social and mainly for the purpose of providing employment in the Gaeltacht areas.  That being so, it is to be expected, because of their different operations in very isolated areas, that there should be a loss.  One could not expect an organisation established for social purposes to make a profit out of diversified activities in very isolated areas.</P>
      <P>It is true that there has been an improvement in the accounts of Gaeltarra Éireann over the past year.  I hope that improvement will continue, but it is absurd to suggest that this body could make a profit in the same way as some industrial magnate who might build a huge factory, take in the best workers he could get, locating the industry as near a port as possible to save costs of transport.  He could not do that in these isolated Gaeltacht areas.  The fact that increased employment is being given and the fact that there are no unemployed weavers&mdash; some may be underemployed, but there are none unemployed&mdash;is something about which the House, and particularly the people from the Donegal Gaeltacht, should be well satisfied. Those who say that no improvement has been made since Roinn na Gaeltachta was established do not appear to be following the activities of the Department.  There are stiúrthóirí going around the different Gaeltacht areas for the purpose of helping the people and bringing their needs to the attention of the Department, week by week and month by month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of special schemes have been introduced to improve the economic health of the Gaeltacht.  As Deputies will recollect, special housing legislation was introduced under which the people of the Gaeltacht got special housing facilities and new schemes were provided to enable them to erect chalets and brugha in the Gaeltacht areas, and to develop whatever local amenities they may have to attract tourism to their areas.  There are schemes like Scéim na bPaistí, Scéim na Muc, Scéim na dTrátaí and several others which were specially brought in and financed to enable those people <Col N="1027" /> in the poor circumstances in which most of them have to live to get a livelihood there or at least to make it possible for them to help themselves in a better way than was formerly the position.</P>
    <P>I cannot speculate here on the effects of more and more people going into the Gaeltacht areas on holidays and whether, between that, television and wireless, the language might or might not suffer.  My own view is that where it is the spoken language of the home, it is quite safe, no matter what new medium comes along.  To prove that, I should like to point out to the House that the Connemara people who were migrated to the Meath Gaeltacht some years ago still have their own language as teanga na teachta.  It is a fact that although they have been there for a great number of years, it is the language spoken in their homes.</P>
    <P>At all events, in the Gaeltacht areas, as in the other congested areas throughout this land, it is true to say, as someone has suggested here, that you cannot put a wall round about them and regard them as people living in a type of Indian reservation.  The people of the Gaeltacht are just as entitled as anyone else in this land to the benefits of any of the other national schemes, whether they are migration schemes which give them new holdings or other schemes not administered by Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>One of the facts about life in the Gaeltacht is that these were the very areas to which people were driven in the dark and evil days of our history, and many of them had to try to eke out an existence on some of the very worst land or bog in the whole of the country.  To suggest that these people, any more than people outside limistéirí na Gaeltachta, should accept the standard of living of their great-grandfathers or their grandfathers would certainly be unrealistic, to say the least of it.</P>
    <P>It is true that the policy of my Department is to endeavour to make the best use we possibly can of any natural advantage that may exist in the area and to help these people by <Col N="1028" /> making special provision for them to cater for the tourist trade, where they live at a seaside or where there is fishing available and so on, so that, in so far as we can, we endeavour to increase their economic lot and the economic possibilities of their future.</P>
    <P>One of the rather peculiar and interesting things about one of the most isolated Gaeltacht areas is that notwithstanding what has been said here about large numbers of people disappearing from the Gaeltacht, they have been increasing particularly in the west and particularly in the Aran Islands.  I had the pleasure and privilege recently of visiting my island friends there and I found that they had to extend their schools because of the increased number of children now on those islands.  That is heartening to see.  People talk here about there being emigration from the Gaeltacht areas.  Of course that is true but it is equally true of the other congested areas, and it must be true in the congested areas where there is possibly only one son waiting on the holding or one daughter getting married locally, but where they have large families, they must move out to other parts of the country or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>From the figures I have studied, I am satisfied that there is no greater emigration from the Gaeltacht areas than from the surrounding congested areas which have been the traditional locations of emigration in our land &mdash;and they have been the traditional locations of emigration because of our history and because of the economic facts I have already pointed out to the House.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies mentioned the question of foraoiseacht na Gaeltachta. I should like to inform the House that I have a special officer in the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands to act as liaison officer for Roinn na Gaeltachta so that if there is any suitable scheme for afforestation located in the Gaeltacht areas, that scheme will get full and prior consideration.  In fact I got a report from the officer concerned dealing with forestry in Roinn na Gaeltachta and he is satisfied that in so far as it is <Col N="1029" /> feasible, the Forestry Division have gone ahead in a reasonably good way throughout the different Gaeltacht areas, depending, of course, as forestry must always depend, on the availability of suitable land.  In many instances, because of location, because of exposure and because of the soil conditions, much of the land in the Gaeltacht areas is not suitable for forestry purposes; but I want to tell the House that where there is suitable land available&mdash;and when I say &ldquo;suitable land,&rdquo; I mean land that is capable of being planted &mdash;the Gaeltacht areas will get priority and first consideration from the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud i gcoitinne go bhfuil suim fé leith san ábhar so ag an líon Teachta a labhair ar an Meastachán. An bhliain seo caite, sílim nach raibh morán spéise ann ag an gcuid is mó de na Teachtaí ach tá athrú ar an scéal an babhta so.  Táim i gcomhnai toilteanach aon chabhair is féidir liom a thabhairt do dhaoine a bhfuil suim aca sa Ghaeilge agus go mór mhór do na Teachtai Dála atá in a gcomhnaí sa Ghaeltacht nó in a gcomhnaí i gcontaethe a bhfuil Gaeltacht beag nó mór ann.  Freisin, táim toilteanach i gcomhnaí aon chabhair is féidir liom a thabhairt d'eagraíocht ar bith, eagraíocht neaspleach leasmuigh den Roinn a bhfuil suim aca sa Ghaeltacht i dtaobh oideachais nó tionscail nó gní ar bith eile a dhéanfadh cothú agus forbairt do shlí bheatha muintir na Gaeltachta.  Dá bhrí sin, bhéinn fíor-bhuíoch d'aoinne a bhfuil in ndán aon tógra a thabhairt dom ar mhaithe leis na daoine sin.</P>

      <P>The Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes makes provision for the annual programme of employment schemes to give work to men in receipt of unemployment assistance in urban and rural areas, including towns with a population of 200 and over; and for other services not directly concerned with U.A. recipients, such as bog development schemes, rural improvements schemes, and miscellaneous schemes including minor marine works and archaeological excavations.  The Vote also makes provision for the salaries, travelling and other incidental expenses of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office, who are responsible for the administration of the Vote.</P>
      <P>I find that the practice over a number of years in dealing with this Vote has been to give general details of the work done in the preceding financial year, and I propose to do the same.  The gross estimate figure for the year 1962/63 shows an increase of £8,830 over last year's figure but, in view of the anticipated increase of £6,000 in the Appropriations-in-Aid subhead, the nett increase is only £2,830.  There is a reduction of £27,000 in the provision for urban employment schemes, and this has enabled me to increase the provision for rural improvements schemes from £200,000 to £225,000 and the miscellaneous schemes subhead from £15,000 to £17,000.  I will refer to these changes again later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, my predecessor made available to Deputies a tabular statement giving particulars of the expenditure under the various subheads of the Vote for four years 1956-57, 1957-58, 1958-59 and 1959-60, the estimated expenditure for 1960-61, as well as the provision proposed for these services in 1961-62.  There are a number of new Deputies in the House, and I am, therefore, bringing these particulars up to date in the new tabular statement which I have made available to Deputies.  These figures include payments from the National Development <Col N="1031" /> Fund in addition to the Vote up to and including the financial year 1960-61&mdash; when the last of the Fund money available to the Special Employment Schemes Office was expended&mdash;the expenditure, all Vote expenditure, for 1961-62, and the provision for 1962-63.  The expenditure last year was something more than 98 per cent. of the money available, compared with 95½ per cent. in 1960-61 and 97 per cent. in 1959-60.</P>
    <P>Before commenting on the different subheads of the Vote, I think it appropriate to make some general observations on the unemployment figures.  Grants for urban, rural and minor employment schemes are related to the number of U.A. recipients in each area.  A geographical census is taken annually by the Special Employment Schemes Office in the third week of January of the number of U.A. men as well as the number of men in receipt of unemployment insurance benefit in each of the 60 urban areas, 477 non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over, and the 2,874 rural electoral divisions in the country.  This period of the year has been selected as it approximates the peak period of unemployment. The census includes, in addition to the men drawing U.A. or U.I.B. in that week, men who formerly drew such payments but who were working on schemes financed from the Vote during that particular week.</P>
    <P>The census figures for week ended Saturday, the 20th January, 1962, give an over-all reduction of 8.3 per cent. compared with 1961.  The reduction was greatest in the urban areas&mdash;a reduction of 9.6 per cent.  For towns with a population of 200 and over, there was a reduction of 8½ per cent. The rural areas figures showed a reduction of 7¾ per cent.  There is a general pattern, therefore, as will be seen, of reductions throughout the country.  Comparing 1962 figures with 1957, the over-all U.A. figures showed a reduction of 35 per cent. or more than one-third.</P>
    <P>The figures I have just given relate to U.A. men only.  Including men in receipt of unemployment insurance <Col N="1032" /> benefit in addition to U.A. men, the reduction in the combined figures was 5.3 per cent. compared with the 8.3 per cent. reduction for U.A. alone.  The overall reduction was general in the different areas, being 5.3 per cent. in urban areas, 5.1 per cent. in rural areas and 7.6 per cent. in towns with a population of 200 and over.  Comparing 1962 with 1957, the reduction in U.A. and U.I.B. combined was 37.6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I propose now to turn to the individual subheads of the Vote.  Subheads A and B provide for salaries, travelling and office expenses of the Special Employment Schemes Office, i.e., the administrative subheads.  The figure for Subhead B for travelling and incidental expenses is the same as last year's.  The increase of £8,830 in the salaries subhead is mainly due to what has become generally known at the eighth round increase, which in a full year would amount to approximately £10,000.  Ordinary increments as the staff become a year older account for a further £1,900 but some savings have been made in reduced staff numbers.</P>
    <P>There is a reduction of £27,000 in the proposed provision for urban employment schemes.  The schemes provide for works in the four County Borough areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford, the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, and the 55 other urban districts.  The grants are administered through the Department of Local Government, and are conditional on the local authorities submitting suitable work schemes for approval by the Special Employment Schemes Office and making contributions towards their cost.  The local contributions vary in the different urban areas. Including local contributions, the total cost of the works authorised last year was £273,905.  Against the provision of £227,000, the State grant expenditure last year was £228,845.  Employment Schemes in urban areas are ordinarily concentrated in the winter period, but the Dublin schemes are proceeded with the whole year round, each U.A. man getting a 12 weeks' spell of employment.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Corporation were notified on 26th July, 1961 that a State <Col N="1033" /> grant of £110,000 was available for new works costing £137,500, subject to a contribution of £27,500.  Schemes to absorb the full amount, £137,500 gross, were duly approved during the year, of which £69,400 was for road works and £68,100 for amenity schemes.  The road schemes were spread over different parts of the city, of which about £21,000 was allocated to the Ballyfermot, Drimnagh and Crumlin areas, £8,400 in Dublin South-Central, £13,000 in Baldoyle, £7,100 in Finglas, £9,500 in Artane, £8,500 in Larkhill (Whitehall), and £2,000 in the Fairview area.  The amenity schemes included concrete terracing and a paddling pool at the Bull Wall, £6,250; £50,250 for the culverting of the Wad River between Beaumont Road and Malahide Road, £2,000 for the reconditioning of the Santry River adjacent to the Coolock housing scheme, and £9,600 for further work on St. Anne's Estate park in Raheny in respect of footpaths, carriageways and the clearing of scrub, etc., in the estate.</P>
    <P>Among the works actually carried out in the last financial year was a scheme for the reconstruction of the carriageway at Fairview between Annesley Bridge and Merville Avenue, near Fairview School.  This scheme was estimated to cost £22,445; and as explained by my predecessor in his introductory statement last year&mdash;Column 136, Dáil Debates of 14th June, 1961&mdash; it was done by contract instead of by the usual method of direct labour.  It was, in fact, an experiment to ascertain whether it was possible to employ U.A. labour on these employment schemes in Dublin under the contract system. With modern methods of road construction, nearly all the work was done by the contractor's skilled operators using machinery, and the proportion of other labour for which work could be found was relatively very small.  In the result, we must accept the position that it is not possible to utilise the contract system in the employment of U.A. labour on these Dublin employment schemes.</P>
    <P>The average number of men employed weekly on these schemes in Dublin in the last year was 90, of whom 55 were U.A. recipients.  The <Col N="1034" /> blunt fact which has to be faced is that, as the years go by, works with a reasonably high labour content on which unskilled U.A. men can be employed become scarcer and scarcer in the Dublin county borough area. The unskilled labour content in the residue now available in the city, even when done by direct labour, in many cases does not exceed 25 per cent. of the total cost.  As I have already said, half the works sanctioned last year were road works.  Up to recent years, Dublin city got a grant of £90,000 from the Road Fund towards the reconstruction of city roads.  In the year just past, this grant has been increased fourfold to £400,000 and a similar figure has, I understand, been made available for the new year, 1962-63. The amount of money which could be allocated to the Dublin Corporation and the other borough areas from the reduced provision of £200,000 for the current year is necessarily less than last year's but Dublin Deputies will be glad to know that £92,000 has been allocated, which, with the Corporation contribution of one-fifth, will make £115,000 available for new work schemes.  The allocation was notified on 4th August, 1962, and road schemes amounting to £45,880 have been approved up to the end of October, 1962.</P>
    <P>The Cork Corporation were notified on 26th July, 1961, of their grant of £19,700 for new schemes, subject to a local contribution of £3,940. Schemes to absorb the full allocation were duly approved, of which £16,310 was for road works at St. Mary's Road, French's Quay and Proby's Quay; £2,050 was for sundry footpaths; and the remaining £5,330 made provision for an open-space at Iona Park and the widening of the Ferry Walk at Mardyke.  The State grant expenditure in Cork last year amounted to £23,557 so that some arrears of payment have been overtaken. The allocation for the current year&mdash;£17,500 State grant; £3,500 local contribution, £21,000 total&mdash;was notified to the Cork Corporation on the 4th August, 1962, and schemes to absorb this sum are awaited.</P>
    <P>The Limerick allocation amounted to £18,500, conditional on a local contribution <Col N="1035" /> of £3,700.  Road works sanctioned amounted to £17,350, including works at Garryowen, £3,000; Carey's Road and Rossbrien, £8,900; O'Curry Street, the widening of the Lansdowne Circle and the laying of footpaths in various parts of the city, £5,450; and the remaining £4,850 was in respect of amenity schemes, including a wall at Ballinacurra, £1,650; the balance, £3,200, being in respect of a second pitch at Shelbourne Park, the levelling of the area at Janesboro' and the extension of the wall at Corbally.  The allocation for the current year&mdash; £14,000 State grant and £2,800 local contribution, £16,800 total, was notified on 4th August, 1962, and schemes to absorb this sum are awaited.</P>
    <P>The allocation for Waterford was £8,500 and, with the local contribution of £1,420, it made £9,920 available for expenditure.  The entire allocation was devoted to footpaths in various parts of the city.  The allocation for the current year&mdash;£7,500 State grant and £1,250 local contribution, £8,750 total&mdash;was notified on 4th August, 1962, and schemes to absorb this sum are awaited.  The Dún Laoghaire allocation of £5,000, with the local contribution of £1,250 made £6,250 available.  The works included footpaths, further development work at Dunedin Park and the balance, £3,700, was intended for work on the Sandycove foreshore.  Work on this last scheme has been held up by some of the affected parties so that the actual expenditure last year in Dún Laoghaire, including works carried forward from the previous year, amounted to about £3,750 representing a State grant of £3,020.  The allocation for the current year, viz., £4,000 State grant, £1,000 local contribution, £5,000 total, was notified on 4th August, 1962, and schemes to absorb this sum are awaited.</P>
    <P>The allocations for the remaining 55 other urban districts, amounting to £65,300, with a local contribution of £9,095 made £74,395 available for expenditure. The amounts of the grants varied between £250 in towns with less than 6 U.A., such as Bundoran, <Col N="1036" /> Castlebar, Carrickmacross and Templemore (where with a local contribution of not more than £40 the amount would provide for only a few weeks' work for the U.A. men about Christmas time) to as high as £5,000 in Dundalk, £4,700 in Drogheda, £4,300 in Tralee, £3,900 in Galway, £3,800 in Wexford, £2,850 in Kilkenny, £2,300 in Clonmel and £1,850 in Bray in the larger urban areas.  In urban areas other than Dublin, the maximum number of weeks' employment which may be given to an individual U.A. recipient is 8 weeks.  In Dublin, as already stated, 12 weeks are allowed to each U.A. man.</P>
    <P>The full State allocation of £65,300 was duly absorbed, and the approved works included £40,000 for road works and £11,000 for footpaths.  The remaining £14,300 was utilised for various types of amenity schemes, such as footpaths in recreation centres and cemeteries, the surfacing of market yards, a sea wall at Dungarvan, public parks at Ceanannus Mór and Monaghan, an open space at Tralee, as well as car parks, the clearance of derelict sites, conversion of dumping grounds into open spaces, playing fields in Mallow and Youghal, and also the construction of a promenade in Wexford.</P>
    <P>The allocation for the 55 other urban districts in the current year is £60,000, which, with the local contribution of £8,325, will make £68,325 available for new works.  The various local urban councils were notified of the amounts of these allocations on the 4th August, 1962.  As I said earlier, there was a reduction of about 10 per cent. in the number of U.A. recipients in all urban areas, including county boroughs, in 1962 compared with 1961, the figures being 6,712 in 1961 and 6,066 in 1962. Deputies will realise from the details of works given by me in the various areas that the bulk of the expenditure in these urban areas has been on road improvement works.  I have already referred to the substantial increase in the Road Fund allocation for Dublin from £90,000 annually up cations for the other borough areas to 1960 to £400,000 now.  The allohave <Col N="1037" /> also been substantially increased from the same source, the figures for Cork and Limerick having each gone up from £15,000 in 1960 to £37,500 in 1962.  Waterford went up from £5,000 to £12,750 and Dún Laoghaire from £25,000 to £62,250.  Having regard to these very substantial increases from alternative sources which will necessarily give substantial employment, the small over-all reduction of £27,000 does not require any further comment from me.  The distribution of the £200,000 available has been related to the number of U.A. recipients in the different urban areas.</P>
    <P>The provision in the next subhead, Rural Employment Schemes, is £35,000, the same as in the last five years.  These works are confined to non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 and over, of which there are 477.  The grants in these cases are made available to the county councils concerned, who are required to contribute one-quarter of the cost, so that a total of £46,665 is available for expenditure on these schemes.  In 1961, there were 3,965 unemployed in these 477 town areas, and grants were given for 130 towns where 3,024 of the 3,965 unemployed were concentrated. Grants were given in every town which had ten or more unemployed resident therein.  No grants were given for the other 347 towns in which 941 unemployed were resident. The schemes were almost exclusively carried out during the Christmas period, and as £35,000 only was available for distribution the allocation in 107 of the 130 small towns was between £200 and £300.  The following four towns got £500 each: Kilkee, Cork South City Suburbs, Balbriggan and Tuam.  Two towns, Mountmellick and Granard, got £450 each, and six town areas got £400 each, viz., Dublin South City and Dún Laoghaire Suburbs, Rathmore in County Kerry, Newcastle and Abbeyfeale in County Limerick and Mullingar in County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>The various county councils were notified on the 19th July, 1961 of the amounts of the grants and the town areas to which they were applicable. <Col N="1038" /> The approved works consisted mainly of footpaths in the towns and environs, which absorbed £31,500 approximately of the £46,665 available for expenditure. Minor road works, including the easing of bends in the immediate vicinity of towns absorbed £12,150; and the remaining £3,000 approximately provided for various amenity schemes such as the improvement of the fair green in Cootehill, a bathing place in Loughrea, the improvement of an open space in Clifden, the clearance of derelict sites and parking places in some seaside towns in Mayo &mdash;Keel, Dooagh, etc.</P>
    <P>The £35,000 State grant available this year has been allocated to 125 towns where 2,872 of the total of 3,665 unemployed in these non-urbanised towns with a population of 200 or over are concentrated and no grants are proposed for the other 352 towns with 793 unemployed.  Grants are being made available for every town area with nine or more unemployed resident therein.  As £35,000 only is available most of the individual allocations are between £200 and £300 and the various county councils, who are required to contribute 25 per cent. of the cost of the works proposed, were notified of the allocations on the 4th August last.  Grants are related as far as possible to the unemployment position and larger grants were made available for the more important towns, e.g., £500 for Ballyshannon, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Edenderry and Gorey; £550 for Newcastle, Granard, Mullingar and Tuam; £600 for Balbriggan, Mountmellick and Dún Laoghaire suburbs, and £650 for Kilkee, Cork South City suburbs and Dublin South City suburbs.</P>
    <P>Minor Employment Schemes (Subhead E) are primarily intended to give employment to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in rural areas, and are carried out only in the winter period, from November to March.  The works consist of the repair and reconstruction of non-county or accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  They are done only in the parts of the twelve counties of Cavan, Clare, Cork West, Donegal, West Galway, Kerry, Leitrim, Limerick, <Col N="1039" /> Longford, Mayo, Roscommon and Sligo in which there are substantial numbers of men in receipt of unemployment assistance.  The unit of distribution is the district electoral division, and this unit was selected as its boundaries are locally known and being approximately nine square miles in area on average, a work selected in any part of it is invariably within walking distance of the homes of the Unemployment Assistance men for whom it is intended to cater.  Last year grants were given in 368 of the 2,874 electoral division areas in the country.</P>
    <P>There were 16,992 Unemployment Assistance in the total of 2,874 electoral divisions in the rural parts of the country according to the January, 1961,census, and 13,993, or 82 per cent., of these were concentrated in the 368 electoral divisions for which grants were given last year.  The other 3,000 Unemployment Assistance were scattered among the remaining 2,506 electoral divisions in which no allocations were made.  As the schemes are carried out only in the winter period, road works only are carried out as minor employment schemes. Drainage works could not be economically undertaken during the winter period and, accordingly, the only scheme under which land drainage can be undertaken by the Special Employment Schemes Office is the contributory rural improvements scheme.  In all, 922 road schemes were sanctioned in these 368 electoral divisions, at a nett cost of £130,600, or an average of approximately £140 per scheme.  These figures do not include overheads, and the actual expenditure including overheads amounted to £136,150.  It is estimated that 16,464 families were served by these works to their houses, lands and bogs.  The distribution of the funds was mainly related to the numbers of unemployment assistance recipients in the different electoral division areas, but approximately £10,000 of the total was distributed as extra turf grants related to the turf production in the areas in question.</P>
    <P>The number of unemployment assistance recipients in rural areas has fallen from 16,992 in January, 1961, <Col N="1040" /> to 15,675 in January, 1962, a reduction of about 8 per cent.  This year, £10,000 of the £130,000 available has again been earmarked for extra bog road grants in the areas in which there are substantial numbers of unemployment assistance recipients.  Grants have been allocated this year to 354 electoral divisions in which 13,116 of the total number of 15,675 unemployment assistance recipients are resident and no minor employment schemes grants will be given to the other 2,520 electoral divisions in which the remaining 2,559 unemployment assistance recipients are scattered.  Copies of the lists, which were issued on the last day of October, have already been sent to the Deputies.  The Employment Period Order expired this year on the 6th November and the works will be put in hands as soon as possible thereafter&mdash;a short period necessarily being given for the Unemployment Assistance Register to fill up.</P>
    <P>The provision for Subhead F&mdash; development works in bogs used by landholders and other private producers&mdash;is £160,000, the same as in each of the last five years.  This subhead is not related to the unemployment position at all, and it makes provision for drainage works in bogs in all parts of the country which are carried out in the summer and autumn periods, as well as for bog road works which are financed from this subhead only in those parts of the country in which minor employment schemes grants are not authorised.  Bog road works in areas in which there are large numbers of unemployment assistance recipients are sanctioned as minor employment schemes; and as will be seen from the expenditure on minor employment schemes already referred to, a small amount, approximately £6,150, was, in fact, diverted from the bog development subhead for bog roads in minor employment scheme areas, increasing the expenditure to approximately £136,150 and reducing the £160,000 in the bog development subhead proportionately. Under the bog development subhead, 1,312 schemes, costing £137,355 were approved last year.  Some 34,300 families in all were facilitated by these works &mdash; 13,000 approximately by <Col N="1041" /> drainage works and 21,300 by road works.  The total expenditure on this subhead last year amounted to approximately £150,000.</P>
    <P>The principal turf counties are: Galway, Mayo, Clare, Roscommon, Kerry, Offaly, Kildare, Westmeath, Sligo, Laoighis, Leitrim, Longford, Cavan, Tipperary North and Donegal, and the bulk of the bog development allocations goes to these counties almost in the order I have indicated. There is practically no turf at all in the six counties of Carlow, Dublin, Kilkenny, Louth, Waterford and Wexford and there are relatively few areas in most of the other six counties of Cork, Limerick, Meath, Monaghan, Tipperary South and Wicklow.  Although these bog development schemes are not primarily intended to give employment in rural areas, priority, in recruiting the gangs of workers, is given to unemployment assistance recipients or to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit in the areas concerned.  With the exception of a few roads and drains in privately owned bogs in which the rent income from annual lettings is substantial, and where, in consequence, it is not unreasonable to expect these bog owners to make a contribution, all grants under the bog development subhead are full-cost grants.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are, no doubt, aware, we have many more applications for Bog Development Schemes than the funds made available to the Special Employment Schemes Office would enable us to sanction.  In considering the main summer drainage programme last year, some 3,200 reports were before the Special Employment Schemes Office for examination, representing an expenditure of approximately £336,500, of which 670 schemes, representing an expenditure of £60,750, were selected for sanction in the main programme.  The position was the same this year.  Three thousand and sixty schemes, representing an expenditure of £310,000, were available for examination, of which 700 schemes, costing approximately £70,000, were sanctioned last June.  In the main winter programme last year, 3,135 road schemes, representing an <Col N="1042" /> expenditure of £534,000, were examined of which 598 cases were selected for sanction, representing an expenditure of £69,800.</P>
    <P>The available funds are distributed having regard to the amount of turf produced in the different bogs, the number of families served and the cost of the relevant development works. For example, in the case of a bog where, say, only five families operate, producing their domestic supplies of less than 100 tons per annum, there is no prospect at all of a full-cost grant being given.  If these five families were producing turf for sale and the total annual production was in the region of 500 tons, we could probably afford to give a full-cost grant.  In cases where the development works are too costly to permit of a full-cost grant being given under Bog Development Schemes, the beneficiaries have the alternative Rural Improvements Scheme available to them, provided they are prepared to pay the appropriate and necessary contribution.  The winter list of road works for the current year is in course of preparation and will be issued before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme makes provision for grants towards the cost of carrying out works to benefit the lands of two or more farmers, such as small drainage schemes, bridges, and the repair or reconstruction of non-county accommodation roads to farmers' houses, lands and bogs.  It is a contributory scheme and it applies to all parts of the country.  It is the only scheme under which land drainage can be undertaken by the Special Employment Schemes Office, and it is also the only scheme under which road repairs can be undertaken to the houses and lands of farmers in the 2,500 electoral division areas where there are few or no unemployment assistance recipients.</P>
    <P>Road schemes can, and are, also done in the other 368 unemployment assistance electoral division areas under the Rural Improvements Scheme, if the benefiting farmers are prepared to make the necessary contribution towards the cost.  In unemployment assistance areas, the amounts of the grants under Minor Employment <Col N="1043" /> Schemes are in many cases limited, being related to the number of unemployment assistance recipients residing in the electoral division in which the work is situated.  There are, therefore, many accommodation roads in these unemployment assistance areas which have little prospect of ever being selected for full-cost grants. Under the Rural.  Improvements Scheme, a better standard job is, in fact, done, subject to the farmers making up the necessary contribution; and, as the land valuations of farmers in these areas are usually below £15, the beneficiaries are asked to contribute at most only 15 per cent. of the cost.  If the average land valuation is below £7, they are asked to pay only 10 per cent. of the cost, and it is against that background that the Rural Improvements Scheme is operated in the 368 electoral divisions which also qualify for Minor Employment Scheme grants.</P>
    <P>The Rural Improvements Scheme has been in operation by the Special Employment Schemes Office since 1943.  For the first seven years up to 1950, the contribution was on a flat rate of 25 per cent., the State grant being 75 per cent., with more favourable terms for link and other roads used by persons other than those whose houses and lands were directly served thereby.  A sliding scale was introduced in 1950, varying the contributions from as low as 5 per cent. in the case of farmers whose average land valuation was less than £6, to 25 per cent. contribution in the case of farmers with an average valuation of £18 and over, and this scale was in operation until 1957.  The Government of the day was not, however, prepared to continue to finance this scheme on this generous basis.</P>
    <P>The issue of new offers of grants was stopped in August, 1956.  The receipt of new applications was suspended in September, 1956 and, in fact, a provision of £150,000 only was made for the scheme in the original estimate for 1957-58.  When additional funds were made available for this scheme later on that year, a revised scale of contributions was introduced in July, <Col N="1044" /> with a minimum contribution of 10 per cent. for farmers with an average land valuation of below £6, ranging upwards to 25 per cent. contribution for farmers with an average land valuation of between £15 and £18; 30 per cent., £18 to £25; 35 per cent., £25 to £50; 40 per cent., £50 to £100; and 50 per cent., or half the cost, in the case of farmers with an average land valuation of £100 and over.  That revised scale was in operation from July, 1957, to June, 1961.</P>
    <P>As announced by my predecessor in his Estimate statement at Column 145 of the Dáil Debates of 14th June, 1961, the terms of the 1957 scale were again revised with effect as from the 1st June, 1961.  The new scale which has been in operation since that date provides that the minimum contribution will, in future, be 10 per cent. of the cost for farmers with an average land valuation of below £7; 12½ per cent. for valuations of between £7 and £10; 15 per cent. between £10 and £15; 20 per cent. between £15 and £25; 25 per cent. between £25 and £50; 33? per cent. between £50 and £100; and 50 per cent. in the case of farmers with an average valuation of £100 and over.  A special scale of 90 per cent.  State grant with 10 per cent. contribution is usually available in the case of bog schemes&mdash;road or drainage&mdash;which cannot be done on a full-cost grant basis under the bog development subhead.</P>
    <P>For the convenience of Deputies, I have circulated a statement giving particulars of the various scales in operation since the scheme was first started in 1943.  As explained last year, the July, 1957, scale was found to be too restrictive; and it was, therefore, decided to give the more favourable terms which have been in operation since June, 1961.  Under the new terms, 748 schemes to absorb the full allocation were sanctioned last year, of which 217 schemes, costing £38,218, were drainage works and 531 schemes, costing £161,776, were road works. The farmers' contribution was 13.8 per cent. towards the drainage works and 15.7 per cent. towards road works, the State providing the other 86.2 per <Col N="1045" /> cent. and 84.3 per cent. of the cost respectively.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The most important and essential components of an efficient and proper system of public transport services were considered in the legislation passed in 1958 in a particularly superficial way.  The public are paying for the results of the superficiality of the approach at that time. In fairness, I imagine one of the people who probably now, if he were asked, would confess to regretting that piece of legislation more than anybody else in the country would be the present general manager of the company. Because of the over-riding consideration incorporated in the legislation that the company, not later than the 31st March, 1964, should balance its operating expenditure with revenue, he better than any of us must now know that that was an impossible task for anybody to be set and that he was a particularly foolish and vain man to think that he could have carried out that achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He must share his foolishness with the foolishness of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, the present Taoiseach, who, in considering the whole problem of public transport, clearly gave it only the most cursory examination and consideration.  It is quite clear he was dominated almost exclusively by strictly doctrinaire, conservative economic ideas and policies and that, so long as the board appeared to carry these through, he really did not mind what the consequences might be for the country as a whole.  His main concern is expressed in column 1598, volume 167 of the <i>Official Report,</i> in which he says that our public transport should be put on a solvent basis and so relieve the general taxpayer of <Col N="1046" /> the necessity of subsidising it by annual subvention.  He gave the general manager approximately 5 years to do that.</P>
    <P>He said in the same column:</P>
    <P>Indeed, the Bill envisages that the board will not have reached that situation for five years.  I know that at the present time there are few railway systems in the world which are not losing money and that in expecting the board of CIE to achieve solvency it may be said that we are asking them to do something that other railway executives are not able to do even under more favourable circumstances.</P>
    <P>But that he did ask the railway executive to do, and it is quite clear from present findings that they will not do it.</P>
    <P>The then Minister went on further, in column 1599, to lay down the figure that they were to be given each year for this limited period as a subsidy to carry them over.  He said, in column 1599:</P>
    <P>It is possible that the subvention of £1,000,000 per year will not be sufficient to close the gap between receipts and outlay in 1959 and 1960, and CIE may have to resort to temporary borrowing to tide them over these years.  I would hope, however, that this fixed subvention of £1,000,000 a year for five years will be more than sufficient in the latter years and that CIE will be able to pay off any temporary borrowing incurred in the earlier stages and have something left to carry on with, if complete solvency has not been finally reached by 1964.</P>
    <P>The most recent of the Annual Reports discloses how hopelessly wrong the former Minister, the present Taoiseach, was in the fact that CIE are still running at a considerable loss and that this loss is increasing and shows little likelihood of being significantly reduced.  In fact, there is a very serious likelihood that by the 1963 or 1964 period, instead of paying its way or not needing this additional subvention, we will find that CIE are in debt by anything up to £2,000,000. <Col N="1047" /> When they started in 1959 it was £1.9 million; in 1960, £700,000; in 1961, £250,000 approximately; and in 1962, £1.6 million.  For a self-assured person, as the then Minister was and the Taoiseach now is, it is of great value to remind him from time to time that on these very important things he is as fallible as anybody else and that he did make a grave error in his estimation of the likely pattern for the future which would be followed by CIE if he gave them these over-riding orders: &ldquo;You must break even by March, 1964; you work virtually in isolation, and your subsidy from the State must stop then.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I hope that if the Minister intervenes in this debate he will tell us if he still seriously believes it will be possible for CIE, with Dr. Andrews in charge, to break even by 1964.  For a man in the position the Taoiseach was then in to fix this sum of £1,000,000, at a time when everybody knew all currency was debased currency, because of its tendency to lose its value, shows the superficial approach of the then Minister to the problem.  It was quite clear that this £1,000,000 would not have the same value from year to year as it has in the first year and that, if he wanted to give some sort of subvention from the State each year, it would have been much wiser to have based that on some percentage calculation of the loss existing at that time&mdash;a decreasing percentage&mdash; if he seriously believed he was going to find that in 1964 CIE was, in fact, paying its way.  Not only are we facing the position that the cost of living has gone up, with resultant justifiable wage demands, which have increased the losses without any increase in revenue, but we are also facing the likelihood that, when we enter the Common Market, we may see anything from a ten to a 15 per cent. rise in the cost of living.  There will then be further wage demands and, because of that, further losses in CIE.</P>
    <P>The whole proposition was, therefore, a completely impossible one to put to the management of CIE.  It does not matter whether it is Dr. Andrews or anybody else.  It just <Col N="1048" /> happens that he used his position in a particularly arrogant and inhuman way and, because of his brash and insensitive manner with the public, he not only did not make a go of the concern but he succeeded in creating widespread dissatisfaction with the whole transport system on the part of the public, on the part of labour, and even on the part of those who might have used the concern, farmers and others.  Deputy Corry gave his reaction the other day&mdash;the reaction of the civilian&mdash;to the organisation of CIE. There would, he said, be an end to contracts.  That is because of his resentment at the way they were treated as members of the public.  That is a particular incident.  Most of us could add to that incident and the whole adds up to a position wherein the overriding <i>diktat</i> of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time made it impossible for CIE to operate successfully.</P>
    <P>It is quite remarkable to note in the annual report of CIE the ingenuous, childlike irritation of management because they have had to face demands for increases in wages.  There is a most astonishing reaction from Dr. Andrews and his colleagues on the Board.  In one report alone, the matter is mentioned four times in a very short preamble: they did not make as much as they hoped they would because of wage increases, because of the eighth round increase, because of the demands of the unions, or some similar smeary suggestion that, if it were not for this covert sabotage on the part of the workers and the unions, everything would have been rosy.  It would have been &ldquo;roses, roses all the way&rdquo; for CIE, if it were not for the disloyalty of the servants of CIE.  This was the absusrd and insolent suggestion on the part of the management in the Labour Court, the boardroom, or somewhere else.</P>
    <P>Why should an unfortunate worker care whether or not CIE will break even?  Why should he make a sacrifice? Why should he resist a legitimate demand for an increase in wages following on an increase in the cost of living or, following on something much simpler, namely, a demand for some <Col N="1049" /> improvement in working conditions, a shorter working week, better overtime pay, better weekend work?  Why should the CIE worker have to make a sacrifice which notably none of the higher-ups in CIE made?  I have not noticed that any of them is prepared to take a voluntary cut in salary or emoluments in order to facilitate the implementation of this absurd provision of the 1958 Act that CIE should break even by 1964.</P>
    <P>Did Dr. Andrews think when he went into it that he had dictatorial powers to establish or insist on a wages standstill?  Did he think he still lived in the kind of world in which he could ask workers to ignore the fact that they could not buy enough bread, enough butter, enough tea, enough sugar, clothes for their children, or pay school fees for their children, merely because they had the privilege of working for CIE?  That was sufficient in itself! What an absurd suggestion! But it was made again, and again, and again, and it was incorporated in print in this report.</P>
    <P>It is part of private enterprise and capitalism to say, whenever there is a demand for a wage increase, that the workers want more money, for no clear reason that they can see, and, if it were not for their wanting more money, everything would cost little or nothing.  There is no reference at all to profits or to dividends.  All the references are to wage demands.  It is the same with CIE.  The accusation is that the workers did not listen to Dr. Andrews when he said: &ldquo;We have got to break even.  If you do not mind, no increase this year; possibly not next year; maybe not the year after; possibly in 1964.&rdquo;  What good is that to the worker faced with a school bill, a grocery bill, a hospital bill, or whatever it may be?</P>
    <P>Irish industrial concerns have absorbed the eighth round increase. Admittedly, they were not tied like Dr. Andrews and his people.  But they absorbed it.  They passed it on to the consumer ultimately.  Dr. Andrews did exactly the same thing, but he still did not achieve his overall objective of breaking even.  He comes up with the suggestion then that because CIE <Col N="1050" /> had to meet these increases, they suffered this unexpected deficit.  One would think he lived in the moon. Surely he was in this situation before? Did he not expect the CIE workers to look for an increase?  Did he think they would not behave in precisely the same way as Bord na Móna workers behaved when they were faced with an increase in the cost of living?</P>
    <P>It is very wrong to poison the public and labour relations by indicting the worker in this way in these semi-State concerns, making them appear responsible for the fact that Dr. Andrews is not able for the job, is not able to carry out an impossible undertaking imposed on him by Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The result is a conflict.  Dr. Andrews will not say to the Minister: &ldquo;I cannot possibly expect these people to take a voluntary cut or make a voluntary sacrifice in order to carry out an impossible undertaking&rdquo;.  Instead of saying that, he goes to these various courts and fights the workers on the sole ground that he must &ldquo;break even&rdquo;, as if that were any concern of theirs.</P>
    <P>The result of all this has been labour disputes of one kind or another, official disputes and unofficial disputes. The result of that is repercussions in the trade union movement.  It has reacted throughout one of the principal unions in a most serious way from their point of view.  The workers were not satisfied with what they were given by CIE.</P>
    <P>Then on another occasion there was a lock-out.  Using the archaic procedure adopted by Dr. Andrews, following in the footsteps of the great William Martin Murphy, a lock-out technique was used.  All these things add up to the fact that the public got, get, and have the impression that labour relations in CIE are very unsatisfactory.  Certainly any of the workers I know in CIE are most unhappy in their relationship with management.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if this man cannot do the job properly, he should either tell the Government or the Minister: &ldquo;This is an impossible undertaking to ask me to carry out,&rdquo;<Col N="1051" /> or he should resign.  He cannot have it both ways.  The fact of the matter is, as the GNR and the GSR have shown, that it is not possible, consonant with the social needs of society&mdash; and particularly in a complicated society like ours with its great rural overlap&mdash;to operate a transport concern at a profit.</P>
    <P>That is becoming obvious and for that reason we felt it was desirable that the Minister should reconsider the basic principles of our public transport at this time.  One of the repercussions of the labour difficulties has been reflected in revenue.  In his short speech the other day, Deputy O'Connor really touched on a consequence that had arisen, the uncertainty amongst merchants&mdash;and I suppose it could be said, the legitimate uncertainty &mdash; as to whether they could rely completely on CIE to deliver their merchandise of one kind or another.  The result was that because of those labour difficulties that occur from time to time, most of them decided: &ldquo;It would be better for us to run our own independent transport service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, of course, is reflected in the transport figures generally and there is no significant advance by CIE in taking over the general public transport services of the country.  One Deputy was given figures last week which demonstrate that very clearly. I think the ratio is something like ten to one in haulage and merchandise as between the private service and CIE. There is no significant impact by CIE in whittling down the domination of the private enterprise section of the public transport service generally where it is related to merchandise.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the Minister has considered, or would consider, the whole position arising from the fact that there is a preponderence of private transport and where there is private transport there is naturally no need for public transport for the reason that it follows, as in most other services, that private transport tends to go for the easy return and the foreseeably sound undertaking.  It is never a risk because it is largely certain of the work it has to do.  It <Col N="1052" /> is purchased for a particular purpose and it can usually manage to draw even or make a profit, while the public transport service is at the beck and call of virtually everyone and tends to be squeezed into keeping only the uneconomic public transport sector which the private sector does not want.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister has given any serious thought to the likelihood or desirability of reconsidering the whole position of private haulage transport to see whether it is possible to assimilate it into the public sector, where that is desirable.  This merely re-emphasises the impossibility of geting the whole public transport service to pay its way, not only by 1964, but by 1974, 1984 or ever.  The Minister might decide that he cannot touch private haulage for political or other reasons, but because he cannot, then the public sector must be run at a loss, that that is one of the penalties which he must pay for believing in private enterprise, and recognising that fact get rid of this provision which is impossible and which cannot be honoured by anyone in charge of CIE.</P>
    <P>I suppose one of the oddest answers one could get&mdash;and it is most significant in many ways&mdash;is the answer which I got from the Minister to-day on the number of employees in CIE. One of the things which the public find it so difficult to understand is the persistent news of redundancy in CIE, with varying degrees of consultation or lack of consultation with the trade unions or the workers concerned, men laid off, and calculations as to what precise compensation should be paid, and whether or not the men were satisfied, and allied with that redundancy, periodic advertisements in the paper for recruitment to CIE.</P>
    <P>What underlies this extraordinary approach to the service which the Beddy report said should be drastically pruned and reorganised?  How is it, if there is this reduction in services, alteration in services, closing of railway lines, closing of stations and all the auxiliary services involved, that now after three or four years, out of a total of nearly 22,000 workers, there <Col N="1053" /> are 200 fewer people employed in CIE.  While there are 200 fewer persons employed in CIE, we are paying out in the region of £800,000 for redundancy compensation.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have an answer pat that satisfies him but throughout the whole of the operation of CIE, since Dr. Andrews took over, in particular, and since the Minister took over his position here in particular, there has been this appalling contempt for the public.  I know what is going on and I understand what is going on.  I have proof of what is going on.  It is a complete lack of appreciation of the reality that both the Minister and Dr. Andrews are employees of the public.  They are responsible to us.  We pay their salaries.  We lay down the conditions on which they are employed and they are answerable to us.  CIE should not be run as a sort of dictatorship in which we are told that everything is all right because the great panjandrum, the boy wonder from Synge Street, is in control, that everything is all right, that &ldquo;Dad is at the wheel&rdquo; and consequently no one need bother.</P>
    <P>That, of course, was completely exploded by the remarkable blunder made in the purchase of diesel electric locomotives which could only be safely driven in one direction, a fact which was only recognised when we got them back here to Dublin.  It is deplorable that the Minister makes no attempt to carry out any serious inquiry or to give the public or the taxpayers, who are paying for this, some undertaking that this will not happen again or that some measures will be taken to see that the people who did it will not do it again.</P>
    <P>No matter which aspect of the operation of the service that is taken there is very little that can be said in favour of the man in control of its operation.  It was recommended that there should be serious pruning.  It was intended to reduce the number of staff needed to operate the service. That was the intention of the 1958 Act, that this would lead to a reduction in the cost of the service, and in practically every case the reverse has happened.  The only aspect of public <Col N="1054" /> relations which is adequately handled is the build-up this Chairman of the Board gets in order to prove that he is infallible, that while he has control everybody is safe and well, everything is going on as was ordained and that there is no need to criticise or question him in any way.</P>
    <P>We have attempted on a number of occasions to get more information, so that we could carry out a debate of this kind intelligently and usefully from the point of view of the House, but on nearly every occasion we have been told either that the Minister has no responsibility or the man in charge, the Chairman, Dr. Andrews, simply will not give it.  That is one of the things which has led to very bad public relations and labour relations. On the one hand he is responsible for public relations and he is also responsible for labour relations.  If we suggest there should be a better city service, that the schedule for Sunday be changed, or whatever it may be, and we ask to see this man, we are told there can be no discussion with him.  He is completely inaccessible.</P>
    <P>This is an extraordinary, a new principle, in relation to public life in Ireland.  I do not think there is a single Minister on those Benches, including the Taoiseach, or the former Taoiseach and his colleagues, who was not accessible to every one of us any time we wanted to see them.  I know certainly in my own time that was true, that we were completely accessible and we were glad to see anyone who wanted to talk to us about matters which concerned them.  That is not permissible now under this new rule laid down by Dr. Andrews.</P>
    <P>If the Chairman of CIE has a good case, why does he not put it to us?  What has this particular man got that makes him so inaccessible as opposed to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Transport and Power or any other Ministers or their predecessors in the Cabinet?  Why should he be permitted to institute this new doctrine?  If Deputy Seán Dunne comes in here and says what he did say, he cannot be blamed.  None of us is afraid to say these things personally to Dr. Andrews. We should be delighted to do it in <Col N="1055" /> precisely the same terms as I am doing now but we cannot see him.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to the Minister's position, we are not allowed to ask him questions, so it is about as easy to find out about the detailed workings under the Secret Service Vote in this House as it is to find out about the workings of CIE.  We can only surmise and put together the best information we find, the limited, sparse and biased information which is handed out, and because it is handed out by Dr. Andrews and his executive it is suspect information.  We should be given information as we wish, whatever reasonable information we ask for.  The information I sought was perfectly reasonable information.</P>
    <P>The result of all this is that there are bad labour relations and bad public relations.  Deputy T. Lynch and other Deputies were asking for information which they required for a deputation. Again, in my own experience, it was the first thing for which we asked: if any deputation was coming along could they submit a memorandum of the general views so that it would be possible for us to have an intelligent discussion, so that it would be possible for us to prepare our side of the story.  If any useful discussion is to be carried out, it can only be carried out when the maximum information is available to both sides of the table.  Why should it be withheld if there is nothing suspect, if there is no sense of guilt about it?  If it contributes to the discussion or if it contributes to eliciting the truth in regard to whether you should or should not limit a service, extend a service, increase somebody's pay or whatever it may be, why not make that information available?</P>
    <P>As I understand it, sometimes the information is changed two or three times.  I know that in relation to the Bray-Greystones position, different figures were given.  That merely shows the fallibility of these people.  If there is a good case let us remember the cliché: not only should justice be done but it should be seen to be done. That would seem to be the ABC of public relations.  He must bring the people with him.  On the other hand, <Col N="1056" /> he can go against them and except for the odd protest we make here there is little we can do about it.  However, we have heard what Deputy Corry had to say and he is only one of the many people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry is an able Deputy and there is no need for me to defend him here, but the point the Minister made is a most interesting one.  I believe Deputy Corry <i>bone fide</i> made these charges the other day.  If he is wrong it is the Minister's fault or the Chairman's fault &mdash; anybody you like &mdash; because Deputy Corry should be put in possession of the facts.  Again it shows a failure on the part of public relations in CIE if a representative like Deputy Corry is not in possession of the facts and if, as a result of being in possession of something which is not a fact, he then takes this very serious decision&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to beet supplies.  It is serious for CIE.  He is only one person.  Whether he is right or wrong, is not terribly important but there are many members of the public who are taking their own personal decisions in this way.  It may be a decision merely to use a bicycle instead of a bus or to buy a scooter instead of having to wait for the bus that never comes or to do as they do in certain areas&mdash;club together to get a taxi because it is cheaper.  These are all the personal reactions of individuals on the same lines as that of Deputy Corry. He happens to be in a more influential position in relation to the beet industry but there are thousands of people who are taking important and unimportant decisions, influential and uninfluential decisions, in relation to CIE all the time, as a result of the ham-handed public relations system operated by <Col N="1057" /> the company.  It is no good.  There is a wonderful thing about humanity. One can make all sorts of rules and regulations but we are wonderfully versatile, pig-headed, single-minded, obstinate&mdash;whichever word you want to use.  A great many people will not be driven but they can be lead.  No attempt is made by CIE to do this. People merely get this parrot cry from headquarters: &ldquo;We have to break even by 1964 and the result of that is that we must do whatever it may be, carry out whatever curtailment or restriction of a rail service it is intended to carry out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>People are genuinely confused about the costing methods of CIE.  I object strongly to this aristocratic indifference of the Minister and Dr. Andrews and these people to the general public, to the suggestion that they would not understand, that this is high finance, chartered accountancy at a very high level and above their heads.  I object to this kind of thing.  It should have gone out with the people who used to be here up to the 1920s.  We should be able to talk to one another on terms of equal value.  We should presume that the public are able to understand whatever we are able to understand. If not, the case should be made understandable&mdash;and I believe nearly every case can be made understandable&mdash;in simple terms.  Some attempt should be made in that way.</P>
      <P>No attempt is made.  Every single deputation, urban council, district council, group of citizens, individual Deputies have all been treated in precisely the same way.  First of all, there is the usual response to any suggestion that the Board could be wrong and then the heavy-hearted acceptance of a deputation which is presented with a new timetable and told to go home and accept it.  This is all part of the insolence of the Board which has created a tremendous amount of ill-feeling for CIE.  The manager is not carrying the public with him and it is an easy enough thing to carry them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the service in which I had some interest, the Bray-Dublin service, I know the difficulty we had in trying to work out the cost of that <Col N="1058" /> service.  What did the Board take into consideration?  There is a service which goes from Dublin to Bray, a service from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire, from Dublin to Rosslare, a service in the summertime to Arklow.  How is the cost of the usage of these lines estimated?  How are the services broken up over a particular line and, in that way, the amount allocated to any particular stretch of that line worked out?  It should be possible to make it clear, as a result of these figures, that there is a good case to be made and the case should be made frankly and fearlessly by the Board and then a decision taken.  Obviously, if one accepts the old principle I have referred to of justice being done and being seen to be done, it is wrong that the Board should be judge and jury in their own case, which is, in fact, what they are.  They are the final tribunal.  If they have a valid case, which is arguable before an independent tribunal, let them bring it forward.</P>

      <P>There is that simple difficulty in relation to the public. There is the other difficulty of the public when they try to get an extension of services or improvement of services or new services of any kind. At the present time, the public are greatly disturbed.  One of the factors which contributed to the increase in the cost of living, which led to the eighth round of wage increases. was, of course, the fares of CIE.  The fact that fares were increased subsequently means again they are creating one of the components for a new wage demand themselves.  When the public try to ensure that the services are run in their own interests, extended or renewed, they find it is impossible to get any satisfaction from the Board for <Col N="1059" /> the same reason as the workers get when they ask for a wage increase, the same reason as is incorporated in the 1958 Act, the same reason as we are asking should be removed&mdash;&ldquo;We cannot give you an extended service because of the cost, because we have to break even by a particular time, because the Company must be run at a profit&rdquo;.  The result is that the public are dissatisfied.  The public, I think, generally are dissatisfied with the standard of service given by CIE, both on the trains and in the buses.</P>
      <P>Certainly I might make my own protest. I am dissatisfied with the bus service which operates in my own part of the world.  I tried to put down a question to the Minister about it recently and was not permitted.  It takes a cold double-decker bus 55 minutes to go 11 or 12 miles and I wanted to ask the Minister is this a record.  Unfortunately, I was not allowed to ask it but I would like the Minister some time to sit in the top place in one of those double-decker buses rambling its way towards Enniskerry, stopping at every bump on the road, the passengers hoping they will not freeze to death by the time it reaches Enniskerry. That is one service of which I have personal knowledge.  I am sure there are plenty of others like it.  One sees youngsters walking miles to school around that dreadfully hilly area. Clearly, CIE have said that no additional buses will be provided there.  It is, particularly from now on, the highest from of cruelty to people.  Of course, I have no doubt that the same position obtains in every county in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the Minister's information, there are very many people without motor cars living in rural Ireland. These people are being driven to live in the cities in order to save themselves the appalling ordeal of, after a day's work, walking, say, from Enniskerry village up to any of these places &mdash; Glencree or Roundwood or the top of the Deerpark or any of these other places.  I do not understand how society can operate and virtually completely ignore the needs of these people.  I am certain it is not <Col N="1060" /> aimed specifically at ourselves in County Wicklow, that it is the pattern in every county, in the rural areas.</P>
    <P>It is no use asking for additional services.  You will be told: &ldquo;They would cost too much and we must break even by 1964.&rdquo;  Of course the man is not going near breaking even but he is nevertheless perpetuating this myth that it is possible to do it. The individual response to this type of service is to provide your own.  I do not like very much driving a motor car, particularly in view of the appalling danger of the Bray road and the area in which I travel.  I should much rather travel by bus if there were such a thing as a comfortable bus with a reasonable frequency, but if you are faced with a 55-minute run for a 12-mile journey, you cannot spend the remainder of your life sitting in a double-decker bus.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we have had to make an independent decision and protest in this case, just as Deputy Corry made it in relation to his.  I never understand how it is, when I give people lifts in from Kilmacanogue or such places, you find there is not another bus for four hours.  In some places, there is not another bus until the next day or the day after, three times a week or something like that.  How people tolerate that is beyond me. There are not sufficient services to Ballyfermot, but if the people in Ballyfermot were told they would get one bus in three hours, then they would know how bad things are. Why should people in rural Ireland be treated like this?  There should be a better&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The number of bus passengers is going up.  Peculiar, is it not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If you take away the train between Bray and Dublin and somebody works in Dublin, he can either swim or take a bus and at this time of the year, it is preferable to take a bus.  I suppose that is the answer. In fact, the number of passengers is reduced.  The result of this decision under the 1958 Act, in any case, has left us with this grossly inefficient service in practically all aspects of its <Col N="1061" /> operation.  One of the minor tortures of my life is driving from here to Enniskerry, where I live, along the roads, any of them, that I have to travel on.  Largely as a result of this 1958 Act and the way the whole question of public transport was considered, it is now a very dangerous thing, as the Minister knows, to drive on any of our roads.  One need but read the morning papers or listen to the radio to hear of all the accidents and the death rate on the roads.  It is clear that to have considered this question of public transport in isolation, as was done in 1958, was completely wrong. I accept Deputy O'Connor's view that we must reduce, or should reduce, the railways and get alternative transport but to reduce the railways and then make no significant improvement in road transport is completely irresponsible.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister will suggest that there has been any serious approach to road-building as a national undertaking, considering the additional large buses and large transport vehicles that will be put into service on these roads as a result of the curtailment of the rail services.  There has been no significant building of properly-dimensioned motor roads of the £1,000,000 or £1,500,000 type one sees on the continent or, to a very limited extent, in Britain.  There is very little development of fly-overs, by-passes or under-passes, rebuilding of bridges, increase in the number of bridges, or an attempt to organise traffic in city centres or to restrict by taxation the use of cars.  The result, as everybody knows who tries to go home between 5 and 7 p.m., is that you find you had better walk as it is nearly impossible to get out of the city with one's patience intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, the fact that hire-purchase arrangements are much easier and more people buy cars, scooters and bicycles is all part of the protest against the organisation of the rail services.  Most people would much prefer to take a quick train home or a quick bus service, if such were available, rather than take the quite considerable risk now involved in trying to <Col N="1062" /> drive a car from here to Bray or Balbriggan or other places where people must go.</P>
    <P>There has been no serious road-building or road-widening within the county boundary of Dublin particularly. Anything that may have happened between Dublin and Cork happened beyond the county bounds; broadly speaking, I think that is true. Driving from here to Balbriggan, Bray or Dún Laoghaire is very much alike. This need not be.  If this curtailment of rail services is decided on for any reason, the decision should have been taken only in consideration of the safety of the public and should have been taken only in association with a great national road-building campaign. In those circumstances, the Minister would have been faced with a problem of whether it was an economic proposition to close down the railways.  It is easy to close them down and show a profit on road transport if you do not recall the fact that you cannot have efficient road services unless you have efficient roads and you cannot have efficient transport on roads that were built for horses and carts.</P>

      <P>This is an Irish Parliament discussing public transport in Ireland.  If the Minister wants to discuss public transport on the continent, let him do so.  I am speaking for the constituents I represent and their problems here in Ireland which is the only thing I know very much about and for that reason I feel competent to discuss it.  If a courageous decision had been taken that rail transport should be curtailed for any reason, with that decision, there should have been a decision taken also that our roads would be greatly enlarged and increased and that all this other business of by-passes, flyovers, underpasses, ringroads and so on would be provided in the interests of public safety.  When the bill was brought to the Minister, he might then have some estimate of the true implications of the decision to curtail rail transport in this way. There has been no serious attempt to do this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if Deputy O'Connor thought of this.  He mentioned lorries&mdash;and the business of quick turn-rounds which was a perfectly good point&mdash;taking the place of rail locomotives but there is this point, that unless you take this decision to facilitate traffic on the roads, then you will be back where you started if your complaint was that rail transport was too slow for the business of carrying merchandise and so on.</P>
      <P>Then, when you get a congested road, and we are gradually moving towards congested roads, you are going to get lorries travelling at 20 miles an hour, or 30 miles an hour, or travelling nose to tail as they do in Britain, and if you dispatch goods they will have to wait.  Everybody believes there is a great increase in public, personal transport and in road haulage transport by private individuals and the result is that more private, personal transport is thrown on to roads which are not designed to carry it.  That was the basic failure of the decision in 1958 and these two decisions should have been taken at the same time.  We are going to be faced again with exactly the same position.  CIE lorries, or Deputy O'Connor's lorries, are going to be at the end of a queue three miles long.  There are going to be complaints about delays and the fact that somebody dispatched something at Bray and had to wait seven or eight hours for it to arrive in Dublin.  It will not be the fault of the lorry driver.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact, of course, is that there has been a slowing down in road transport and basically it was a very unwise decision to abandon this wonderful, uninterrupted run from one city to another which was available on the railway.  This decision to close them was done without seriously examining the possibility of trying to <Col N="1064" /> speed up the services or trying to make them more attractive.</P>
      <P>Another inexplicable anomaly of CIE is this: why did we set about what is called dieselisation of the service? To some people it seemed to be a dangerous thing to do in so far as we were putting all our eggs into one basket and using imported fuel to drive our public services and in that way we were putting ourselves at the mercy of whoever was exporting the fuel. There is also the fact that the steam engine services appeared to be operating quite well.  There was at one time a proposal that we should use native fuel.  I understand that no great progress was made in that regard but what was the benefit of providing these very fast diesel electric locomotives? Was it so that we could provide these secret, gargantuan contracts for General Motors or whatever it was? There is no clear explanation and this is another thing about which the public have been kept in the dark.</P>
      <P>One would have thought that the purpose of getting these locomotives was to try to provide a much speedier service on the railways.  If this is so is it not a fact that there has not been a great speeding up on these inter-city train services?  Is it not a fact that there has been no increase in speeding up the services at all and it now takes three hours&mdash;certainly it took President de Valera three hours&mdash;to travel from Dublin to Cork when in fact these diesels can do the journey in two and half hours?  Is it not a fact that there has been no significant change in railway timetables for about six years? Has there been any significant change in timetables except restricting them or cutting out train services altogether? Surely there should have been a purpose behind this colossal expenditure on providing diesel locomotives?  The purpose should have been to try to get speedier and better services in every way, services which would have made the passengers flock back to them.  I should like the Minister to say if there has been any significant change in railway timetable schedules for the past five or six years.</P>
      <P>There are other countries which have equipped themselves with diesels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1065" /> I understand Holland is one and that there you can get two types of trains, a fast train on the hour and a slow train on the half hour.  That seems to me to be a good thing for anybody to know.  If a person wants to get to the suburbs, it would be nice to know that there was this choice between a fast and a slow train.  I do not think that there has been any serious attempt made by the management of CIE to make rail services really attractive to the travelling public.  There has been no great improvement in the rolling stock.</P>
    <P>In one of the annual reports I saw a reference to four new carriages.  We are now a long way along the road from 1958&mdash;we are at the end of 1962 &mdash;and we still have not nearly replaced the rolling stock or provided ourselves with new, modern and comfortable carriages.  Some of the antiques which are brought out at Christmas or Easter or for football finals should be in museums.  Conceivably, the reason why one does not get faster services is because if these diesels were running to their full output they would pull the end off these carriages.  These antiques cannot be driven at more than a certain speed. It is a vicious circle and the result is that people are not being encouraged to use the passenger services.</P>
    <P>The publicity one sees is usually concerned with one or two hostesses, or whatever it may be, but the important publicity is to give efficient, comfortable service between the various towns and cities.  The only publicity needed is a picture of a new timetable with faster, more accessible and more convenient services.  I understand that that is the broad line to be followed by British Railways, an attempt to have very fast transport, travelling at 100 miles an hour on the railways.  Is any attempt being made to do that here?  If not, why not?  If not why did we not save ourselves the millions of pounds which we have spent and, presumably, by the time we change the remaining steam locomotives for diesels, the millions of pounds which the taxpayer will have been asked to spend?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, then Minister for <Col N="1066" /> Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, was at that time also wrong on that point when he suggested that the capital payments were nearing an end.  It shows how little thought he must have given to this matter and it is quite frightening to think that he had such a powerful influence on such an important aspect of the life of our society.  In addition to saying they would be breaking even any time&mdash; instead of which they are losing £800,000 or £900,000 in addition to the £1,000,000 which we are to give them in the form of a subsidy&mdash;he said, as reported at column 1599 of the Official Report of 8th May, 1958:</P>
    <P>These annual payments must cover all the needs of CIE, including payment of interest on their stocks, all outlay, other than expenditure on capital account.  The dieselisation of the undertaking is, as the House knows, now nearly completed and it is not anticipated that any further substantial capital expenditure will be required during that period.</P>
    <P>That was 1958.  Only last July, we voted the fantastic amount of something like £6,000,000 for more diesels. If one continues the dieselisation programme through, many more millions of pounds will need to be spent by the public in the completion of the programme. Therefore once again, Deputy Lemass was talking through his that when he said we were at the end of capital expenditure as far as the diesel electric purchases were concerned.</P>
    <P>There was a reference in one of the annual reports to the purchase of four units of rolling stock.  It is quite obvious that if we are to go ahead at that rate&mdash;possibly it will be speeded up&mdash;then, on a quick estimate, at the rate of four a year, it will be 40 years before people will find themselves travelling in any sort of reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>One of the further problems in relation to CIE, about which I am not very clear, is road freight.  Road freight tonnage has gone up from £2.1 million to £3.5 million.  That appears to suggest that there is some improvement in the holding of CIE <Col N="1067" /> in this regard.  Of course, as everybody knows, taken in the global picture of road freight in the country generally, it is only a flea bite on the total but, for what it is worth, there is some increase by CIE.  At the same time, there appears to be a reduction in price in the rate per ton from £13.5 to £12.4.</P>
    <P>I wonder what is the significance of the reduction in price on the road freight side and the increase in price on the passenger side.  Our receipts for passengers dropped from £8 million, approximately, in 1959 to £6.9 million in 1962.  The significant thing which I should like to explain is why the cost per passenger went up from £1.63 to £1.87 while the rate per ton for road freight went down, as I said, from £13.5 to £12.4.  What is the policy decision behind this reduction on the one hand and increase on the other hand?  How did the Board of the Company succeed in taking that decision?  Were they not bound by the same provision to break even?  Did it not operate here?</P>
    <P>Did the board not feel they had to increase their rate on the road freight side, just as they increased the passenger costs?  Is that significant? Does the Minister believe it is significant that where they reduced their unit costs there was an increase in the turnover generally and where they increased their costs in relation to passengers there was a significant reduction from £8,000,000 to £7,000,000?</P>
    <P>I should like an explanation as to whether the increase in passenger fares was inevitable.  Was it justifiable to allow an increase in passenger fares and at the same time to allow a reduction in relation to road freight rates so that, in fact, the passenger-travelling public are subsidising road freight transport?  Is it not a fact that the reduction in the number of passengers and the increase in receipts means an increased cost per passenger?  Is the Minister satisfied it will not end up in a vicious circle with fewer and fewer passengers using railways not only in relation to the curtailment of services <Col N="1068" /> but also because of the unsatisfactory nature of the services and increasing fares and then, with the reduction of passengers, a continued upward trend in fares to recoup losses?  Will this trend be so?</P>
    <P>The increase in passenger fares generally, on the roads and on the railways, seems to be a very diligent and doctrinaire attempt by Dr. Andrews to look after people whom Deputy Lemass, when he introduced this Bill, seemed to be primarily concerned to relieve&mdash;the general taxpayer&mdash;of the necessity to subsidise the railways, and so on, by annual subventions.  The way I look at it is that the general taxpayer is not only the direct taxpayer but is also the indirect taxpayer.  He is the person who pays tax on cigarettes, tobacco, drink, and so on.  He will have to pay a contribution, admittedly, if the subvention rises.  If the subvention has to be increased or maintained at its present level he will have to pay something in the form of direct taxation but indirect taxation is consequent, too.</P>
    <P>In recent Budgets successful attempts have been made to reduce taxation on the higher taxpayer.  The result of that has been that the main burden of taxation is falling on the indirect taxpayer. He is paying indirect taxation, which is constant, and, in addition, he is paying increasing fares.  He is the person who is paying it elsewhere.  The wealthy person is not bothered by increasing fares.  Most wealthy persons do not use CIE, anyhow.  Therefore, it seems to me that this is yet another indication of the Government's determination&mdash;whether it is health, old age or any of these other social welfare provisions in the community&mdash; to see that the wealthy taxpayer is paying less and less to the general needs of society.  Accordingly, the unfortunate worker is paying more and more, either on his own behalf or on behalf of his family, because the people who use the services most are those with children going to school or with wives who want to travel to a town or city to do ordinary domestic duties.  People are paying more and more in fares and in that way, since <Col N="1069" /> fares have been increased, are paying more and more for maintaining the services.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is unfortunate that the general trend has been to victimise the person who is already finding life hard enough without having further impositions. It looks as if there is no aspect of the operation of CIE under Dr. Andrews and the Minister which can be pointed to with pride as being a booming success.  This is something to which this man cannot turn and say: &ldquo;I have achieved my particular objective.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A question was asked recently to try to determine the impact which CIE have had on the general transport of the country and it elicited the information that CIE had 1,394 passenger vehicles, 674 lorries, 85 vans, and 26 horse boxes, a total of 1,785 vehicles of one kind or another.  On the other side, for the haulage of general commercial and agricultural goods of one kind or another, there are in existence 88,929 different goods vans owned privately or by firms. That is a ratio of 1,785 to nearly 90,000, meaning that only one in 100 of the haulage vans on the road is CIE operated.</P>
    <P>Anyone would think, listening to the Minister and Dr. Andrews, that CIE are sweeping all before them. Anybody who travels the roads knows this to be a complete hoax.  There is a tendency for the general merchant to by-pass CIE if he possibly can and there is a general tendency by the ordinary passenger in whatever way he can, whether it is by buying a car, sharing a taxi, buying a scooter, getting a bicycle or walking, virtually to consider anything as being more satisfactory than using CIE except in extreme cases.</P>

      <P>The difficulty about the Minister is that he does not realise he is Minister for Transport and Power here in the Republic of Ireland and that we do not give two damns about what goes on outside it.  The unfortunate person who is depending <Col N="1070" /> on transport to get from Dublin to Bray, Dublin to Balbriggan, Dublin to Cork and Cork to Waterford, is not concerned to know whether they are paying the same between Paris and Biarritz or Rome and Milan.  It is irrelevant and unimportant, but this type of attitude epitomises the unrealistic approach of the Minister and Dr. Andrews to the simple, terribly important issue of trying to provide the ordinary people with an efficient, comfortable and moderately economical transport service.</P>
      <P>It is typical of the Minister that he should be content to cushion himself from reality by saying that it is important for us to consider what happens in Timbuctoo or Paris or Hamburg.  I do not give two damns what they are paying in France or Italy and I should be surprised if the Minister stood outside the GPO in Dublin and asked each of a thousand people who passed by if they were worried about the position on the Continent, or elsewhere, that one of them would express the least anxiety.</P>
      <P>The reality about our transport service is that there is this great makebelieve by the CIE authorities at Kingsbridge.  Their public relations officers are doing very well in creating this mythical fiction about the expert Dr. Andrews, about the great job he did cutting turf down in County Kildare and saying that consequently he should know all about public transport. We do not dispute that he did a good job cutting turf in County Kildare but it does not necessarily follow that this man is infallible in matters of public transport.  That is what is worrying all the Deputies here &mdash; this aura of infallibility with which Dr. Andrews, his public relations officers and the Minister seem to surround themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no spectacular break-through in relation to rail passengers by CIE.  The receipts have gone down, travelling costs have gone up and we have the great touchstone of success.  Surely it must be a touchstone of success: it was established as such by Deputy Lemass.  At column 1595, Volume 167 of the Official Report, Deputy Lemass is reported as saying that the board of CIE were <Col N="1071" /> placed under a general obligation to conduct the undertaking so as to eliminate working losses by 31st March, 1964.  They were the riding orders to the general manager and, as I say, the 1959 position was that there was a loss of £1,900,000, in 1960, it was over £700,000 and in 1962, it was £1,600,000, going up.  Everybody knows it is going up.  I do not think anybody has any serious doubts that we will be losing £2,000,000 at the end of the next financial year, or certainly by the deadline by which CIE have been asked to break even.  Everybody can see from the way costs are going that it was an absurd proposition anyway, that even if Dr. Andrews were ten times the man he thinks he is, he could not be expected to break even, not to talk of showing a profit by that date.</P>
    <P>Surely the only possible way of doing that would be to curtail services.  If you are to curtail the rail services which do not pay their way and replace them with bus services, where is this to stop?  The time will come when you will find it does not pay you to run a bus service from, say, Balbriggan to Dublin, Bray to Dublin, Dún Laoghaire to Dublin.  What will you do then if you are to put into effect this operative phrase: &ldquo;We must break even&rdquo;?  If you do insist on retaining that directive in your transport policy, where will you stop?  As soon as the bus service which replaces the rail service starts showing a loss, what is your position to be?  Take the services from Bray to Dublin, or from Dalkey and Dún Laoghaire to Dublin. That is the logic of your present position.</P>
    <P>Even in relation to merchandise, in relation to livestock, has there been a significant increase?  If we are to take the annual reports, the increase in tonnage was from 1,200,000 in 1959 to 1,800,000 in 1962, a relatively insignificant increase.  In spite of what the Minister may imply in his eulogy of Dr. Andrews there has been no spectacular take over by CIE of the transport of livestock.  The position did improve from 536,000 in 1959 to 541,000.  There is nothing very significant <Col N="1072" /> in that.  It is a relatively mild increase in view of the tremendous promise, in view of the undertaking that CIE would break even by 1964.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the various scales in connection with rural improvement schemes when progress was reported.  Under the old scale, some 1,165 offers of grant were made during the year ended 31st March, 1961, but lodgments were made in only 655 cases&mdash;553 new schemes and 102 for supplementary or part grants.  In the year ended 31st March, 1962, 1,297 offers were made and lodgments were made in 754 cases &mdash;657 new and 97 supplementary.  In fact, lodgments arrived during March in excess of available funds, and about £22,340 has been sanctioned in April in respect of lodgments made in the preceding month.  In announcing the new scale last year, my predecessor said that he had little doubt the full provision of £200,000 would be fully taken up and, as will be seen, his optimism has been fully justified.  It is against that background that an increased provision of £225,000 has been made for this service in 1962-63.</P>

    <P>Works of a better and more durable standard are done under the Rural Improvements Scheme than are possible <Col N="1073" /> under the Bog Development or Minor Employment Schemes, where, as already stated, in many instances the number of U.A. recipients limits the amount of money that can be made available.  The average road grant under Minor Employment Schemes was £140, under Bog Development Schemes £120 and under the Rural Improvements Scheme £305. The average bog development drainage grant was £90, compared with £176 for the average Rural Improvements Scheme drain.  I should emphasise that the Rural Improvements Scheme is not an employment scheme and, in fact, the payment of a contribution by the applicants does not constitute a claim to employment on the work, either as a ganger or otherwise.  First preference in employment is given to U.A. recipients, the second preference to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit, and it is only when the claims of these two types of persons have been met that contributors, or members of their families, can be considered for employment on a Rural Improvements Scheme.</P>
    <P>Coming to the current financial year, there were approximately 1,200 applications awaiting inspection under this scheme on the 1st April, 1962.  In the first six months, some 945 proposals were inspected and some 800 offers have been issued to the representative of the applicants.  Over 550 schemes were sanctioned, representing an expenditure of £125,500 out of the £225,000 available, so that all the indications are that the full amount available in the year will be expended. As stated in reply to Parliamentary Questions and in personal correspondence over recent months with most of the Deputies, the Special Employment Schemes Office have been short of a number of engineering inspectors for a considerable time and there has, therefore, necessarily, been some delay in overtaking the outstanding inspections.  I hope to have all the vacancies filled in the near future, when it should be possible to overtake the arrears.</P>
    <P>The provision for miscellaneous schemes was £15,000 in the last five years and this has been increased to <Col N="1074" /> £17,000 for 1962-63.  The expenditure in 1959-60 was £14,514; in 1960-61 it was only £9,920 and in the year just past it increased to £16,074.  This subhead is intended to meet expenditure on minor marine works, towards which county councils are required to contribute one-quarter of the cost, and which they are required to maintain on completion.  It also finances archaeological excavations and other miscellaneous schemes. Last year, archaeological excavations were authorised in: Creewood, Co. Meath, £670; Tawnley Hall, Co. Louth, £240; Templekieran, Loughane, Co.  Offaly, £300; Bealboru, Ballyvally, £850; and Raheenamadra, Knocklong, Co.  Limerick, £350; as well as a small tidying up job in Tara, costing about £70.  Usually about £2,500 is devoted to these archaeological excavations but this year over £7,000 has been allocated, including £800 for further work in Creewood, Slane, Co.  Meath, £1,100 for Newgrange and £400 for Knowth, making a total of £2,300, and a special allocation of £5,000 has been made to finance a scheme at High Street, Dublin.  Deputies interested in the latter scheme will have seen details of the work being undertaken there in recent articles in the Press: some of the activities have also been filmed.</P>
    <P>Dealing with this miscellaneous subhead last year, it was explained that, owing to the existing commitments, there was little prospect of many new miscellaneous schemes being sanctioned. The new marine works approved last year totalled only £2,580, which included the improvement of landing facilities at Cassan Sound, St. John's Point, £350 and a winch at Inver, £60, both in County Donegal; a landing slip at Traagawla, Bere Island, £1,900 and a winch at Travara, £90, both in County Cork, as well as some small expenditure to complete works at Lahanebeg, County Cork, £150, and Ervallagh pier in County Galway, £35.  In the current year, a number of further minor marine works have been sanctioned, including the improvement of landing places in Garahies, Bantry, £2,600; Illaun na gCaorach, Bere Island £540; <Col N="1075" /> Lahanebeg, Castletownbere, £1,610; Pallas Pier, Ardgroom, £1,500, all in County Cork; Portmagee, Caherciveen and the clearance of salmon fishing grounds in Dooagh, near Cromane in County Kerry, £800; Rathlacken, County Mayo, £260, and additional work at Cleggan Harbour, County Galway, £500.  Included in the expenditure figure of £16,074 for last year is £2,000 for accommodation roads on islands, of which approximately £1,700 was expenditure in the summer on roads on Clare Island and Inishturk Island, off the coast of Mayo, the remaining £300 being for a road work on Bere Island, County Cork.  Some island roads will also be included in the current year's programme.</P>
    <P>The appropriations-in-aid subhead, which is made up almost entirely of the contributions under the Rural Improvements Scheme, amounted to £36,400 in 1961-62 compared with £34,464 in 1960-61.  The Rural Improvements Scheme figures are £34,368 and £29,821 respectively.  It also includes receipts in respect of development works on privately owned bogs, the contributions from county councils towards the cost of minor marine works and the sale of surplus stores.  The figure in the estimate for 1962-63 is £41,000 compared with £35,000 in recent years, in view of the proposed increased provision for the Rural Improvements Scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the works financed from Vote 10, the Special Employment Schemes Office also acts as an agent of the Minister for Transport and Power in respect of the carrying out of development works to facilitate the output of turf for the four hand-won turf-fired generating stations at Caherciveen, Co. Kerry, Miltown Malbay, Co. Clare, Screeb, Co. Galway and Gweedore, Co. Donegal.  These schemes are financed from a National Development Fund allocation of £80,000 at the disposal of the Minister for Transport and Power.  New works, costing £11,065, were approved last year.</P>
    <P>The Special Employment Schemes Office also acts as agent for the Minister for the Gaeltacht in respect of the carrying out of accommodation road <Col N="1076" /> works in Gaeltacht areas financed from the Vote of that Department.  New works costing £37,725 were authorised in 1961-62, of which £16,290 was in Galway, £10,100 in Donegal, £6,010 in Mayo, £2,950 in Kerry and £2,375 in Cork.  The expenditure on these Gaeltacht schemes and on the works for the benefit of turf-fired generating stations will be accounted for by the Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Transport and Power respectively and not by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Applications for grants should be made in the first instance to the respective Departments also.</P>
    <P>The expenditure statement which has been circulated shows that almost the full amount, 98.2 per cent., available last year has been expended.  All Deputies would, no doubt, like to see more money provided for the different schemes operated by the Special Employment Schemes Office.  Apart from the employment they give, these schemes, particularly in rural Ireland, are recognised for their contribution to agricultural and fuel production. The difficulty in finding additional funds is, however, the place in the queue which these schemes must necessarily take having regard to the various calls that are made on the public purse to improve conditions in urban and rural areas.  Eradication of bovine tuberculosis, subsidisation of fertilisers, farm buildings, water schemes, arterial drainage, etc. are amongst the things which hitherto have had priority in the payment of allocations from the Exchequer.  The funds we are expending on minor roads and drains in rural areas and on amenities in town areas make meanwhile some small contribution towards the improvement of conditions for our people.</P>
    <P>I might say for the benefit of new Deputies that the Special Employment Schemes Office has no connection whatever with the Office of Public Works.  It just happens that I am supposed to be responsible for this Vote and this Office.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> The term &ldquo;Employment and Emergency Schemes&rdquo; is a sort of misnomer because most of the work done is valuable and necessary.  So far as I know, it is only under subhead E, Minor Employment Works, that absolute priority is given to considerations of employment rather than the merit of the work.  Inevitably, there is a high level of administrative expenditure in relation to the total sum spent. I say &ldquo;inevitably&rdquo; because normally in operations of this kind administration costs would be out of proportion to the normal expenditure, but I think a figure of ten per cent. of the total sum for salaries, wages and allowances &mdash;£87,430 out of £822,920&mdash;is rather excessive.  There may be an opportunity for pruning administrative expenditure in future years, and even this year, thus freeing more money for expenditure on schemes down the country.</P>
    <P>The figure for Urban Employment Schemes shows a reduction of £27,000 &mdash;from £227,000 to £200,000.  The Parliamentary Secretary justifies this by saying there are substantial increases in Road Fund grants.  I am a member of a local authority, Drogheda Corporation, dealing with an urban area.  Under this scheme we try to do work coming up to Christmas which would not be ordinarily done and which has a high level of employment. We find that the level of employment, in works for which we get Road Fund grants, is falling and that an increase in Road Fund grants does not mean, as the Parliamentary Secretary suggested, a higher level of employment. Because of new methods of road making, there is a lower level of employment for the amount of money spent.</P>
    <P>I should like to say from this side of the House, that we do not therefore accept the Parliamentary Secretary's explanation.  In fact, we believe that, when the figures are produced at the end of the year, the position will be that there will be fewer people employed on Road Fund work so that there is at least an equal necessity for the sort of work I have referred to: the cleaning up of public places and the repair of small, back streets and <i>culs-de-sac</i> where the ordinary Road <Col N="1078" /> Fund grant would not apply.  This sort of thing gives a high level of employment. In Drogheda this year we had a reduction of £200, which means £200 less for the fellows whose names are sent over on the unemployed list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary looks it up, he will find that is not so in our case.  Our problem is that we have just as many.</P>
      <P>It is wrong&mdash;and this occurred before the Parliamentary Secretary took office&mdash;that the amount for Rural Employment Schemes is so small. Louth County Council, of which I am a member, has a much smaller Rural Employment Scheme grant than Drogheda and Dundalk Corporations combined, both of which enjoy urban employment scheme grants.  There are many things necessary to be done in the country for which Road Fund grants are not available.  For example, there is the repair of third-class county roads, the removal of humped-back bridges and the creation of culverts for minor floodings.  Since the Local Authorities (Works) Act has been removed, there is more and more need for Rural Employment Schemes.  At £35,000 the amount for Rural Employment Schemes is extremely small and is ridiculously low compared to the £227,000 for urban employment schemes.  In Dublin city the urban employment scheme runs throughout the year.  All we can ever get from our allocation is a few weeks before Christmas.  That is the normal experience all over the country.  You can be just as hungry down the country as in Dublin.</P>

      <P>We have in this Vote the clash between what the rates <Col N="1079" /> should pay for and for what the central administration should pay. You have the case of the decent farmer, paying £200 or £300 rates on his land, who lives at the end of a long lane, which normally he could never hope to repair to a decent standard.  You might say that is his property, that it is a capital asset and that it is not for the State to appreciate it for him by giving him a good road. That would be a material outlook to take.  This man is paying a large sum in rates.</P>
      <P>In addition, he cannot keep tyres, axles, spring or shock-absorbers on his car, while his neighbour is in the position of paying perhaps a similar, or a lesser rate, but enjoys this very good road provided by the county council.</P>
      <P>When you consider that for development works under Subhead F on bogs used by landholders and other private producers a sum of £160,000 is provided, it is a question, then, of whether there should not be available to this farmer more opportunity to have this road up to his own house repaired.  I believe it is necessary that there should be an improvement here.  I am well aware that the Rural Improvements Scheme does give him an opportunity to do this on payment of a small contribution but, mark you, he will be waiting a long time for that.  I shall deal with that later.  Just as it is necessary to develop roads into bogs when a group of farmers want to cut their own turf and provide themselves with fuel, it is also necessary to consider the case of the man who has no hope at all of his lane being taken over by the county council and no hope, in relation to the capital asset he has, of ever bringing it to the stage of development at which he will have a decent road in and out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I took the figures for my own county off the file this morning.  We have a list of roads not taken over by the county council.  It is a very lengthy list.  To bring that list up to third-class county council road standard, after which there might be a possibility of the county council considering maintenance, would require a capital sum of £212,460, and that in the <Col N="1080" /> smallest county in Ireland.  The maintenance would be £8,582 and, in respect of that, there would be a 50 per cent. grant available.  Deputies can relate this to their own counties. For 4d. on the rates we could in Louth. as far as maintenance is concerned, take over all of these accommodation roads provided something could be done under the Rural Improvements Scheme grant to bring them up to the stage at which no capital sum would need to be spent by us.  If we were to spend the capital sum necessary, we would have to queue up with the other county councils for our share of the £200,000, and, if we were to do it ourselves, it would be 212d. on the rates because a penny gets £1,000.  If, however, the job were done for us by extending this scheme we could take over and maintain those roads for 4d. a year.  That is the picture.  These are the figures produced to us at the request of our county council.  I am sure similar figures could be produced for all the other counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy prepared to take over the lanes in Louth if they are put into proper condition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are prepared to consider taking over anything that is brought up to third class standard.  But the Deputy sees our dilemma.  If he is a member of a county council, and I am sure he is, it is his dilemma too.  The capital sum is so frightening that it could never be faced&mdash;212d. in Louth.  The Deputy's county would probably be worse.  But, when you take the Road Fund grant, the cost of maintenance, the roads having been put into third-class standard, would be only 4d. per year. That is the reason why the Rural Improvements Scheme, as distinct from the Rural Employment Scheme, should be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a long waiting list.  He said: &ldquo;Coming to the current financial year, there were approximately 1,200 applications waiting inspection under this scheme on 1st April, 1962.  In the first six months some 945 proposals were inspected and some 800 others have been issued <Col N="1081" /> to the representatives of the applicants.&rdquo; That is the situation where you have a long waiting list.  Do not think for a moment that I am hypercritical of this waiting list.  I fully appreciate that there has to be a waiting list.  Sometimes I get annoyed with Ministers who deny that such is the case.  I think it was a bit churlish of the Parliamentary Secretary, however, to advert to certain steps that were taken in 1956-57 in view of the fact that we had at that time an international credit squeeze and financial difficulty out of which we, by our decisions, got the country.</P>
    <P>I think the particular line he took earlier could have been saved for the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis next week.  I did not start this.  The Parliamentary Secretary started it.  Since he did, I think I am in order in taking him up on it and giving the House one simple set of figures.  He says: &ldquo;The Government of the day was not, however, prepared to finance the scheme on this generous basis,&rdquo; and he goes on to speak of the new scheme.  He does not advert to the fact, a fact which is quite clear from the figures issued, that in 1956-57 this Vote was £888,129.  Notwithstanding his statement of an announcement that the reception of applicants was being suspended, the position is that in 1956-57 the expenditure was £888,129.  In the following year, 1957-58, it was £857,719.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On Employment and Emergency Schemes.  In 1958-59 it was £834,931; in 1959-60 it was £852,104; in 1960-61 it was £837,952; in 1961-62 it was £844,594, and in 1962-63 it is £868,920.  Let us consider one increase in the meantime in relation to another aspect; in this year there is an increase in salaries, wages and allowances of £3,000. Without looking at any other increase in cost, you are up £3,000.  I do not want to claim any credit for this side of the House.  I do not want to produce any sort of political argument.  I just want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that next Tuesday or Wednesday might have been a better place and a more appropriate <Col N="1082" /> time for the sort of statement he made.</P>
      <P>Finally, we believe that there is a case now for an expansion, at least, in rural improvements in order to look after the capital expenditure necessary on many accommodation roads throughout the country to bring them up to the stage where county councils, in their wisdom, can consider whether or not to take them over and put them on the rates.  We believe the figures I have given show that the charge upon the rates, if county councils had to bring the roads up to the standard necessary, would be quite impossible and would be absolutely unfair to the ratepayers.  We think the Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;a young, active man, and often described as brilliant&mdash;could have addressed himself to this Vote with greater enthusiasm and greater energy.  If he had done so, we believe he would have come to our conclusion that the Subhead should have been extended considerably to look after this matter and we have, therefore, decided to move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few general remarks on this Vote. Frankly, I want to say in the first place that I consider that not enough money is provided for the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote.  It will be seen from the tables, with which the Parliamentary Secretary was kind enough to furnish us, that there has been no appreciable change in the overall figure over a period of six or seven years.</P>
      <P>While expenditure under these subheads for the year 1956-57 was £888,129, this year we propose to provide something like £20,000 less, that is, a total of £868,920.  Of course, the immediate reply is to the effect that we have not the same number unemployed, but we have unemployed. While we have not the same number unemployed, it is accepted that we have some unemployed.  In that case, we should be prepared and able to afford more for those people who have not employment in this country.  I do not think that is unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent figures issued by <Col N="1083" /> the Taoiseach's Office show that at the week ending 3rd November we had 40,064 unemployed.  When we compare that with the figure of 43,338 last year, we see that there are slightly less than 3,000 fewer unemployed this year than there were last year.  Anyone who has had experience&mdash;or should I say knowledge&mdash;of providing relief for the unemployed knows that the money provided in the rural areas, and particularly in the urban areas, does not do a great deal to relieve unemployment. It never did provide employment for a sizable number of workers.</P>
    <P>We should accept the responsibility that we undoubtedly have, and that the Government particularly have, for the unemployed, because if they are not sustained here by way of employment or assistance from the Department of Social Welfare they have no option but to emigrate.  I do not think we are killing ourselves in this Vote by providing less than £1,000,000.  Let no one misinterpret me by subsequently alleging that I said that less than £1,000,000 only is provided for employment.  There is much more from the various other Departments, from practically every other Department in the State, but this is the only Department which states it is providing money for the main purpose of giving employment to unemployed Irishmen.</P>
    <P>Frankly, I say it is not enough.  I have often advocated in this House, and members of my Party have advocated, the provision of millions of pounds, if necessary, to keep Irish people at home.  I think it would be worthwhile because while emigration is not as great as it has been, while it still stands at about 20,000 per year, there is still the problem of providing work for our people to induce them, as I have said, not to emigrate until we can provide good, remunerative and secure employment for them.</P>
    <P>In my own town, which is an urban area, while the effect of this sort of money might have been good some years ago it is pretty negligible today. It does not do a lot for what I might describe as the genuinely unemployed and, therefore, the Government would <Col N="1084" /> do well, at smaller cost than they would have some years ago, to provide much more money now&mdash;double it, treble it or multiply it by six&mdash;in order to give some happiness to some of the 30,000 or 40,000 who are unemployed during the year.</P>
    <P>I remember Government speakers being very enthusiastic some years ago about a measure about which was introduced&mdash;and that enthusiasm was subscribed to by the Labour Party&mdash; by the Minister for External Affairs who was then either Minister for Finance or acting Minister for Finance. It was, I suppose, about ten years ago that he introduced legislation to provide what was called a national development fund.  I honestly had hopes for it, but it seems to have been forgotten.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go into it in detail.  I only want to say that it seemed at that time that the Government, a Fianna Fáil Government, were determined that no one would be unemployed for want of money.  It disappeared.  Compared with the millions which were mentioned in the debate when that legislation was being introduced, we now have a figure of £868,920 which certainly does not fill the Bill or provide against the unemployment situation which we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, as I know him, and as the House knows him, is not a man who will stay in a rut.  He has been rightly applauded for the changes he has made.  I do not say that he has made revolutionary changes but he has certainly demonstrated that he is not prepared to do what the previous Parliamentary Secretary did, or what other Parliamentary Secretaries did away back since that office was established.  I should like to appeal to him now to give serious consideration to the idea of not allocating moneys for unemployment in accordance with figures for unemployment which are given in the previous January.  That annoys many urban authorities.  It annoys <Col N="1085" /> many local authorities because the situation changes or can change &mdash; it does not necessarily change every year &mdash;in every single one of the 12 months.</P>
    <P>In my home town, January is a reasonably good month for employment by reason of the pattern of employment in the foundries.  I think it is totally unjust to relate the grant that is to be given with the number unemployed in January in respect of Wexford town.  Dundalk, Drogheda, Cork or Dublin may be the same.  The whole scheme should be more flexible. The Parliamentary Secretary should take the power to have regard to the situation of unemployment that exists, say, in the month of October or November or any other month in which there appears to be distress in an area.  That could easily be got.  I have mentioned my home town of Wexford.  There is a particular problem there in regard to employment in the foundry.  Unemployment is worse there now than it is in January and the relief granted will operate in relation to the figures of unemployment for January of this year.</P>
    <P>I believe also that it is necessary to provide much more employment in the rural areas or we will be confronted with a situation that will be detrimental to the agricultural industry, because of the scarcity of the agricultural workers.  It seems to me that the agricultural industry either does not want to, or in many cases cannot, give 12 months' employment to those who are generally regarded as agricultural workers.  There are so many attractions in the towns, and particularly in the towns and cities of Great Britain, that they are not content with eight or nine months' work, or even ten months' work, when there is the prospect of 12 solid months of employment with reasonably good wages and security in Coventry, Bristol, London or any other city.  Therefore it is necessary for the people themselves and for the agricultural economy, until such time as they can be fully, gainfully employed, to fill the gaps that undoubtedly exist so far as agricultural workers are concerned.  Possibly that is not the fault of the agricultural industry but the problem is there.  In <Col N="1086" /> many parts of the country when these workers are needed by the farmers in the busy time, they are not available and that can be detrimental to the whole agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in regard to forestry workers and road workers, one thing that attracts workers especially in the rural areas to emigrate is not entirely the inadequate wages they get but the feeling of insecurity.  There are tens of thousands of such workers in the rural areas, those who are taken on by the county councils, say, for six, eight or nine months.  They just will not be there in a short time to do the road work if they are not guaranteed security or if there does not appear to be some guarantee of security of employment for them.</P>
    <P>I do not think many of those who are in responsible positions have an appreciation of the circumstances of agricultural workers, forestry workers and road workers in that respect.  I have been told on many occasions by an engineering official of the county council to whom I make representations for a job for a rural worker: &ldquo;That fellow got nine months' work last year&rdquo; or: &ldquo;That fellow has just completed three months' employment with us.&rdquo;  These officials believe that should satisfy the man for another three months, that if he gets eight or nine months' work in the year, he should be satisfied&mdash;that is his quota for the 12 months.  However, the workers are becoming a little wiser and have begun to cast their eyes on the cities here and, unfortunately, on the cities in Britain.  If they can get 12 months' work not necessarily in Dagenham but in other industries in Britain, they will take it and will leave the county council, forestry and agricultural work there.</P>
    <P>This is a problem the Parliamentary Secretary will not resolve in this Vote and possibly will not resolve in the next 12 months but one which is dangerous because, while we have these 40,000 odd unemployed, we may find ourselves in a situation where we shall, like many countries in Europe, be crying out for manpower, the manpower we are now exporting at the rate of 20,000 to 25,000 per year.</P>
    <P>While I am, in the first place, concerned <Col N="1087" /> about giving the man work and good wages, the general problem is to retain the labour in this country.  After all, even if it is considered to be a pool or reserve of labour, 40,000 is not a big number if we are thinking in terms, as the Taoiseach seems to be, of bringing over another 40 German industries, of attracting American, British or Belgian industrialists here to establish factories.  In those circumstances, that is, providing we are not to have redundancy on our entry into the Common Market, there will be a scarcity of workers in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Somebody may say: &ldquo;On the one hand, he is talking in terms of scarcity of employment, while on the other hand, he says if we enter the Common Market, there may be a redundancy problem of 30,000, 40,000, 90,000 or 100,000.&rdquo;  That may be so, but if we are to believe the Taoiseach and the Government claims that we will not have a redundancy problem, if we are to believe them when they say we shall have much more employment, we should spend money to keep the workers here.  Goodness knows, we have let enough of them out of the country in the past 10, 15 or 20 years. I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to do all he can to get the money to keep the unemployed in the towns or rural areas in some sort of employment.  I do not necessarily mean gainful or productive employment but some sort of employment until the other opportunities arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take a new look during the next year at these special employment and relief schemes. We have been trying to get roads repaired such as those of which Deputy Donegan spoke.  I do not often agree with him but I agree with his remarks on the problem in various county council areas dealing with roads leading to farmhouses.  We have had some of these roads repaired in County Dublin, thanks to the rural improvements scheme provided by the Parliamentary Secretary.  However, there is one thing holding up this work in County Dublin, the fact that such schemes cannot be worked unless there <Col N="1088" /> are a large number of people unemployed in the area.  That policy will have to be changed if we are ever to improve the very bad roads leading to homesteads in Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate sometimes that when, say, seven people using a road may agree to a contribution under the rural improvement schemes, one or two contrary people hold up the scheme.  Now that the country has become more prosperous and there is more money to hand for schemes of that kind, we should tackle this on a national basis.  The county councils are only too anxious, if these roads are put in a third or fourth rate condition, to take them over and keep them in repair.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will do something to speed up the rate at which these roads are being repaired.</P>
      <P>Relief grants at Christmas are very acceptable but the system under which they have been given over the years should be changed.  It should be changed for the betterment of the workers.  In a period of prosperity, more generous treatment should be extended to unemployed persons.  The system adopted over the years has been to provide niggardly relief schemes at Christmas.</P>
      <P>December-January is a lean period for certain people.  There is not a great deal of unemployment in County Dublin at present but there is some in every district.  One person is as important as another.  Every citizen has the right to get a living in his country, if the country can afford to give him a living.  In County Dublin. a great deal of work has been carried out under employment schemes.  The cleaning of intermediate rivers in County Dublin at an estimated cost of over £500,000 is a very generous contribution from the State to the constituency and I want to avail of this opportunity to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for his assistance in matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of relief schemes, there should be special work schemes during the Christmas period which should not be confined to persons registered as unemployed. The schemes should be reasonably flexible.  If there is unemployment <Col N="1089" /> in a district, it should be possible to allocate money to that district for the purpose of providing employment.  I would recommend the adoption of such a scheme, whereby grants could be given to areas where there are a number of persons unemployed as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the Government, and which would eliminate all the restrictions inherent in the old system that has been operating since the establishment of the State.</P>
    <P>That suggestion of mine could not have been adopted at a time when money was not available.  There has been an improvement in our financial position and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the possibility of providing special work schemes for the relief of unemployment. Such schemes could include road improvement, the taking over of <i>culsde-sac,</i> laneways and so on.  Any scheme the county engineer recommended should be carried out.  We should not be tied to an outmoded system.  The Parliamentary Secretary is a highly intelligent and resourceful person and will be able to put up a good case to the Minister for Finance for a review of relief schemes as at present operated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise only because of some words Deputy Burke used.  I take it the allocations to the urban districts are related mathematically to the unemployment problem?  That is all I have to ask the Parliamentary Secretary: Is there a relationship between the allocation to the urban district and the unemployment situation in that district?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make on this Vote.  One is in connection with a matter to which Deputy Corish referred, that is, the qualification period for the grants.  I suppose for the purpose of making the allocation, it is convenient in the month of January each year to reckon the number of persons at the labour exchange drawing unemployment assistance and to base the amount of grant on that figure, but, as Deputy Corish said, it is a most unrealistic way of dealing with the matter.  While there <Col N="1090" /> may be a surplus of work left over from unemployment schemes until after Christmas, it could happen that there would be very few persons unemployed in an area in early January, whereas towards the middle of the year or perhaps over the remainder of the year, there might be ten times that number on the unemployment assistance register. The allocation must be related, nevertheless, to the number of persons on the register in the previous January. If the Parliamentary Secretary could be empowered to exercise his discretion, after an amount had been made available for the relief of unemployment over the entire State, it would be a far better way of dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the fact that he does not, in his capacity as head of the Board of Works, operate on the principle that because a thing has been done in a certain way for years, that is the right way of doing it.  I hope he will adopt the same approach in regard to the administration of this Vote.</P>
      <P>With regard to Christmas relief schemes, it is rather unfortunate that while schemes are notified to the local authority relatively early in the year, the local authorities do not bring the matter to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary's Office for sanction until it is too late for the Christmas period.  It is a shocking thing that when a number of persons depend for their Christmas dinner on these schemes, some local authority is too lazy to get the engineer to prepare a scheme and submit it for sanction.  The result is that these people cannot get work until January when the record is being taken for the following year's allocation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that but there are numerous instances where the local authority has not forwarded the schemes in time for sanction for the Christmas period.  It has happened that some local authorities, on the advice of their technical people, have submitted completely unreal schemes <Col N="1091" /> which the Parliamentary Secretary's Office have had no option but to refuse to sanction.  In such a case the scheme goes back to the local authority and by the time it is reviewed, Christmas is over and that is that.  I do not say that the people concerned do not need work at other times but the most important time is between now and Christmas.  Every effort should be made by the Parliamentary Secretary to force local authorities to submit schemes in time so that employment could be given for the Christmas period.</P>
      <P>The question of grants under the rural improvements scheme for work on lanes leading to dwellinghouses and leading to agricultural land has been raised by a number of speakers.  Many local authorities like to give the impression that the only way these matters can be dealt with is by a scheme submitted from the Parliamentary Secretary's Office but the local authority of which I am a member has dealt with this matter in a different way.  As a result of an Act which was passed some years ago and which was sponsored by Deputy McQuillan, that local authority has declared every lane on which there are two or more houses a public road and has repaired every such lane.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one complaint, that is, that when they do that, they are not allowed to avail of the grant which the Special Employment Schemes Office would make available, if the tenants themselves had repaired the lane.  It may be asked: why do the tenants not undertake the repair, in the first instance, and the council could take it over afterwards?  If the council waited for that they would wait a long time.  Deputy Burke referred to a lane which six or seven people were using and where there was one contrary person.  If there is one contrary person who will not pay his share of the cost, the whole thing is held up for years.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have a good look at this and while it may not benefit County Meath very much because we have almost finished with our schemes, I think it would benefit rural Ireland very much if some arrangement could <Col N="1092" /> be made whereby the grants which normally accrue to the tenants, if they do the lanes, could be passed on to the local authority when they in fact take them over and declare them to be public roads to be maintained and repaired by the local authority.</P>
    <P>The whole question of schemes has been dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary in a very detailed manner and there is little more comment that I would, or could, make on it except for one last point and that is the question of the allocations for those amenity schemes.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary was referring to the last list of amenity schemes which are, in fact, administered through the Local Government Department or whether he was dealing with the schemes which he has referred to as having been carried out at Newgrange and Tara. If he was referring to those, if his office can do anything about them every effort should be made now to end the very long trail which a number of people have been following to have something definite done about Tara.</P>
    <P>Tara was the seat of the high kings of Ireland and one of the most historic places in Europe.  Yet we have people wrangling over years as to whether they should put up a public convenience there and a shed in which they should show a few items or whether they should in a decent way try to perpetuate the memory of Tara. If the Parliamentary Secretary has any say&mdash;I do not know whether he has or not&mdash;or any money, I would ask him to give every assistance possible to Meath County Council who are at present trying to have this matter finalised because, unless everybody gives goodwill to this issue, we shall finish up in another 15 or 20 years, if we live so long, still wrangling over what type of monument should eventually be placed on Tara Hill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary and the staff on the way this Estimate has been introduced.  He has certainly gone into very great detail.  I also thank him for including in this year's list of minor employment schemes the figures <Col N="1093" /> allocated to each road.  I think every Deputy will welcome&mdash;it is the first time it happened since I came to this House&mdash;the showing of the exact allocation to each road on the same sheet as the mention of the road itself. Heretofore, when you were asked how much was allocated for a particular road you were unable to tell the people and, when you came to the Office, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</P>
      <P>I think it is time that some Parliamentary Secretary in charge of this section or Department would examine the whole scheme because I feel we are not getting the results we should get. When we get a job of work to do, to complete a road or roads, these should be completed up to a certain standard and then ask the local authorities to take them over and maintain them thereafter.  As it is, you get an allocation of from £100 to £300 for a road of one or two miles and what happens is that the engineer comes out, gives an order to the ganger or foreman that so many perches must be done.  The men go along and throw in a few shovels of blue sand into the potholes but the first tractor that comes over it slashes out the sand again and it is just as bad in six months' time.</P>
      <P>Some of the public money spent on some of these schemes is just wasted. The work should be done up to whatever standard is set by the engineer and the local authority should be asked if they are prepared to take it over and if it is brought up to that standard, let them take it over.  In my constituency we have done that for the past few years and I feel we shall do it in the future if the roads are brought up to that standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how schemes are selected in different areas.  The Parliamentary Secretary may say they are picked on the distribution of unemployment. Granted that is so; yet certain villages in different townlands with more than a gang, as they say, of unemployed are left out year after year.  I know a few of them which I shall not mention that have been left out year after year and the same has happened this year as for the past five or six or seven years.  You will find a <Col N="1094" /> road on which a certain amount of money was spent last year and a certain amount the year before.  This year it is cut out, without the road being completed.  That grant will not be spent again for perhaps three or four years and when the Office comes back the money allocated will be spent on the first few yards and the people living at the far end of the road never see the road at their end being repaired.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary especially for the development of Clifden Harbour, for the protection of fishing boats and the boom which is being erected at present.  I urge him, before he finishes the job there, to lift the silt at present in the dock, so making the harbour deeper and better.</P>
    <P>Another objection I have is to the spending of money on drawing sand over long distances for road repair purposes. You can see eight-ton or tenton lorries bringing sand for 15 to 20 miles when sand might be obtained nearer.  If you have a scheme to relieve unemployment and you hand it over to a contractor to draw sand you are not taking unemployed off the register.  I think that is wrong and wherever available I think sand should be got in the immediate locality to which the money is allocated.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am sure every Deputy from rural Ireland would agree with what I am about to say now.  It concerns the consent form that has to be signed by people living on the road before work starts.  Somebody in the village may have had a falling-out with the neighbour ten or fifteen years ago and for that reason will not sign.  If it were a new road, I should have no objection to the form but, if the road is there for the past 60 or 80 years, surely there is no need for a consent if you want to spread a bit of sand on it?  If I have a grudge against my neighbour I will not sign and the road cannot go ahead.  I do not see why that should be so.  There is no need for it.  If it were a question of widening the road, taking off corners, touching an individual's field something could be said for it but in cases where you are not affecting anybody's property but merely repairing <Col N="1095" /> the road the consent form should be abolished.  The sooner that is done the more satisfactorily these schemes can be carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the main representation of rural Deputies of the House goes, no doubt they are more interested in rural improvement schemes than in any other part of this Vote.  That section of the Parliamentary Secretary's Department can do much more than is being done at the moment.  It is certainly a matter of interest to see the amount of work that is being done.  This is extremely important.</P>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Tully referring to what the Meath County Council were able to do to bring roads up to standard.  He is very lucky in that Meath happens to have a good, solid terrain.  I can assure him if his county council had to face up to a problem similar to that in County Cork, 5/- in the £ in the rates would not make much of an impact on bringing up to standard the tremendous mileage involved in counties so large and so diverse as County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that respect, I am glad that a number of us in the council have over the past few years been responsible for implementing a closer liaison between the engineering staffs of the county council and the rural improvements scheme office.  We now have the happy situation that it is almost automatic that when a road is brought up to standard by that office, the county council take it over and mainit thereafter.  This is a very good encouragement to those prepared to contribute to get such work done.  In the past, contributors found that when the work was done, the standard deteriorated and after the passage of some years, their condition was almost as bad as it was before the investment was made.  Now we have this situation and it is working satisfactorily.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to proceed as quickly as possible with the job in hand and to encourage as many as possible of those people who have not yet availed of the scheme to avail of it.  We speak of the necessity for increased agricultural production and <Col N="1096" /> about the difficulties of people in remote parts.  Here we have an opportunity of assisting them in a very sensible and tangible manner.</P>
    <P>I suggest we could not put State moneys and the energies of the Department to better use than to proceed apace with the improvement and taking over of such laneways.  It should also be borne in mind that with the use of large modern farm machinery, wider roadways are necessary. We are aware of the legal difficulties in regard to the widening of such roadways but nevertheless if anything could be done, I suggest it would be worthwhile in ensuring that farmers who are prepared to work harder and extend production would be facilitated by being provided with access for the type of machinery necessary for them in order to carry out this work.</P>
    <P>Some references were made to objections by the type of person who will object for some petty reason but up to 1950 many of those who objected had greater reason for their objections because it was only then that the sliding scale was introduced. There is no doubt that that was the big break-through in obtaining agreement among landowners on such roadways.  The fact that the small landowner could not see his way to pay as much as his more prosperous neighbour was understandable, but with the graded payments, that difficulty has been eased to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>I should also like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary that we should not accept that because in the Book of Estimates there appears some little increase in the amount of expenditure, we must relate that to the increased cost which every Department, and every employer, has to face in carrying out any type of work.  In order to get the work done, a greater amount of money will have to be allocated and let us hope when this is forthcoming, he will have sufficient personnel in his Department to ensure that applications are dealt with as rapidly as they are presented to him.</P>
    <P>One further point I wish to make is in relation to improved facilities on the coast and to bring to the Parliamentary <Col N="1097" /> Secretary's notice a pier which is deserving of attention at Clonakilty Harbour.  It is Ring Pier where the situation at the moment is that it appears to be nobody's child.  It has been examined by a number of people who are prepared to go as far as they can go but the major work necessary to provide facilities for fishing and pleasure boats will have to be carried out by the Parliamentary Secretary's office.  I hope if he is in the office during the coming 12 months, we will be able to avail of his services to ensure that the conditions there, which at the moment are pretty grim, will be rectified.  I emphasise, both from the point of view of tourism and the point of view of local fishing interests, that the repairs to that pier should be undertaken with the shortest possible delay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary indicated in his speech, this Estimate deals with very important features of town and country life.  Consequently, instead of approaching it from the viewpoint of the employment content which it provides, it should, as some speakers stressed, be looked upon more as improving the rural conditions of our people, in outlying areas particularly. The rising generations are not prepared any longer to put up with the muddy approaches from the road to their homes which have now been brought up to standard.  The contrast is too great and should not be allowed continue. The dynamic approach of the Parliamentary Secretary is to be commended. In the first instance, we have the Special Employment Schemes for cities and towns.  The grants are related to the amount of unemployment and the diversity of work for them is limited.  They may improve the footpaths; they may perhaps get rid of bad corners on some of the roadways or of projections constructed on urban roads by people who are unco-operative, and even though the sites may be derelict, they are not prepared to allow the council to straighten out the bends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Barry was Lord Mayor of Cork, we made some progress in regard to amenities like <Col N="1098" /> the planting of trees.  We debated for a considerable time whether grants could be got either under the amenity scheme or under the Special Employment Schemes for such purposes.  At the present time when some of the railways are being closed, we will have big vehicles approaching the cities. The roads may have to be improved so that non-stopping traffic, such as large beet lorries and so on, may be diverted into the marginal roads in the city, rather than have them holding up traffic, causing delay at traffic lights and generally obstructing the flow of traffic in the city.  These are the principal problems to be dealt with in town and city areas.</P>
    <P>I am sure the local councils will in due time be able to tackle these problems if they get sufficient co-operation from the Departments.  I am more concerned with the rural position.  I have in mind the roadways approaching farmhouses and, in some instances, cottages.  In the past, cottages were built in very out of the way places without any proper roadway to them &mdash;at the end of lanes, and so on.  The people are left there, all their lives, in these conditions.  Under the law and regulations applying to rural improvements, these people cannot improve their position because they cannot afford to make the contributions that may be needed in these cases.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who feel that every link roadway, no matter how small it may be, should be declared a road of public utility and improved by the county council.  Sometimes we are told by the officials that it is not a road of general public utility because it is not used by very many.  It cannot be used because its condition is too bad.  Very often, such a roadway would shorten the distance of travel between various places if it were brought into proper condition so that people could travel along it.  That is the first thing I would say about these rural roads.  If they are a bit narrow, they can be improved and brought up to standard.  Somebody is using them all the time and some people must stay in them all the time.</P>
    <P>Another point for consideration is that we have some roads where, as <Col N="1099" /> members of the council know, only a few people reside, but they are pretty long roads.  It would take a considerable amount of money to bring them up to standard.  In some cases, it would cost hundreds of pounds.  Surely, one or two men cannot be expected, from their own resources, if they have high valuations as they sometimes have, to give the necessary allocation for the improvement of these roads which, when repaired, will be of general public utility and used by the people generally? Some of these are in old estates where, I suppose, farms were confiscated, in days gone by.  When the landlord saw the trend of events, he sold off some of these farms individually. The only roadways there now are the old passages that were there in the landlord's time.  These matters should be dealt with rapidly if we are to attain the standards we desire in our country areas.</P>
    <P>In order to do that, it would perhaps be necessary to decentralise our administration. Take the Rural Improvements Scheme in the County of Cork, for example.  I think the headquarters for these schemes is in Tralee, County Kerry.  The person responsible for whatever works are done in the southern area is there.  I have no objection whatsoever to him.  He is an excellent man.  He does his work well and supervises it well.  However, how can a person who is so remote from County Cork as the farthest point of Kerry, almost&mdash;leaving out the Dingle Peninsula&mdash;look after these schemes in a county the size of Cork as well as in the county of Kerry?  I think our administration should be decentralised.</P>
    <P>I would further suggest that the services of county engineers and district engineers be used to a greater extent in the ordinary survey of these roads in relation to rural improvements schemes.  They would be able to give the occupiers or the persons concerned an indication of the cost.  On the document presented today by the Parliamentary Secretary in relation to the percentage of payments required, the people concerned would have a good idea of their responsibilities. <Col N="1100" /> Perhaps it would be an encouragement to them to go ahead.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult, and I suppose most Deputies find it very difficult, to get people in rural areas to sign forms of any kind involving contributions.  In effect, they say: &ldquo;We do not know what this will lead to in the end or how much we shall have to pay.&rdquo;  You may tell them, when you see the figures: &ldquo;This signing of the document in relation to the proposal does not commit you to anything.  If you feel it is beyond your capacity to pay you can leave it there until future conditions permit or until the law is changed or until some other scheme will come up which will improve your condition&rdquo;.  Nevertheless, such people do not wish to sign.  These are two points which I think everybody meets with and consequently these schemes are frequently delayed.</P>
    <P>The question of bog roads does not affect our areas very much.  Some improvements were made there from time to time.  However, in relation to rural improvements schemes, we also meet with the position that sometimes they lead off the road down towards the sea: they are <i>culs-de-sac.</i>  They are not improved.  They may lead to a little bay or to some place where people might like to disport themselves in summer, and so on, because the well known beaches are now becoming very crowded, particularly those within striking distance of big populated areas.  Grants are not given for them. It is said, in effect: &ldquo;This road is not really an established road.  Even though you are living on it&mdash;one person only&mdash; or your farm is there, very much cannot be done for you because you are alone.  In any case, you would have to pay your proportion of the grant right down to the sea.  It would have to be one job.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Very often, farmers, in consequence, consider that such a proposition would be beyond their capacity.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give the local authority the same power as, say, in the case of a small farmer with, say, 15 acres of land who may allocate an acre to the housing authority who will build a cottage there for him.  That is looked upon as <Col N="1101" /> a special instance case.  If there are any of these problems where one man is living in one of these laneways and is trying to have the position improved, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could, on the recommendation of the county council, consider some of these cases as special instance cases when it is obviously beyond the capacity of the man, who may have a high valuation but who is in a lonely place, to pay the required contribution, based on his valuation.</P>
    <P>I make that suggestion to the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not know whether or not he may be able to put it into operation.  However, he is managing to surmount many problems which were difficult up to this.</P>
    <P>The provision of proper piers and landing places also deserves special consideration because on a large coastline like that of Cork and Kerry, regard must be had to the demands of these people who risk their lives in sea fishing in order to provide a livelihood for themselves during the periods of the year when they have nothing to do on the land or elsewhere. When the county councils deprived them of the system under which they could build small sections of road by contract, part of their livelihood was taken from them.  That type of thing is in great measure gone; all the work is done now by direct labour by the employees of the county councils and it would be a great thing for these people if part of this road building were given back to them.  They must continue to be encouraged to live where they do, in places which, though they may be beautiful and attractive in many ways, do not provide the natural resources for a decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>We have the problem of the clearing of obstructions in minor rivers flowing into the sea or into tidal estuaries.  I know a number of these cases and I have been in contact with the Parliamentary Secretary regarding them.  The local people are often reluctant to sign the necessary forms to have this work put under way because they have had previous experience of inspectors visiting the districts <Col N="1102" /> at a time when the whole place was flooded and coming back with the story that there was not sufficient fall and that they could do nothing about it.  Farmers who live in these places, and others acquainted with the conditions, say the first inspection should be made in the summer when the rivers are low.  At that stage, if there are trees obstructing the water or which may obstruct it when the river is in spate, or if there are banks which have subsided into the stream, they can be seen clearly.  There is no use in inspecting a river when it is in flood because the only inspection that can be carried out in such conditions is from a hill above the flooded area. As the saying goes, it is only when the inspector can walk the land, when he can walk along the bank of the stream and see the situation properly that the potential obstruction of the water can be properly gauged and a genuine report made so that proper steps can be taken to improve the flow of the water.</P>
    <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary indicated here today that he is trying to recruit more inspectors. Because of understaffing in that office, it is hard to blame the inspectors.  It is very difficult for an inspector, under present staffing conditions, to do his work properly.  I know some of them who work night and day trying to facilitate people and keep ahead of their schedule.  If the work were decentralised, a number of these small streams could be cleared each year and much fertile land improved consequently. If there is difficulty about getting the machinery on contract locally, it could be provided by the Department itself.</P>
    <P>The last point I wish to bring to the Parliamentary Secretary's attention is the problem of the island roads, to which the Parliamentary Secretary himself referred earlier.  The Parliamentary Secretary pointed out that he was spending money on those islands. Some of those island people agitate&mdash; they say they will not pay their rates because nothing is done for them. There would be no great gratitude due to us if we were to spend on these island roads the amount of money the islanders pay in rates because in most <Col N="1103" /> cases they have not the services of doctors, nurses or teachers.  Anything we can do to improve their way of life, whether by way of Departmental schemes or otherwise, should be considered favourably.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary deserves our thanks for having done so much under these heads since he assumed office.  He has done a considerable amount of work in trying to push things ahead, very often in the teeth of local obstacles and old prejudices by reason of which local communities fear that if they fill out forms, the authorities will impose on them as a result.  The only way in which we can overcome that attitude is by pursuing a progressive approach to it ourselves.  If we adopt such methods, we shall be helping and encouraging the rural population, giving them some return for the rates they are paying and providing their sons and daughters with an opportunity to grow up in better conditions than their fathers enjoyed in bygone days.</P>

      <P>When I came into the House, I did not intend to participate in the debate.  As a matter of fact, I have not even seen or read the Parliamentary Secretary's statement. However, I have listened to some of the speeches made here, I feel I must say a few words.  Every speaker so far has heaped bouquets on the Parliamentary Secretary.  By all means, he is entitled to some of them, but so are the members of the staff of the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I have been in this House during the past 11 years, I have been a source of great trouble year in year out to that office and I say sincerely that I am grateful to the staff for what they have done.  I am not for a moment trying to detract from the tributes paid to the Parliamentary Secretary since he took office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Deputies who spoke tonight tried to tell the Parliamentary Secretary and his staff what they should do. From my experience of the Parliamentary Secretary since he took office, and of his staff, I say that much of what Deputies said tonight could be more beneficially directed to the people <Col N="1104" /> who apply for grants for different works because I can say from hardearned experience that if the people concerned co-operated with one another in respect of the facilities and the grants offered by the Department in the past, the Estimate introduced tonight would be for a far smaller amount.  I say this in all good faith.</P>
    <P>A group of people were offered a grant of £1,000, which I thought was very liberal.  They were asked to contribute £9 apiece.  There were one or two of them who would not do it.  Even the Special Employment Schemes Office, with whom I took the matter up again, agreed to halve it. Half the work could be done this year for half the cost and the other half could be done the following year, but they would not do it.  It is all very fine to tell the people here what they should do and what they should not do.  Something should be done to educate the people and make them appreciate the grants which are made available at a small cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about the roads. As a matter of fact, in County Clare, we have too many roads.  Due to the grants given by the Special Employment Schemes Office, through the Parliamentary Secretary, last Monday I got two roads taken over by the council.  If I did, the men who got the grants contributed to the making of the road.  It is all very fine for Deputies to say that the council should take over those roads.  If people live on a roadway such as I have described; if they have any interest at all in their holdings or in their family having a decent entrance to their homes, surely it is not too much to ask them to contribute some small sum, whether it is £5, £6 or £7, towards the making of the road and thus provide the comfort they are looking for?</P>
    <P>We cannot always be looking to the Government, any Government, to fork out money for everything.  It is up to the people themselves to avail of what the Government can give them at a very small price indeed.  If the people co-operated among themselves and with the Special Employment Schemes Office, this Estimate need not be as much as it is tonight and the drains on the roads in the County Clare would <Col N="1105" /> be in a much better condition than they are today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the last speaker.  His approach to the whole matter of roads and public finances was reasonable and sane.  We are all well aware that the Celts were more or less an urban people.  Penal laws and invasions drove them into the wilderness and backward places.  The history of our people is reflected in the story of these <i>cul-de-sac</i> lanes that are not yet taken over by the county councils.</P>
      <P>It is an immense problem.  From the beginning, the question of the roads was a very big item for any Government to tackle.  During our lifetime, modes of transport have changed considerably.  Traffic has increased out of all proportion on the roads and even on these <i>cul-de-sac</i> lanes.  We have got away from the horse traffic. Heavy vehicles of all kinds are now seen in the most backward places.  All these changes have led to the problem of trying to meet the desire of each individual householder in this country to have a tarred road at his door.  It is only reasonable to put the main arteries into condition, first of all, and then devote the rest of our resources, gradually, to bringing the others up to the same standard.</P>
      <P>The rural employment scheme has worked reasonably well.  Any scheme must have its growing pains and this scheme, naturally, had its growing pains.  It has done a tremendous amount of good.  The greatest fault I find with it is that many county councils are not prepared to take over these roads when they are put into repair under the rural improvements scheme.  Therein, I think, lies the greatest disadvantage.  It is the county councils who have refused to take over these roads who are at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the comparison which the Deputy from County Meath made, I wish to state that there is a vast difference between his constituency and mine, which is a neighbouring constituency.  It is a well-known fact that you could actually drive a tractor or lorry through any field in his constituency but I should not like to <Col N="1106" /> predict what would happen if you tried to do the same on the lanes, not to speak of the fields, in my county.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to say that it is easy for county councils to face the problem and to put all these <i>cul-de-sac</i> lanes and roads into repair.  That would be a colossal effort on their part.  I do not think it is something the ratepayers would welcome.  This scheme has worked reasonably well. I do not know whether the county councils could legally be asked to do this.  There are county councils which are unwilling to face up to this problem. It would be wrong for us to try to get it across to the ordinary people living in these parts that the Government or anybody else can solve this problem overnight.  I feel that the scheme is a reasonably good one and until we get something better, we should continue as we have been doing, with, if at all possible, a recommendation that the county councils in the various counties, immediately one of these roads is put into proper repair, should take it over and try to maintain it in the same way as they maintain the ordinary county roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilhawley" hpid="Mr. Gilhawley Mr. Gilhawley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilhawley</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, wish to express my appreciation of what has been done in my constituency and what is still being done by the Special Employment Schemes Office under the direction of the Parliamentary Secretary but I regret to say, at the same time, that in my constituency, at any rate, it does not appear to be adequate.  I should like to point out that if our farmers are to compete in the Common Market with a hope of success, they should be given the best possible conditions and an adequate reward.</P>
      <P>I think the wheat subsidy recently was for a certain section of the community in this country&mdash;the larger farmers in the midlands and the south of Ireland.  What I am trying to tie in here is that in my constituency we derived very little benefit from that subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to find out by Parliamentary Question what we actually did get. I presume we contributed to the tax from which that subsidy was drawn.  In <Col N="1107" /> the case of areas, such as my own, which did not benefit from that subsidy, there should be an increase in the grants available to farmers from the Special Employment Schemes Office.</P>
    <P>I want to deal first with roads. There are 13,000 holdings in my constituency under £20 valuation, and you can therefore imagine the network of by-roads and laneways throughout my constituency.  Very few of these roads are county roads, and many of them are in a deplorable state.  The farmers' method of working has changed and heavy traffic, such as tractors, are using these bad roads. Quite a number of these roads are little more than quagmires.  Farmers should be helped as much as possible by providing them with proper means of getting in and out of their farms and houses.</P>
    <P>The second matter I wish to deal with is drainage.  I want to refer again to the amount of money being given to a section of the community in respect of wheat.  Surely every encouragement should be given to farmers all over the country and not just to a particular section?  There should be a reasonable reward for the labour involved.  We are told we will have to work harder if we are to compete successfully in the Common Market.  If we have to work harder, there should at least be an incentive in the form of proper roads and drainage.  There are practically 150,000 acres of water-logged lands in my constituency.  I do not say all these lands can be drained under Special Employment Schemes, but I do say if the Government made an allocation to be used for the drainage of these lands, it would be of very great benefit.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting last night in Rathcormac, County Sligo, where the main matter dealt with was drainage. They could not carry out the Land Project there because there was no outfall for the water off the land.  It is rather hard to see a couple of million pounds going in subsidy to a section of the community and finding ourselves with 150,000 acres of water-logged land.  I appreciate what has been <Col N="1108" /> done in respect of bog drainage and the provision of bog roads.  This makes up 75 per cent. of the work done in my constituency.  If any money could be made available from the Special Employment Schemes Office for the drainage of small rivers and the removal of obstructions, it would be well worthwhile.  It is no use asking for increased production. Production is diminishing year after year because these streams and rivers are choked.  Perhaps some method could be devised of providing money for the drainage of these smaller streams before the larger rivers are done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to piers.  I spent my holidays at Rosses Point, Sligo, where they have been looking for a pier for the past 20 years or more.  I understand some progress has been made in this regard and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear it in mind and do something about it.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to deal with was also referred to by the previous speaker&mdash;the taking over of <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads by the county council.  I am afraid the ratepayers have reached the limit so far as roads are concerned, and especially in my constituency, where there is such a large network of <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would review the matter to see if there is a possibility of giving to counties which did not benefit from the wheat subsidy extra grants from the Special Employment Schemes Office.  I can assure him the money would be very well spent indeed.  I should like to see a supplementary list from the Special Employment Schemes Office coming down to my constituency this year.  What we got was reasonably good, but we could do with much more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters I wish to deal with on this Vote.  The first is in regards to rural improvements schemes.  For a number of years, Cork County Council have endeavoured to get some co-operation between the Special Employment Schemes Office, the Department of Local Government and the local authorities on this matter. It is true, as Deputy MacCarthy said, <Col N="1109" /> that in the case of what might be called roads of convenience&mdash;a road joining two other roads together&mdash;it is practically impossible for the couple of local people living on that road to meet the sum demanded for their share of the work.  Unfortunately, we found that the county council are precluded from assisting them.  For many years, we had in Cork what we called private members' proposals. Under that procedure, we were enabled to give little grants here and there for some of these roads to help out.  If at that time we had got the co-operation we should have got, there would undoubtedly be very few of these roads left today.  They would be all done and finished with.</P>
      <P>I am very happy to see the Parliamentary Secretary in this office because I think he is a man with a mind of his own.  In those circumstances, on behalf of the Cork County Council, I invite him to come down to Cork so that we can thrash this matter out.  We invited the Office of Public Works on several occasions in the past to send someone down to a rates meeting of the county council to discuss this matter and come to some arrangement.  We always failed.  On behalf of the county council, I assure the Parliamentary Secretary now that he will be very welcome and, whatever day he fixes, I will call a special meeting of the county council to meet him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I always recommend the rural improvements schemes to any group of people who come to me about roads and I tell them that the rural improvements schemes are a certainty if everything is in order, and if everyone is satisfied.  The only fault I have to find is that there are delays of 12 months or more in getting an inspector out to examine the schemes.  That is the only complaint I have because the terms are really good and the grant is always a substantial one.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary so far as he can to see that the inspectors are got out a little more quickly.  That is the only fault I have to find and I always tell people that they will get a substantial grant and that the scheme is a certainty, if a proper approach is made.  Since I became a public representative, I have always advocated the doing of these roads under the rural improvement schemes.</P>
      <P>In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, we have quite a considerable number of accommodation roads.  Every consideration should be given to them because the people who really count in this country are the farming community and the people who live near these roads.  If they go, the towns and villages go.  I had intended to say a few words on the matter raised by Deputy Corry but I see that it does not arise on this Estimate.  A great advantage of these schemes is that they do a fine job and they give employment at a time of the year when it is much needed and very scarce.  We find no difficulty in my area in getting co-operation to carry out these schemes. We got a considerable number of minor schemes this year but there are many disappointments and I suppose we have to have them.  Let us hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will grant us a little more next year.</P>

      <P>It is very seldom that we throw bouquets at the Office of Public Works but for a considerable time past they have deserved bouquets from this House and I think we should give them what they so well merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I notice that there is a reduction in the amount given for <Col N="1114" /> urban employment schemes.  That is to be regretted.  The type of person who obtains employment from these moneys is perhaps more deserving than anyone else.  In the various towns I represent, I find that most of this money is spent at Christmas when the men make a supreme effort to work.  The relief schemes, as they are locally called, are not of a productive nature, I agree, but nevertheless they bring comfort to the homes of many people who for one reason or another are not able to obtain employment, or perhaps accept employment, at any other time of the year.  We should be very generous with that money because it goes to a very deserving section of the community, mostly people who have been in receipt of unemployment assistance during the preceding months.  Naturally, at the great season of Christmas, they make every effort to bring at least frugal comfort to their families.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I appeal strongly to the Parliamentary Secretary to increase the grants where possible, and especially in towns that have not been industrialised, the towns which are outside the underdeveloped areas. Unlike my friend on the opposite side of the House who thinks that extra money should be given to underdeveloped areas like Sligo as against being given to the wheat growers, I should like to point out that the under-developed areas get more money out of public funds than we in the south of Ireland ever got or hope to get.  This is money well spent.  It is not of a productive nature but, nevertheless, it goes to a really deserving section of the community, the poor unemployed men who have been on the unemployment assistance for a long time.</P>
    <P>I know that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Office of Public Works have no right to interfere with any of the rivers.  Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, they were so debarred.  In my constituency, we have had evidence of how dangerous it is for the Office of Public Works to interfere with any of the rivers in a catchment area.  The engineers of the Office of Public Works did a splendid <Col N="1115" /> job, a job of which they can be very proud, in draining the lands there, but nevertheless a greedy person brought them into court and got moneys to which I believe he might be legally entitled, but was not morally entitled. It was a disgraceful episode in Irish history and I hope it will be a lesson to the rest of us who have been trying to get moneys for that kind of thing, remembering that we may be breaking the law, so to speak.  We are putting into the pockets of some greedy landlords moneys to which they are not morally entitled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry advocated drainage. We must look to the dangers even if people are to benefit.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will do his best to get the necessary legislation passed to enable him to remove obstructions from rivers.</P>

      <P>I was just saying, to remove the obstructions which are causing so much damage to fertile lands.  As has been mentioned, there are the unfortunate farmers living in isolation along boreens.  There may also be on such a boreen holdings owned by people who do not reside there.  Because they do not reside there, they do not care what condition that roadway is in.  The county councils will not take over boreens or <i>culs-desac</i> that are not in a proper state of repair.  Therefore, this unfortunate person is unable to have that work done through lack of co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are isolated cases but that is all the more reason why attention should be paid to them.  In Tipperary South Riding, I am glad to say great advances have been made in taking over these <i>culs-de-sac.</i>  I take the opportunity of congratulating the county council on their courage and even though it means increased rates, it is time we brought the man who lives on the boreen out into the middle of the road, so to speak.  Improvement of roads is the only thing farmers get from the rates and no money should <Col N="1116" /> be spared in improving the boreen in these far-off places so that these people will be brought nearer to the villages and towns, to the creameries, and especially nearer to schools.</P>
    <P>These operations may not appear to be productive but they are.  It is desirable that the Board of Works should come to the rescue of these people so that these roads may be taken over and kept in a proper state of repair by the county council.  There is no way of compelling people to be generous.  In one case I know of, the local parish priest tried to get people to come to an amicable arrangement but you will always find those few people who put their hands in their pockets and leave them there.  They never think of their less fortunate neighbour at all.  Despite the fact that generous grants are available, these people, for some little reason, probably spite or something of that nature, will not co-operate.</P>
    <P>Again I ask the Parliamentary Secretary and the officials of the Board of Works to be as generous as possible, especially in regard to the smaller towns that are not fortunate enough to be industrialised, and to make sure the Christmas of the unemployed will be as merry as it can be under existing circumstances.</P>

      <P>I understand this Vote we are discussing is of a very limited nature and I can assure you, Sir, and the House that my contribution also will be of a very limited nature.  I should like to join with my colleague, Deputy Davern, in appealing to the Parliamentary Secretary to be as generous as possible in the alleviation of the unemployment problem in the towns to which Deputy Davern referred and in those which I represent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true to say that where unemployment strikes most and where unemployment schemes are needed most is in those urban areas where there is no outlet at all or where there is no chance of employment and where people are living on unemployment assistance.  I am quite sure the Parliamentary Secretary, who is a Limerick city man himself, must appreciate this problem as Deputy <Col N="1117" /> Davern and I do and I have no doubt that my appeal to him this evening will not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The problem I rise to speak about more than anything else is with reference to rural improvements schemes. Different speakers here this evening have mentioned the contributions that should be made and all the difficulties of getting the people who live on these <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads and boreens to make any contribution at all.  I have been long studying this problem and studying it, I hope, with a sense of knowing the country mentality, and here is what I find.  In a country townland, there is a <i>cul-de-sac</i> road leading to four or five houses.  Of those four or five houses, four of the occupants might be farmers and one a cottier. You present them with the rural improvements scheme application form and all the details that go with it. You go to the trouble of helping them to fill that form as any good Deputy will, of asking the few people concerned to put their valuations on it and their signatures.  The representative of these four or five people signs that form and it is duly passed on to the Special Employment Schemes Office in Earlsfort Terrace.</P>
    <P>These people are hoping for results. The inspector comes and here may I say I agree with my colleague Deputy McLaughlin from Sligo-Leitrim that the delay after the inspector comes is uncalled for?  In passing, I appeal to the Minister to speed up that part of the programme.  When the inspector calls, he sees the road, prepares his estimate and talks with the agent who signs the form.  He goes back to Dublin and some weeks later&mdash;months later, in some cases&mdash;the people are told the scheme will cost something in the region of £500.  The local people are asked to contribute one-fourth of that.  That is all right as far as it goes.  Four of the five people are ready and willing to contribute their part but, if the fifth decides that it is of no use to him or if he does not like his neighbour, he will not contribute one penny.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that we should take our courage in our hands in this House to-night <Col N="1118" /> and instead of asking for a contribution from the local people, the State should take on the entire responsibility and then insist on the local authority maintaining the roads thereafter. Having regard to the cost of administration, the visits by inspectors and all the unnecessary expense, the 10 per cent. contribution from the local people should be taken over by the State.  That would go a long way to solve a big problem.  In many cases, the people concerned cannot take modern machinery into their farms.  The problem is much broader than would appear.  Seventy-five per cent. of the local people may be willing to pay their part of the local contribution but because 25 per cent. decide not to contribute, the 75 per cent. are unjustly treated.  I appeal to-night to the Parliamentary Secretary to review this matter.  The problem can be solved by a decision that the Department should take over these roads and put them into a condition that will make it possible for farmers to take their machinery into their farms and that the local authority will take them over and maintain them thereafter.</P>
    <P>I do not know what view the Parliamentary Secretary or the House may take of that suggestion.  I have given a great deal of study to this problem. I am in touch with farmers and people who have to live on these <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads.  I do not see any solution to the problem even in my lifetime and that of the Parliamentary Secretary, if a lead is not given and a start made now.</P>
    <P>What is involved is not so much the personal relationships between Johnny Murphy and Mick Smith, as the wealth and prosperity of the country. Farmers must be provided with the means of taking their machinery to their farms and bringing their produce from the farms.  It is a national question, a much broader question than would appear to be the case when applications under the Rural Improvements Scheme are being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I intervened in the debate simply to make that point and I make it very sincerely.  The matter should be reviewed from that angle.  The cost involved will not be very great having <Col N="1119" /> regard to the saving in administration but whatever extra money is involved I suggest that it would be of national benefit that these roads should be taken over by the State and improved for the sake of the people living on them and that the local authorities should take them over and maintain them thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some very interesting matters arising from the Estimate.  I should like to see a much larger vote to meet the needs of the people in the backward areas.  In my constituency, there are many small holders whose valuations are from £3 to £5 who manage to keep going during the summer months by virtue of a creamery cheque.  If a much larger amount of money could be channelled into those backward areas that would provide employment for these people for three or four months of the winter it would keep them from having to go to Britain, as they do during the beet season.  Many of them are taking their wives and families and leaving us for good.  If it were possible to channel even a further £1 million into this scheme, no better use could be made of money until some form of permanent work can be provided in these congested areas.</P>
      <P>A startling feature of the figures given here, and a very significant one, having regard to our proposed entry into the Common Market, is that while there is a reduction of £19,000 as compared with the year 1957, there is an increase in the provision for the salaries and travelling expenses of £15,000.  In other words, it is costing £15,000 more to administer a reduced figure. Some Deputies commented on the difficulty of getting inspectors at times.  Surely we could expect that whatever was done in 1956/57 should be quite as easily done in 1962.  It would appear that the amount of work is reduced because there is a higher proportion paid on wages and the productivity is much less than in 1957.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that it is always the workmen who have to suffer.  The same thing takes place in the county councils.  It is the workmen who have to go and the administrative staff is retained.  It is important that we should get the maximum amount of work.  This is a sum of money voted to give the maximum amount of relief and, certainly, at least the same volume of work should be provided as was provided in 1957. I make that point because it is a serious matter from the point of view that farmers and business people are being asked to gear themselves for the Common Market.  I do not think it is out of line to ask State Departments to keep the belt as tight as they can and to keep costs within line.</P>
      <P>I shall refer again to the small holders, particularly to those who earn about £4 a week for eight months of the year, people who are not on the employment exchanges in the ordinary way but who could do with a bit of money during the winter months.  In future Budgets substantial provision should be made for the purpose of keeping these people in the backward areas fully employed.</P>
      <P>I have noted the tendency to channel the maximum amount of grants into the rural areas.  That is a very good thing.  Further provision would be very useful.</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that link accommodation roads should be brought within the schemes.  They cannot be covered by &ldquo;rural improvement schemes&rdquo; because the general public are using them and it is beyond the capacity of the people living along such a road to subscribe the sum necessary to maintain it. Special grants should be provided for that type of work, link accommodation roads possibly connecting two county roads.  They serve a very useful purpose in my constituency.  They would cost perhaps £1,200 or £1,500 and would mean a demand for some £200 among five or six or eight people.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep an eye on these in the future and make the necessary provision for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By and large, this is a good scheme, <Col N="1121" /> doing very useful work, in our country, anyway.  There are not sufficient schemes to meet the demand of those who want work.  Many people need work for three or four months.  In future, any Government money that is available should be channelled to the maximum extent into that type of work, providing employment for very small holders, those of £3 or £4 valuation who are not even on &ldquo;the dole&rdquo; but who, if there was sufficient work in the area, would get it and who badly need it.</P>
    <P>By doing that, we would succeed in keeping them from the emigrant ship which many of them take temporarily and we lose them permanently.  It happens in many cases.  In our lifetime, I hope to see those people with plenty of work.  Conditions are changing and things are shaping that way but very many of them cannot wait for the chance of getting work in five years' time.  This seems the only way in which they can be helped.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the amount of work he has accomplished in the past year.  On hearing his speech, I was amazed to discover the wide field which he has to cover and the amount that has been done.  What we are mostly concerned with in County Kildare are bog drains and bog roads and then the rural improvements schemes.  I should like to see a little more money given, particularly for drains, as the work done last September or October, according to quite a number of men I spoke to and who worked on them in my area, had to be rushed in order to finish it.  It meant, in a number of cases, having to skim over the last 10 or 20 perches when a small extra amount devoted to these drains would have meant that the high standard on which they started and continued practically to the end, could have continued completely to the end.  Those drains have always been a great relief to people in bogs and the scheme has served a great need.  It is hard to get everybody to co-operate to clean those drains and the Parliamentary Secretary has stepped in to do a good job <Col N="1122" /> there, saving quite an amount of trouble.</P>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider very carefully one aspect of bog roads.  I should like to see a good deal more money spent on them because the work that is done is not up to the required standard and with modern transport, is not able to stand up to heavy traffic.  It was all right in the days of the cart but now with tractors and trailers we need a better standard.  I should like him to consider these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In my constituency, we have the very same problem with <i>cul-de-sac</i> and accommodation roads. Unlike Deputy Tully in Meath, we in Leitrim could not afford to tackle the problem as they have tackled it in Meath because a penny in the £ gives us less than £600 income.  I think I heard my colleague, Deputy Donegan of Louth, say that they estimated it would cost 216 pence in the £ to bring their accommodation or <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads into a state of reasonable repair so that they could be taken over by the county council.  If it would cost that in Louth, it would cost at least four times that in Leitrim.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies here criticised the condition in which <i>cul-de-sac</i> roads were left after minor employment or rural improvements schemes.  I could not agree with that.  In my constituency, they are left in the condition we would expect.  They are usually soled with heavy stones covered over by sand.  Only in the past few years the county council have taken over a number of these roads and maintained them.  It was a pity they did not do that some years ago.  Even in my own time, I have seen one or two, perhaps three or four, grants spent on one road.  I hope from now on the county council will take over these roads and maintain them.</P>
      <P>There is one paragraph in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement about which I am concerned.  I do not know if it could be amended but I certainly would like to comment on it.  It is this:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should emphasise that rural improvement schemes are not employment schemes and, in fact, <Col N="1123" /> payment of a contribution by the applicant does not constitute a claim for employment on the work either as a ganger or otherwise.  First preference in employment is given to UA recipients; the second to persons in receipt of unemployment benefit and it is only when the claims of those two types of person have been met that the contributor or members of his family can be considered for employment on rural improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>I honestly think that, particularly in my constituency, that attitude is wrong. The people who contribute there are usually small farmers.  They may not be registered as unemployed people but it is unfair not to give them equality, with the others if not preference over them for employment.  I have experience of a case where two people put up the amount of money required which, I think, was about £50, each contributing £25.  The man on the holding was not registered for unemployment. His son was too young to register and it meant that neither of them could get employment on the scheme.  I honestly think that is an unfair position for them to find themselves in.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to mention, that is, the question of rural improvement schemes and minor employment schemes.  It seems that a grant is not available unless the road accommodates more than two families. I have had a rather peculiar experience, which I am sure has arisen elsewhere, of a person who applied for a grant in respect of a road which accommodated only the occupants of the household, himself, his wife and six children who were all going to school.  One hundred yards down the road the occupants of two houses who used an accommodation road also applied for a grant.  In these two houses, there were only three people, one person in one house and two in the other.  It is unfortunate that the man with six children could not qualify for a grant while the three people could qualify. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary in his generosity would consider such cases as they present themselves to him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> I agree with the speaker who said that the signing of the consent form should be done away with.  Perhaps Bill had a quarrel with Jack's father 40 years ago and it was carried on and now Bill will not sign the form in order to prevent Jack from getting a road to his house.  That is happening very often on both rural and minor relief schemes.  As a new Deputy, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the manner in which he has presented his Estimate. I found it very simple to follow and I think he has earned the thanks of myself and the other Deputies.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I should thank the various Deputies on all sides for the manner in which they have received this Estimate.  It could, as Deputy Donegan remarked, in certain instances become contentious and certainly if one or two of the remarks did appear to be of that nature in my Estimate speech, I can assure him that that was not the intention.  If he looks back at the introductory speeches on the Special Employment Schemes Office by my predecessors on both sides of the House, he will understand just what exactly I mean.</P>

      <P>Various speakers, including the last speaker, stressed the point about consent being necessary, that of five or six beneficiaries in a roadway which we in the normal course of events would contribute to, subject to a contribution by the beneficiaries, one, for some peculiar reason down the years, would not sign the consent form.  I should bring it out in the open that we do not need the consent of all the parties.  It is just as well that that should be known.  We have come across these cases of what we in the south call &ldquo;thorny wires&rdquo; who have been most unjust and unfair and adopt a dog in the manger attitude.  We examine the case and try to come to an amicable settlement among all the neighbours concerned <Col N="1125" /> and if we fail, we agree that one person cannot hold up the others to ransom.  The position that arises where a scheme should have been done 10 or 20 years ago is that the road is getting worse all because of one individual.  We intend to do away with that and if necessary to proceed without the consent which has been unreasonably withheld.</P>
      <P>However, it will be appreciated that that is all right specifically on the road surface but it will not enable us to trespass.  The man who holds out, among three families, may be in between the other two who are at the end of the roadway.  We are not allowed to trespass.  If we did, he could take certain action against us. We realise the extent of our rights and I should like the House to know and appreciate what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall try to reply to the various matters raised by Deputies but I cannot possibly conclude tonight in the short time at my disposal.  Deputy R. Barry made the rather novel suggestion that the local contribution should be done away with <i>in toto</i> and that the rural improvement schemes should be carried out at one hundred per cent. cost by the Special Improvements Schemes Office, on the condition that the local authorities thereafter maintain such work.  I have the greatest respect for any suggestion made by the Deputy, and naturally any suggestion by any Deputy tonight will get the most careful consideration by my <Col N="1126" /> Office and myself.  Down the years as a Deputy, I have found that constructive criticism, in the main, is welcomed by a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary and very often they do receive a flash of genius or constructive criticism of the highest order which is successful in improving the position.  I do not think it is feasible that we should do away with the entire principle.</P>
    <P>You will see the cost from the schedule attached to the back of my introductory speech, with the sliding scale of some 7 or 10 per cent. and pro rata to 50 per cent. contribution for £100 valuation, and it would be quite fantastic were we indiscriminately to pay the entire cost, irrespective of a man's valuation.  It would be inequitable.  Someone would have to pay for this and ultimately it would be the taxpayer or the ratepayer who would be paying in respect of the poor man exactly the same amount as he would be paying for a farmer with 200 or 300 acres.  I do not think anyone on any side of the House would subscribe to that theory.  It is possible that Deputy Barry has not that in mind.  I think I see what he has in mind.</P>
