    <Title>Intoxicating Liquor Bill, 1962&mdash;Report Stage (Resumed) and Final Stage.</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>In page 13, line 54, after &ldquo;Act of 1960&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;pursuant to an application notice of which was given, pursuant to the rules of Court, to the appropriate county registrar or the appropriate district court clerk&rdquo;. &mdash;(Deputy M.J. O'Higgins.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard this amendment as a technical one and I hope the Minister will accept it.  The provisions of Section 17 provide that in the case of applications affected by that section after the passing of the Bill or the commencement of its operation as an Act, new applications cannot be granted.  There is a saving provision in connection with what I might call full applications for new licences which are dealt with under subsection (4)  (a).  It is quite clear in the case of full applications for a new licence that if the notice of application was given before the commencement of the Act, those applications may still be granted by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next thing dealt with in the section is the case of declarations regarding the fitness of premises to be licensed when certain works of alteration are carried out or possibly in the case of a virgin site where the premises are actually erected.  They are <Col N="2744" /> dealt with under Section 15 of the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of subsection (4) of the present Section 17 in the Bill provides that in those cases also the licences may be granted provided the declaration has actually been made by the court before the commencement of the Act.  There are cases where the necessary preliminaries would have been taken, notice is given to the Garda, county registrar and district court clerk and where expenses will have been incurred by way of architect's fees for doing the necessary planning, where the newspaper notices have been inserted but where the application has not actually come before the court. In those cases, I am suggesting to the Minister that he should provide for the case of pending applications even though the declaration has not actually been made.  I have got the Minister's suggestion in connection with this matter and perhaps I could study it for a moment.  I think the Minister's suggested amendment meets fully the point I am making and I would accept that.  I think it is identical with the idea I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28A:</P>
      <P>In page 13, line 55, after &ldquo;Act&rdquo;, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or that notice of an application for such a declaration was given, pursuant to rules of court, to the appropriate County Registrar or to the appropriate District Court Clerk before the commencement of this Act, and that such declaration was granted (whether before or after such commencement).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is to meet the idea put forward by Deputy O'Higgins.  I would like further to amend the amendment as circulated by substituting the word &ldquo;made&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;granted&rdquo; in the second last line.</P>
      <P>Amendment, as altered, agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2745" /> In page 13, between lines 55 and 56, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a person is convicted (whether before or after the passing of this Act) in relation to any premises in respect of which he holds a licence for the sale of intoxicating liquor by retail and which is situate in the Court area of Swinford of more than one offence (being offences each of which was committed during the period from the 19th day of May, 1961, to the 23rd day of May, 1961) and more than one of the convictions would, but for this section, fall to be recorded under Section 25 of the Act of 1927 on the licence, not more than one of the convictions shall be so recorded.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It will be remembered that on Committee Stage I was pressed by a number of Deputies to do something for the Swinford publicans.  I have decided to accede to those requests to some extent and the purpose of the amendment is to give what I may prescribe as a partial amnesty to the publicans in Swinford who committed a number of offences against the licensing laws on the occasion of the fleadh ceoil in Swinford last year. There was a substantial request from all parts of the House to the effect that these publicans should not, by reason of what occurred on that occasion, lose their licences.</P>
    <P>This is a very unusual type of provision and I want to make my own position with regard to it clear.  The suggestion was made on the Committee Stage that we should not discuss the matter because it was, to some extent, <i>sub judice.</i> I am prepared to grant that there is some validity in that point but as long as we do not suggest that any publican was or was not guilty of any offence we are entitled to take note of the fact that there are on record convictions against various publicans and that other charges are pending.  I think we should refrain from making any comment about the degree of blame which should attach to these offences.  I do not want to say any more than that except that the full picture was not given <Col N="2746" /> here by a number of Deputies on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, having said all that I think there is some basis for the arguments which were put to me and in all the circumstances I feel that the compromise I am proposing goes as far as I can go.  It is clear from the wording of the amendment what the intention is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has met the suggestion that was made to him in this connection quite fairly in this amendment.  I appreciate what he says regarding matters which are <i>sub judice</i> but I think the House must never abrogate its right to discuss whatever it thinks proper.  I agree that it is not proper to discuss matters which are <i>sub judice</i> if there is any danger of prejudicing any person.  The Minister has met the request in a fair way in providing that no more than one conviction arising out of this particular occasion and special circumstances can be recorded.</P>
      <P>The danger which faced the publicans in this area was that their licences might have been lost arising out of very exceptional circumstances, and it would not have been necessary to introduce this amendment or to make special and peculiar provisions of this sort if the Minister had decided to adopt the suggestion made from these benches to allow the court to have discretion with regard to the recording of convictions.  The Minister argued in relation to an amendment yesterday evening that it was only in relation to the immediately after closing hours offences that the question of discretion in connection with the recording of convictions might be important.  The fact that this amendment is now being introduced shows in a very effective way that there are, and that there may be from time to time, particular and special circumstances in which it would be a very valuable matter that discretion with regard to endorsements might be vested in the courts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 55 and 56, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 23 (2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960, shall be amended by the deletion of the word `two' and the substitution of the word `three'.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to recommit for this amendment.  Deputy Sweetman had a word with the Minister in regard to that. This amendment deals with the question of lapsed licences which are dealt with under Section 23, subsection (2) of the 1960 Act.  Under that subsection the period for renewals expired, I think, on the 4th of the present month. Deputy Sweetman's suggestion in amendment No. 30 is that that period should be extended for a further year, until July of next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment in Deputy O'Donnell's name and my name is to achieve a similar result with the slight difference that in the case of our amendment we suggest it remain in force for a period of six months.  It is a well-known maxim <i>ignorantia legis non excusat.</i> That, in the main, applies to criminal matters.  Undoubtedly, in this case quite a number of people were ignorant of their rights and failed to avail of them.  It may be because of the circumstances in which the last Intoxicating Liquor Bill was passed. During the course of its passage it was stated it would be allowed to operate for a trial period and that amending legislation might be considered after that trial period had expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This may be the last occasion for some time before we have another Intoxicating Liquor Bill and, consequently, it seems reasonable, in view of the provision made in the 1960 Act and, indeed, in certain respects, made <Col N="2748" /> in this Bill, for cases to be considered where an application has been made to the court or a declaration secured. The dormant licence provision deals with somewhat similar cases.</P>
    <P>A few people, most of them, I think, in comparatively remote areas, have what might be regarded as a valuable interest or at least an interest of some value&mdash;it may not be very considerable&mdash;if they are in a position to revive the licence by making an application to the court.  Many of those people, through domestic or other circumstances, found their licences had lapsed and are anxious now to revive them.  I would suggest that the Minister might amend the 1960 Act as set out in either of these amendments.  The attendant publicity would direct the attention of any person who is interested and who feels that he or she has been prejudiced by being unaware of the position up to this.  They should be given an extended period under which they could make an application to revive the licence which was either their property or the property of their family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 30, the Minister may take it that, if he is prepared to give the six months, the year would not be sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot give way on this.  I know that some people feel aggrieved by what has happened but I think that will always be the case.  Were we to give six months or a year, there would still be hard cases who would say that they were not aware of the provision and would ask to have the period extended for six months.  We must get finality. As Deputies know, hard cases make bad law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to all this is that there are too many licences in the country.  Some day we may have to face up to that problem but that is the background to the situation.  We should set our faces very sternly against new licences coming into being in any way except where they are strictly necessary for the public convenience. There is no question in the majority of these cases or in any of these cases <Col N="2749" /> of there being a necessity for a renewal of these licences.</P>
    <P>There is no licence at all in existence at the moment.  All that is involved is a right to apply for a licence.  We are not taking anything away from anybody which he already has.  I think the Oireachtas dealt very fairly with this situation by giving two years' notice of this provision.  Anybody who slept on his rights for that two years cannot expect he should get favourable treatment now.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this matter. In the vast majority of these cases the licences which have lapsed are renewed entirely for the purposes of sale.  In the past two years I would say that by far the majority of the licences which were revived were revived for sale.  On that basis, there is no real investigation of the suitability of the premises or anything of that nature. Indeed, I think if most of these applicants were submitted to the test of suitability of premises, the courts would not renew the licences at all.</P>
    <P>All that apart, the real principle at stake here is whether or not we wish to have more licences created or brought into being where they are not really necessary.  I am informed that there are probably well over 1,000 of these lapsed licences throughout the country.  We could not possibly contemplate having all of those 1,000 licences suddenly revived and brought back into operation.  It would be entirely against the principle which we have adhered to of restricting the issue of new licences.  It would have a very serious effect on business equities throughout the country, particularly in country towns.  As well as that, the 1960 Act gave them sufficient notice to revive their licences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will realise that the risk of having the 1,000 lapsed licences renewed if an extension for six months were given is so remote that it need not be regarded at all if they were not revived in the past two years.  The Minister will realise that there are hard cases. Probably he is right in saying there always will be when you set a deadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2750" /> There was one case brought to my attention&mdash;I shall not mention the name&mdash;where a person wanted to apply and would have been in time under the existing legislation to apply but for the fact that the appropriate circuit court would not be sitting until after 4th July.  Consequently, even though this person was aware of the position and wanted to take advantage of it, just by reason of the sittings of the court she was not able to.  Her position now is that, unless an extension is granted, she cannot make the application at all.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister will be going far wrong if he gives some very small concession.  I would even settle for four months, something shorter than Deputy Cosgrave is looking for. Anyone who is interested has been brought up against the position in a very effective way by the fact that the deadline has been reached already under the 1960 Act.  Their interest has been awakened and is alive now.  If a further extension were given, the Minister would be unlikely to be asked to cater for hard cases after that.  I do not think any would exist.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware it is possible at present to convert a six-day or other type of restricted licence to a full seven-day licence by paying £200 to the Revenue Commissioners.  I am making this proposal because it is possible that the changes which the Bill would make in the hours of trading on Sundays may give additional advantage to seven-day licences and that some of the six-day licences, who up to now have been unwilling to pay this £200, may feel that under the new conditions it would be worth their while to do so. I want to emphasise that the difference between the proposal in amendment No. 32 and that in amendments Nos. 30 and 31 is this: This is where a licence is already in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes a six-day licence into a seven-day without any extinguishment.  The other at least revives a licence in existence.  This is obviously a more valuable concession because in most cases six-day licences were far less valuable than seven-day licences.  In fact, quite a number of premises availed of the 1960 Act to convert six-day licences into seven-day licences.  The only difference, as Deputy O'Higgins has said, is that on this occasion the Revenue Commissioners also have a chance of getting a whack out of it.  The applicant, once he pays the £200 or whatever the fee is, is entitled to get a seven-day licence for a six-day.  Certainly, if the Minister argues there are too many licences, this in fact is increasing the breadth of the licence rather than the actual number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley) Gerald Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Bartley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall try not to delay the House unduly in speaking about the provisions <Col N="2755" /> of this Bill, which will, I am sure, be welcomed by Deputies inasmuch as it provides for a number of benefits.  For the convenience of the House I shall take the sections in order.</P>
    <P>A person with pre-true military service who had a wound or disability pension in respect of such service was, as a result of provisions embodied in the Acts of 1953 and 1960, also made eligible for a further or married pension, provided that his marriage took place before the 5th August, 1953. Ordinarily, a person's marriage must have taken place before he received the wound or, in the case of disease, before his service terminated, but the extension to 1953 was specially granted in relation to persons with pre-truce service. They should have applied within twelve months after the passing of the enabling legislation, but, as usual, a few failed to do so, and a further period of twelve months is now proposed in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 makes provision for the reconsideration of cases, rejected under the Act of 1932 but coming within the provisions of the Act of 1937, in which application was not renewed within the time specified in that Act as extended by the Act of 1941.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested from time to time that persons awarded gratuities under the Connaught Rangers (Pensions) Acts should, like those awarded pensions or allowances under these Acts, be eligible to apply for special allowances.  This is not unreasonable, and the appropriate provision is now being made in Section 4.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to cases under Section 4 of the Act of 1953, frequently referred to as &ldquo;Part II cases&rdquo;.  That part of the Act of 1953, as amended by Section 8 of the Act of 1959, provided for enhanced allowances in the cases of relatives of deceased persons who had pre-truce service and who were killed in service during the 1916-1923 period or died within four years as a result of wound or disability attributable to service during that period.  Only one such allowance could, however, be paid at any one <Col N="2756" /> time; it could be paid to the widow, or to one parent, or to one unmarried or widowed sister, or to one permanently-invalided brother or to one son or one unmarried or widowed daughter permanently invalided since childhood.  It is now proposed to remove that restriction, and this is being done by Section 5, taken in conjunction with Section 10.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Act of 1941 provided that where an applicant under the Army Pensions Acts failed or refused to attend before the Army Pensions Board for medical examination after having been given ample opportunity to do so, the Minister could refuse the application, which would not then be capable of being renewed. It is now proposed, by Section 6, to enable such past cases to be reconsidered where the persons concerned so request and the Minister is satisfied that reconsideration would be justified.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a section which, I think, will give particular pleasure. The cases to which it relates are, firstly, those in which a person suffering from disease attributable to service, but with a degree of disability below the 80 per cent. necessary for an &ldquo;attributability&rdquo; pension, opts for a final fixed rate pension, and, secondly, those where the disability is not attributable to service but was aggravated, accelerated or excited by service.  Neither the final fixed rate pensions nor those in respect of aggravation, etc., at present carry eligibility for married pensions, and the widows and children of such persons are not eligible for allowances where death is due to the pensionable disability. There were valid reasons for this, especially in the case of the final fixed rate pensions, which were intended at the time of their introduction, to be in the nature of allowances for the purchase of medicines, etc.  However, it has now been decided to pay married pensions, and widows' and children's allowances, on conditions similar to those which apply in the case of &ldquo;attributability&rdquo; pensions and at rates similar to those appropriate to &ldquo;attributability&rdquo; pensions of like amount.  Section 7 and the Schedules contain the necessary provisions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2757" /> Section 8 merely effects amendments of a textual nature, and there is nothing in the remaining sections calling for special comment.  I commend the Bill, therefore, to the House.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might mention at this point that, on page 4 of the Bill, at line 13, there is a typographical error; &ldquo;the 15th day of August, 1953&rdquo; should read &ldquo;the 5th day of August, 1953.&rdquo;  Might I ask the House to agree to the necessary change being made without a formal amendment?</P>
    <P>Agreed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>For the benefits which are conferred I suppose we must be grateful but I would be untruthful if I did not say that the Bill is a very grave disappointment to every one of us.  The Minister, having the opportunity of amending the Acts and bringing in a Bill to do so should, in my opinion, have eliminated most of the complaints and disabilities under which many people suffered because they were not covered by any of the sections of the previous Acts.</P>
      <P>Again I want to complain that this is another Bill in which we are legislating by reference to previous Acts. There are no less than six Acts referred to in this Bill and for the ordinary person to get a fair idea of what is contained in it he has to wade through all the various Acts and see where they have been amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we are grateful for the benefits that are conferred.  The Bill does take away one of the chief causes of my complaint, that is, that a person who was entitled to a disability allowance but who did not apply at the appropriate time was disqualified. This Bill removes that disqualification and the Minister can now re-examine the cases.  I am not sure whether there is an obligation on the applicant to re-apply or whether the Department or the Minister will re-examine the cases from the existing files.  It would appear application must be made again in every case.  The Minister does not say he will automatically re-examine the cases and that he will notify the person: &ldquo;Under your application of such a date you were disqualified from receiving a pension.  I am glad to <Col N="2758" /> inform you that the case is now covered.&rdquo;  I should like the Minister to give us some indication on that.</P>
    <P>I still think the Minister should take out the qualifying date.  As I have said time after time, if a person was ever entitled to a disability pension and if he is entitled to it now, there is no reason why he should not be able to apply at any stage.  The only disability he would suffer would be that he would be paid a pension only from the date of his application.  It would not be retrospective although there is something to be said for it and you could argue that it should be made retrospective.  I shall not push that point but if a person suffered a disability at any time and, for whatever reason, did not apply, any time he did apply, provided he could establish the necessary facts, he should be entitled to the pension from the date of his application.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that in the history of this country there were many people who did not recognise the institutions of this State and there are still friends of ours and of mine from the old days who still do not recognise them.  We all hope wisdom will come to them at some stage.  We all hope that they will realise and recognise the democratic institutions of State set up in this country.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has taken this opportunity of extending the allowance to one or more dependants of those who died whether pre-Truce or post-Truce.  It is something the Minister should do.  I only regret he has not taken out the other little bit, that is reference to the Minister for Finance before payment.  If the Minister for Defence is satisfied that dependency has been established and that a person should be paid, he should not have to send it to the Minister for Finance for his concurrence.</P>
    <P>As in the case of a disability pension, or anything like that, the Minister reaches his final conclusion on the board's report and the Minister for Finance is not brought into it at all as a sanctioning authority.  But, in these Part II cases of allowances to dependants, having found the facts, the Minister makes a report and then the <Col N="2759" /> Minister for Finance has to concur&mdash; and the Minister for Finance can put it aside until the cows come home. That was a bad provision.  The Minister has the opportunity of deleting it now and of assuming the full responsibility himself of deciding on the merits of the case.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has extended the time for application for wound or disability pensions due to service or aggravated by service.  It brings in some very deserving cases that were disqualified or were not qualified to benefit because of the provisions of the Act.  I still am not happy that cases such as that of Commandant Collins' widow and Newell of Galway are provided for in this Bill. Let the House know exactly what the cases are.  Here is a person who served in the Volunteers, who served in the National Army, who had at least 20 bullet wounds in him.  He then gets a disability pension and his wife is provided for with a disability pension.  He suffers a mental disorder.  He is made a ward of court and is put into a mental home.  While there he is treated but he suddenly collapses and he is brought to hospital from the mental home and he dies there without regaining consciousness.  The death certificate says he died from diabetes.  Because the death certificate did not show that he died from the disability, because the certificate does not show he died as a result of an illness aggravated by bullet wounds, the board finds that that person is not covered.</P>
    <P>The same can be said in regard to Newell of Galway.  There are several cases.  The widows are left without any pension whatever except the social welfare pension.  They are entitled to that.  They have not to thank the Department of Defence for that.  I am not satisfied that these cases are covered at all.  Although it is quite clear, in this instance, that it was unconsciousness, everybody who was associated with that case believes that it was as a result of a blood clot that he lost consciousness.  The death certificate was given in that way.</P>
    <P>There are other cases and, again, it <Col N="2760" /> is very difficult to know whether or not they are covered.  The Minister has not given us any indication of the type of case he proposes to cover.  He should do so when he is concluding the debate.  As I say, I am glad and grateful for the benefits which are being conferred but they do not go far enough.  The Minister has a great opportunity now.  I appeal to him to go to the full limit.  Like everything else, the roll call is becoming smaller every day.  In a very short time there will not be any necessity for this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that when the Minister had the opportunity of doing something he did not do it.  I am disappointed that, again, it is legislation by reference and that it is not clear what the full benefits are.  I want to urge the Minister to deal with the files in his office so that the people will not have to make application again.  However, I presume that, if they have to, they will do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose we must all be grateful for any improvement made by a Minister in the conditions of people affected by this Bill, no matter how small the improvement may be. Deputy MacEoin referred to the fact that there are so many references to previous Acts that it is difficult to understand what exactly is meant.  To somebody like myself, it is almost impossible.  Now that there seems to be a spate of legislation to tidy up Acts, is there any hope the Minister might tidy up these Acts and, in doing so, try to cover the people who are at present being treated shamefully by the State because of the fact that they are excluded by a section of one Act or are not included in a section of an amending Act?  Something should be done about that.  I would ask the Minister to consider it more seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy MacEoin said, the number is decreasing.  Year after year, people are dying off.  In another decade, the problem will be a very small one.  But, during the ten years to come, it is too bad that so many people will be put in the same position as many people who have written to me.  All we have to do is to look <Col N="2761" /> at the top of the letter to find that the address is the local county home.  That in itself is enough to condemn whatever authority is responsible for looking after those old people.</P>
    <P>It is just too bad that people who have given the best years of their lives to fighting for the establishment of the State should be forced into the position that they have to go into the county home at the end of their days. That is bad enough but it is even worse when you find that their complaints are invariably either that they are getting a very small amount from the State or that they made application for various types of allowances and have not got a decision over the years.  The Department, apparently, depend on writing to people, asking them to verify.  Sometimes the letter is addressed to a person who may be dead.  I have numerous instances of letters written to people who were dead, letters written twice, three times or four times, asking about an application.  The applications were not, therefore, verified and, because they were not verified, no award was made. The same can happen under this Bill. While the person is living, there is some hope that eventually the information required will be supplied.  When it is a question of dealing with the dependants of persons who served, it will be almost impossible to get the evidence required to enable the Department to say whether or not any of these persons is eligible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but he seems to be dealing with special allowance cases and they do not come under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with all cases.  I will deal with one case of a man who was receiving an allowance for himself and his wife.  He has two children and because the two children were born more than nine months after he left the service he does not receive any allowance for them.  There are hundreds of those cases.  Perhaps the Minister would see if something could be done to change that.  It does not matter when the children were born; the dependants of this old soldier are entitled to be looked after by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One other matter with which I <Col N="2762" /> should like to deal is the question of representations.  In County Meath there is a man who was a very responsible person during the fight for freedom.  When the Civil War took place he went out of the picture completely and refused to take part on either side. He stood by that principle for years. He is chairman of the Meath Brigade Executive, Old IRA Federation.  He was accepted in the Minister's Department as a person who could be trusted to give honest advice and on all his visits to the Department he was treated with courtesy and his advice was accepted.  Since the Minister took control not only has his Department refused his co-operation but he has been ordered out of the Department. He has been told in no uncertain terms to get out and not to come back. That is a shameful way to treat somebody who is anxious to assist the State.  He is Councillor James Finn, Athboy, County Meath, who was very well known in the fight for freedom. He has no interest in politics and in all cases he has given a completely independent view.  I would ask the Minister to look into the matter and see that it does not happen on his next visit to Coláiste Caoimhin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because in it the Minister is making an attempt to make amends.  However, he is making amends only to a certain degree.  The Bill allows persons who did not apply on previous occasions to apply now.  It also provides for allowance of married pensions for those who have pensions under the 1937 Act, an Act which allows for aggravation.  Previously only those who could attribute their injuries to service were granted pensions.  Now those who are suffering due to aggravation will get pensions.  I accept that that is going some of the way but I want to dwell on a point raised by Deputy MacEoin, that is the question of the Bill not being retrospective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 probably applies only to one or two people and refers to people who did apply under the 1932 Act. Those people are not people who just did not bother to apply.  They applied 22 to 25 years ago but they applied <Col N="2763" /> under the 1932 Act.  They claimed that their disabilities were attributable to service but the Board disallowed their claims.  Although it was later indicated such cases could be met by the 1937 Act the applicants in question never accepted that direction.  They persisted that they should have been covered by the 1932 Act.  They said their injuries were attributable to service and not to aggravation.  Aggravation means that a person had something wrong with him and that by reason of service it was aggravated.  The 1932 Act refers to injuries which were received as a result of service.  The applicants referred to deny that they had any latent disease or disability at the time and that theirs were cases attributable to service.</P>
    <P>They have proof that would stand up in any court.  I believe the chairman of the board at the time, a judge, decided in favour of the applicants and held that their case would be accepted in any court but the medical opinion was against the chairman of the board.  Nevertheless there is evidence that the chairman was of the opinion that their cases were attributable to service.  Here is a borderline case where persons have been suffering for 40 years and it could be proved beyond doubt.  However, whether their disability is attributable to service or aggravation it makes no difference. The applicants maintain that their injuries were attributable to service.  It was only when they knew that they were up against it that they reluctantly agreed to apply under the 1937 Act. This Bill states that if you can show you had injuries and you can prove they were aggravated due to service you will get a pension from now on. In other words, the applicant will only get something which a man who is now in the Army and suddenly becomes paralysed or develops some disease as a result of service, will get.  He would get the same pension under this Bill as the applicants who have been suffering for 40 years.  Where is the justice in that?</P>
    <P>There is a continuity in this Bill because Section 3 says that if a person applied under the 1932 Act and was <Col N="2764" /> refused a pension that person would be recognised for the purposes of the 1937 Act.  That means that if a person had applied, his claim is there.  There are two or three such people.  It would be totally unjust to say to the person who has suffered for 40 years &ldquo;You will get nothing for all that time but henceforth you will get something&rdquo;. That can happen to the man who was suffering only from last week.  I am objecting to that section and I hope it will be made retrospective in those cases where an actual claim was made under the 1932 Act.</P>
    <P>I was asked to raise one or two other matters, and I do not know if I am in order in raising them on this Bill.  One person told me that although he has a disability pension, he cannot get any free treatment or any free appliances, that he must pay for them. I do not know whether that is true, but if it is true, the Minister should do something about it.  The fact that a man has about £3 a week does not enable him to buy appliances and get treatment if he needs it.</P>
    <P>Some Old IRA men are in St. Brendan's and others are in St. Kevin's.  Many Old IRA men have died in those places.  That is most unfair.  I have said before that the time has come when a special ward should be provided for those people, and even for mentally affected people. They should be treated as the British treated them and not left stranded, isolated and ignored.  There should be special wards where Old IRA men could get treatment.  That is the last thing they are asking for in their last years.  I have always held the view that the old IRA men got a raw deal and I shall hold that view to the day I die.</P>
    <P>There are men who served in the Tan war who did not get any pension unless they were in an ambush, and even men who fought during the Civil War in armed combat, and also went to jail, did not get a penny.  Their service was not recognised for pension purposes.  It was the same in the Tan war and men who served in those wars, and went to jail, did not get a penny because their service was not recognised.  I believe they should get <Col N="2765" /> some care and free medical treatment in their old age.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on this Bill and on the improvements he has provided for all concerned.  Like Deputy MacEoin, there are one or two points on which I am not clear.  I have in mind the widow of an Army officer who was a volunteer from 1930 to 1960.  He served in the National Army.  His health broke down, and I have no doubt in my mind that his service was the cause of his death, but the certificate does not say so.  His widow finds herself with a very small pension. I do not know if the Minister will be able to bring her in under this Bill, and others like her, but if he can, I shall be very grateful to him.</P>
      <P>The principal reason I rose was to compliment the Minister on being able to introduce this Bill and on being able to get the money from the Minister for Finance.  When Deputy MacEoin was expressing his disappointment, I could not help thinking that in 1954 I brought a motion before the House for an extension of the period in respect of medals.  At that time unless the medal had been awarded at a very early date, a person did not qualify for a special allowance.  That motion was carried&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters to which I want to refer in connection with this Bill.  One is the re-opening of cases where a person was refused a pension because it was held by the board that the disability was not attributable to service.  As I understand <Col N="2766" /> it, under Section 7 of this amending legislation, it will be possible to have those cases reconsidered.</P>
      <P>All of us are familiar with cases, particularly during the emergency, where either officers or men found that in many cases after leaving the Army they contracted, I suppose in most cases TB, and in some few cases, some other disability, and when they made application and had their case considered by the board, they were refused on the ground that the disability was not considered to be attributable to service.  It is impossible to convince people who suffered a disability subsequently that it was not attributable to or aggravated by service.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, Section 7 proposes that it will be possible in the future to have these cases reconsidered and I hope reconsidered in a sympathetic way.  Undoubtedly, some of the applicants may have suffered from wettings in the course of their employment, just as they suffered from wettings during their service in the Army. In those cases, it is obviously extremely difficult to decide whether the wettings in the course of duty while in the Army, or in the course of employment, or perhaps not even at work, were the cause of the subsequent disability.</P>
      <P>There are certain cases where people were in indoor occupations and in the course of their work, suffered no such exposure to rain or cold, or were only exposed to rain or cold either while on manoeuvres or during the course of ordinary service.  I believe this amendment is long overdue, and that it will be welcomed by a number of people who feel they have a very strong sense of grievance about the way in which they were treated after their unselfish service, given when requested, and on the understanding that they would not in any way be allowed to suffer as a result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how many cases there are now, but there must still be quite a few outstanding cases of persons who applied for disability pensions and who were refused because of the fact that the disability was not attributable to their service in the <Col N="2767" /> Army.  I hope the proposed amendment is sufficiently wide to cover all those cases and that there will be no doubt about any of them in the future.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I believe that adequate publicity, if necessary, by way of advertisements in the newspapers, should be undertaken by the Minister and the Department in order to ensure that if people have to apply again, they will be fully informed. Very often, the proposals in legislation passed here are not apparent to some people, and indeed one of the difficulties with legislation of this sort is that in many cases amendments are made by reference to sections of earlier Acts, and quite a few people may well be unaware of their rights in the matter.  Adequate and clear publicity should be given to the scope of the amending legislation.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I shall refer.  It is the question of a small group of retired Army officers who had 1916-1921 service and who were granted the original extension of one year in 1949 provided they had the service medal.  They were subsequently granted a further two years in 1954.  I mention that because, as the Minister is aware, in 1957 his predecessor changed the regulations and as a result a number of these officers had to retire at an earlier date than was originally anticipated.  One of the problems in that connection was that, while the Minister did give at the time the same salary and emoluments for the two years which were taken from them, it had the drawback and disability that what at the time seemed a reasonable enough proposal was altered by subsequent events.  This was the first occasion that persons holding service medals had any advantages withdrawn from them.  Nevertheless, the proposals to give them full pay and allowances for the full two years instead of the normal pension rate seemed reasonable until increases in salaries and wages were granted.</P>
    <P>The position now is that quite a few of these officers find that although they reached the same rank on retirement as some of their comrades who <Col N="2768" /> have since retired their pension is substantially lower because of the increases in salary that have been granted. There have been three increases including the eighth round.  Although a man was in the same rank and had the same service in some cases, he now has a lower pension.  Some of those who subsequently attained the rank were more fortunate because they got some part of the allowances but, in certain cases, officers who retired before any increase in salary was given, although they had given the same service as those who served after them and were also holders of service medals, because of increases in salaries, allowances and emoluments, the results of these rounds of wage increases culminating in the eighth round, suffered a disadvantage.  A man who retired, say, last November and held the same rank as his predecessor who retired a year or 18 months earlier, finds he has a pension of anything from £50 to, in some cases, £100 more.  In one or two cases the disparity is even greater.</P>
    <P>Surely that was never intended.  It was a consequence of the decision taken by the Minister's predecessor but I do not believe it was intended.  It has certainly caused a great deal of ill-feeling and is, in my view, an injustice. It is inequitable to have withdrawn a benefit which would have entitled these people to their full rights under the Army Pensions Act.  I should be glad if the Minister would consider that.</P>
    <P>Subject to those comments, like other Deputies, I welcome the improvements that are being made.  In the cases I have mentioned certain changes could be made which would entitle the officers with Old IRA service to the full benefits to which their colleagues, who in some cases served for comparatively short periods after them, have become entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this measure introduced by the Minister to give further relief to retired Army personnel and members of the Old IRA.  As one born in the early 1920s I have enjoyed fully the freedom we now have in this country but it is difficult for me or the younger generation to understand the struggle that was <Col N="2769" /> required to win this freedom.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to reward in any way he can members of the Old IRA.  We should try to give the few remaining everything the nation can afford to provide.  They are fully entitled to it.</P>
      <P>I come across many cases in my constituency of Old IRA members who did not get any pension until, I think, the 1934 Act.  I wonder if the Minister could make up the difference or compensate for it in some way in the future.  I congratulate the Minister on what he has done and urge him to do everything possible in the future for the benefit of members of the Old IRA who are still living.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the spirit of helpfulness displayed in the remarks made on this Bill.  It is essentially a Committee Stage Bill and no doubt the points already made will be repeated section by section in Committee.</P>
      <P>There are some misconceptions in regard to the Bill.  I should stress that there are two main features in it.  One is the provision of married pensions for those in receipt of final flat rate pensions and what are known as aggravation pensions.  The other is the removal of the restriction on the payment of allowances to more than one dependant of a person with pre-truce service who lost his life during the 1916-1923 period or died within four years of disability incurred during that period.  These two extensions of the existing benefits will cover a number of cases in which Deputies on all sides of the House are interested.</P>
      <P>I do not claim that every possible grievance has been remedied in this measure.  I sympathise with Deputies who have commented on the difficulty there is in understanding the Bill because of the number of references in it to previous legislation.  The reason why there has not been consolidation in one measure is the frequency with which amendments of this code have taken place.  If we get a reasonable respite from such amendments it may be possible to consider bringing them all inside one cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Deputy General MacEoin, there is no general re-opening of the <Col N="2770" /> cases of those who did not already apply within the appropriate time.  The only cases to be re-opened are those covered by Section 3 of the Bill.  It is a confined class but, nevertheless, I think that Section 3 meets the cases known to us.  There may be others not known to us.  I do not think the Deputy is serious when he makes a plea for allowing people to apply for disability pensions at any time.  After the lapse of so many years, it would be almost impossible to get the necessary medical and other evidence to relate the disability back to service.  In the past, as all the Deputies interested are aware, many opportunities were given for late applications.</P>
    <P>With regard to eliminating the Minister for Finance from decisions, I should like to tell Deputy MacEoin that in the 1953 cases, the Minister himself decides whether the applicant was a dependant of the deceased.  It is only where the relative was not a dependant but should, in all the circumstances be treated as a dependant, that the Minister for Finance has to be consulted.  I do not think that any great cause for complaint has arisen because of that requirement.  The Deputy mentioned specific cases by name.  Here again we are up against the medical opinion on which decisions are based.  If the doctors statutorily responsible for making these decisions say that a man who had a disability pension and who lived a long time did not die from the disability, it is not possible for the Minister, even if he were himself a doctor, to gainsay that opinion.  The Minister has no function in that respect.</P>
    <P>By moving the qualifying date, I take it the Deputy means the date from which the payments are made, and he also asked for retrospective payment. As far as I know, that has so far not been done and I think it would be difficult to make a reasonable and acceptable case for retrospection, much as I would like to do so myself in certain cases of which I know and to which Deputy Sherwin referred.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to a certain tightening up of the code.  I should like it if that could be achieved for the benefit of us all.  I have been trying. <Col N="2771" /> to master the various Acts and I can assure the House that it is not easily done.  If it is possible to do anything with regard to the consolidation of this code of legislation, I can assure them the matter will have my attention as well as my sympathy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully also referred to a certain verification officer by name and said that this officer who had a good pre-Truce record and who had taken no part in the Civil War was valued very highly in the Department of Defence, but he made the statement that, since I took office, this man has been turned out of the Department. There is no truth in that.  If Deputy Tully was aware of that and did not tell me, the blame is on Deputy Tully. Anyway, it is not true.</P>
    <P>I want to tell Deputy Sherwin that I have the greatest possible sympathy with him in the cases he has mentioned. Again, what I have already said about medical opinion comes in here.  If the doctors say that certain cases are aggravation cases rather than attributability cases, there is no power given to the Minister for Defence to gainsay them.  There are cases in which I would love to have the power to do it but I simply have not got it.  That is the only answer I can give to Deputy Sherwin.  I have gone as far as I can go to ease the sense of grievance that the persons concerned experience.  With regard to disability pensioners having to pay for appliances, may I suggest to Deputy Sherwin, if he knows who these men are, to get them to write to the Department and we will see what we can do.  I understand that we do help out in those cases and I should be very anxious to attend to the cases of which Deputy Sherwin seems to know.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Gilbride would write to me about the widow of the deceased National Army man who has a grievance in the matter of pension.  If he does so, I will give it my best attention.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Cosgrave has not taken quite the precise meaning which it has out of Section 7.  Section 7 does not provide for the reopening of applications where disability was found not <Col N="2772" /> to be attributable to service.  In fact, the Bill does not provide for any general reopening of rejected applications.  What Section 7 does is to provide for married pensions in certain cases not already covered.  I indicated what they are in my opening statement.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Cosgrave's stressing of the need for publicity for the new benefits, the Department will, both by advertisement in the newspapers and by the insertion of a leaflet in the communications that go out to pensioners, ensure that the changes now being brought about will be brought to the notice of those concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to a matter which cannot be dealt with under this Bill at all, because this Bill is concerned only with questions of dependency and disablement.  The Deputy has been referring to married officers who had an extension of service withdrawn in 1957.  That matter does not come within this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that I have to tell Deputy Gallagher that retrospection in respect of the 1934 Act is not possible.  That is the simple answer to it, but that does not represent any lack of sympathy on my part with his viewpoint.  This principle of retrospection has not been applied in relation to any of these Pension Acts.  I do not know whether there is anything else I have to say on this second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Stage of this Bill I raised certain questions of a general character which have special reference to the Money Resolution. This is a Money Resolution designed to provide the requisite guarantee to enable Córas Iompair Éireann to enter into a contract with General Motors to purchase diesel engines.  The Minister recommends it to us on the grounds that Córas Iompair Éireann have been able to make an advantageous bargain with General Motors after what the Minister describes to us as an adequate competitive tender with a variety of other companies.  The additional advantage accrues that General Motors Corporation are prepared to give the Board of CIE extended credit at a moderate rate of interest.  We are anxious to facilitate CIE to avail of this extended credit on advantageous terms.  That seems to be a very sensible proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I want to recall an interesting fact, because I am always zealous to educate Fianna Fáil.  I remember during the inter-Party Government administration, when Deputy Norton was Minister for Industry and Commerce, a contract was negotiated, and one of the arrangements was that extended credit would be made available by a foreign firm for a very large capital sum.  In that year we were appropriating £10,000,000 under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts for housing.  We had other very large capital liabilities for housing the people under the housing drive then going on.  We were very glad of the opportunity of getting extended credit for a large capital sum, thus releasing capital resources here for work urgently necessary.  I can remember the Fianna Fáil Party rising up in these benches and saying that no more awful confession had ever been made on behalf of an Irish Government than that we should accept commercial <Col N="2776" /> credit at the hands of a foreign firm. Do you remember it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly correct.  One was a case where the Government had not got the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In that year we were providing £10,000,000 under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts.  Here is the proposal the Minister puts before us now.  Instead of giving the money from the Exchequer to CIE and letting them pay for the engines&mdash;there is no reason why we could not advance the money to CIE from the Central Fund and let them pay for these engines&mdash;we are saying to the company: &ldquo;You may inform General Motors that if they give you extended credit on advantageous terms, we, the Government of Ireland, guarantee the payments.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is a very sensible thing to do. It is just as simple to do it now as it was to do it five or six years ago and release capital here for other necessary capital investment in this country.  If we had to provide 6,000,000 dollars for the purchase of these engines from the capital available for domestic development, that would have meant a reduction of approximately £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 in the available capital for investment in necessary and desirable capital development at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to impress on them (1)  it is a good thing they are learning sense, and (2)  I hope Dáil Éireann will approach these matters in the same <Col N="2777" /> way as we tried to approach them, that is, to recognise that the national credit is the concern of all of us and that to say, for cheap Party advantage, that the Government of Ireland have no money does an injury to Ireland.  It is a shameful and despicable activity on the part of any political Party that they, for the purpose of trying to deceive simple people at home, should denigrate their own country before the world and say &ldquo;Our Government have no money&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise perfectly clearly that there is no difficulty at all.  If we wanted to buy these diesel vehicles and pay for them, the Government of this country could write a cheque for them in the morning.  But they elected, on the merits of the bargain negotiated by the Board of CIE with General Motors, to say: &ldquo;Instead of writing a cheque for it, we approve the bargain you have made and, in order to facilitate the completion of it, we authorise you to say to General Motors that the Government of Ireland guarantee these payments.&rdquo;  General Motors then say: &ldquo;We are prepared to make these advantageous terms available because the Government of Ireland give that guarantee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That guarantee is not given on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government. It is given by the authority of us all here in Dáil Éireann on behalf of this country.  We are pledging Ireland's credit for this transaction.  That is a sensible and prudent thing to do, and we are prepared to endorse it.  I hope, if a similar situation should arise after this Government have left office and we are responsible, that the Fianna Fáil Party will make a corresponding approach to matters of this kind and join in with us in any similar case in saying: &ldquo;That is a sensible arrangement.  It is right and proper that our Government should act rationally in these matters and, where it is more advantageous to finance transactions of this kind by this method, we are glad to see them to do it, and we are not going to get up and shout from the hustings `The Government of Ireland have no money.&rdquo;'</P>
    <P>The Government of Ireland have all the money necessary to carry out whatever <Col N="2778" /> duties devolve upon them in the wise administration of their affairs.  If every other country in Europe were in a position to say as much, they would have more to boast of than they claim at present.  Let us try to say that always from both sides of the House. It will be good for the country, good for all of us and it will be a useful demonstration to our neighbours of what responsible, democratic Government means.  That is one of the matters I wanted to refer to.  I have been waiting for the chance, because I think it is good for you to get your noses rubbed into that kind of folly of your past.

      <P>There is another matter I raised on the Second Stage. The Minister made some reference to it, but I should like to raise it again. I understand from the Minister that this money we are guaranteeing will operate to complete substantially the dieselisation of CIE.  We think that is a wise policy.  We think that on balance, the dieselisation of the rail transport of the country is wise.  But I want to direct the attention of the House again to a matter that, sooner or later, we will have to consider. When we passed the first Transport Act in this country, nationalising the transport services and giving that body a complete monopoly, that step was justified on the ground that we wanted to give the country a transport service which accepted the technical liability of common carrier.  That is to say they bound themselves to accept any traffic tendered and to deliver it to the destination indicated by the consignor; secondly, on the ground that we wanted to maintain in the country a traffic authority which expressly undertook not to provide differential freight rates; that is to say that, if they quoted a special freight rate to any individual in the community, they <Col N="2779" /> thereupon undertook to make that special freight rate available to everybody; thirdly, on the ground that we wanted to maintain in the country a transport undertaking which would maintain rail transport in all essential areas of a character acceptable to the people in those areas.  In consideration of their undertaking to do these three things they were to have a complete monopoly of all traffic.</P>
      <P>That situation continued to obtain up to the time of the 1958 Transport Act.  Under that Act we relieved Córas Iompair Éireann of the obligation of common carrier.  We relieved Córas Iompair Éireann of the obligation to refrain from quoting differential rates and now they can quote a special rate to any individual in the country, and they are doing it under the package deal on a pretty large scale.  Thirdly, when we come to the question of maintaining rail services in all parts of the country, we understood the present Taoiseach, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, to say that that obligation remained in so far as Córas Iompair Éireann would not close down a railway line without full prior consultation with the local interests involved.</P>
      <P>Between 1958 and the very recent public statement by the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, that undertaking was completely ignored and a great many railway lines were closed down without any prior consultation with local interests.  Now the Chairman of the Company has announced that, under the general authority conferred upon the company by the 1958 Act, he will close down virtually all the branch lines in the country, though he has added that that will not be done until everybody involved has been given ample opportunity of coming to discuss it with him and his Board, which is, I concede at once, an implementation of the original undertaking given by the present Taoiseach, which had not been implemented heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to pose this question.  In the new situation, what is the case for continuing the monopoly of transport? I am moved to ask that question by <Col N="2780" /> this fact: there are individual <i>entrepreneur</i> outside carriers who have got limited, or general, licences to engage in the transport business.  I know of one case where a man was operating three lorries.  I think he had a general transport licence for the three lorries. Recently he retired from business.  I understand that he was able to sell his plate, covering three lorries, for £12,000.  That meant that there was some hardheaded business man who had seen his books and was satisfied that the opportunity to operate three lorries in general transport was worth a capital sum of £12,000.  I think all of us know individual plates with restricted areas of licence changing hands for sums of up to £1,000.  There is nothing wrong in that, but it is evidence of the profitability of the transport business to those who have access to it.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the House has not the time come, now that we have completed by this guarantee the modernisation and equipment of Córas Iompair Éireann, now that we have acknowledged the right not to be a common carrier, now that we have acknowledged the right to suspend the prohibition on differential rates, now that we have acknowledged the right to close down branch lines, for a cessation of the monopoly of transport?  What case can anybody make, once they have been fully modernised and equipped, and put on an absolutely equal footing with any private <i>entrepreneur,</i> for saying that there should not be free competition?  Why should there not be free competition? Why should not anybody be allowed to engage in transport subject to the general regulations governing safety, fares, labour conditions and so forth? That is a matter we ought to consider.</P>
    <P>The Money Resolution to this Bill provides the money for, as I understand it, the completion of the modernisation of the major transport undertaking in the country, and this is the stage at which we should ask ourselves this question afresh and take a completely new look at the situation because, and this is a thing people are liable to forget, everything everybody uses in this country is at some stage of its existence moved <Col N="2781" /> from one part of the country to another and thereby makes it contribution to paying the transport charges. What it is vitally important to remember is that virtually every export we have, including our entire livestock exports, carries some element of cost deriving from the transport it has undergone at some stage of its sale and export.  If, by restoring free competition under the new dispensation, a material reduction in these costs can be made, how can we refrain from giving the most careful consideration to such a reform if we are serious about preparing ourselves for the new atmosphere of the Common Market into which we are moving?</P>
    <P>I hear the Taoiseach, I hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I hear them with approval, saying to the manufacturers and business men in this country: &ldquo;We are moving into a new climate.  You ought to get business consultants in and review your whole set-up to see how it will measure up to the impact of the Common Market.&rdquo;  I am putting this to the Minister for Transport and Power.  He is responsible for a very material element in the whole costs structure of all our exports.  Is it not time that he asked himself as Minister for Transport and Power the same question the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce are urging the businessmen all over the country to ask themselves?  Have the members of Dáil Éireann not an obligation to ask themselves: can there be any reform of administration or organisation which would give us better transport at lower costs than the set-up that at present exists.  Unless we do that I do not see how we can with clear conscience expect, as we do expect, and rightly expect, businessmen to make that examination of conscience in respect of their own individual businesses.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister for Transport and Power to give us his view of these important matters and to tell us how is it that it is necessary for every individual businessman in the country to streamline and revise the whole methods of procedure to meet the threats of the Common Market if we are content to drift along with what I <Col N="2782" /> suggest is a wholly out-dated transport concept in the light of the 1958 Act and in the light of the guarantee under this Bill which, according to the Minister's statement, completes the modernisation of CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had already dealt with this matter on the Second Stage of the Bill.  The position in regard to CIE is that it is in no sense any longer, if it ever was at any time in the past 15 or 20 years, a complete monopoly.  There are competing with it some 70,000 private lorries and contractors, 960 licensed hauliers and 190,000 private motor cars; and in so far as passenger transport is concerned, if the number of private vehicles increases at the present rate there will be about one for every 10 people in the course of the next eight or 10 years.</P>
      <P>A further answer to Deputy Dillon is that CIE provides a service throughout the country either on the roads or on the rail of a kind which ensures regularity, ensures that a very wide variety of people can be certain of sending their goods on a particular route on a certain date.  In making the effort that is now being made to pay its way, CIE must take account of the fact that within certain limits a great many of its services are uneconomic. In other words, if the CIE monopoly were eliminated by an Act of the Oireachtas it is, to my mind, inconceivable from studying the reports of CIE that buses would be run in a great many areas with the regularity with which they do run, and that lorries would travel on regular routes serving particular areas and would be known to cover those routes at specified times and on specified occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CIE activities include a number of operations which will almost in perpetuity be losing operations and others that are profitable.  Therefore, even though CIE has the privilege of making package deals and has proved that in respect of road transport it can, in connection with many individual operations, be more economic than private haulage concerns, it has, as I have said, to carry out public transport policy which involves a combination of losses and profits.  Even in Dublin city, <Col N="2783" /> for example, a great many of the bus services make no money, in fact actually lose money.  The same applies to road passenger services.  I am sure Deputies do not need statistics in regard to this matter.  All of them must see going around the country CIE lorries which on many occasions appear to have only a few parcels in them; on other occasions those lorries may be full but the fact remains that for the small farmer, the small householder and the small industrialist, such service is regarded as essential both in this and every other country.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dillon speaks about the sale value of carrier licences, he is speaking about licences in respect of transport services where the owners do not have to provide regularity of service.  They choose their route and the goods they carry and the operation is almost known in advance to be profitable to them.  I should say also that the fringe benefits of the pensions scheme to the workers in CIE add an inevitable cost to the whole operation which is not met in most cases, so far as I know, by licensed carriers, and in respect of some of them at least, I very much doubt whether they keep the rules in regard to conditions of employment that are kept by CIE. The House must be aware that the main thing is that these licensed carriers use their transport in their own way whereas CIE maintains a great panoply of public transport services and in the case of all the railway lines that are closed and a substitute of bus services provided it is not in any sense monopolistic because it is up against private competition but it does continue to run them regularly throughout the country.  I think that applies to a great many transport systems throughout Europe where countries are also concerned about the cost of exports and therefore with transport costs.  Whatever changes are made in legislation for private or public transport it is essential to have a public transport company that has the privileges that are left to it under present legislation.</P>
    <P>I should say in reply to Deputy Dillon that CIE is making a tremendous <Col N="2784" /> effort to reduce its transport costs by more modern methods and although successive wage increases which apply to the rest of the community have added to their costs they are doing their utmost to prepare for the Common Market by a vast scheme of reorganisation which is taking place by making use of containers wherever possible, by using work study methods on the input and output of goods from stations and depots, and by ensuring the greatest productivity possible.</P>
    <P>It would take me much too long to give a detailed account to the House of the work of reorganisation.  A great deal of it is highly complex and extremely tedious to relate but it is going on.  When I last inspected some of the new depots I was told that the increase in productivity on the whole operation had been anything from 25 to 30 per cent.  In so far as package deals are concerned CIE are able to compete more effectively.  If the general progress of CIE is examined since 1958 it will be seen there is far more productivity and that CIE for the sake of its own survival as well as for the sake of its adhering to the terms of the 1958 Act, is doing all it can to provide an economic transport service at the lowest possible cost to the community.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in reply to a question this week, gave me particulars of the rate collectors paid <Col N="2785" /> by way of salary as against those paid by way of commission.  I am not bothering at the moment about urban areas. I am thinking purely in terms of county councils.  I notice that in certain areas the councils concerned appear to have gone over virtually entirely to salary.  Cork and Dublin appear to have entirely gone over.  I should be interested to know if the Minister has received any report from those local authorities as to the efficiency of the change.  Can he tell me also how the councils concerned dealt with the established officers who had rights as rate collectors?  Had they to retire them and pay them heavy compensation to buy them out or how did they effect this change?</P>
      <P>From time to time in Kildare we considered whether or not a change would be desirable.  Whenever we did give any consideration to that problem we always came up against the situation straight away that there were many established rate collectors there whose terms of appointment were on a commission basis and we could not see, in consequence, how we could make the shift-over on a wide front, if we wanted to.  Discussing this matter with some county councillors, we came to the conclusion that we were virtually tied to the situation until a vacancy arose for a rate collector. A mixum gatherum sort of system did not appear to us to be entirely satisfactory.  I am particularly anxious, therefore, to know how Dublin and Cork county councils have got over that problem and how they were able, in one fell swoop, apparently, to change from rate collectors who had been remunerated on a commission basis and to put everybody on a salary alone basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is generally as the Deputy has outlined in regard to the change over.  By and large, throughout the country, where these new salaried posts are being created, they are generally being created only as and when districts become vacant.  There is not the problem therefore that has been suggested.  I understand that it may have <Col N="2786" /> been done in certain cases, by agreement with existing poundage rate collectors, if we might call them so. They opted to go over to a salary scale.  But, in general, salaried posts are arising only where the districts become vacant.</P>
      <P>In so far as Cork is concerned, I think they do their collection from the office and by established officers of their council staff.  I would not say that that goes for the entire number at the moment but, in the main, I think that is the position.

      <P>Yes, and, if fully calculated, you could say that the time of remaining fulltime people would have been taken up in the collection in any one year.

      <P>Yes.  It seems rather a strange comparison that you have 30 in Cork and only one designated in Kerry but it lies in the designation by the council rather than 30 in Cork and only one for Kerry.  As to how this system of salary payments is going&mdash;the overall numbers and indeed the time over which collections have been done by the salaried collectors&mdash; it is scarcely fair at this juncture to give any judgment on the method or the efficiency of the service as given by salaried officers but so far as my Department are aware there is not any cause for complaint in regard to the manner in which the job is being carried out.</P>
      <P>Again, in the years ahead, as the numbers increase and as time goes on, it may well be that they will be shown to be more efficient or less efficient. At the moment, it seems that the collection being done by salaried officers is nothing to be complained about, let us put it that way, and seems to be fairly satisfactory as far as we are aware.</P>

Banks recently have brought in new forms of credit acceptance, a new form of accepting payments for customers' accounts at different offices. I am merely trying to see whether there has been any examination from the Departmental point of view as to whether, with these new banking facilities, there might not be, based on office collection, a cheaper form of collection than that obtaining at the moment.</P>

      <P>I can assure the House that very full consideration is being given to the overall systems of collection.  On the specific question regarding the Kerry collection, the rates are sought by post.  The demand notes are posted to the ratepayers and the rates are then paid in any one of a number of forms&mdash;it could be by postal order, money order, cheque or by cash&mdash;at the council offices.

I might also say that in the change-over as between district and district, not to mention county and county, the pattern of collection and the efficiency of the collection as indicated by the percentage collected, which I suppose is really the true basis on which to decide whether it is efficient or not, seems to be much the same as before.

      <P>Can the Minister tell me why it is necessary to have such completely different drafting between this section and Section 10 (2) (b) of the Housing Bill or is Section 10 (2) (b) intended to do something different.  Section 10 (2) (b) says most specifically:</P>
      <P>Repayment of a loan under this section in respect of a cottage that has been purchased under the Labourers Acts may be secured at any time in the manner specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister, when replying on Second Stage, said that he was visualising a case in which it might be necessary to have a charge.  A local authority might say to the tenant of a vested cottage: &ldquo;We want you to get a surety before we will give you this extra £50.&rdquo;  I want him to have the option.  If he wants to, he can get a surety but I want him to have the option of saying: &ldquo;I will give you the charge instead of going to look for surety.&rdquo;  I cannot see how under this section he has that option having regard to the phraseology.  Perhaps two different people drafted the Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first real difference between the cases that are envisaged under the Housing Bill and under this Bill is that advances in the case of the Housing Bill are likely&mdash;almost sure&mdash;to be relatively substantial amounts, whereas in this Bill the amounts will be relatively small and, in fact, could be quite small.  Also, advances in this case could actually be purely temporary, for a very short period, possibly even while awaiting the payment of grants to a group.  It would only be a matter of getting an advance to cover the amount allocated by way of grants, pending the receipt of the grants themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2796" /> In so far as the request for security may arise, the local authority may provide any procedure.  The idea would be that because of the relatively low amounts likely to be involved that procedure should be the least onerous and cumbersome possible, consistent with reasonable security and care by the local authority.  In that regard, for instance, the deposit of the land certificate could be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The simplest method of all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have one point clarified.  Nothing is mentioned in the Schedule in connection with the repeal of Section 21 of the 1936 Act which prevented loans being made because vesting was considered as a mortgage.  If Section 21 is allowed to stand, how does it affect the position?  The same question arises in regard to the Housing Bill. I should like to know how we stand on Section 5, if a tenant applies for a loan and if he is prepared to give his vested title.  If, in the meantime, Section 21 of the 1936 Act was not repealed, is the vested title of any use to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice on this point is that it is similar to that raised already in another way by Deputy Sweetman.  My advice and assurance is <Col N="2797" /> that the deposit of a land certificate does not constitute a charge on the actual property such as would properly be debarred under the section the Deputy mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the vested tenant secure the land certificate to produce it to the local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand these tenants would, or should, have available to them their land certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly the matter may be remedied locally but I have had cases in one particular county where there is an extraordinary problem in that such land certificates are not in existence.  It is not the fault of the Department but, originally, when a cottage was vested, it seems that by law the local authority should provide the tenant of such vested cottage with the map of his property and that in the event of the death of the tenant and the transfer of the cottage to a son, daughter, widow or husband, such map is stamped by the Land Registry.  We have the position now in which such maps do not exist in thousands of cases.  The Minister may say it is not his responsibility but will it hold up these tenants for an unduly long period to secure that certificate so that they will be able to get a loan? The Minister or his officials may not be able to answer at present but could the matter be considered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the type of case he has cited is probably somewhat exceptional and is the result of circumstances over which the Department has not, and could not be expected to have, any control.  It was due to a lack on somebody's part in the past that this situation may arise in quite a number of cases&mdash;I do not know how many.  That lack could be on the part of many people, not just one.  In circumstances such as these, if and when they arise, even though the land certificate would not, as a result, be available to be used as has been suggested, there would still be available the resort of getting security from a <Col N="2798" /> neighbour, relative or friend, as the case might be.</P>
      <P>Where groups are concerned, the security might be obtained within the group.  In any group of five, six, ten or 12 there is sure to be one or two who without the assistance of the signatures of any other members would be good for the amount involved and which was required for a short term.  On that basis, the individual might not be called upon to procure or produce on his own behalf either the land certificate or, if it was not available, a security to guarantee him personally for whatever part of the loan for which he would be responsible.  I do not think it is the type of case for which we can legislate specifically.  Such exeptions do arise, but if it does arise in this case, the door does not necessarily close as a result because there is an alternative way of getting a loan by security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make the position clear.  I am not blaming any particular individual.  I am not blaming the officials of local authorities or anybody else but I should like the Minister to look at it from this angle. Actually, it is not an isolated case. There may be thousands of such cases in other counties and I wonder if the Minister could consider it in this way rather than have the vested tenant looking for somebody else to go surety. When he has the property and if the Minister is satisfied that the cottage has been vested in him or properly transferred from the original tenant to him, while the local authority is preparing the necessary material for presentation to the Land Registry would the Department be prepared not to delay the application in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These tenants are not in possession of maps.  It may be a case of a transfer from a tenant to a son or daughter or a widow or a husband and these people may wish to avoid spending money on legal costs.  We do not wish to direct tenants of vested cottages in one direction.  If what they require can be obtained more cheaply through the Land Registry, would the Department co-operate by not delaying the application <Col N="2799" /> while the map is being prepared and submitted to the Land Registry?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Department is concerned there would be no objection to accepting the situation such as suggested by Deputy Desmond, if it should arise.  In the first instance, it is a matter for the local authority and if the local authority is satisfied then it is all right as far as we are concerned.</P>

      <P>I am a little perturbed by the explanation the Minister gave a moment ago.  The Labourers Act of 1936 declares that a mortgage cannot be made by a vested purchaser of a cottage other than by way of purchase price paid by means of the annuity.  The fact that there is an annuity does not affect the right of a vested purchaser to create a second mortgage.  There is the expressed and explicit proviso in the Act to that effect.  The Act provides that the premises shall not be put forward as security for a mortgage.  I think it is Section 21 that makes that provision. The Minister said a moment ago that such a restriction does not operate to prevent an equitable deposit of the land certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate matters dealt with in Section 21 of the 1936 Act.  Subsection (2) states that any mortgage or charge on a cottage made in contravention of the section shall be null and void and subsection (1) provides that a cottage which has been purchased under this Act shall not, during the payment period in relation to such cottage, be mortgaged or charged.  The deposit of the land certificate is an equitable mortgage.  Subsection (1) says that the cottage may not be mortgaged but the deposit of the land certificate is an equitable mortgage.  I think the Housing Bill, which we shall discuss later on, is right because it has a proviso to offset subsection (1) of Section 1 and I think the Sanitary <Col N="2800" /> Services Bill is wrong because it has not got that in.</P>
      <P>It is a very simple matter for the ordinary person to get out the land certificate.  All a person has to do is to go to the Land Registry, or send to the Land Registry, giving the folio number and pay £1 to the Minister for Finance and the certificate comes along.  When the tenant of a vested cottage gets that land certificate into his hands, it is no use to him for anything as long as the provisions of Section 21 subsection (1) exist.  According to subsection (2), he cannot make a written charge.  He can deposit the land certificate but the efficacy of that procedure is ruled out by subsection (1) of Section 21 unless the Minister puts into this section a similar provision to that contained in subsection (10) of the Housing Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that when I was talking about this procedure it was in answer to a point raised by Deputy Desmond.  A much less formal procedure is envisaged in relation to this section.  The point put forward by the Deputy is not in accord with the advice I have received on the matter. My advice is that the deposit of the land certificate, while it may be an effective charge, is not precluded by the terms of the 1936 Act.  That is the advice that I have been given although it would be strange if somebody did not disagree with advice given by anybody on such a matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one procedure.  It is my belief, intention and hope that the securing of loans such as we expect under this section will be even less formal than the deposit of the land certificate.  It could well be said that the grants as allocated by the Department could be regarded as quite adequate for the small amounts that are liable to arise under this section. Furthermore, another way in which I feel that this procedure will more easily work out is that there will not be a formal passing of cash.  A man may have a guarantee of a grant from a local authority but it has been a common practice in many parts of the country over the years that the builder's supplier advances the material up to approximately the amount of the <Col N="2801" /> grant and there is an assignment of the grant in favour of the builder's supplier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>A formal assignment?  It is usually paid to the grantee in care of the supplier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing is that the builder, by direction, is assured of getting his hands on the grant.  It is not as formal an assignment as the Deputy has pointed out.  I expect that for the relatively small amounts that will arise under the procedure of this scheme for these jobs, the type of procedure with the builder's supplier standing in and supplying the material on the strength of the grants allocated, is likely to operate to a greater degree in regard to sewerage and water than it has done in regard to housing.  In regard to housing, the amount of material and the cost of the house is very much greater and not every builder's supplier can afford it.  That, again, is one of the many ways in which the intention of facilitating those who wish to provide these facilities for themselves or groups could be brought about and it probably will be operated in order to help further the installation of these services throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am still surprised by the advice tendered to the Minister. I agree with him that it should not be necessary to go into all these formalities at all but the advice which the Minister has expressed opens a very, very wide door in relation to the whole question of labourers' cottages which was not visualised at all.</P>
      <P>The whole intention of the 1936 Act was that a vested purchaser of a cottage could not pledge his cottage as long as the annuity remained.  If the Minister is right in the advice he has just given, then the person can take his land certificate either to the local authority for an advance under this Bill or to the bank and deposit it in exactly the same way as the Minister suggests the local authority can accept it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also means that there is a possibility of a purchaser of a vested cottage being enabled to purchase that <Col N="2802" /> cottage, if you like, by his employer. His employer can say: &ldquo;I will give you the money to buy it if you give me the land certificate on an equitable deposit,&rdquo; which means going back again to the tied house system I thought we had got away from.  I cannot see that there is the slightest difference between the equitable deposit to the local authority and an equitable deposit in favour of a bank or anyone else.  The vista opened up by the advice the Minister says he has received is that it will virtually negative the fixity of tenure of the vested cottage holder which was deliberately enshrined in Section 21 of the Act of 1936.</P>
    <P>If that is the position, I think the Minister would be very wise, indeed, to re-examine it certainly between now and Report Stage.  I do not expect him to be in a position to argue legal points but, perhaps, he might get his legal advisers to brief him so that he could explain to the House the difference between this Bill and the Housing Bill because, as I say, Section 10 of the Housing Bill deliberately visualises the existence of the interpretation that has been put on Section 21 of the 1936 Bill ever since it was enacted.  The advice the Minister has got in relation to this Bill completely over-rules that interpretation as it has been heretofore understood.</P>
    <P>It is not for me to say which is right but it is perfectly clear that it has always been interpreted up to this that a vested cottage holder was not entitled, so long as the annuity remained outstanding, to pledge his land certificate by way of an equitable deposit.  The Housing Bill we are going to discuss accepts that as the law and provides a specific exception for it in favour of the local authority, and rightly so.  If the interpretation which is confirmed by the Housing Bill is right, this section does not give the cottage holder the optional arrangement&mdash;it is only optional.  If he is given the optional arrangement provided here, then clearly there is nothing in this Bill or any other Bill to prevent a cottage holder going to the bank and borrowing funds on his cottage.  There is nothing to prevent a <Col N="2803" /> person buying a cottage for his employee, putting the employee into the cottage and keeping the land certificate for his own security and in that way going back again to the old tied house system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman's contention is that the deposit of this land certificate would, in fact, constitute a mortgage.  My advice, as I have already stated, is that it does not constitute a mortgage.  In so far as there would appear to be a discrepancy of approach as between Section 10 of the Housing Bill and this Bill, I want to say that the Housing Bill does not, no more than does this Bill, repeal Section 21 or any of the provisions in the 1936 Act outlined by the Deputy. The various procedures which will be drawn up by the local authority are intended to be rather informal procedures because of the fact that the amount is likely to be quite small and the term for which it is required may be very short.  In a group scheme operation the advance may indeed only be sought as to the amount of the grants which will ultimately be paid and only for the period until the grants are paid.  It is not in the same category at all as operations in regard to the reconstruction of a house.</P>
      <P>In regard to the land certificate, the local authority may themselves design their own formula which will be expected to be a simple formula&mdash;one which people generally in the country with very modest means will be able to avail of.  If in those circumstances the local authority suggests any type of workable scheme whatsoever which they themselves feel is not unreasonable or does not give rise to the belief that they will lose as a result of being too lax, my Department will welcome their approach in this matter.  The amounts likely to be borrowed will be small in most cases and the time relatively short.  In very many cases there may not be any borrowing necessary at all. Borrowing may be in kind.  A local contractor does not have to be paid in advance for his work.  These things may not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These sections are intended to give <Col N="2804" /> the local authorities every reasonable latitude to draw up the type of procedure best suited to their own circumstances and to enable their people avail to the greatest possible extent of the facilities offered.  We are looking to the local authorities to devise the procedures which are the most simple and practicable.  I shall have more to say on the question of mortgages and local authority houses when we come to deal with the Housing Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind the section is good but we fear that the legal advisers to local authorities may advise that it is not legal to do what is suggested, without the repeal of Section 21 of the Act.  While the Department have laid down certain conditions under which loans may be made, those regulations may not be accepted by local authorities.  If we could have an assurance that the Department would insist on the land certificate being accepted by the local authority, we would be prepared to let the matter drop.</P>
      <P>The other alternative suggested by the Minister is not considered a good idea.  If you have to look for somebody to go bail for you at the bank, you are in a very awkward position.  The other way is clear-cut.  We appreciate the Minister is trying to take the simplest way out.  Our fear is that local authority legal advisers may say it cannot be done.  Will the Minister ensure that steps will be taken to prevent that happening?  If he does, we shall be quite happy.</P>
      <P>It is mainly materials that would be affected in this case.  It is not like a housing scheme.  Even the small amount necessary to put in the materials might not be available to the person doing the job.  I assume that, although some people might be able to do it themselves, small contractors would be doing the job in the majority of cases.  The money would have to be available.  It could not be left in a haphazard way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would be glad if the Minister would give us an assurance that, on the passing of this Bill, local authorities will not come back and say, on <Col N="2805" /> the advice of their legal advisers, that this cannot be done legally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authorities are not instructed that they need to get a land certificate deposited.  Legal advisers differ from each other at times in the interpretation of many things.  Not all local authorities are ever fully agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If any local authority legal adviser says that this may not be done, then the local authority, by virtue of these sections, is not tied to any one formula.  They are not obliged to drop the whole idea because this way of doing the job is said to be illegal.  They may devise any other type of scheme which they think will operate.  For instance, the seeds and fertilisers scheme has been operated without difficulty for many years in many counties.  Under it, seeds and fertilisers are advanced to the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>But there is a difference in the amounts.  In the case of that scheme, it is £1 or £2 at the most.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, I am only giving that as an example of a scheme which has been in operation for many years and about which there has been no difficulty, despite the lack of any formal legal requirements in regard to it.  The intention of this section is to give the local authority freedom&mdash; freedom to a degree never enjoyed under any scheme before&mdash;to draw up their own scheme, and if there is any reasonable semblance of security about it, it will be accepted.  They do not <Col N="2806" /> have to take their line from what has been said here as to how they should go about doing it.  They can devise various schemes.  They will find when they come to us that, if the scheme is reasonable at all, we will not only accept it but will welcome it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We may have the position that a local authority will say: &ldquo;We cannot do that&rdquo;.  County managers will be very quick to advise councils that under the regulations they are not entitled to lend money because they are advised legally that a second mortgage is involved.  Is it any use saying to those county managers: &ldquo;We can devise some other scheme. No matter what scheme is involved, there must be some type of security, but the only security available is the land certificate&rdquo;?  Where do we go from there?  The only alternative is to go to a neighbour and ask him to go to the bank with you, to go bail for you, as we say We want to get away from that.  Is there any way to get around the other difficulty?  Is it possible to have an appeal to the Minister to adjudicate in such cases? Unless something like that is done, I am afraid this section will not work in many counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me give an extreme case.  If the council so decide, they may make the advance and take the applicant purely on his face value.  It is as wide as that.  It is intended to be that wide in order to make the whole scheme operative.  To put it another way, suppose a man had a Sunday hat, it could well be that that Sunday hat would be taken as security for a small advance under this section.  If the local authority want it to be the &ldquo;Sunday hat&rdquo;, or something like that, then they will be enabled to accept it under this section.  That is the whole point.  We have been discussing just one method mentioned here, but there are several methods available.</P>

      <P>There is no difference of view between the Labour Party and the Minister on this, except in relation to our experience of managers in local authorities.  I know one <Col N="2807" /> official who was manager in Cork.  He has gone very far north now, but, from my experience of him, he would be very strict in matters such as this. Whether or not he has changed since he went to Donegal I do not know. We appreciate the alternatives, but we are not concerned with them because we have in mind the tenant of a vested cottage who may not find it very easy to get anybody to go surety for him. The decision will be based on his income, and so on, and the decision may be that he is not a safe mark. If some provision could be made to enable local authorities, through their legal advisers, to find some way out, we would be satisfied.  The extraordinary situation is that both the Minister and the local authority are anxious that there should be a way out to enable the local authority to accept the land certificate of a vested cottage.  We know the alternatives are there, but we are anxious that the land certificate should be accepted against the mortgage if handed in directly by the tenant concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In subsection (11) to delete paragraph (c).</P>
      <P>We want that portion of the Bill deleted which provides that in future it will not be possible for people to do something which, at the moment, practically everybody does.  I refer to the weekly car wash.  This Bill makes it an offence to wash a car, or a van, or what-have-you, by using a tap outside or a hose from a tap inside the house.  The prohibition will apply even to a pram.  The extraordinary thing is that if the car is washed by using a bucket, even if there is a hole in the bucket, it will be quite legal.  If someone decides to carry water from a tap inside the house, and there is a hole in the bucket, not alone will he draw down the wrath of the authorities but he will probably draw down the wrath of the housewife as well and he will certainly waste a lot more water than he would waste in the normal way.</P>
      <P>I think someone got the idea this was a heinous offence which must be stamped out.  Someone may have known of some neighbours who washed their cars.  He may have had no car himself.  He said: &ldquo;We will stop those fellows from washing their cars&rdquo;.  That is probably the secret at the back of this particular section.  I think the Minister will agree with me&mdash; possibly he does not have time now to wash a car&mdash;that there is a great deal of pleasure in removing the mud and putting a good shine on the car with a Flexee brush.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure.  There is no doubt about that.  We think this subsection should be deleted.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>a supply for any purpose incidental to a dwelling-house or private garden (including washing a private vehicle) if the water is drawn otherwise than from a tap inside a dwelling-house <Col N="2809" /> or if a hosepipe or similar apparatus is used,</P>
    <P>I assume this also refers to the offence of watering a garden, a little drop of water on the roses, or something like that.  It is quite ridiculous to include such a provision in a serious piece of legislation like this.  I appeal to the Minister to delete that subsection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy's interpretation of the intention of this subsection were the correct one, I should be only too ready to withdraw it.  The Deputy's interpretation is, however, not the purpose of the subsection at all. The purpose of the subsection is to enable a charge to be made for the use of water over and above domestic use in order to prevent abuses or a waste of water.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned washing his car.  If we were to leave the position wide open, then anybody could wash everybody else's car.  In those circumstances, there would be an unlimited abuse of water.  This subsection does not make a charge compulsory.  It merely enables a charge to be made in certain circumstances.  The Deputy mentioned a garden.  A garden could be of a very sizeable acreage.  It could be a very profitable garden.  If the local authority does not wish to make a charge, if they feel there are no abuses in the directions the Deputy has mentioned, they are not obliged to make a charge.  The subsection is included in order that, if they wish to make a charge, they can do so legally. They may find it necessary to wipe out abuses or to curb wastage of water for purposes not strictly related to domestic use.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely we are allowing ourselves to get into a fantastic position.  This is the way you drift into folly.  Somebody has said that an <Col N="2810" /> abuse exists, that in exceptionally dry weather in an area of short supply some irresponsible persons may use water to wash cars or water their rose gardens, which ought to be stopped. Representations have been made by some zealous soul.  A Bill is on the stocks, the Local Authorities (Sanitary Services) Bill: here is the time now to stop this practice, and we put in a section like this into the Bill.</P>
      <P>We all live in the country.  The Minister lives in the country.  Is there any reality in the picture of any resident we know of taking a hosepipe out through the kitchen window and washing all the cars in the county or setting up a business as a car washer? Do any of us know any of our neighbours in rural Ireland who would be seduced by the opportunity of easy profit that he would elect to earn his living by taking a hosepipe out through the kitchen window to wash not only his own car but all his neighbours' cars, a wet, dirty, ill-rewarded job?</P>
      <P>This is the kind of picture which bears no relation to reality.  The Minister invites us to do this.  The Minister ought to understand this as well as I understand it.  Suppose you put in a provision that watering roses renders you liable to a supplementary charge by the local authority, I want to remind the Minister that that will not operate in the way rational people may contemplate.  What will happen is that some mischievous old baggage who has seen you watering the roses last Tuesday will be off hot foot to the relieving officer to say that So-and-So was using the water, so hard to come by, in order to water roses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been done and that is why this section is in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That complaint has come to the relieving officer, then to the superintendent relieving officer, then to the county manager; the county manager has mentioned it in some conference in the Custom House and now here is the baggage moving into action to put an end to the villain that sprayed the roses to the outraged fury of the next door neighbour whose roses did not bloom that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2811" /> I suggest to the Minister that the intention may be excellent but we are in danger of falling into the customary error of employing a 400-ton hammer to crush one monkey nut.  There is no abuse existing that requires legislative control of this kind.  Occasionally a situation arises in which if there is a water shortage in the local town an irresponsible person will waste water but ordinarily the public reaction to that in the neighbourhood will correct such abuse and you will see decent fellows driving their cars out to the bridge at the end of the street and washing them at the river if they have to be washed when there is a local shortage of water.</P>
    <P>This is the mischief-maker's charter. I do not believe the Minister wants that.  I suggest to him that he is putting in the hands of every cantankerous old baggage in the country the chance to harass her neighbour if she takes it into her head to do so.  It is activities of that kind that give rise to very much more irremedial difficulties in rural communities than the occasional abuse of somebody wasting water on washing a car or watering a rose garden or something of that kind. Wasting water can be stopped without any hard feelings by anybody but if a neighbour falls out over an issue of this kind the consequential ill-will may be long-enduring.  I would advise the Minister to have another look at this section and to see if these provisions are essential and if they are not I recommend him to drop them.</P>

      <P>There are quite a number of things in this Bill which were said to be there already but about which some doubt might have been created in the past.  In regard to this matter considerable doubts have been created in the past as to how they may or may not charge for water.  It is in order to simplify the existing procedure, to enable these things to be done and to be shown that they can be done and that there is no ambiguity about the authority of the local authority, that we are putting the matters in this form.  It is not for the purpose of catching the old lady or the young lady who is watering her roses.  That is not one of the matters which we are legislating to prevent.</P>

      <P>We are legislating to enable the local authority, on whose initiative a water scheme or schemes were provided in any part of their functional area, where water is being used on a lavish, wasteful or commercial scale, if they so wish, to make a charge.  It is no more and no less than that.  The proposal in the Bill will not bring about repressive measures unless they are considered necessary by the local authority.  We are not making these things illegal.  We are merely giving the local authority the power to make charges for water used for certain purposes above and beyond the ordinary household uses.  I can see no reason why it should be removed. In fact, I can see every reason why it should be retained&mdash;but not to abuse it.  It is there to ensure that users of water do not abuse the privilege they may enjoy of being connected to a piped water supply, provided at public expense, in any area or town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a change of foot on the part of the Minister in this connection.  He has just quoted an Act which allows, according to him, the local authorities to do exactly what he is proposing to give them authority to do in this <Col N="2814" /> measure.  It is true that in rural areas where the local authorities put in a water scheme they charge a water rent according to the valuation of the house.  They charge a tenant of a house 30/- a year as a water rent.  It is now suggested that if the tenant waters his roses by means of a pipe or hose &mdash;it does not matter if he does it with a tap&mdash;or if the tap is outside he must pay an extra charge, if the local authority desires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;If the local authority desires.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority in any area has the right, and exercises it where there is a danger of a water shortage, to notify the householder that there is such a shortage and that water may not be used for A, B, or C.  That is quite a common thing in rural Ireland at present.  It is now suggested that a system should be introduced which will allow somebody to inspect a private person's garden or house to find out if there is a tap outside or if a hose is being used.  As Deputy Dillon said, it gives the long-tongued lady the opportunity to tell stories about her neighbours.</P>
      <P>All this arises because somebody got the bright idea that there should be a change in legislation where water is concerned.  Surely the recent position in Rush has not been the cause of this? Was this point introduced because there was a water shortage there, which some people alleged was caused by a number of people who grow fruit and vegetables?  Is that the reason why this is introduced?  Under the present system, people can be told they are not to use water for a certain number of hours.  Is that not sufficient?  Has that system not being working well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by the Minister to Navan.  He did not refer to another matter in regard to Navan.  An unfortunate person living outside the town boundary must pay up to £20 per year water rent.  No effort is made in this Bill to remedy that situation. The person happens to be an urban dweller, according to the regulations, and not a town dweller.  Surely this is going too far?  Are we now to have <Col N="2815" /> a tax on cleanliness?  Will there be a tax on people because they believe in using a little extra water for some purpose outside the house?</P>
    <P>With reference to the watering of a very big garden, I do not think it is reasonable to suggest that there will be a conspiracy whereby people will decide, in order to thwart the local authority which supplied the local water main, that a big garden will be laid down which can be watered several times a day in order to waste water.  Has the Minister looked at another point, namely, that if there is to be a charge for water it is assumed a meter will be installed?  Who will instal it?  What will the cost of the meter be?  Will the position not be worse in the last case than it was in the first case?</P>
    <P>Again, I will describe this section of the Bill as being not alone frivolous but mischievous&mdash;a section which has been inspired by people who do not like to see their neighbours doing something which they themselves cannot do because they have not got the necessary equipment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  The Minister is a very sensible person.  He must realise, as we do, that the section is ridiculous.  I would ask him to withdraw it.  I believe that if it is not withdrawn it will be laughed out of this House.  It certainly will be laughed out of existence by the general public if it ever becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I charge the Minister with being a little disingenuous. Consider the case of a public garage proprietor or somebody for whose business it is necessary to have a very large water supply.  The plain truth is that the only water supply he can get in a private house is a half-inch rising main.  Anybody who wants to turn on the tap in the house may do so day and night, with nobody to say yea or nay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are making a provision here that, if instead of letting the water run down the plug-hole of the kitchen sink, a person attaches a hose to the <Col N="2816" /> tap for half an hour to water the roses, to wash the car or to do any domestic chore outside the house he renders himself liable to a special charge.  The Minister should look at this section again.  Certainly he should consider the deletion of paragraph (c) of subsection 11.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody here would complain if there were a special charge for a person engaged, for instance, in a trade, business, agriculture or horticulture.  If a person is engaged in a large-scale enterprise, it is not unreasonable that he should pay a charge for his raw material which in this case may be part water. If he is engaged in a trade or industry or business it is not unreasonable that he should pay a special water rate because he is an exceptional charge on the local water supply.  I think, in fact, most of us who are in business usually pay a special water rate if the nature of our business is such as to cause us to use more than the normal supply.</P>
    <P>When we come to a supply for any purpose incidental to a dwelling-house or private garden, including washing a private vehicle, if the water is drawn otherwise than from a tap inside the dwelling-house, or if hose, pipe or similar apparatus is used, that that should make a resident whose only source of water is a rising main half an inch in diameter liable to a special water rate is clearly not in accordance with the wishes of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister knows of some urgent reason why it should be there, a sensible arrangement would be to drop paragraph (c) of subsection (11).  I do not think the world will fall down if he does.  On the other hand, he will remove not an urgent or catastrophic cause of likely rural civil war but a very possible source of bad relations between neighbours, of which, God knows, in the imperfect world in which we live, there is a sufficient abundance already, without adding to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Another aspect <Col N="2817" /> which I imagine will cause difficulty if the Minister insists on this provision is in regard to the householder who has a walled-in yard attached to his house.  If he brings his motor car into that yard and connects up his hose and starts washing his car, what authority will any official of the local authorities have to take a look over the gate or climb over the wall to look into the backyard?  I can see undue difficulty arising for local authority officials.  The local water curator in some places gets £10 or in larger villages he may get £20 or £25.  Is he now supposed to check every household where a hosepipe is available?  Will it be like the radio licences and even though the hosepipe is not being used will the very fact that a man has a water hose mean that he will have to apply for a special licence?</P>
      <P>Will it mean that the county engineer or some such person will be directed by the county manager to employ the local ganger in each area to keep an eye out for a possible flow of water from these enclosed yards in case some terrible damage is being done by people washing their vehicles? I suggest we can get on without this provision.  In the summer time through advertisements in the press, and by their own employees calling on the people, when water is in short supply, the local authorities ask for, and usually get, co-operation from the people in the matter of water consumption.  That is essential in these areas.  In this case, however, it is suggested that the onus will be on the local authority so that in the future they will have to bring people into the district court because they have water hoses available, or because some official of the council took a chance and climbed over a wall and found the occupant washing his car.  If we insist on this subsection, we will create more difficulties for local authorities than we realise at this stage.</P>

      <P>There has been a very great amount of misunderstanding in regard to the application of this section and subsection.  If Deputies had read the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill, they probably would not have misled themselves as <Col N="2818" /> they have done.  Subsection (11) is to be read in conjunction with subsection (1).  We have been discussing this matter as if it were to have nation-wide application.  In fact, the subsection read as it is to be read with subsection (1) applies to urban areas where no general water rate is chargeable or allowable under the law, nor is it proposed that it will be allowed under the law in the future.  In other words, water for domestic use may not be charged for under the existing law and it is not proposed that the new law will enable a charge to be made for domestic use.</P>

He knows that is not so and I know it is not so, and pleading that sort of case does not convince anyone here, or outside, of the validity of his arguments generally.  We are merely giving powers in this Bill to the local authorities to handle their business in regard to water in the way they think best in the interest of the public good.  That puts in a nutshell what this Bill means. If there are abuses of powers, it is not the Bill that is wrong.  It would be the local authority who so abused the power proposed to be given.  I am not suggesting that the local authorities would abuse this power.  If I thought they would, I would not give them the power&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has misread his own White Paper which sets out that the origin of the business was that when a water rate was struck in an urban area for the domestic water supply, it apparently resulted in a series of judicial decisions out of which emerged the conclusion that washing a carriage with the domestic water supply could not be properly described as a domestic use of water. <Col N="2822" /> Apparently that decision has been carried on by some other judicial decision that watering a garden with a hose constitutes something in excess of a domestic use of the water supply in respect of which no rate has been levied.  It is now proposed to set those two judicial decisions as to the proper use of the domestic water supply beyond further doubt by incorporating paragraph (c).  This is what the Minister and his Department conceive to be the existing situation as a result of the judicial decisions as to the nature of the domestic water supply.</P>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Minister that a fundamental error is here involved.  We are all familiar with the large paved courtyards which were associated with houses like Mountjoy House, Leinster House or some of the other palatial establishments in days of yore, in which one of the occupations of the day for the coachman and the footman was the washing of the carriages.  That does not go back to the 18th century.  It was a common characteristic of the 19th century.  You would have found in the backlanes of Dublin, behind Fitzwilliam Square or George's Street, accommodation for that type of transaction.</P>
      <P>Some case being raised that that was not a normal use of the domestic water supply, in the circumstances then obtaining, it may have been thought that it would cause an excessive strain on the water supply which justified an exceptional charge.  There may have been a case of a person using a domestic water supply to water what was in fact the merchandise of a large market garden.  In order to prevent that abuse, a prosecution was taken, a rate levied, and on appeal, it was determined that that person had something other than a normal domestic water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put to the Minister that in our conditions today the washing of a car, or the watering of a suburban garden or the kind of garden that now exists in the urban areas in our society, does not fall outside the normal use of the domestic water supply.  I urge on him not to get himself committed as a matter of principle to something on which he thinks he is in the right and <Col N="2823" /> that we are all fractious, and in the wrong.  I would ask him to look again at paragraph (c)  of subsection (11) between now and Report Stage, and if he sees any force in the representations which have been made, and if he decides that without excessive inconvenience or the danger of serious abuse paragraph (c)  could be dropped, he should drop it.  If he does, I think he will have made a constructive contribution to meet a reasonably argued case about a matter which is of some consequence to some of us.  By doing so, he will not delay the passage of legislation for which he is responsible. I suggest that might be the sensible thing to do in this case.</P>

      <P>The specialised care of the aged involves a wide variety of care and treatment ranging from nursing and simple medical care to <Col N="2826" /> surgical and medical treatment of acute conditions.  All county homes and all mental hospital can be regarded as providing specialised care for the aged and, in addition, several other hospitals also provide specialised care.  In practically every county there is a link between the county hospital, the county home and the mental hospital so that the services of the medical and surgical specialists and physiotherapist of the county hospital are made available to the county home and the mental hospital. Medical officers of certain county homes have, in recent times, taken courses in geriatrics.  In the regional centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway geriatric care of a higher level is made available.</P>
      <P>The number of patients aged 65 and over in county homes and mental hospitals and in the institutions at the regional centres is shown in a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  It will be seen from the table that on the dates for which the information is available there were 7,430 patients over 65 in the county homes and regional institutions and 4,845 in mental hospitals.  Information is not available of the number of aged patients treated in other institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
      <P>The cost of special classes in French which have been organised for officers engaged on work in connection with the European Economic Community is being paid out of voted moneys.  The immediately pressing needs of the public service are involved in these cases.</P>
      <P>To provide opportunities for other officers, both senior and junior, to acquire competence in French, the City-of Dublin Vocational Educational Committee agreed to organise classes suitable for their needs.  It is not a fact that senior officials get free tuition while junior officials have to pay.  The fee of £1 per session charged by the committee is paid by each officer, whether senior or junior, attending the classes.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, special leave with pay to attend in 1962 an approved language course abroad is being granted to a limited number of officers selected from amongst those who are engaged on work in connection with the European Economic Community and those who are not so engaged but for the discharge of whose duties a knowledge of one of the official languages of the Community would be likely to be of substantial benefit, provided that the special leave will not normally exceed four weeks for any officer.</P>

      <P>The responsibility of the Office of Public Works in regard to the Feale River is limited to the maintenance of the works completed under the Feale catchment drainage scheme.  The question of extending the scheme to take in the upper reaches of the Feale river was very fully considered in the past and was found to be so uneconomic that it could not be justified.</P>
      <P>The maintenance of the embankments referred to by the Deputy is not a responsibility of the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the statement referred to.  In a very small number of cases, the failure of applicants for headage grants to comply with the necessary requirements or to give the correct eartag numbers etc. has necessitated investigation.  In each such case the headage grant is paid as soon as the admissibility of the application is established. Each investigation is carried out as quickly as practicable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by Bord na Móna that they have now completed their examination of the proposed superannuation scheme in the light of the representations made by the workers' representatives, and that they expect, within the next week, to submit the scheme for my formal approval, which requires also the concurrence of the Minister for Finance.  Until I have had an opportunity to examine the proposals it is not possible to say when the scheme may come into operation but I can assure the Deputy that there will be no avoidable delay.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte inform me that information about places of historical interest is contained in a number of their publications, for example, the &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; Guide and the County Guides.  The matter has also been the subject of consultations between Bord Fáilte and the Office of Public Works who are considering the publication of a new Guide to the National Monuments in the State.  In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given on 7th June last by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance to a question on this subject.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDunne" hpid="Mr. T. Dunne Mr. T. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether a subsidy in respect of bottled gas will be paid to those people who have already installed this system of heating and lighting owing to the exorbitant fixed charges quoted for the connection and installation of an ESB supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A subsidy of £10 will be paid to enable bottled gas to be installed in those houses which had neither electricity nor bottled gas on 17th April, 1962, and which could now be connected for electricity only on the basis of special service charges of more than 100 per cent. of the appropriate normal fixed charge.</P>
      <P>It is not correct to describe the fixed charges as exorbitant.  They represent far less than the actual cost of connection, the balance being met by the State and from the loss on rural revenue account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="2852" /> for Transport and Power if he is aware that the companies controlling cross-Channel freight have recently increased freight charges by approximately seven per cent.; that world freight charges have recently fallen; and that Irish ships are at present idle; and, if so, if he will consider establishing an Irish-controlled shipping organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the principal cross-channel shipping companies, following increases in their costs of operation due to higher wages and other costs, have increased their port-to-port charges by approximately 7½ per cent. from 16th July.  I am also aware that because of the recent further sharp fall in world tramp and time charter freight rates, Irish Shipping Ltd. have found it necessary to lay up one of their ships.  The type of regular liner service required for the traffic moving between this country and Great Britain is not, however, affected by the factors which influence the level of world freight rates nor is the type of ocean going dry cargo ship now laid up suitable for use in the cross-channel trade.</P>
      <P>As regards the latter part of the question I would refer the Deputy to my supplementary reply to a question on 26th October, 1960, on the question of increases in cross-channel freight rates at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is it a fact that Transatlantic freight rates are cheaper in proportion than cross-Channel shipping rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Many efforts have been made by various enquirers to make a comparison between them but it is very difficult to make any relevant comparison as the types of trade are so different.  One of the factors so far as the cross-Channel trade is concerned is that nearly half the costs are incurred at the ports at either end which makes a comparison extremely difficult to calculate.</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that the cost of freight between New Zealand and Great Britain is as cheap as it is <Col N="2853" /> between Ireland and Great Britain? In view of the fact that Irish Shipping Ltd. have been engaged in Transatlantic shipping would the Minister reassess the position so that Irish Shipping Ltd. can be used to carry our goods across the channel?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if that matter were raised in the debate on the Estimate for the Department as it is far too lengthy a matter to deal with now.  There have been comparisons made.  One example taken was the charges incurred from a port in this country to a port on the Continent as against the charge between London and Copenhagen and the difference in the cost was negligible. To make comparisons of costs between long distance services by ships designed for those services and cross-channel costs is very difficult.  We have the report on the cross-Channel services made in 1957 and the Government have been using the evidence in that report in any way it can to improve the situation.</P>

      <P>2.  In the period from 1st January, 1962, to the 19th July, 1962, 28 prospecting licences have actually been issued and particulars of these are on Table A appended.</P>
      <P>3.  In addition to those licences already issued a decision has been taken to grant prospecting licences as set out on Table B appended and notice of intention to grant these has already been published.</P>
      <P>4.  Apart from cases included above, no firm undertakings to grant licences have been given.  A number of provisional undertakings have been given subject to compliance by the applicants with certain conditions, but I am not free to give details of these at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The conduct of mining research in this country is in the first place a matter for private enterprise.  I have within my Department, however, the Geological Survey Office, which, in fact, constitutes just such an expert advisory section as the Deputy suggests.  It is the almost invariable practice of people interested in mineral development in Ireland to consult that office which is in a position to offer them valuable advice and guidance, and I am happy to be able to say that I have received a number of tributes from such people to the assistance there rendered them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that on account <Col N="2860" /> of the considerable extension of mining in this country this advisory section needs to be increased considerably?  If we had an advisory service we might not have happenings such as in the case of the Avoca mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Deputy's qualification.  I have just told him that we have an advisory service.  We have a very efficient director of that office and I have had no complaint from him that he is over-burdened or that he requires additional staff.  If he does make such a complaint or representation to me it will receive my sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>Meath County Council have applied for two grants under the scheme of grants for the provision of works of public amenity.  One application relates to the provision of a car-park beside the County Hall, An Uaimh, and the estimated cost of the works involved is stated in the application to be £407 3s. 2d.  The second application is in respect of the provision of access to beaches at Laytown and Bettystown.  The cost of the work involved in this case is estimated at £620.  Details of both proposals are at present being examined in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs whether a radio and television repair man who has a set in his possession for the purpose of carrying out repairs to it is required to have a licence for such a set.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>If a licence is not otherwise held in respect of the premises in which the sets are repaired, the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it unreasonable that somebody who simply repairs a television set as a means of livelihood should have to pay a licence, although he does not himself possess one for his own use?</P>

      <P>I have stated in my reply what the law is in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there no exception to the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The law is enforced by the Minister and it is applicable to the Minister the same as to any other citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not repair sets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not repair sets. If I did, I would have a licence for the premises in which I proposed to carry on that business.  The Wireless Telegraphy Act 1926 imposes an <Col N="2868" /> obligation on any person who keeps or has a set in his possession to have a licence for the set, or the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that army sergeant, Harry Donaghy (Reg. No. 6653), served for thirty years in the National Army, and was discharged with an exemplary character; and that when he applied for a job with his Department, sweeping the roads at McKee Barracks, he was refused the position which was given to a man who never served a day in the Defence Forces; and, if so, if he will state why the sergeant was not given the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>All vacancies for employment of the nature referred to in the question are filled through the medium of the employment exchanges. This practice was followed in this case, but as Mr. Donaghy's name was not submitted by the employment exchange authorities for consideration for employment, it was not possible to consider him for the vacancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem to be manifestly an unsuitable situation that in relation to a sergeant of our Army, who has 30 years' service, who is discharged with an exemplary character and who applies for employment in the barracks where he served, that somebody who never did a day's work in the Defence Forces is preferred before him?  Surely some provision should be made for ex-servicemen to be given some special consideration in connection with such employment, at least from the point of ensuring that if the employment exchange has not sent up his name, his name will be considered, if he wishes it to be considered, in consideration of his service to the national forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon must be aware that successive Governments have required employment of this sort to be recruited from the lists supplied by the labour exchange.  I take it that is for the purpose of reducing the list of registered unemployed and, consequently, reducing payments of public assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further consideration in cases of this sort.  Usually&mdash;in this <Col N="2872" /> case it is so&mdash;the man is of such an age that it is hardly likely his name would be included in the list in the exchange.  The fact is his name was not included.  That is the reason why he was not considered for employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister for Defence not agree with me it would be reasonable and appropriate for him to make representations to the Minister for Social Welfare, or whoever is responsible, if an ex-service man with an exemplary discharge after 30 years' service wishes to have his name considered for positions of this character? Even if the branch manager has not sent up his name, an ex-serviceman ought to be entitled to have it considered.  If the present regulations do not provide for that, should they not be changed?  Or are we to tell ex-servicemen of exemplary service in the Army that this is a matter of no consequence or interest to the Government and the State they spent their lives serving?  I suggest to the Minister that is wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is defending himself behind a regulation, the nature of which I could debate very eloquently but I do not debate it.  The Minister's position is all cod.  This is a common way of distributing jobs among the boys.  All I am asking is that the operation of distributing jobs among the boys be suspended when an ex-serviceman asks for employment in the barracks where he spent his life in the service of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well, but has the State not an obligation to the people who have only very intermittent employment?  After all, this soldier had constant employment over a long period of years.  Certainly his sort get preference, but he was not nominated by the Exchange.  It is for that reason that the man mentioned in the question was not considered for employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully knows that, with the help of Deputies like himself, all these men know what the regulations are.  None of them is so ill-informed as not to know that in cases of this kind, his name must come through the labour exchange.  It is for that purpose the labour exchanges were established.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress, I was dealing with the question put to me by Deputy Dillon as to whether it was time to revise the monopolistic character of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, we cannot hear what the Minister is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to repeat what I have said already, but there are a few more words I should say on this subject.  CIE have an essential function of being able to provide a nation-wide transport service and being able to give information on their through-rate from one part of the country to another in regard to the transport of every conceivable kind of commodity.  They also have the function of being able to arrange transport for every single person, someone with a very small amount of goods to convey and big companies, from this country to any other country. Equally, they have the very important task of being able to provide a national transport service for tourists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite see, when Deputy Dillon raises the question of the monopolistic position of CIE, that it no longer is as simple as it used to be.  When the railways started the whole of the legislation was passed to protect the community against a service of transport with which there was no other competitor but the horse.  The situation is now very much changed and we have the picture of a national transport company which can make reasonable <Col N="2901" /> profits to pay its depreciation and interest on capital in respect of some of its services in a particular sector of transport and, at the same time, is losing money on other services.  Generally speaking, the idea is that it should balance on the whole of the operation. Now that the horse is no longer the sole competitor, it can be said that the monopoly which CIE previously had is, shall I say, so severely delimited that it can no longer be said to be in the nature of a problem for the economy or for the State.</P>
    <P>I was speaking also of the reorganisation programme that has taken place in CIE.  In so far as the services are concerned, where there is a low profit &mdash;when I use the word &ldquo;profit&rdquo;, I merely mean being able to pay their way&mdash;they have shown their ability to carry out modernisation, and the best sample of that is the package deals that have been effected, to the value of about £1,000,000, in which a great number of private institutions and firms have found that it pays to make use of CIE for their transport commitments.</P>
    <P>When the 1958 Bill requires revision the whole of this matter will be examined again and we will look into the future of transport, in regard to every aspect of it, to make quite certain, if we are to have an arterial railway line carrying passengers and goods at relatively high speeds, and over relatively long distances and stopping at reasonably infrequent intervals, that kind of service which is so valuable for the carriage of large quantities of bulk goods, large numbers of passengers at peak periods, that that kind of service can be carried on; and it can only be carried on if CIE are given the opportunity and privilege of having such monopolistic powers at least as still rest with them and being able to co-ordinate that rail service with the bus and road freight service and being, in turn, able to arrange for cross-channel goods and for maintaining its connections with all the services abroad.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, looking at the matter in a balanced kind of way, I can say to Deputy Dillon that the time has certainly not arrived when it <Col N="2902" /> can be said that CIE are exercising an undesirable form of monopolistic practice.  The Deputy was perfectly right to raise this question because there have been very big changes in the character of transport all over the world but we are, at least, in good company with the established dynamic democracies, all of whom feel that at the present time, and for many years to come, as far as we can see ahead, it is essential to encourage some form of national transport service that has certain privileges and certain monopolies while facing inevitably, as the years go by, ever-increasing competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to an interesting fact.  At his instance, the Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann was kind enough to send us a copy of &ldquo;The Future of CIE&rdquo;, being an address delivered under the auspices of Public Administration, Custom House, Dublin.  That incorporated a map.  This section is the definition section of this Bill.  It strikes me as interesting that, in the map prepared by CIE of its own railway system, they should succeed in putting Ballaghaderreen west of Kilfree when, in fact, God put it east of Kilfree, and they have succeeded in substituting the name of &ldquo;Boyle&rdquo; for the junction of Collooney.  Perhaps the Minister would direct his attention to the cartographers of CIE and suggest to them <Col N="2903" /> that, if their knowledge of the features of their railway system is no more accurate than that suggested by their maps, there may be danger of a very serious miscarriage in our transport system in the early future.</P>

      <P>This is a proposal for the purchase of a considerable number of locomotives and I should like to know why the Minister has chosen the particular locomotive he has named here, the General Motors diesel electric locomotive.  Would he tell us something about the behaviour of this electric locomotive in use in CIE, why he has ordered this particular one as opposed to the other type which has been in use in CIE?  Could he tell us also why he has decided to turn down the Vickers, the Vickers Armstrong or the German types or the possibility of getting a French locomotive?  I should like to know more about the contract.  Were tenders sought for these locomotives?  What companies were asked to tender? What were the conditions put forward by the various firms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the locomotive the Minister has decided to purchase I should like to have a number of things clarified.  The first locomotive delivered to this country was one with an observation cab at one end rather than a cab at both ends.  I understand from Parliamentary Questions that the alteration has been made now to have an observation cab at both ends.  Why was it decided to have this cab at both <Col N="2905" /> ends?  Was it for the purpose of increasing the safety margins of these engines?  If that is so why was the original engine purchased with a cab at only one end?  In relation to the loan terms, were these proposed by CIE to the company or did General Motors propose them to CIE?  When these proposals were made were they offered or were they asked for from any of the other potential competitors of General Motors?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>As the State has been asked to guarantee such a huge contract, the Minister should give some further clarification of the contract. Perhaps he would let the House know if the contract was entered into as a result of open competition?  Perhaps he would say if other firms were asked to quote?  If he does not wish to give the names of the firms he might give the country where these firms are located.</P>
      <P>Whilst appreciating that these may be attractive terms that have been offered to CIE by the General Motors Corporation, I would ask the Minister to say whether or not it was the lowest tender received and what was the difference between the accepted tender and the next lowest.  I qualify that by saying I feel fairly sure that whilst the lowest tender may not have been accepted the terms made for CIE and for the State have been reasonably attractive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to take Deputy Dr. Browne's question literally we could spend almost the entire time in this House debating all the major contracts entered into between State companies and their suppliers. There is a tradition in this House that State companies can be trusted in very large measure in regard to the purchase of materials and supplies.  There has been a very good tradition over a <Col N="2906" /> great many years and there have been very few questions asked in the time of any Government in regard to any circumstances in which large supplies were secured by State companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked questions on a more reasonable basis. CIE in the usual way sought tenders from some eight firms in a number of countries.  In their wisdom they chose the diesel engines which best suited and in respect of which the financial terms were most attractive.  I have no reason to suppose their choice was not a wise one.  There is nothing exceptional in the way the contracts were examined.  Diesel engines vary a great deal in their technical quality and diesel engines for use on our type of railways naturally have to conform to certain technical particulars.  I am satisfied that I can have confidence in the Board of CIE in the choice they have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this later engine costs us more money than the earlier one.  Why is the Minister asking us to spend this additional money? What are the grounds put forward by CIE from changing from the engine they have here to the one they have now chosen.  Surely there must be good reasons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE had very good reasons for choosing this kind of engine.  But it is quite impossible to make comparisons of the prices paid for diesel engines bought in 1953 with those for diesel engines being bought now.  Moreover, a great part of the value of a diesel engine consists in the extent to which it can be run continuously and in the amount of time that has to be spent in maintaining it and checking it.  You must take all the circumstances into account with all the other qualities of one diesel engine as against another.</P>

      <P>There is the usual guarantee.  Deputy Corish's questions are reasonable.  I reject the attitude of Deputy Dr. Browne towards this whole transaction.  Enormous purchases have been undertaken by State companies, the ultimate responsibility being left on the State company for the choice of material or equipment. If one were to have this kind of discussion in regard to one hundred million pounds' worth of equipment purchased by a great board such as the ESB since they started, we could have an interminable debate.  The actual result of it could be something which Deputy Dr. Browne might like, namely, that all these State companies would eventually be merged in the State Civil Service.  Directors could not be found to undertake the job of conducting a commercial concern under State auspices if they were liable to be asked for the same kinds of <Col N="2910" /> detailed particulars as Deputy Dr. Browne requires.</P>
      <P>We have a very fine tradition of State Boards in this country.  The directors and the chairmen have proved the trust of this House over the years.  I do not propose to alter the tradition or the circumstances under which we debate this matter. Neither do I propose that we shall get into the position in which we shall have no State companies and when the whole matter would be a vast bureaucracy because competent men would not serve as directors or high executives of these companies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that this is a good type of engine?  I may be unlucky but practically every time I travel by train, the engine on the Wexford line has broken down on its way to Dublin.  The last time I came up here by train, the engine broke down.  Not only that, but the engine on the train travelling in the other direction broke down as well.  We had to wait an hour until an engine came from Bray to enable us to proceed.  I want to be sure the Minister is satisfied that the type of engine is reliable.  I also want to be sure there is a good guarantee <Col N="2911" /> with it that it will give good service to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already inquired in particular about these engines because of the difficulties CIE have had with the older type of engine.  I am satisfied they are particularly reliable.  I very much regret that Deputy Esmonde has had this dismal experience of travelling on trains that have broken down.  All I can tell him is that according to the last count made by CIE, 85 per cent. of the trains arrive on time as compared with between 70 and 80 per cent. in the case of trains run by the British Transport Commission taken as a whole.  I would not claim that the fact that there is a slightly greater punctuality here than in their case has any great significance.</P>
      <P>I have impressed upon the Chairman of CIE, ever since I became Minister, the necessity to make sure that there will be fewer breakdowns of trains than when these older engines were used.  A very large maintenance programme was undertaken last year at a cost of £300,000 more than usual to restore the engines which had reached a certain dated period in their life when major restoration had to be done.  I hope the results will be good.</P>
      <P>I am told by the Chairman of CIE that the number of engines breaking down, as compared with two or three years ago, is now greatly reduced.  I regret that the Deputy should have been the victim of a double breakdown.</P>

      <P>The Minister should realise that the only way anybody can assess the reliability of the statistics he may produce at the behest of CIE or that they themselves may produce is by one's own experience.  My experience in relation to the statistics produced by CIE is abyssmal in the extreme.  About two years ago, I noticed regularly that CIE trailers never had splashers on the back and were always splashing up mud on the rest of the traffic.  I took the matter up with CIE.  The General Manager said it was utterly impossible, that there were no trailers whatsoever out on service by CIE <Col N="2912" /> without splashers.  It took me 22 further letters&mdash;noting on each occasion the number of the trailer in question, the time at which it was involved and the place in which it was involved&mdash; to get an admission from CIE that their statistics were wrong and that the assurance they had given me was incorrect.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about an efficient road transport service producing speedy deliveries.  This is Thursday.  Last Tuesday week, a well-known Dublin shop directed, and confirmed to me that they directed, CIE to deliver tc Kells, 16 miles away, an item of not very great size and it has not yet arrived.  Still the Minister expects us to believe the assurances he is giving. It seems to me the only way we can expect the truth of the assurance is by our own experience and our experience in most cases has not been very happy.  I am going to go on looking for information to satisfy myself and if I cannot get it, I will put down an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

If the complaints mount up and are of a particular kind, we take up these repetitive complaints with the chairman.  I can assure the House the officers of my Department do their best to aid me in this general check on the operation of all State companies, not only CIE but the ESB and every other company.  I quite agree that for a particular individual like Deputy Sweetman to have this experience is most regrettable but I have to go on the average of what I see in the way of correspondence in judging CIE and I would say there has been a very great improvement in <Col N="2913" /> the service offered both for goods and passengers and that the improvement continues generally over the whole system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I must deprecate the Minister's contemptuous approach to this whole question.  He comes in looking for a lot of money and produces a Bill in order to justify it. There are certain clauses in the Bill and we can go through them item by item and we are, by the rules of procedure, permitted to discuss each of these items and in fact consider them word by word or comma by comma if we desire.  It is the Minister's responsibility to satisfy us.  There are plenty of other things we could be doing instead of asking the Minister questions but we feel it is our duty to ask questions and get replies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is living in an insulated cocoon in which most indifferent or bad Ministers rapidly find themselves <Col N="2914" /> when they are put in control of a Department which they do not control.  They become apologists for the Department, for the concern whose policy they are meant to direct and dictate.  Their function is to act as a sort of public relations officer, not as a person with control over that particular Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to make us accept his particular approach, that is, to wash his hands of the Department and make us wash our hands of the Department also.  If the Minister does not wish us to discuss these proposals, why put them before us or why bother to come before the House at all?  The Minister must understand that he appears to be isolated from ordinary current thought amongst the public that the state of CIE, particularly since Dr. Andrews took over, is not at all high in the public mind.  On the contrary, the fact that fares have gone up&mdash;an irrefutable fact&mdash;the fact that services have been cut down, the fact that branch lines have been closed, the fact that there are very bad relations between the management and the workers do not add up to create a feeling of confidence, on the part of the public, in the management of CIE.</P>
    <P>In regard to these locomotives, we have the Minister's own admission that CIE have bought a whole lot of &ldquo;duds&rdquo; in the past, locomotives which were inefficient.  Having bought them and tried them out, CIE found they did not work very well and they have changed their decision.  Apparently they have changed their decision on a number of occasions because we have many different kinds of locomotives in CIE, so that the management of CIE are not infallible. They have made mistakes and we know in relation to this particular type of locomotive, although the Minister will not reply honestly to Deputy Esmonde, that an important adaptation was made in relation to them.</P>
    <P>From the horsepower point of view, this locomotive is virtually the same as the engine at present in use but it has the important addition of an observation cab at both ends instead of at one end.  In the first instance, CIE made a very serious blunder <Col N="2915" /> when they bought a number of engines which were perfectly satisfactory on the American railways but for particular reasons were not suitable for operations in Ireland and in certain circumstances were not only unsafe but added greatly to the amount of trouble required in their operation because of the fact that they had only one observation cab.  For safety purposes, and in order to facilitate their operation, we have got this additional, and I have no doubt costly, second cab put on.</P>
    <P>The Minister should understand that we are all over 21.  We have all come to the use of reason and we have a modicum of commonsense.  You do not go to the expense of adding quite an important structure to these locomotives just for the fun of the thing or because you have money to spare.  This was done for a good purpose&mdash;to facilitate usage and to increase the safety margin.  The Minister should have given us credit for having that modicum of commonsense and said: &ldquo;Yes, a mistake was made; they did not get the right one in the first instance and they are now getting it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Looking back over the record of CIE, whether in their administration of their affairs in relation to their employees or in relation to the public, we find that their reputation is at a very low ebb indeed.  The Minister comes in here and says: &ldquo;Give us this money and do not ask any questions. There are very good answers which have convinced me and the management of CIE, but you cannot be trusted with them.&rdquo;  That type of approach to the House is not worthy of the Minister.  We are only talking about locomotives, about trains.  For that reason, I think we could be perfectly frank about the many considerations involved.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were dealing with an ordinary private company, with a company with share capital and shares issued, he would have to stand up before the shareholders, and if they wanted to ask questions, he would have to provide the answers, particularly if they decided that they wanted an account of an amount of money <Col N="2916" /> such as is proposed here.  He could not say: &ldquo;Let me spend it.  We are running at a loss; closing branch lines; increasing fares; we have appalling staff relations; we have made a number of mistakes in the past; we made a mistake about the diesel locomotives; but trust us&mdash;we are right this time.  We made mistakes on half a dozen other occasions, but we know we are right this time.  Do not ask any questions.  Accept our word for it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why should we accept the Minister's word or the word of CIE?  So far as I can gather, the public are very impatient with CIE, and do not want to accept the <i>diktat</i> of Dr. Andrews about these things.  The general supercilious attitude adopted by the Minister is a mirror of his whole contempt for the conception of discussion.  As a tory, a conservative, he hates discussion and does not want it.  We believe we should be permitted to discuss these things.  We and the adult public have a right to know as much as possible about these affairs.</P>

I have been unable to get information at Question Time from the Minister, as I said before.  I have written to the head of CIE, Dr. Andrews, and he has told me he will not give me the information either. I have his letter here saying it would not be good for me, the same nostrum as is served up by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister talks about bureaucracy.  We are trying to prevent the establishment of a bureaucracy.  Dr. Andrews is trying to make CIE his personal private concern, where his word is law.  He wants to be a petty dictator in CIE and to dictate to everybody.  He already dictates to the <Col N="2917" /> workers, the public and in regard to the branch lines, and he now wants to dictate to Deputies through his puppet, the Minister.

      <P>I gave the answer in my Second Reading speech when I said that these engines are required by CIE for the maintenance of the main arterial rail renewals.  In reply to the second part of the Deputy's question, I and my predecessor have dealt with the question of buses which apparently run parallel to the railway lines.  If an examination is made of the use of those buses, it will be found that in many cases the buses do not run the whole way with the trains.  They depart by many miles, and passengers get in and out at intermediate points along the line.  The bus lines refute the suggestion that a parallel bus service is in any way competing undesirably with the railway service.</P>

      <P>It was an interesting experience because it proved to me long before I was ever made Minister for Transport and Power, that the buses, both in relation to the number of the services and the number of persons travelling on them, do not compete with the railway line.  They follow the most approximate route. The times are different and they take passengers from one different place to another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister in drafting Section 2 had followed the normal practice, perhaps some of this trouble would not have arisen.  I have not gone back over all the Acts, but we had a pretty similar discussion not very long ago which reinforced my own recollection.  The universal practice has always been that where a contract is mentioned in a Bill, that contract is appended in the Schedule. That has always been done.  One of the most complicated of such contracts that I can remember was in relation to the acquisition of Johnstown Castle.</P>
      <P>Be that as it may, something similar arose in relation to the Rent Restrictions Bill of 1959.  During the course of that Bill the Dublin Artisans Dwellings Company negotiated a special agreement with representatives of their tenants, and the section of the Bill referred to that particular contract by reference to date and parties as is done in this Bill.  After considerable objection being taken on that occasion to the method used, and after the case had been made at length that it was the universal practice that the contract itself was appended in the Schedule, the Minister for Justice of the day&mdash;as far as my recollection goes it was Deputy Traynor or perhaps it was the present Minister for Justice, acting as Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;agreed after investigation that it was the universal practice to schedule the contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had scheduled this contract, in respect of which he is asking for a guarantee of no less than <Col N="2919" /> 6,000,000 dollars, perhaps many of the questions which have been asked might not have arisen, and the appropriate information would have been given to the House by that contract in the Schedule.  As it is, the Minister comes to the House with this section, by virtue of which he asks us to pledge public moneys to the extent of 6,000,000 dollars, and at the same time, he tells us that he will give no information whatsoever about the contract.  That is not a proper approach.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Browne and I have pretty different views on many subjects.  I do not necessarily agree with all the remarks he has just made, but I am entirely in agreement with him in regard to this request to pledge 6,000,000 dollars of public money.  I submit to the House that when there is a request to pledge 6,000,000 dollars of public money, it is not we who are being abnormal in asking for information.  It is the Minister who is being abnormal in neglecting to follow the normal routine procedure, the procedure which has always been adopted &mdash;and which was accepted after investigation by his colleague, the Minister for Justice, as being proper procedure&mdash;and scheduling in the Bill the contract that was executed between CIE and General Motors.</P>
    <P>If that contract were here, we might not have found it necessary to ask many of the questions that have been asked today but even at this late stage he Minister should undertake to introduce, between now and Report Stage, an amendment setting out as a Schedule in this Bill the contract in question and so follow the very desirable precedent set up over the years.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister not see that he is drawing all this on himself?  I am sure there is nothing underhand at all in the proposals.  I should be very surprised if there were anything like that in the carrying out of this transaction but the attitude which the Minister is adopting of coming in here and asking for money and <Col N="2922" /> then not answering questions is creating this aura of suspicion and doubt about the whole transaction and all sorts of propositions, proposals, suggestions and innuendoes will be made which might be completely unmerited. It would be in the interests of the already much-damaged reputation of CIE with the public and it would greatly help to restore the position of CIE in the public mind if the Minister would be more can did with the House and answer these simple questions.</P>
      <P>I have not yet got an answer to my question concerning the type of locomotive which he is now buying.  Why has he decided to buy this particular locomotive rather than the type already supplied to him by General Motors as a result of a buying commission sent over by CIE?  I understand that engine was involved in very nearly killing one or two people in one incident and later on took a leg and an arm off another unfortunate man.  I should like to know whether it was decided that, because of the danger of operating these engines together with the inconvenience of having to change them at termini, the great work, trouble and bother involved in turning them at termini, these new engines were opted for by CIE?</P>

I ask that in view of the questions that have been asked on both sides of the House.  Would he hold the inquiry for his own sake?  I do not want <Col N="2923" /> to see a Minister of our Government, no matter what Government are in power, taking blame for anybody, if there is blame involved.  That is all I am asking.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>And it is under that clause that this Bill is being enacted. I think I have given all the information that could reasonably be sought in regard to this transaction.</P>
      <P>As regards what Deputy Barron said, I wish to state here and now that I have absolute faith in the conduct of the present Board of CIE and I have particular faith in Dr. Andrews as Chairman of CIE.  I disagree with everything Dr. Browne has said in that regard.  The Chairman has undertaken an enormous task of reorganising a company which, through no fault of its own, was allowed to remain under appalling difficulties of administration and finance for over 40 years.  He was asked to reorganise a company in which every single officer knew that for 40 years matters had been going from bad to worse without anything being done about them.  He was bound to raise some doubt with his work study groups and other innovations.  I have full faith in his capacity in this regard and I think I should defend him in this House in face of remarks made by another Deputy and which were published in the newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When he started in Bord na Móna he did not know very much more about peat than he knew about railways <Col N="2924" /> when he started with CIE.  It is time that a public tribute was paid to him particularly in view of the criticisms made about him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to correct the statement made by me earlier when I said that the Dublin Artisans Company Agreement of 6th October was scheduled in the Rent Restrictions Bill.  It was not.  It was a very lengthy document and in lieu of being put into the Schedule, a copy was put in the Library and the contract under Section 7 subsection (2) was deposited in the Public Records Office.  If the Minister agrees to adopt that procedure in the present instance, I shall be quite happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want the Deputy to feel that I am unduly uncooperative.  I will consult with the Minister for Finance and if he considers, having regard to all the evidence he has&mdash;and he is much more experienced in these matters than I am&mdash;that there is a case in the public interest for placing this contract on the Table of the House or in the Library I am sure he will do it.  Ministers for Finance in general have been very reasonable about that matter.  I cannot guarantee that it will be done because I am doing here something that is quite normal and it is not customary to publish these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been taking up the rôle of the Angel Gabriel and has been handing out haloes to certain people.  He should have got his facts a little more straight.  If there has been a reorganisation of CIE it has been done throughout the country by the closing of branch lines and at the expense of the workers who have lost their jobs.  I wish the Minister would remember that most of the savings have been made at the expense of the ordinary man who is earning £6 or £7 a week.  Every new experiment has been made at the expense of men who have lost their pay of £6 or £7 a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is not unreasonable for the House to ask this Minister to give the fullest information possible?  Over the last few years the Board of CIE have been attempting to save money at the expense of the people and of the <Col N="2925" /> workers and now the Minister expects this House to hand over to them the sum of 6,145,530 dollars.  Surely it is not unreasonable, when the sum is so large, that the House should ask that it be explained by the Minister?  For my part I would not agree that a satisfactory explanation has been put up. Surely it is not suggested by the Minister that at this stage of development, when the last few branch lines are being closed down, when the number of services is becoming smaller and smaller, there now has to be this complete change over and that it is necessary to spend this fantastic sum of money for the purchase of diesel engines?  If the present policy should continue to its logical conclusion we will not need any of these engines at all.  The only transport we will need will be sufficient transport to take away the lines that have been torn up.</P>
    <P>The position now is that CIE is not competing with the rail services. They have taken off the rail services and have not put on bus services to replace them.  Now they are taking over the job of common informer and are asking the Gardaí to pull up cars on the road to find out if workers who have to travel 40 miles to their work are entitled so to travel to their work. Everybody in the country has not the same idea about CIE as the Minister has.  That organisation has done more than its share over the last few years to drive thousands of people out of the country because their jobs were taken away from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am not amazed at the attitude of the Minister in this matter because I am growing accustomed to it.  His attitude here to-day is true to type; it is a repetition of what we are accustomed to from him at Question Time when questions are asked about CIE.  He immediately bristles and resents questions which are simple ones.  I come from a constituency where a large section of the railway is now being closed down, that section from Thurles to Clonmel.  Here to-day we have had the Minister who is responsible for the closing down of that service coming into the House and asking for a very large sum of money while at the same <Col N="2926" /> time he is very reluctant to give answers to what are really simple questions.</P>
      <P>When I return to my constituency, I will immediately be asked about this large sum of money and people will want to know what explanation of it was given to me, was the Minister sympathetic in his answers, was he sympathetic to the House.  What reply will I have to give?  The Minister has been anything but sympathetic.  The Minister was aggressive.  I am not exaggerating when I describe the Minister's attitude as an aggressive one. If I were in this position and was asked questions of a difficult nature I would attempt to take the House into my confidence much more than the Minister has done and explain my difficulties.  I would not go into attack and try to smother Deputies who ask simple questions.</P>
      <P>This is a democracy.  It is supposed to be a democracy.  Surely in a democracy when we are dealing with public money we are entitled to ask questions, subject to the ruling of the Chair?  There seems to be some kind of pattern established here that a Minister has 101 different tricks by which he can avoid a question.  We suffer enough in that regard in local county councils with county managers without having to suffer the same thing here in the National Assembly.  What is the secret to be guarded that the Minister cannot tell us the broad outlines of a deal made by CIE?  In all probability some good newspaper reporter will have the information tomorrow or the day after in, perhaps, a cross-channel journal.  Not alone are we in this House not provided with the information but we are not supposed to ask the question.  That is the kind of dictatorial attitude which tends to grow and which in other countries has torn down democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that if he persists in that attitude he will not make things pleasant for himself. Perhaps, he enjoys the situation.  The badgering he got here today he brought upon himself, and deservedly so.  If he gets twice as much in the next ten minutes or in the next one, two or <Col N="2927" /> three hours of the next day, I am prepared to sit and enjoy it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must surely realise that he is pushing this thing far too far.  Suppose the Minister went into any place and was asked to sign an agreement and would not be allowed to read the contents of the agreement he was signing&mdash;a sheet of blotting paper was going to be put over the agreement&mdash;he would regard that as outrageous.  He would regard it as outrageous to sign such an agreement.  I can visualise the Minister going to Deputy Colley or Deputy Booth years after he had signed an agreement without reading it and saying: &ldquo;I do not like this very much. Get me out of the trouble.  I did not read the document before I signed it.&rdquo; He would very probably be laughed out of the office.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what the Minister is asking us to do.  He is asking Dáil Éireann to underwrite, sign and stand over the agreement and the contract dated 4th May, 1962 between General Motors and CIE.  He will not tell us what is in it.  It is an outrageous performance.  It is exactly on all fours with the situation of a man who was asked to sign an agreement and told he could not read it.  Dáil Éireann should not be asked by any Minister to underwrite, stand over, accept and approve&mdash;indeed, the endorsement of any guarantee must imply acceptance and approval&mdash;a document which they have never seen and which the Minister will not put on the Table of the House. I could, perhaps, understand the Minister, although disagreeing violently with his approach, if he said: &ldquo;I never thought about it but now that the matter has been raised in the House, the House must have it at once.&rdquo;  That is not the answer.  The answer is that he will only think about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is asking us to accept, guarantee and stand over the payment by the taxpayers&mdash;in the last analysis that is what a guarantee to CIE means&mdash; of some 6,000,000 dollars without having seen anything and in respect of which we are getting no undertaking. If that is the type of blindfold legislation <Col N="2928" /> that we are asked to pass by the Government, then the sooner the people realise that Fianna Fáil as a Government feel that there is no use for Dáil Éireann the better it will be.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the statement made by <Col N="2929" /> the Taoiseach to the Institute of Public Administration on the powers and liberties of State companies and their responsibility to Parliament and to a speech I made at the conclusion of the Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power in which I gave in great detail my interpretation of what the Taoiseach said in relation to my Department.  I explained all the difficulties associated with the control of State companies by Parliament, the extent to which they should be given liberty and power to order goods and equipment for themselves.  I gave a very full commentary at that time and what I said will be generally agreed that on the whole and taking as an average body the reasonably good democratic administrations in the world today, some of them might wish to have a little more direct control, others may wish for a little bit less.  What I and the Taoiseach said covers the average view taken of what is a highly complex matter.  It is a matter related to democratic philosophy.  It is extremely difficult to define.

If he makes Dr. Andrews the man with a hatchet, then we have got to go for him.  The Minister has disowned responsibility for this Department.  He has put it over on to Dr. Andrews and he has told us to deal with Dr. Andrews.  When the Minister was asked questions here he said he had nothing to do with it and wanted nothing to do with it.  In relation to this paean of praise of Dr. Andrews, the position is that having closed branch railways, created widespread redundancy, increased fares, having reduced services and having created great unrest in CIE, he then has to admit, in spite of all these efforts, in spite of the dieselisation and all these other so-called rationalisation procedures, that his deficits are continuing to increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Following is the text of circular letter H.7/59 of 28th May, 1959, regarding the sale of vested cottages, which was addressed to each rural housing authority:</P>
      <P Just="Center">LABOURERS ACTS.</P>
      <P Just="Center">Sale of Vested Cottages.</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to state that he has given special consideration to the experience of housing authorities, as evidenced by the nature of representations conveyed to the Department from time to time, in regard to the sale of vested cottages. In the light of that examination he suggests that the administrative principles set out herein may be of assistance and guidance to housing authorities generally.</P>
      <P Just="Center">STATUTORY PROCEDURE.</P>
      <P>1.  The vesting of a cottage is subject to prescribed conditions which <i>inter alia</i> restrict the purposes for which the cottage may be used and govern alienation of the cottage. [Section 17 (2) (d) (ii) and (iii) of the Labourers Act, 1936].  The prescribed conditions continue to apply during the period in which the purchase annuity is payable, notwithstanding that the cottage may have been alienated by, for example, sale with the consent of the housing authority.</P>
      <P>2.  The Labourers Act, 1936, does not prevent a housing authority from giving its consent to the sale of a vested cottage to a person who is precluded by the conditions of vesting from using the cottage for his own accommodation but who satisfies the housing authority that the cottage shall be used for the accommodation of a qualified tenant.</P>
      <P>3.  In certain circumstances, the housing authority is empowered to suspend, with the consent of the Minister, any of the conditions of vesting which restricts the purposes for which the cottage may be used [Section 23 of the Labourers Act, 1936].</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2880" /> 4.  The Labourers Act, 1936, does not prevent the owner of a cottage from letting it, provided the letting does not contravene any of the statutory conditions which, at the time of letting, restricts the purposes for which the cottage may be used.</P>
    <P>5.  The power [conferred by Section 16 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1885] which enables housing authorities to acquire by agreement any cottage for the purposes of the Labourers Acts exercisable in relation to a cottage vested under the Labourers Act, 1936.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ADMINISTRATIVE PRINCIPLES.</P>
    <P>1.  It is clear from the foregoing that a housing authority may in its own discretion consent to the sale of a vested cottage to a person other than a person who comes within the broad statutory definition of &ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo;. This discretion has occasionally been exercised by housing authorities in consenting to sales to persons who would in the normal course be regarded as persons of the working classes rather than as agricultural labourers and whose need of rehousing is established.  In such circumstances, the Minister has consented to suspension of the conditions which would otherwise preclude persons of this class from using the cottages for the accommodation of themselves and their families.  Apart from meeting the needs of persons the rehousing of whom might ordinarily become the responsibility of the housing authority under the Labourers Acts, this procedure is, in the Minister's opinion, consistent with the recent tendency of legislation and practice towards integration of the rural and urban housing codes, including the narrowing of the statutory distinction between &ldquo;agricultural labourers&rdquo; and &ldquo;persons of the working classes&rdquo;.  The Minister, accordingly, sees no objection to consent being given by a housing authority to the sale of a vested cottage to a person of the working classes who, in the normal course, might not be regarded as an agri-</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2881" /> cultural labourer and who, in the opinion of the housing authority is in need of rehousing.  In this regard he is prepared to consent to such suspension by the housing authority of any of the relevant conditions of vesting as may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>2.  It has been held by the courts that failure of the purchaser to reside in a cottage is not in itself a breach of any of the statutory conditions of vesting and accordingly that the housing authority cannot succeed in recovering possession of the cottage on that ground alone.</P>
    <P>3.  Housing authorities are obliged to enforce compliance with the statutory conditions of vesting, including that which requires the purchaser to maintain the cottage in good sanitary condition and repair [Section 23 Labourers Act, 1936].  It is important, therefore, that housing authorities should ensure that no vested cottage, particularly a cottage which is left vacant, is permitted by the purchaser to deteriorate or become insanitary. Housing authorities are empowered to initiate proceedings for recovery of possession where they are satisfied that the statutory requirement in this regard is not observed.</P>
    <P>4.  It has been the practice, for obvious reasons of policy, to dissuade housing authorities from purchasing any vested cottage in which the owner resides.  The Minister considers, however, that he would not be justified in withholding his approval to the purchase by a housing authority of a vested cottage which is vacant if the withholding of such approval were to result in the cottage remaining vacant.  In the exceptional circumstances, therefore, in which a vested cottage is vacant and recovery of possession by the housing authority pursuant to the Labourers Act, 1936, is not appropriate, he would see no objection to the purchase by the housing authority of such cottage to meet the ascertained housing needs of a person eligible and willing to tenant it, provided that no purchaser is forthcoming who is eligible and willing to use it for his own <Col N="2882" /> accommodation or who might reasonably be permitted to do so. It is to be understood that the Minister would not countenance the purchase of a vested cottage by a housing authority in competition with a person to whom it might in the normal course be sold with their consent under the provisions of the Labourers Act, 1936.  The Minister is advised that should a vested cottage be purchased for re-letting by a housing authority, the relevant purchase scheme under which it was vested would cease to apply and that the housing authority would, accordingly, be obliged to make a new scheme under the Labourers Act, 1936, in respect of such cottage.</P>
    <P>5.  Should the owner of a vested cottage which is vacant propose to sell it to a farmer for the accommodation of the farmer's workman, the Minister would not object to consent being given by the housing authority to such sale rather than that the cottage should remain vacant indefinitely.  The Minister wishes to make it clear that he visualises consent to such a sale being given only in the exceptional circumstances in which no other purchaser is forthcoming who is eligible and willing to use the cottage for his own accommodation or who might reasonably be permitted to do so.  It is his opinion that the unrestricted sale of vested labourers cottages to persons other than persons of the classes who would normally be rehoused by the local authority would be an abuse of the fundamental principles of cottage purchase procedure.  He is satisfied, however, that the enforcement by the housing authority of the statutory conditions governing the use of the cottage would, in the event of consent being given to a sale to a farmer for the accommodation of his workman, ensure that the dwelling would not be used for purposes other than those for which it was provided.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands the area of land in this country known to have been owned by non-nationals in the year 1951, and the area of land known to be owned by non-nationals at the last date for which the relevant information is available.</P>

      <P>Statutory records for the period prior to 1st August, 1961, are not available.  I have given the Deputy, by way of reply to another question put down by him for answer to-day, particulars of relevant transactions since 1st August, 1961, recorded by the Land Commission under the procedure authorised by Sections 33, 34 and 35 of the Finance Act, 1961. It is not possible, however, to state the acreage owned by non-nationals at any particular time.  The Deputy will no doubt appreciate that such statistics would in common with the position in relation to land generally, be subject to fluctuation arising from such factors as resales, deaths, changes in citizenship status, etc.</P>
