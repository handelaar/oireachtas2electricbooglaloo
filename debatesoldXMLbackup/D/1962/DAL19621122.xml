      <P>Last night, I was endeavouring to outline the position with regard to local authority houses in County Dublin but I had not quite finished.  I want to say again to the Minister that I fail to see why a person being rehoused out of an unfit house is necessarily in greater need than a person beng rehoused out of a deplorably overcrowded local authority house.  I cannot see why there should be any distinction or difference between the subsidy as between these two people.  We have an enormous problem in County Dublin and it is only by contrasting it with many of the local authorities in the country that this can be realised.  As I said, we have over 1,000 unfit houses and we have between 800 and 900 applications for houses.  Even that does not represent the current picture.  If you contrast that, for instance, with Limerick County Council, you find that an estimate of Limerick County Council's needs is 300 houses.  They provided only 25 houses in 1959-60, 15 houses in 1961-62 and 21 houses in 1962-63.  We will need some special assistance because of the fact that more and more people are flocking into County Dublin and the need will be greater as time goes on.  If we do not get that special assistance, I do not know how the job is to be done.  The demand for houses can be easily <Col N="1615" /> recognised if we consider that something in the region of £12,000,000 has been spent on SDA houses in County Dublin.  That indicates that there must be a corresponding need for local authority houses.</P>
      <P>I know that the Minister has been critical of the efforts made by Dublin County Council to provide houses over the years.  I should like to hear from him how members of the county council can secure greater progress because at every housing meeting there is no member of the authority who is not critical of the lack of progress. We have very little function with regard to staff and if the county manager says we cannot make any more progress, that we cannot get the staff, what can the members of the local authority do?  I should like the Minister to tell us what we can do, if there is something we can do.  He himself should be in contact with the local authority and should be inquisitive about why this problem is not being solved.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with other aspects of the housing problem.  First, there is the question of sites for these houses.  There will have to be a change of outlook with regard to the area required for the siting of a local authority house.  It is altogether ridiculous as far as County Dublin is concerned to allocate half an acre to each of these houses because it represents waste space and all over the county there are weeds crossing the ditches.  It is absolutely unnecessary to provide such a large site.  One of the ways in which expenditure on local authority houses could be reduced is by cutting down considerably on site area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the further consideration that we are far too selective about sites.  Recently a site was offered in the Terenure area.  It is a comparatively small site but a site on which numerous families had been reared in the past. It is up a very nicely wooded lane and in a very nice situation.  The local authority refused to accept that site, which was being offered cheaply.  The services were all available.  We had to <Col N="1616" /> invoke Section 4 to press the manager to agree to the site.  The matter will now go to the Department and I hope the Department will say that this site is quite good enough for a local authority house.  We were trying to provide a house for somebody who was about to be evicted.  It would make possible the provision of another house and that is the important thing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the purchase of sites by local authorities, I should like to cite a case of one very large community centre which has been created in recent years.  There were no sites available for schools, primary or vocational, a library or a health centre. There is one field left.  I put down a notice of motion to have the county council purchase a site for these purposes.  I was told by the manager that we just could not put that in, in a compulsory purchase, that we would have to be more specific.  I should like to get a ruling on that because these community centres are growing up without space being provided for any of these very essential needs.  I realise, of course, that the matter comes under town planning rather than under housing.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the picture as I know it with regard to housing and I just want to refer now to SDA building. A number of Deputies have referred to the fact that the grant is confined to a certain size of house and that subsequently a reconstruction grant of £280 may be made available and have suggested that it might be more advisable to allow the house to be somewhat larger at the outset.  That is a matter that deserves further consideration by the Minister.  There is certainly something in the suggestion.</P>
    <P>I am very critical of the standard of houses being built at the present time.  There must be fantastic profiteering. I have examined a number of schemes of SDA houses during the past six or eight months.  If there is not a fantastic profit in them, I know very little about houses.  They are of very poor standard, merely shells. There is a need for research into the cost of building, especially of local authority houses.  There is a problem <Col N="1617" /> in regard to this matter.  Some years ago, we were getting tenders for rural houses in north County Dublin.  When they were running at £1,100 or £1,200, we were being told by the Minister to readvertise.  This has been going on for years.  We are now in the position that tenders for similar houses are running at £1,800 and £1,900 and again we are being told to readvertise.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I do not know what is the solution to this problem.  If anybody is to be left on the farms in rural Ireland, this matter will have to receive further attention and some way must be found to provide rural houses. Otherwise, nobody will be left in rural Ireland.  Whether the solution lies along the lines of setting up a building organisation for local authority housing&mdash;having research carried out into methods of reducing building costs, the use of more modern materials and so on&mdash;I do not pretend to know, but I do know that applicants have been awaiting houses for the past ten years and we are still being told to readvertise. Certainly, the position needs further consideration.</P>
    <P>In County Dublin, there is a very big regional water and sewerage scheme being undertaken.  The cost is very high but, when completed, the scheme will be very well worthwhile. It is a remarkable fact that County Dublin, which is in such close proximity to the capital city, has been one of the most backward counties in Ireland.  The lack of amenties and services is amazing.  There are local authority houses still in existence which can be described as being in the city because the areas for miles beyond them have been built up, which have no water, sewerage or other services. I have emphasised the need for some special consideration if the problem in County Dublin is to be solved, and I shall leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The impression has grown up that the Minister was tied to piped water schemes for rural Ireland.  Therefore, I was glad to learn from his opening address that he has an open mind on the subject and that he is prepared to consider and encourage other water schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1618" /> There are three sections of the rural community concerned with the question of water supply.  There is the individual who has provided his own water supply who, having gone to the expense of procuring a supply for himself, feels that he should not be asked to subscribe towards a supply for other people; secondly, there are those to whom a piped water supply is available; and, thirdly, those concerned with a group scheme.</P>
    <P>The provision of piped water supplies will present a serious problem in rural Ireland.  In my constituency, already, that problem has become apparent.  Some years ago, there was a new scheme for a water supply to the town of Gorey, which is not an urbanised area but falls within the county council's jurisdiction.  At that time, the local advisers considered it necessary to instal a large pipe in order to ensure an adequate supply for the town of Gorey but the representatives of the Department did not agree. Apparently, somebody in the Department conceived the notion that £2,000 or £3,000 would be saved by putting in a smaller pipe.  The result is that at present there is a new and ambitious scheme, costing £33,000, to ensure that Gorey gets an adequate water supply. Naturally, this involves an increased charge on the ratepayers of the Gorey area and persons in the fringe area of Courtown, who are getting water.  In addition, there is the south regional water scheme for Wexford, which took approximately eight or nine years to implement.  That has left an extra charge on the consumers of water in Gorey.  In some cases, the increase is as much as 600 per cent.  and this increase falls on people in the back streets, who are least able to bear it.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for the Minister for Local Government to put that matter right but it does pose the question that, if we are to have a piped water supply&mdash;and I concede that in certain rural areas it is possible to have such a supply&mdash;the scheme should be ambitious enough to allow for extension. There is no use in laying down inadequate foundations.</P>
    <P>In Enniscorthy, where there is a large amount of fringe increase going <Col N="1619" /> on, they are able to meet the demands because they have a peculiar sort of water supply which comes out of the river.  It is almost illimitable.  If piped water supplies are to be economic they must be capable of expansion and, if they are capable of expansion, more people in the fringe areas will be able to absorb the supply.  The reason I mentioned Gorey was to show that the local people were put to enormous expenditure because there was not enough foresight.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister favours group regional schemes.  I am very much in favour of them.  Because of our scattered population it is quite impossible for everyone to have a piped water supply.  I have no doubt that is very disappointing to the Minister for Health because he wishes to fluoridate all the water in Ireland.  Group water supply schemes are provided by private enterprise with a certain amount of assistance from the State and there is no further charge on them other than maintenance.  The Minister should lend a most sympathetic ear to any group of private individuals who come together for the purpose of securing their own water supply.</P>
    <P>I feel that a different approach would be advisable in regard to the relations that exist between the Department and the local authorities on the question of sanitary arrangements and water supplies.  Not being a member of a local authority I speak, of course, subject to correction but, as I know it, the position is that the local authority presents a scheme to the central government and the scheme goes to the Department of Local Government and stays there for a considerable time.  It is vetted and checked in every way to see that the subvention from the State is safeguarded in every way.  It then comes back to the local authority with queries, and then goes back again to Local Government, and someone sends it back with another query. That was very evident in our Wexford south regional water supply scheme.  It went on for a period covering three Dála before all the different obstacles were overcome.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> The same applies to a sanitation scheme in a small village or town.  It is sent to the Department of Local Government and comes back with a query as to whether a sewerage pipe should be four points to the east or to the west.  Is it not possible for the Department to have an expert on water supplies, as I have no doubt they have and, when a local authority is setting up a scheme, is it not possible to send someone down from the Department for consultations, to have the whole matter discussed around a table and have a suitable scheme worked out?  That would shorten the negotiations that go on.  That may happen at the moment.  As I say, I am not a member of a local authority but I do not think it does.  It is all done by correspondence and my years in public life have taught me that correspondence between the Department and the local authorities can go on over a considerably extended period. If the Minister considered that suggestion, the whole thing might be done much more quickly than it is at present.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, we already have a scheme on the south coast, and if they have the same trouble and difficulties as we had in regard to correspondence, checks and cross-checks between the Central Government and the local authority, they will not have a water supply for years to come.  The feeling amongst the general public is: &ldquo;Why should we wait all this time?  Why should there be all these delays?&rdquo; I ask the Minister to give consideration to that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that there is a falling off in private housing.  I think there are several reasons why private housing is not fully availing of the grants.  I have found that in certain instances there are people who prefer to build their houses a little larger than is allowed under the existing schemes.  There are rigid, hard and fast rules and if you want to get a grant the rooms must be exactly the size laid down by the Local Government regulations.</P>
    <P>There are many people who would welcome a grant and would be encouraged to build houses if they got a grant, but they would like to build them a little bit bigger than they can under <Col N="1621" /> the hard and fast rules of the scheme. I wonder is it necessary to be so rigid? I appreciate that if a Bill is passed here which provides for a particular size of house that decision has to be administered by the officers concerned. I wonder would it be possible to change the regulations if the Minister would agree?  One person might prefer to build his house a little bit bigger because he has a large family.  If that were possible there would be a considerable upsurge in private housing. There is nothing that stimulates a person more and makes him a better citizen than owning his own house.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the falling off in private housing is the appalling delay in the payment of grants.  I understand that there is considerable difficulty in getting engineers, inspectors and officials to work for the Department.  I suppose that if a man has the necessary professional qualifications, he does not want to get into a dead-end job. I should not think that it is a very exciting job to have to inspect houses day after day.  That is probably one of the problems.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed last night by the speech made by Deputy Reynolds. He made a very sound suggestion which I should like to reiterate.  He said that when an inspector examines a new house he decides whether a downpipe is wrong or whether a vent should be to the left or the right.  He goes away and leaves the impression that everything is sunshine and that there seems to be no reason why the grant should not be paid.  Later on a query comes back about a vent in a pipe.  It should be possible to indicate to the person who is getting the grant when the inspector is coming.  The whole difficulty is that the inspector turns up out of the blue and perhaps the person is away selling a pig at the local market.  He does not see the inspector and does not know what is happening.</P>
    <P>There are delays in regard to housing grants.  I do not like to say very much about it because I have had so much courtesy and help from the housing section of the Department of Local <Col N="1622" /> Government that I feel they are doing their best.  I believe the staff is inadequate. As far as I know, the inspector who does the inspecting in my constituency has to do three or four other counties as well.  This is a matter to which the Minister and his officials could direct their minds in order to get more rapid results.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why private housing is falling away.  It is almost impossible to get a tradesman to do the job now because the majority of them have emigrated.  There is a falling off in rural housing and these men are not satisfied that if they came back, there would be a continuation of the building that exists.  There is a demand for houses.  There is a tremendous demand for rural houses.  There is a demand for labourers' cottages in Wexford.  There is a demand for houses in Gorey, Enniscorthy, New Ross and Wexford town.  Unless we are continuously building houses, there will be a great backlog and that is what the country is facing at the moment.  It is nonsense to say the housing requirements of the people have been met.  I know of three people from, shall we say, the middle income group who were forced to emigrate from near where I live because they could not get a house or see any prospect of a house being built.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another problem of private housing.  There are people who are anxious to build houses for themselves.  The Minister will accept that it is more desirable that the person build the house himself rather than let somebody else do it for him. In most instances, the local authorities have sites available and I do not see any reason why the private individual should not be allowed to build on the site belonging to the local authority.  It could be done easily by instituting a ground rent or something like that.  If some scheme to that effect were made available, I am sure private housing would go ahead very much faster than it is going now.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have referred to the delay in the repair of labourers' cottages and also to the fact that it is almost impossible to get a labourer's cottage repaired unless the person is <Col N="1623" /> prepared to vest it.  To a large extent, that is true.  I know cases where people had to wait as long as six years to have their front door repaired.  I know people who have had a leaking roof on their house and who have been trying to patch it up themselves.  I thought at one time this situation was peculiar to my own constituency, but having read some of this debate and listened to Deputies here, I find it is widespread.  It is entirely wrong that such should be the case.  Perhaps the Minister could help by having a survey made in all the counties and indicate to the authorities concerned that it is a matter they should investigate.  I am sure it is not a question of a shortage of money.  It is a question of organisation more than anything else and one that should concern central government as well as local government.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have had a number of very ambitious schemes, road schemes and main road repairs not only in my own county but between where I live and Dublin.  I gather it is happening all over the country.  I wonder are we wise in spending these huge sums of money in rural areas for the purpose of taking off corners, filling up ravines, for which we are utilising a lot of arable land.  In one case recently, they went right through a man's farm, cutting his fields in half; no doubt he was well compensated for it.  Efforts are being made to create straighter roads.  I think the scheme is known in the Department as the 60-mile an hour road where if you can see a certain distance ahead, it is considered safe to travel at 60 miles an hour. I suppose it is an imitation of the famous autobahns to be found in Europe.  A note of warning ought to be issued that the majority of fatal accidents that take place in Europe take place on these famous autobahns. The straighter the road, the faster people go.  If anything goes wrong, they have to stop and that is where the danger comes in.  Apart from that, there is the question of lights at night. It costs vast sums of money to keep these roads in repair.  I should like to see some of this money diverted to <Col N="1624" /> what are known as county roads.  There is a sizeable amount of money now being paid into the Exchequer through motor taxation.  I cannot help feeling we are very stingy with luminous paint and also danger signs.  If you travel on the roads in other countries, you continually see signs up everywhere and plenty of luminous paint.  That is an example we should follow.  It should be compulsory also&mdash;I have referred to this before&mdash;for all lorries to have luminous paint signs.  There are strips which can be got and which would give warning to vehicles approaching from behind, particularly where there are trailers in tow.</P>
    <P>That brings me to one or two points in relation to my constituency.  An inquiry was held nearly 12 months ago in regard to the New Ross bridge. I have been to the office of the Minister for Transport and Power imagining that they were responsible for the delay.  Apparently this matter has gone to the Minister's Department. The question is whether we are to have a closed bridge or an open span bridge.  For 12 months, the local people have been waiting for a decision on that point.  It so happens that New Ross has become a much more important place than it was.  It has now a good harbour, thanks to the initiative of private enterprise, a harbour which is now capable of taking a 3,000 ton ship and there is the expanding Albatross fertiliser factory there.  The railway is to close down in the near future so that the people in that area will be entirely dependent on road traffic.</P>
    <P>Nobody has been able to find out the cause of the delay.  Every time there is an inquiry about it, we are told the matter is not yet decided.  It seems to be a simple matter to decide: will it be an open bridge or a closed bridge? The question that arises from that is: is it necessary to have an open-span bridge so that ships can come up the river?  I do not think myself that much cargo would go up the river, though of course it is navigable up to the towns further along.  However, it has a very fine tourist potential in regard to house boats and that sort of thing.  Perhaps the Minister would <Col N="1625" /> indicate whether we are to have an open-span bridge or a closed bridge, if he thinks it worth discussing.  If he does not, perhaps he would indicate to the House for the benefit of the people of New Ross when this report will be issued.</P>
    <P>Officials have discovered recently in my constituency that the Eddermine bridge is in a crucial condition.  Not even an ass and cart is allowed over it now.  I wonder how it was allowed to get into such a state.  I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that between Enniscorthy and Killurin, there is only one bridge and if farmers want to go to the other side of the river, they have to go right up by Killurin or around by Enniscorthy. There are bridges on the other reaches about every two miles.  In this place, there is a complete paucity of bridges. I wonder if this very heavy machinery used by local authorities has been in any way responsible for the damage to this bridge.</P>
    <P>I wonder also if this very heavy machinery used by local authorities to the detriment of employment of labourers is wise or not.  If we are to to use this machinery, if we are to employ fewer men, will it be less economical in the final analysis if these huge heavy machines show up the defects and weaknesses of these bridges which originally were able to carry normal traffic?  Perhaps I am wrong. It is only a suggestion.  The Minister will shortly be approached by a deputation from the local authority and perhaps he will give it sympathetic consideration.  I might say we have many bridges in Wexford but that is not our fault since we have a river running right through the constituency.</P>
    <P>Finally, not being a Dublin man but having to come to Dublin often as many of my constituents have to do, I should like to say something about the parking outrage which exists in Dublin.  It is an outrage.  After 10 o'clock in the morning, there is nowhere to park a car in Dublin unless you go to Rathmines or some such outlying area.  People coming to Dublin from the country&mdash;the Minister himself is a country Deputy&mdash;have no earthly chance of getting a parking <Col N="1626" /> place.  I know of nowhere in Dublin now, if I went out with my car and tried to park centrally, in which I would have a chance of parking, added to which either side of every street is closely packed with cars.  They talk about traffic congestion and difficulty in face of the fact that the flow through the streets in central Dublin is only half the width it should be. Nothing has been done to meet this problem.  Every other city I have been in has attempted to deal with its traffic problem and to ease its parking difficulties.</P>
    <P>This may be a question for an inter-Departmental committee.  If it is, God help us, because we will be waiting another three or four years for something to happen.  The answer is that there is not the room available in Dublin for parking in normal conditions. You must go overhead or underground but I can assure the Minister that if he provides decent parking facilities in the centre of the city, and if he charges a reasonable fee for parking, he will reap a rich dividend.  That is work that needs to be done in Dublin.  I do not know if there are any members of the Dublin Corporation listening; I do not know even if the Dublin Corporation have discussed this matter, but it is a problem that must be taken up at ministerial level because the parking position in Dublin is a public outrage and something must be done about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In reference to rural water supplies, I should like to bring the points of view of the people in my constituency before the Minister. There is a lot of conflicting thought about the way water supply schemes should be provided and operated. Because they have water supplies themselves, a number of farmers in Kerry seem to think it unfair that they should be saddled with charges on the rates for the provision of public water supplies.  The bulk of the people, however, do not agree.  An important feature is that many of the farmers who have private water supplies really have not enough water for their own needs.  Most of them have the usual pump or sunken well in the yard and an electric pump to supply the house <Col N="1627" /> and in some cases the cow byre.  That seems satisfactory but we must remember our low water usage in country areas by comparison with that of the Danes.  If we do that, it will give us an indication of what we need in the future.</P>
      <P>Most of the farmers who may now think they have satisfactory water supplies would be much better off and would realise that fact very quickly, if they had a piped supply along the roads passing their farms from which they could get water into their fields and farmyards.  I saw a film in Killarney on how the New Zealand farmer operates.  He washes down the entire concrete yard and byres before the cows are brought in and immediately after they are driven out.  There are four washings per day, thousands of gallons of water being used.  If we are to achieve the competitive position we need in worldwide markets, an important factor in our operational methods is that we have proper and adequate water supplies to our farms.</P>
      <P>In Kerry, we have an abundance of water along the Magillicuddy Reeks and the county engineer has put up a scheme which would cost in the region of £2,000,000 to £2,500,000.  The plan is to pipe that water 15 miles in all directions to farms which are now mostly without water.  In a county like Kerry, where the rates are close to 60s. in the £, already, a gigantic scheme like that is away above us financially. The Department would be doing a good job if they made available full cost grants in areas such as that throughout rural Ireland.  We should have large mains carrying water through the centre of counties which could be tapped at local level, where required.  Apart from the amenity value, it would be a great incentive to farmers to increase production.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied with the efficacy of the group schemes that operate in Kerry.  The groups of people who get together to provide such schemes are inclined to take a limited view of what an adequate water supply should be and ultimately most such groups have to fall back on public supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> I would also ask the Minister to do everything he can to allow the maximum amount of money for congested district areas.  Very useful work has been done in part of my constituency in the Dingle Peninsula by the Gaeltacht people.  They have practically supplied the entire Gaeltacht area from Dingle with piped water.  That is a very laudable scheme and I would ask the Minister to try to envisage something on the same lines for the congested areas where the people are hardest hit.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, again we have made vast progress in County Kerry but there is still a big lot to be done.  I learned recently that there are 700 applications for local authority houses and cottages in County Kerry. I would ask the Minister to take up with the county council the question of trying to meet that waiting list.  It is a pity that the Minister has not some form of liaison between his Department and the councils.  We seem to come up against snags from our engineering section and the Department.  There are long delays that appear unnecessary.</P>
    <P>Let me quote as a comparison the Kerry County Committee of Agriculture. The Department's officer is sent down from time to time.  He sits in with the committee, especially on new schemes.  He has full particulars. There never appears to be any delay or hold-up.  If the Minister for Local Government had somebody from his Department sitting in, particularly on our housing, sewerage and water sections, to take back the views of the council to the Department, many of the hold-ups and delays would be got over.  I would suggest to the Minister that he consider something on those lines.  The Department should be capable of working out something in that connection.</P>
    <P>I noticed&mdash;I think it is in today's paper&mdash;that it has now been found that there is a 12½ per cent. increase in labour costs and materials, so far as housing is concerned.  That is a clear indication of the necessity to increase grants to the local authorities and the ordinary householder.  Most houses, even in rural areas, will cost in the region of £2,000 if they are to be fully <Col N="1629" /> serviced houses.  The sum of £2,000 is a lot of money for some of our smallholders.  An increase in the grant would be a further incentive to those people.  There is a forward demand by all our people to-day in the rural areas to have the best as far as their means will allow.  Further help both from the Minister's Department and the local authority would be a powerful incentive to speed up the number of houses.</P>
    <P>There is another section who are crying out for assistance in regard to houses.  I refer to old people, husbands and wives, whose families have emigrated, a bachelor and his sister who, through economic circumstances, never got married and are in the 60 years age group, living in deplorable housing conditions.  Special arrangements should be made to help those people out.  We have a number of them.  Thanks be to God there are not many in our county.  Still there are a number there.  A special effort should be made to erect some type of small house in which they could live for the few remaining years of their lives.  I would ask the Minister to go specially into that matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to the horrible position which exists in relation to motor traffic, we are bringing in regulations about slowing down the speed through towns and villages.  That is very essential. All the same, I think that as far as possible some form of by-passes should be arranged on the roads running by towns where the main traffic could be directed.  I pass through many towns going from Dublin to Kerry.  I have to travel 200 miles once I leave Dáil Éireann.  The position in most towns is impossible.</P>
    <P>In regard to Portlaoise, at most times the entire centre of the town is blocked. We have to pull up.  Possibly, it often takes ten minutes or a quarter of an hour to get out of the town.  If we reach the stage where we have that in every large town, the position will become intolerable.  In those large towns, there should be some control of the parking system.  In Portlaoise, the main street is very narrow and if you find a lorry coming against you, you <Col N="1630" /> cannot get through and have to pull into a side street.  There should be parking regulations in respect of such towns, if there is to be a slowing down. There should also be some regulations introduced to help out the traveller going long distances.  None of us wants to face a position where one has to wait hour after hour trying to get through.</P>
    <P>It is only reasonable that the authorities should be made to provide by-passes in most of those towns.  For obvious reasons, they will not want to do that and they will try to frame the regulations accordingly.  The matter, particularly in built-up areas, of fast driving is becoming a headache.  All the same, if any of those urban areas brought in the proper by-laws to control parking it would ease the position and help out the traveller and probably not drive him to the extent of trying to make up the time he has lost in one town or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Several Deputies have already referred to the delay in the payment of housing grants.  I think it must now be evident to us all that a pretty widespread problem exists in that regard.  The plain fact is that Deputies are inhibited from complaining, as stridently as they would be justified in doing in regard to this matter, by the unfailing courtesy and helpfulness of the officers of the Department of Local Government who, certainly in my experience and in the experience of many of my colleagues with whom I have discussed the matter, go to great lengths to try to help Deputies to resolve the individual complaints that reach them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that that help is so freely and generously forthcoming does not alter the other fact, that there are unjustifiable delays, for which there must be some reason, in the payments of grants.  It may be due to lack of inspectors or to some deliberate purpose of holding up payments of grants for some financial reason but whatever it is, it should be discovered and remedied.  A situation ought not obtain in which a considerable percentage of people feel it incumbent on them to approach a Deputy in order to get a grant that is due to them paid <Col N="1631" /> and which is paid when urgent representations are made.  They should get these grants without unreasonable delay and, if they did, the complaints, which so many Deputies have felt it their duty to make, would not arise.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that something radical should be done forthwith to put an end to that situation. In County Monaghan, I must write several letters every week to the Department querying the non-payment of grants.  Undoubtedly, in a small percentage of these cases it is suggested, particularly in regard to reconstruction grants, that there is some defect in the work.  I have had one or two cases in which the Department replied that they had not received notification from the person who built the house that the work was completed, but in the majority of cases it is a matter of referring to the files of the inspector and bespeaking the earliest possible attention for the claim.  I imagine it must be due to a shortage of personnel but, whatever the reason, a remedy should be found and applied forthwith.</P>
    <P>I am much concerned about the general housing situation.  In 1957, we were in the happy state of being able to survey the whole continent of Europe, and of being one of the very few countries where we could say with truth that we had substantially resolved the acute housing problem.  You heard stories of appalling hardships in Britain, Germany and France and all over the continent, cases of people living in shocking conditions.  Although they were able to afford rents, houses were not there to accommodate them. But here in Dublin you had the extraordinary and immensely gratifying situation that we had abundant houses for all who wanted them and that sometimes, in fact, it was suggested there were vacancies which could not be filled.</P>
    <P>That situation was the fruit of the programme of house-building which secured the erection, through private and local authority building, of approximately 10,000 in 1954.  10,000 in 1955, 9,400 in 1956 and 10,200 in 1957.  In the following year, however, <Col N="1632" /> the number was 6,900; in 1959, it was 4,400; in 1960, 5,500 and in 1961, 5,300.  We are now in the position that in Dublin there is an acute shortage of houses.  People are living in shocking conditions and cannot get a house; the people who are queuing up to get a roof over their heads are faced with the fact that in Dublin city to-day we are building more luxury hotels and luxury suites of offices than ever before.</P>
    <P>What is the matter with the building policy of a country which leaves its people in slum rooms and condemned buildings and diverts the building industry and its resources to an unprecedented programme of luxury hotels and office buildings?  There is a boom in building at present but when you inquire into its nature, it is not occasioned by the provision of houses for people living in condemned dwellings but by the building of immense office blocks and luxury hotels to a point where many people are beginning to ask themselves: &ldquo;Who are going to occupy the office blocks and luxury hotels?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was something of which I was happy to boast at any international gathering I attended five or six years ago that we had a situation in which there were more houses than applicants. That was a distinction one was proud to claim in any city in Europe. I am not a bit proud to claim anywhere that there are people living in condemned dwellings in Dublin at present, young married couples living in one room in the houses of their fathers-in-law, while at the same time we have a surplus of office accommodation and luxury hotel accommodation.  To my mind, that reproduces a picture that you expect to find in South American republics but it is not the kind of picture I would wish to see emerge here.</P>
    <P>I suppose the Minister can claim the alibi that the housing needs of each area are primarily the function of the local authority in that area but that is not a valid argument.  The function of the Minister for Local Government is to secure that the housing requirements of the people at large will be met and, where he finds local authorities fail in that duty, it is his overriding <Col N="1633" /> responsibility to direct their attention to it and to take such steps as are necessary to see if local authorities and the other resources available will provide adequate housing for those who require it.</P>
    <P>I listened to some Deputies today saying that the cost of building is going up and that the rise in the cost of building demands increased grants. That is substantially true but I think that because we say the cost of building is soaring, we should ask ourselves what is making it soar?  Is it that all our resources are stretched in the task of housing the people?  I think we are reluctantly constrained to confess that is not the case.  Our resources are strained in every other type of building but that is having its repercussions on the cost of building houses and making the problem of those who want houses even more complex than it already is.  It is raising the question as to whether the burden of reasonable housing grants is not to be substantially increased, if people are to be enabled to build houses for themselves, or if local authorities are to be enabled to provide adequately for the people who want houses and cannot afford to buy or build them for their own use.  The Minister should take a very careful look at the building policy at present proceeding in this country. The policy which provided houses for the people, though much criticised by certain economists, was sounder social policy than a policy which provides luxury hotels and office buildings and leaves the people in condemned houses.</P>
    <P>I heard discussions today about the desirability of introducing speed limits on the roads with a view to reducing the accident rate and the Minister's affirmation that it was his intention to do so.  I am sure speed limits will make some contribution in certain built-up areas but the fact remains, if we want to be honest with ourselves, if the motor accident rates on the roads of this country are substantially to be reduced, that some measures will have to be taken to fix an arbitrary maximum of alcohol which may be consumed by a driver before he takes to the road.</P>
    <P>It is illusory to imagine that we will <Col N="1634" /> make any serious impression on the motor accident rate on the roads unless and until the fact is faced that it is not the blind drunk driver who precipitates accidents on the roads; it is not the driver who is unduly constricted by the road accommodation or it is not the driver who drives faster than prudence would allow.  The driver who does most of the damage on the road is the driver who is not drunk but who has enough drink taken to persuade himself that he can take risks which another man would not.</P>
    <P>There is only one way of terminating that problem and that is by fixing an arbitrary limit to the quantity of alcohol a man may take if he is going to drive a car.  If he exceeds that limit then he is deemed to be unfit, by reason of the consumption of alcohol, to drive a car.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnWMoher" hpid="Mr. Moher Mr. Moher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moher</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is not the quantity but the tolerance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very danger in which we stand.  If we want to stop accidents on the roads, we are always prepared to do everything but the one thing which will produce results.  If we want to stop accidents on the roads, what we must prevent is the man on the road with too much drink but who is not drunk.  That would involve unduly placing restrictions on some people who have hard heads.  We want to provide that there is an arbitrary level of alcohol above which you must not go if you want to drive a car.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly true that there are certain exceptional individuals who can safely drive a car without exceeding that limit but the vast bulk of men and women are in a dangerous state, if they exceed that limit.  Therefore, the man with the hard head must conform to the rule of lesser men for the public good and say: &ldquo;If I take that much drink, I shall not drive.&rdquo; Any other precautions such as speed limits, effective in their own way though they may be, are illusory protections against the motor accident rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is justifiable in built-up areas to have a speed limit.  However, it is quite illusory to imagine that that <Col N="1635" /> will get to the root of the road problem which is in my judgment&mdash;and all the discussions I have ever had with authorities on this matter confirm me in my belief&mdash;that it is not the blind drunk driver who is dangerous; it is not the man who is stone cold sober who is in the habit of driving too fast but the man who takes drink to the point of believing that he is uniquely qualified to take certain risks with safety which he would not sanction in the case of anybody but himself.  He is the dangerous man and he is the man who has drink taken but who is not drunk within the meaning of the law as it stands at present.</P>
    <P>CIE are gradually shovelling off a considerable volume of traffic back on the roads.  In the 1958 Act, we exempted them from their liability, not only as a common carrier but from their obligation to maintain in existence the rail system that obtained. They are now taking advantage of that exemption and are shifting a considerable volume of heavy traffic on to the road.  That has given rise to two evils.  One evil is the appearance of the articulated vehicle on the roads. By an articulated vehicle I mean a lorry of customary size drawing after it a second vehicle of equal size, on tow, and, even on occasion, you will meet two pantechnicons, one hitched on to the back of the other.</P>
    <P>The fact is that on the roads of this country a lorry presents quite a formidable obstacle to ordinary traffic. However, when you are confronted with an articulated lorry, the back half of which is swinging unpredictably behind the vehicle drawing it, they become an appalling hazard to ordinary traffic on the road.  I want to suggest that the time has come when we ought seriously to consider providing that articulated vehicles of that character should not be employed upon the public road.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard that suggestion recently.  At a committee of the Economic Council of Europe, which <Col N="1636" /> I attended, that matter was discussed. I raised that question there and I was told that the vested interests in the transport industry on the Continent were too powerful to get a general ordinance throughout the whole of Europe to put an end to the practice. But, whatever the vested interests are on the Continent of Europe, it seems to me that, here in Ireland, in our circumstances, we ought to be able to face that problem and put an end to it.</P>
      <P>Naturally, it is not something one would do at 24 hours' notice.  However, I do not think it would be unreasonable to prescribe that, after the lapse of a suitable period to allow people to adapt themselves to the new regulation, articulated vehicles of that character would no longer be allowed and that there would be a certain maximum limit which I believe at present exists for any lorry trading on the public road, at least in respect of width and length.</P>
      <P>I have also mentioned in this House that the availability of modern earth-moving machinery seems to exercise a kind of mesmeric effect over county engineers.  Hills that nobody thought of cutting through suddenly become cuttable.  Corners and obstructions which were physically irremovable heretofore are no longer there.  With the arrival of powerful road-making machinery, that is understandable but we ought to face this fact.  It is much more important to maintain in perfect condition the surfaces of the roads we already have.  I suggest to the House that if you travel from here to Ballina or Sligo, and indeed on certain parts of the roads from here to Cork and Limerick, you will find immense projects in progress for shifting corners, rooting up hills, altering gradients, while the surface of the road is breaking up under the traffic upon it.  It seems to me to be the acme of insanity to allow the surface of the roads to break up while you engage in vast expenditure on improving the contour of the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde referred today to the <i>autobahnen.</i> I inquired into that when I was in Germany recently as to whether the creation of the <i>autobahnen</i><Col N="1637" /> had reduced the number of accidents. I got the rather chilling reply: &ldquo;Yes, the actual number of accidents has been slightly reduced, but they are all fatal now.&rdquo;  I understand the experience in Germany is that, whereas in the past the number of road accidents involved a relatively small minority of fatal cases, now there has been some slight reduction in the total number of accidents on the <i>autobahnen</i> but the fatal element in these accidents has skyrocketed.  That is largely as a result of the increased speeds which the <i>autobahnen</i> make possible, and indeed make obligatory, in order to keep the traffic flowing.  I do not object to improved roads.  To see our roads widened is a most admirable thing.  I am certainly glad to see on the road from here to Sligo, that in a variety of instances what we used to call in the country the &ldquo;long acre&rdquo;, is being incorporated into the road in order to widen it.  But these works should not be promoted at the expense of maintaining the surface of the existing roads.  It ought to be possible to do both, because when you look at the Road Fund figure, you find that in 1957 it was £4,850,000 and in 1961-62, around £7,696,000.</P>
    <P>That is largely because of the transfer of the rail travelling public to the roads in their own cars and lorries. All this additional money should make the task of the Minister relatively easy in providing increased grants for the road-making authorities, and in providing special inducements to them to ensure that a correct and prudent priority in their work will be preserved and that the roads we have will not be allowed to crumble away under the traffic they are carrying, while we build vast new improvements in restricted areas of the existing road system.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the Local Authorities (Works) Act has ceased to function.  I hear Deputies continually deploring the fact that this and that useful work cannot be undertaken because there is nobody charged with the responsibility for doing it.  I recall that in 1955 we provided £300,000 for the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In 1956, we provided £749,000 and in <Col N="1638" /> 1957, £602,000.  For the past three years, we have provided an average of £5,000 a year.  Every rural Deputy knows of the valuable work it was possible for a local authority with an intimate knowledge of their own area to do with the assistance of this Act. The decision to suspend it was a political decision&mdash;a political decision to do away with something the Government's predecessors had established.</P>
    <P>It was a bad political decision.  It has resulted in unemployment of the most undersirable kind, because the Local Authorities (Works) Act used to provide employment primarily for small farmers at periods of the year when they had no other work to occupy them or provide them with an income.  It also enabled local authorities with an intimate knowledge of their own area to do valuable work it would be very difficult for any other authority to undertake.  If the Government would restore the moneys which formerly were made available for this purpose, I believe a very valuable contribution could be made to the resolution of a number of rural problems which at present are being left on the long finger because there is no source of revenue to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I have heard reference made to the housing of the aged.  According to the Minister for Health, we are just about to embark on an immense programme and to spend oceans of money on the rehabilitation of the workhouses.  You can call the county homes whatever you like, but in the minds of the people, they are the workhouses.  I want to renew an appeal I have made in this House repeatedly.  It is a barbarous last resort to take elderly people out of their homes, however humble, and move them 20 or 30 miles from the place they were born and reared and put them in an institution where they never see a friendly face again.</P>
    <P>I know of no more painful tragedy in rural Ireland than to attend at the final crisis of old people's lives, when they are no longer able to look after themselves, when they have, possibly, fallen in the fire and have been salvaged from serious accident.  The neighbours finally say it is no longer <Col N="1639" /> possible to look after them and see that they are properly fed.  They say: &ldquo;We have helped them for a long time but, in conscience, we cannot say it is safe for that old body to be left alone any longer.&rdquo;  Then the ambulance turns up and the old person is carted out and carried away.  Maybe for the first month or so, a couple of neighbours make the pilgrimage to the county home to visit them and comfort them, but in the course of time, they are forgotten.  One of us, perhaps, whose duties, bring us to the local authority institutions calls in there on some other business.  You are passing along a dormitory and some old body speaks to you out of a bed.  Suddenly you remember that that is old Pat So-and-So and, if the truth were told, you thought he was dead.  But he is not dead.  He is lying lonely, thirsting for the sight of a familiar face.</P>
    <P>That is a very tragic thing, and the odd thing is that none of us wants it. I do not believe there is a single person in the House who does not feel with me in the story I seek to tell.  But we suffer from a kind of paralysis. What can you do about it?  I think there is a remedy ready to our hands.</P>
    <P>The queer thing is that our grandfathers and our great grandfathers knew the remedy and applied it, and, if you go down and look at the remedy devised by them operating, it warms your heart and you feel at once that these people knew what they were about. These are the old charities that were established, some of them as far back as the sevententh century.  There is one in Castleblayney; there is another in Armagh.  There are some scattered about all over the country.  They were established by old ladies and gentlemen leaving bequests to endow a row of houses in which there is accommodation of various kinds, usually with a lady superintendent to act as housekeeper and co-ordinate the charities provided.  The people who get into these houses have not only a home but very often a little pocket money as well.  All provide the old person, or the old couple, with a room, some of them with a little flat, in which <Col N="1640" /> they can live to themselves.  Some have not only a little flat for the old couple but also have a communal room to which they can come for meals.</P>
    <P>Recently Guinness built such a charity.  It was opened within the last couple of months.  They have provided not only a little flat but two or three spare rooms as well to which the old people can invite their friends to come and spend a couple of nights on the payment of some modest sum like 5/- or 6/- a night while they are there as guests of the old people. Such a plan has the advantage of not only eliminating the whole horror of isolation which blasts the declining years of so many old people but it gives them an occupation, because, if they have a wise and prudent administrator in the form of an almoner of some kind living in the establishment, she can get the old people to help one another.  They are delighted to do so because it gives them a sense of being wanted.  They are no longer flotsam and jetsam. They are able to help a neighbour.  If one is laid up, a neighbour can come in, help to clean, and make a cup of tea.  They have a purpose in life.  Over and above that, when circumstances will allow them, they can walk down the streets of the village or town where they were born.  They can meet their neighbours and they have some place where they can offer a friend a cup of tea.</P>
    <P>I urge on the Minister there is no greater blessing that could be conferred upon the people of rural Ireland than that of the establishment of what I shall describe, for want of a better word, of local charity to accommodate old people.  Mark you, they need not all be based on the assumption that the old people can afford to pay nothing.  We could have an adaptation of the differential rent system for such establishments.  Certain old persons would not be able to pay anything; other old people would be willing and glad to pay something.  Still others would be able to pay a relatively economic rent for such accommodation.</P>
    <P>Here there is a possibility for an immense benefit to be conferred.  We <Col N="1641" /> would, I hope, gradually eliminate the need for what is known as the county home, having as our county institutions medical and surgical hospitals designed for those sick to the point of requiring hospital treatment.  For the aged and for those in the state to which we all aspire to arrive, decrepitude, for it is only the saints who desire to be gathered to Heaven before their time, there should be the same sense of security that we have in our prime.  The only privilege I bespeak for these people is that they should have the right to die at home.  When I say &ldquo;at home,&rdquo; I mean no more than amongst their friends and that the rest of us should be spared the perennial woe of seeing an old friend carried away in the ambulance in the grim certainty that we will never see him again until he comes back in a hearse.</P>
    <P>That is one of the things I believe every Deputy wants to see done.  Can we not shake off the paralysis which prevents us from doing it and put our hand to the task of eliminating this problem as quickly as we can with the resources at our disposal?  If we start, I do not think we will find it impossible, and countless thousands in succeeding generations will bless the Minister who put his hand to the task.</P>
    <P>I am very much troubled about this whole question of piped water supply. I heard a Deputy from Kerry announce to-day that for a restricted area in Kerry a piped water supply had been formulated, the capital cost of which was £2,500,000.  He went on to say that the rates are already almost £3 in the £ and he foresaw some difficulty in accepting this proposal.  I am, I am quite convinced, as radical as any Deputy, but surely there is some sanity left amongst us.  Does anybody who knows rural Ireland, and the way the houses are situated there, seriously believe that an effective way of bringing water supplies to the houses of rural Ireland is by laying mains along the main roads?  Sixty per cent. of the houses in rural Ireland are within 40 yards of the main road.  I have never heard anyone suggest that you should bring water mains up and down <Col N="1642" /> every boreen in the country.  If we are to build water mains along every main road in Ireland, we will leave a blister on the rates, a blister of very formidable dimensions, as the Deputy from Kerry indicated, and the man who gets the water will be paying for it for the rest of his life, provided the water main and the pipe from it to his house is fully maintained and repaired.</P>
    <P>My experience of water mains in rural Ireland is that, the longer they get, the harder it is to find the leaks. The usual remedy for a chronic leak is to ration water at the time one most wants it because the cost of tearing up miles of country road to find where the leak is daunts the most enterprising county engineer.  It is much easier to say: &ldquo;We will cut the water off from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.  Do the best you can in the intervening period,&rdquo; hoping that the point at which the water is cut off is above the leak, which it very frequently is not, and the only effect of cutting the water off is that the water now goes down the drain, nobody draws any in the houses, and the leak gets bigger because the pressure of the water grows greater.</P>
    <P>Surely we can get a sane approach to this whole business.  We all know there are certain restricted areas where you cannot find a well, owing to the structure of the subsoil.  It is usually a fractionated limestone subsoil, through which the water flows away and wells do not form.  Nobody complains if in those areas the local authority gets a special allowance to provide a water main which will facilitate the supply of water to groups of houses and to areas where otherwise no water would be available, except by carrying it from rivers or by long journeys from adjacent lakes.  But take the country as a whole.  The annual average rainfall is 42 inches and there are large areas in the West of Ireland where the average annual rainfall goes up to 60 inches.  Outside of Bedlam, would anyone propose to lay down on all the roads in all these areas water mains which, according to the calculation of the Deputy from Kerry, are liable to involve a capital cost of £2,500,000 for one very relatively small area covering an area of 25 miles all <Col N="1643" /> around the shortage of supply?  That, in effect, is only the main roads within that 25 mile area.  There are very few parts of Ireland, except the special areas to which I have referred, in which wells cannot be sunk with modern well-sinking machines.</P>
    <P>We have carried electricity into practically every small house and if you have electricity, and a well, your problem is resolved.  A man can then instal a pressure tank in his house with an automatic pressure gauge which operates the pump whenever the water goes below a certain level in the tank.  He has an effective hot and cold water supply, if he wishes to use it, both for his house and for his out-houses and farm buildings, if he wants to extend it, and if he wants to carry water to his fields, there is no difficulty either and with an adaptation, an average supply of water can be made available.  Once that has been done, apart from the cost of the electricity to run it, he has free water for the rest of his days.  There is no question of an annual water rate or any charge of that kind.  If a pipe bursts or if there is a leak, with modern methods it is almost unnecessary to have any underground pipes at all so that the leak can be easily detected and repaired and those problems do not arise at all.</P>
    <P>In most areas, it is possible for a group of farmers to have one pressure tank or gravity feed for their respective houses.  I would urge on the Minister that steps should be taken to bring to their attention, with much greater vigour than has been done heretofore, both the scheme under his Department and that under the Department of Agriculture, so that we may maximise the number of houses providing their own water supply, either for themselves or in colloboration with their neighbours, and that we should not urge or encourage local authorities like the Kerry County Council, which has a rate of almost £3 in £ already, to engage in a capital outlay of £2,500,000 to carry water mains along the main road in a strictly limited area of the county, in the belief that that will go any distance towards solving the problem of providing running <Col N="1644" /> water for the majority of farmers in the county.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters to which I wish to make special reference. One is the provision of swimming pool facilities, not only for rural towns but also for the city of Dublin.  If we want to contribute to the control of juvenile delinquency which, thank God, in this country has not as yet assumed alarming proportions, but it is before it has assumed alarming proportions that a prudent Government will take appropriate steps to ensure it never will&mdash; a necessary step is to provide healthy amusement facilities for young people so as to rescue them from the temptations of delinquency into which they so easily fall in the absence of such amusements.  One of the most desirable and urgent and easily provided amenities are decent swimming baths.</P>
    <P>I know when I was young in this city I used go to the Tara Street baths and to the Iveagh baths in the Coombe.  When I look back now to those distant days of bathing in the Tara Street swimming pool, I recall that they changed the water twice a week.  I always remember that if you went down to the baths on the day they changed the water, you could see the bottom of the pool but if you went down towards the end of the period before they changed the water, you could not see the bottom of the pool. I often look back with admiration both on the excellence of my own health and the valour of youngsters that they went into that water and it did not kill them.  The Iveagh baths changed the water much more frequently and anyway the bath was lined with white tiles but living on the north side of the city, it was not always possible to get to the back of the Castle where the Iveagh baths are.</P>
    <P>Those are the only two pools in the city and they were functioning 40 years ago.  One was provided by the charity of Guinness's Brewery, that is, the clean one, and the other by the diligence of Dublin Corporation, the dirty one.  I do not know what it is like now.  I have not been in it for 35 years.  I have no doubt that it is admirable and that there will be a <Col N="1645" /> loud explosion from Dublin Corporation as a result of my reference, but dirty it was 40 years ago and I can state that on my own personal authority.  I do not know if the Iveagh baths are still in existence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not always easy to get to the sea and anyway we were enthusiasts and swam at a time when you would not go into the sea.  Looking back on that experience, I can see how often a visit to the swimming baths kept me out of mischief when mischief came readily to hand and I now urge on the Minister that better accommodation should be provided for the greatly increased population of Dublin.  I agree that it is probably primarily the function of the local authority to make such provision, but a Minister for Local Government has an over-riding responsibility where there is a general problem to be faced to bring pressure to bear on local authority to live up to their responsibilities and make special provision to provide facilities to help them where there is a very substantial capital sum involved.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Dublin problem could be very much mitigated if measures were taken to make certain stretches of the canals hygienic.  That could easily be done.  We do not all want to swim in tiled swimming baths. If certain sections of the canal were put under proper care and maintenance and the water chlorinated, I believe they would make very excellent and desirable swimming pools for the children of this city.  It is certain that so long as children are children, into the canal they will go and nobody can stop them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it not be much better to face that fact and to take certain stretches of the canal, repair the banks, perhaps cement them, chlorinate the water and make the canal as safe as it is possible to make it for the children <Col N="1646" /> who will bathe in it whether we like it or not?  If you had such stretches of the canal and had a lifeguard attached to them, a number of children who are drowned every year by plunging into the weed-infested canal in its present condition, could be saved; a number of children who are probably made sick by the contaminated water of the canal at the present time could be spared that sickness; and a number of children who will otherwise drift into juvenile delinquency, if they were enrolled in active participation in swimming activities could be protected from such a fate. Therefore, I would press the Minister to urge on local authorities, both in the cities and in rural areas, in small towns, to provide better swimming facilities than are at present available.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to direct the attention of the Minister to this fact which he might discuss with the Minister for Transport and Power, who is responsible for tourist attractions.  Many people have it in their minds that it is ludicrous to consider the establishment of swimming pools at seaside resorts There is no place where swimming pools are more needed: one, they provide facilities for many people who do not care to go into the open sea; and two, in many resorts, the tide flows so far out that for half the day there are no swimming facilities although you are at the seaside.  I there is a good sea-water baths available, the tide can be used to fill it and to empty it twice a day; its maintenance is relatively cheap and it adds enormously to the attractions of the seaside resort which may have every thing except constant access to at adequate sea for swimming.</P>
    <P>Housing is, to my mind, the most important topic which may with propriety be discussed on this Vote and I have dwelt particularly on the scarcity of houses and the presence of the superabundance of luxury hotels and office buildings.  I have dwelt with special feeling on the subject of the housing of the aged, especially the aged poor, but there is one last detail I want to mention.  There is not a Deputy, I believe, who has not in the course of his lifetime come in contact <Col N="1647" /> with the tragedy of a child or children drowned in abandoned quarries.  I know I have had that experience and it is a very grievous one.  Sometimes children slip into the quarries; sometimes, in spite of the vigilance of their parents, they will bathe in these quarries, oblivious of their great depth, and are drowned and then there is the awful sequel.  While everybody hesitates to start dragging the quarry, we all go looking through the countryside for the child whose body, we know well, is in fact drowned in the quarry, until either the poor little body floats or else you steel yourself to the task that you have to look and find where he child really is.</P>
    <P>It seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable stipulation that, if any local authority or persons engaged in mercantile activities open a quarry and make a profit out of it, before they abandon the quarry they should reduce the hole to a minimum depth.  Is that an unreasonable stipulation?  Fifty or 100 years ago, it might have been.  The cost of employing an army of men to shovel stuff down into a deep quarry might have been prohibitive but you can get a bulldozer to do three days' work and there is no quarry in Ireland that you would not fill.  You will not get a smooth, level surface but you can reduce the quarry from a death trap into a sloping declivity which will not collect water 20, 30 or 40 feet below, and from its relatively minor depth adequate drainage could be provided so as to provide that water will not accumulate either as a trap for or a temptation to young people.</P>
    <P>Is there anything revolutionary or unreasonable in the stipulation that the local authority or private enterprise abandoning a quarry shall be under a statutory obligation to fill it up and that regulations shall be made prescribing the maximum depth which they may legally leave after them?  I do not think there is and I suggest to the Minister that he should examine the question forthwith of providing in that sense for the future.</P>
    <P>There remains the problem of the existing abandoned quarries and, if the Minister made up his mind that, <Col N="1648" /> hereafter, that kind of thing would be no longer permitted, then I suggest to him he might with propriety say to local authorities that he would be prepared to provide the not excessive sum necessary to put existing abandoned quarries in a condition of safety and that in off periods, when they were not using their earth-shifting machinery for some other purpose, they would bulldoze quarries into relative safety and, if that involved any serious expense, the Central Fund would make some contribution to the cost.  Upon my word, I believe most local authorities would be able to undertake the job without any serious cost to themselves at all, but, whatever the cost might be, it would not be substantial and it would save the annual recurrence of the kind of tragedies with which all of us during our lifetime have become familiar.</P>
    <P>Every year, on whatever side of the House we are, we find ourselves advocating reform.  Sometimes we grow discouraged but we should not ever grow discouraged.  I have seen reforms enacted in this House which I had been advocating for 20 years.  Perhaps it is a good thing that democratic Parliaments have within themselves a certain reserve conservatism which makes the road of reform arduous and hilly.  I have been talking now for a long time about the protection of the aged and the poor from the final disaster of separation from their homes and friends.  I do not abandon hope that these representations may yet fall on sympathetic ears and, if all I have said during these years some day results in the protection of a few old people from this final catastrophe, then my exertions will not have been in vain.</P>
    <P>I am not very optimistic about the present Minister for Local Government doing anything about this but the Minister for Local Government is a corporation sole.  I hope that shortly I will have a hand in providing a successor in that corporation sole and I guarantee that, if and when I do, something will be done about the problem of the aged poor on whose behalf I have spoken to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There are, needless to <Col N="1649" /> say, quite a lot of difficulties in dealing with the problems of local government, and in any discussions on local government in the national Parliament or at local level, we have a certain amount of conflict.  I do not refer to political conflict.  When we speak on the Estimate for the Department of Local Government, most of us in the course of the debate advocate more and better facilities and amenities for the people for whom the various local authorities are responsible.  We advocate better water supplies, more swimming pools, more houses, better roads and better building grants, but all too seldom do we discuss the problem of who is to pay for them or how they are to be paid for.</P>
      <P>When we seek from the local authorities better facilities and greater amenities &mdash; water supplies, roads, houses&mdash;we always seem to speak on the assumption that the increased moneys should come from the State or, in this case, from the Department of Local Government.  Of course it is inevitable that the Minister and the Government want to insist that the increased costs be paid by the local authorities.  My belief and the belief of my Party is that where amenities are needed and it is decided that they should be provided, we should also face the problem of paying for them.</P>
      <P>We hear complaints from time to time&mdash;or, should I say, year after year &mdash;about increases in the rates.  I would object to any increase in the rates, if I believed they were being mis-spent or wasted, but where I am convinced that an increase in the rates is intended to provide amenities for those who deserve them, I have no objection in the wide earthly world to their being increased.  My belief is that people would have a greater appreciation of the problems of local government if they knew a little more about local government in their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inevitably, there are complaints and critical discussions at the beginning of each financial year on the matter of what the rate is to be and what people will have to pay in rates.  From my experience, it seems to me that people have not got an appreciation of the purposes for which they are paying <Col N="1650" /> rates.  All too seldom are they reminded, or do they remind themselves, that lighting, housing, roads, water supplies, swimming pools and every facet of local government, are paid for out of the rates which are contributed year after year.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that there should be a greater drive by the Minister, with the co-operation of the Minister for Education, to educate our people in civics.  That, too, in my opinion, might do away with a certain amount of vandalism by children and teenagers who have no hesitation in damaging something which they believe is public property.  If they realised it is their own property, they probably would not damage it.  It would be a relatively simple matter for the Minister and the Minister for Education to arrange short weekly classes on civics, at least in the secondary schools, to give young people an appreciation of what local government is, and the value of their own property in their own towns, cities or localities.  They should also be made to understand that when an amenity is provided, improved or extended, the money comes out of their own pockets and the pockets of the people who think those amenities should be provided.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I would not confine such courses of lectures entirely to local government; I suggest that they should also cover what might be described as national civics.  I have had occasion to say before that while we are regarded as a nation with a deep interest in politics and in the political life of our own country, we find&mdash;and especially those of us who are members of Dáil Eireann or local authorities&mdash;that the people know very little about the details of the manner in which the country is run.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider that suggestion.  Already we have in some of our schools half hours devoted to this, that and the other thing.  We have a certain amount of time allocated to the teaching of singing&mdash;which is very good in itself&mdash;and physical exercises, but I believe that when people are concerned about costs and about the size of the rate in their districts, it is time they were educated <Col N="1651" /> in the processes of local government and, indeed, of national government.</P>
    <P>One of the main topics in the discussion on this Estimate in the present circumstances is housing.  I had occasion last year to be very critical of the Minister and the Department generally on the matter of housing. While I think it is right to say this year that I recognise that there seems to be a greater degree of co-operation between the Department and the various local authorities in the matter of house building, I would still say that the Minister and the Government do not seem to regard the problem of housing as of grave importance.</P>
    <P>I can do no better than to quote the example of my own home town. Recently a survey directed by the Minister showed that 278 houses are needed there.  At the rate of progress in house building in Wexford, and in the country generally, I do not know when the housing problem will be solved.  It seems to me that it will not be solved in the next ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, unless there is an acceleration of the housing drive.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that problem is considered to be as serious as it actually is.  I would say lack of houses contributes towards emigration. There are many young married couples &mdash;in some cases, with two or three children&mdash;who cannot find accommodation and who are so distracted by the difficulties of finding suitable housing accommodation that they prefer to emigrate to Great Britain than to live in the very bad conditions in which they are forced to live in present circumstances.  Therefore, special consideration should be given to certain categories who are looking for houses in the various towns and cities throughout the country.  Some provision should be&mdash;possibly there is &mdash;made for newly married couples.  I do not know whether there is at present but some years ago such provision was made in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I believe also there should be some effort&mdash;and I subscribe to what Deputy Dillon said&mdash;to provide accommodation <Col N="1652" /> for old people.  In some local authorities, they have a system of housing whereby they build houses designed merely for old married couples.  I believe that should be encouraged to a greater extent.  These houses could be built at a relatively cheaper cost than the ordinary sized house and would do much to relieve the housing problem for many of our local authorities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what has been done in the past, particularly since 1945, the period which I know.  However, while houses have been provided, in many cases we have tended to destroy the characters of the various towns.  In many of these places, we have just extended housing on the outskirts of the town and there are now very many ugly built-up areas.  There are schemes of 100, 200, 300 and 400 houses and the centre of the town has been allowed to become more or less derelict. I gather the Minister is concerned about that problem but we have towns that appeared to be like shells.  The older houses in the centre of the town have fallen into disrepair, and have been demolished so that there are very many ugly gaps in the centre.</P>
    <P>I say that bearing in mind that the Minister introduced legislation some time ago to provide against that sort of thing and also to provide inducements for the local authorities to correct it.  We should now get away from the idea of enlarging the towns in area.  When big derelict sites in towns are demolished, the Minister should encourage the local authorities to try as best they can to preserve the characters of these old towns and to fill in these derelict sites with new dwellings.</P>
    <P>I raised with the Minister some weeks ago the question of the housing of people who are deemed to be lodgers in local authority houses.  The Minister was good enough to say he was considering the matter but we all know that in most Departments consideration of a problem means that it will be considered for a long time. This is a very urgent problem and it seems to me that a solution is relatively simple.  All of us know that in a corporation house, if a member of the <Col N="1653" /> family gets married and takes his wife in or a girl takes her husband in, they are prevented from getting another corporation house.  Let me put this to the Minister.  Is it not quite natural that a member of a family who is married from a corporation house and who has no other suitable accommodation will decide to stay in his own home until such time as a house is available?  Therefore, where a son or a daughter in a corporation house needs a house, he or she should be eligible to be housed in another corporation house and have applied to that house the full subsidy.  As I said, the Minister said he was giving consideration to this matter and at this stage I would merely urge him to come to a decision as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem of the rents of local authority houses, which many people consider to be far too high.  It is very difficult to know whether there should be a greater contribution by the local authority towards the cost of building a house or a greater contribution by the Minister. In any case, houses are being built and rents are being fixed at a figure which cannot be paid by many of the people who are genuinely seeking houses.  The Minister should discuss at some stage with county managers, city managers and urban managers the question of giving transfers from one corporation house to another where the transferee is prepared to pay a bigger rent to get into a particular locality and thus leave a cheaper house for those who cannot pay the high rent of the newly-constructed houses.</P>
    <P>I know this cannot be done in any haphazard way and that a local authority or a city or county manager could and should not be bothered with giving transfers willy-nilly every day of the week or every week in the year. However, I believe there are many people who are anxious to get transfers and who are willing to pay a higher rent.  If that were allowed in certain cases and in certain conditions, it would leave cheaper houses for those people who could afford to pay what would be regarded as a modest rent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1654" /> The Minister should have another look at this matter of the purchase of cottages in the rural areas.  To my mind, the intending purchasers are not getting justice.  As I understand it, if a cottage dweller applied seven or eight years ago to have a cottage vested in him, he can now be told, after that length of time, that the cottage is vested merely by reason of the fact that he applied, and that the county council now have no responsibility for the further repair of that cottage. Further, if the tenant has any objection to raise in regard to the condition of the cottage he is told he should appeal within 30 days to the Minister who will decide whether or not further repairs are needed.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember whether the change in procedure was effected by legislation or by regulation.  Up to about two years ago, if a person applied to have his cottage vested, the actual purchase was not completed until the tenant signed a document to the effect that he was satisfied with the condition of the cottage.  Now it seems that even though a tenant made application for the purchase of a cottage seven, eight or ten years ago, the county council can, by merely notifying him, deem the cottage to have been purchased and to have been vested in him.  Longer notice should be given to the tenant whose cottage it is proposed to vest so that he can have an opportunity not alone of making an appeal or representations to the Minister, but of making an appeal, some sort of inquiry or representations, to the local authority.  I throw this out as a suggestion to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I believe the county manager in this case should give, say, three months' notice to the members of the county council that it is proposed to vest a certain number of named cottages, so that tenants can have an opportunity of consulting with their local representatives. I do not think that is unreasonable. I do not know whether the Minister has power to direct county managers or local authorities to proceed in that way.  It is possible that the county manager can, by resolution of <Col N="1655" /> the council, decide that that will be done.</P>
    <P>A number of these tenants at the present time feel a shabby trick is being played on them, and I agree. They have the minimum time within which to complain about the condition of the cottages on vesting and to appeal to the Minister, something which many of them are not in a position to do.  The notice that is given to the tenant is on a foolscap page, very closely printed.  It is impossible for many of these people who get these notices to interpret 10 per cent of what is written on them.  Many of them fail to read the small print which tells them they can appeal to the Minister for Local Government within 30 days. Many of them are incapable of writing an appeal anyway and therefore the Minister should try to ensure that managers will give a preliminary list to the members of the local authority, setting out the addresses of cottages which it is proposed to vest after a period of three, four, five or six months.</P>
    <P>Many questions have been raised here, and I am sure the question has also arisen in this debate with regard to what appear to be delays in inspecting premises for which applications have been made for building or reconstruction grants, and in the payment of these grants.  The Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary Question recently, said that there were approximately 50 inspectors in the whole country.  That seems to be quite a number of inspectors, but it appears that it is not enough.  I notice in respect of my area that there are two inspectors who operate in Counties Wicklow and Wexford.  This is a pretty big area and I appreciate it is not possible for these inspectors to go through these two counties as rapidly as the applicants expect, so surely there is a case for the employment of more inspectors?</P>
    <P>There may be difficulties in that respect but I do not know what they are. I can only guess that the position is not sufficiently attractive.  I do not know what the qualifications of these inspectors are but if more inspectors are needed, surely it should not be <Col N="1656" /> beyond the bounds of possibility to make the position attractive and to get sufficient staff, because there is no doubt in the world that there is a building boom of a kind in the country at the present time?  There has been a boom in the matter of reconstruction more than in actual building.  There is a boom in other types of building, whether in the erection of offices or the reconstruction of shops and that sort of thing, but we should endeavour to clear up this business of more house building, repair and reconstruction as quickly as we can.  One way of doing that is to employ more inspectors.  I think the Minister implied in his statement that in order to safeguard employment in building, it was intended to stagger the building of houses over a period of years to ensure continuity of employment.</P>

      <P>I am sorry; I must have taken the Minister up wrongly and, therefore, I must check on the actual statement he made.  While I am as concerned as anybody about employment in the building industry, I think top priority should be given to the building of houses.  Reconstruction of shops and rebuilding of offices is also important but we should give top priority to the building of houses and I would deplore any attempt to string out the building of houses, especially by local authorities.  The job should be tackled as vigorously and as quickly as possible so that we can be clear of this problem for all time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the views of Deputy Dillon on the provision of water supplies in rural areas.  He was not against the provision of water supplies in such areas but queried the type of scheme being provided at the present time.  I welcome the idea of regional water supply schemes.  I think the method in which they are being done is the soundest and most economical method of providing water in rural areas.  The type of water supply scheme Deputy Dillon mentioned may have attractions but I would say it would be far more costly.  A sum of £2,500,000 for a place like Kerry seems <Col N="1657" /> formidable but we should measure against that cost the immense advantages there will be for the people who will avail of the water supply.  As far as my Party and I are concerned, we support the Minister in his approach to the provision of water supplies and will not job at any extra cost there may be, whether the question arises here or at local authority level.</P>
    <P>It does not seem as if we are making much progress in the matter of the provision of swimming pools or swimming baths.  Local authorities do not appear keen to provide the extra money.  It is possible they expect much more by way of financial assistance from the Minister but I think these swimming pools might be provided in various other ways than by direct contribution from local rates, helped by subvention from the Minister.  I know at least two places where it was found possible to lay down swimming baths as part of winter relief schemes.  Other swimming pools have been built with grants from Bord Fáilte, and these projects have been very successful.</P>
    <P>I often wonder which Minister should be responsible for sport development and physical culture generally. Nobody in any Government has seemed to accept responsibility for the promotion of sport and physical development here.  Some people have suggested that it ought to be the Minister for Education, others the Minister for Local Government, and other Ministers in various Governments have been mentioned from time to time.  As far as this country is concerned, we could very well place much more emphasis on sport.  The Minister has shown his interest in one sport, that of swimming.  I think he should be prepared, and the Government should allow him, to go a little further and to take responsibility for all types of sport.  We could gain tremendous advantages, if we made an all-out drive to make sport generally more popular in the country.  It could be one of the best ways of advertising the country.  Immediately I think of a country like, say, Australia, whilst some people may think of kangaroos and sheep, I think of sport.  We are <Col N="1658" /> concerned about selling Ireland from the point of view of tourism.  One of the greatest advertising mediums the Australian nation has is its prowess in sport.</P>
    <P>The President of the United States of America has recently expressed concern about the lack of physical development and the damage to physical development in the United States of America.  We could well follow his example here.  I think the Minister for Local Government or some other Minister might be charged with the responsibility for sport generally.  It would be a very good thing for this country.  I believe it would be one of the best advertising mediums we could adopt.</P>
    <P>I merely want to mention the question of roads.  I do not want to dwell too long on the subject.  Has the Minister caused any new investigation into the damage done to our roads by heavy transport?  Has he considered the damage which road machinery itself does on the roads?  I have two examples in County Wexford.  I can quote one example where about two miles of road were to be constructed. Those two miles of road were constructed in a pretty good way but the unfortunate thing is that the materials were drawn from a distance of about ten miles and the transport employed in carrying the materials to this road did irreparable damage to the ten miles from the quarry to the road.</P>
    <P>There is another similar example where a mile of road was being reconstructed or repaired and the CIE lorries, the Roadstone lorries or some other lorries of that type engaged in the transportation of the materials from a quarry ten miles away destroyed the roads for that distance.  I know that is a problem and it is difficult to know what the solution is, but there is in the recent Traffic Act passed by this House provision which ensures that where such damage was done, the local authority can be compensated by the company owning the trucks or lorries which did the damage.  I believe that there is a tremendous amount of damage being done on the roads and the Minister should be prepared to enforce that <Col N="1659" /> provision.  I say that bearing in mind that many of the roads were not constructed originally to bear the type of traffic on them now.  It is a real problem and one the Minister should tackle as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>As far as co-operation in the matter of house building is concerned, there is an improvement.  It seems to me that the Department are prepared to give a little more latitude, a little more autonomy, to the local authorities in the building of houses.  For that I am grateful.  I would ask the Minister to treat the problem of providing houses for our people as one of national emergency.  He should get on with the job and try to have the problem of the lack of houses solved as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>There are still many people in my constituency anxiously waiting to see what the Minister intends to do about providing houses for many people who are unable to provide houses for themselves. On two occasions, circulars have come down from the Department asking that a survey be made in Leitrim.  On both occasions, the survey was carried out.  On the last occasion, I think that almost 1,000 houses in my county were found to be unfit for human habitation.  In the majority of these cases, the Minister can take it for certain that those people are not able to provide houses for themselves.  I would earnestly appeal to him to try to make a start and ensure these homes will be provided.</P>
      <P>I would also suggest that the grants both for reconstruction and for new houses be increased.  While the last Housing Act passed by this Dáil did something, nevertheless, it still did not give any increases to the people in the carrying out of the work.  The cost of labour has increased considerably; the cost of materials has increased considerably; but the grant has not increased.  Many people are reluctant to start a housing scheme or to do any work, due to the fact that the grant is not at all in keeping with the amount of money involved in the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1660" /> Other Deputies made reference to delays in payment of grants.  Many people have to contact a county councillor or T.D. when the job is finished. It is a pity that we as representatives should receive a letter from somebody telling us that a job was finished six months and yet he has got no money. I would ask the Minister to check up on that.  When a report comes in that the job is finished, the money should be paid because, after that, a certificate has to go to the county council and it is a considerable time before the people are given the money due to them.</P>
    <P>Again, we must consider the problem facing newly-married couples all over the country.  Every time I go into Sligo town or any of the towns in my constituency, I am approached by people who ask me if I can do anything for them with regard to getting a house.  This is particularly the case in respect of Sligo which has a population of between 12,000 and 14,000. There are many young people there who find themselves with their in-laws. They will always tell you they would be far more content if they had a home of their own.  The Minister should carefully examine the housing problem in respect of those people as well as the people who are not able to provide homes of their own.</P>
    <P>What happens when these people discover they are not able to get a house in any town or even in the rural areas?  The only decision they can come to is to emigrate.  Once these people settle in a city outside Ireland, they take their children with them and that is the end of it.  That is very serious for this country.  When people are prepared to settle down and build a home here, every possible effort should be made to provide them with a home.  As a public representative, I meet very many such people anxious to get a home and unable to do so.</P>
    <P>Occasionally we see big write-ups about great hotels and other great concerns being built here to cater for people who may come here between the months of May and September. The tourist industry is a great asset to the country but I have never regarded it as compensation for the export of <Col N="1661" /> 30,000 people, or perhaps 35,000 in some years.  We should consider those people first.  If they leave, they will not be induced to come back by inviting other people to come in and spend a few months here, with a big car and living in luxury hotels.  The majority of them never go anywhere else and the average business person does not benefit very much by them.  I visited four licensed premises in a town one morning and asked them did the tourists mean anything to them.  The answer I got was that they meant practically nothing.  By chance, they might come in and buy something, but otherwise it meant no extra business.  Far more emphasis should be placed on the problem of providing houses for young married couples and others needing houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also referred to this problem.  I was recently asked to get an unfortunate person into hospital, a chronic case, not a patient for a surgical hospital.  The only place left for her was the Nazareth Home or the county home.  I went to both and they were packed to the doors.  There was not a hope of getting her even into the county home.  After great effort by the county home matron, she succeeded in getting a place for this patient in another hospital in the county.  That is the situation we have when old people find themselves on their own.  They have no alternative but the county home.  The sooner a scheme such as that suggested by Deputy Dillon is prepared, the better for the country. The county home in Sligo is packed with those old people.</P>
    <P>Recently, I put down a Question about road traffic asking to have speed limits applied.  Even since then, we have had two fatal accidents in Sligo town.  One person was killed on a Friday evening and another on the Monday.  Accidents are not entirely due to speed in some cases but are often due to the lighting system.  I appeal to the Minister to see that the lighting system is improved, wherever local authorities or the people make that request.  Bad lighting can be very misleading to a motorist driving near or under it.</P>
    <P>We have some very elaborate road <Col N="1662" /> schemes nowadays in my county and there is no lack of heavy machinery there.  Every time heavy machinery comes in, it means that an enormous amount of the money granted for the scheme will go on machinery, with the result that unfortunate fellows, who are waiting until the grant arrives, discover that the scheme is cut short and they get very little out of it.  The mechanical shovel is brought in which cuts out about seven men and the lorries ply back and forth and the whole scheme goes through very quickly.  While we know it is up to the Minister to get the best possible results out of the amount of money available, it should be remembered that the money could be more evenly divided and not so much spent on machinery. If we put the money spent on machinery against manpower, it might be of greater benefit to the country in the long run not to have so much machinery.</P>
    <P>Nowadays we have plans for major road schemes and the old system has changed.  We are going off the present roads and going across fields.  Such schemes involve a tremendous cost and seeing we have so many by-roads unfit for traffic, it is rather a pity so much money is being spent on the main roads while the county roads are often neglected.  I have asked before, and I ask again, that more money be allocated to county roads in County Leitrim instead of main roads.</P>
    <P>Drainage is another problem in my constituency.  No drainage is being carried out except what is done under rural improvement schemes.  Many rivers are causing heavy destruction and people naturally appeal to the councillors and Deputies to see what can be done.  The only answer we can give is that there is nothing we can do, that there is no money available for this work and that they must suffer on.  It is very sad that for years and years we have had drainage in Leitrim and Sligo but now we have reached the stage when except, as in the case of the river&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Recently I was invited to a number of meetings to see what could be done about drainage and we could not see any prospect of drainage being done other than under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of housing by local authorities, we come to the problem of differential rents. The whole history of that system should be examined in the light of the facts.  It was not originally the intention of local authorities to become landlords.  It was not their duty.  I am not saying they should not have done it but the responsibility was pushed on to local authorities to provide houses for the people.  The situation arose, when costs became so high that people who had accepted this responsibility in the past found they were being priced out of the market by the increased cost of raw materials for building and local authorities have had to accept responsibility for housing the people.  As a result, the rates have to be increased to meet the enormous cost of building.  One has only to examine the estimates each year to see the extent of the increases under that heading alone.  There is a greater responsibility on the State to house the people.  Goodness knows, enough responsibilities are piled on us over the years.  Gradually, they have been pushed over.  It has come to be accepted that we are solely responsible for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say he gives a certain amount.  I feel that the actual <Col N="1664" /> percentage I have here at the moment is not great enough to meet the increase in rates that the people have to face.  Hence you have the bringing in of differential rents to alleviate distress. Still, the responsibility is on the local authority to make up the difference that the people cannot meet.  It all boils down to the fact that it is not the ratepayer who should meet this cost but the taxpayer.  Maybe it is the one person who does all.  I think there is a bigger purse when it comes to looking at what they have collected in taxation in this country than at what the ordinary ratepayer puts to the credit of the local authority.</P>
    <P>I had a chat with a fireman on one occasion about chimney fires.  A lot of the trouble is caused by a type of flue liner that we use.  I think it is a concrete type of flue liner that cracks easily and causes obstruction in the chimney.  The Department should look into that matter and, when drawing up specifications, ensure that that type of flue liner is omitted.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also look into the question of expediting the takingover of certain lands in our area.  I appeal to him to have the question of arbitration in that connection settled. The demand for housing in Galway at the moment reaches a figure of over 250.  Not all may be really bad cases but at least 75 per cent of the applicants are entitled to immediate consideration. By the time houses are provided for them, the other 25 per cent, plus other applicants, will make that list very formidable.  Industries in Galway are creating a demand for housing.  The Minister should do what he can to expedite the land arbitration aspect of the problem in our area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney) Neil T. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Blaney)</NameTxt>
      <P>So very much has been said by so many people, not always about the same thing, but, even when about the same thing, in different ways, that it seems almost impossible to reply fully and adequately to every point raised.  So, if there are, as I am sure there will be, some Deputies who feel that the matters raised by them have not been answered or dealt with, it will be due to oversight on my part. <Col N="1665" /> If they want a further elaboration later, I shall be quite prepared to give it to them, either verbally or in writing, if any matters are left out about which any of them are particularly concerned.</P>
      <P>Early on in the debate, reference was made to the matter which was mentioned in my speech on this Estimate. Attention was drawn to the fact that the total indebtedness of local authorities was reckoned to be somewhere over £150,000,000.  That figure is a large figure, I agree, but no elaboration was made on the build up of the indebtedness or on who, in fact, is carrying the greater part of that indebtedness.</P>
      <P>It has been put to the House that the bold figure of £150,000,000 is so formidable that it is one very big reason why we should be very careful about any further advance in spending by local authorities.  The fact of the matter is that that is the gross figure of indebtedness.  It has not taken any account of the subsidies repayable and payable over the years.  It has not taken account of loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts which are outstanding and which, in fact, are the indebtedness of thousands of individuals throughout the country in respect of houses which they have built.  Neither does it take into account the very substantial number of millions of pounds that will, in the normal course of events, accrue to the coffers of local authorities by way of rents on their own house property.</P>
      <P>Taking those as the main heads that are not mentioned, and adding them all together, they go to make up a fairly substantial figure and really to bring about a situation wherein the actual net indebtedness of local authorities is less than one-third of the gross figure of £150,000,000. Indeed, the overall figure is somewhere in the region of £43,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that I might also say that the property owned by local authorities and the services they have provided over the years cannot be regarded as useless and valueless.  If we regard the net indebtedness of the local authorities against the real assets of the local authorities&mdash;against services <Col N="1666" /> of various kinds, including roads, water and sewerage, various public buildings, and so on&mdash;I think we shall find, on a fair examination, that these local authorities are not in the dire financial straits that the figure of £150,000,000 would first indicate and that, over all, they could be said to be very solvent.  I should just like to clarify that position, lest the big figure that has been mentioned should be taken at its face value and thereby possibly inhibit the local authorities from continuing the good work they have been doing down through the years in the service of their local communities.</P>
    <P>Another matter discussed and an assertion made was that the rates system as it now operates should be asked to contribute only according to the ability of the ratepayers to pay. It was also stated that the rates burden presses especially on people with small farms who have dependants to support. What seems to be disregarded, when we talk about the rates burden falling on any or all categories of people throughout the country, seems to be that when rates are discussed in this light only the case against paying any rates is made.  No credit whatever is taken for the fact that there is no ratepayer in this country, no matter what category he or she belongs to, who is not getting from the local authority and through various State-aided local authority schemes and services, very substantial benefits under all heads, under so many heads that I shall not even enumerate them.  If these services were calculated on their worth to each individual ratepayer, I do not think it could be said that any ratepayer, no matter how heavily burdened with rates, was getting bad value for his money.</P>
    <P>It is in this context we should look at the question of the payment of rates. Rates are not a hand-out by the ratepayer to the local authority of money to be spent on matters which do not affect him.  This money, with a large supplement from central funds, is being spent to provide for that ratepayer, and every other ratepayer, the services they are insisting on having. In the vast majority of cases, very good <Col N="1667" /> value is being given in the public services provided out of rates moneys.</P>
    <P>We have had a demand that central government should bear more of the burden of providing these services, as well as additional services.  The position is that the State is continuing to bear an increasing share of the load of financing local authorities.  In the past, local authorities paid a higher percentage of the total cost, but now the position is reversed and central funds are paying the higher share. During the current year, 43 per cent of local authority expenditure under all heads is being provided by the Exchequer, while only&mdash;I do not use the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in any critical sense here&mdash;34 per cent is paid out of the rates.  The balance comes from the various revenues to local authorities by way of rents and other charges. There we have an indication of the trend.  What is being called for is already taking place, and the State is continuing to bear an increased proportion of the cost.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick talked about the extraordinary high rates in the western counties.  I know the rates there are high when you consider merely the amounts levied; but the agricultural grant goes to abate the farmers' rates in respect of agricultural land in the western counties and in general, they do better under that than counties elsewhere.  In Deputy Blowick's county, over 90 per cent of all holdings are £20 or under in valuation.  Therefore, the increase in the rebate from 60 per cent to 70 per cent applies in 90 per cent of the cases in Mayo and leaves the smaller portion of the land rates to be paid by the actual land-holder.  That is not only the case in Mayo but is typical of the general pattern of land holding in the West.</P>
    <P>The grant of £2,000 to An Comhairle Leabharlanna has been criticised as inadequate and unrealistic.  This figure is put in this year to assist, by way of subsidy towards loan charges, certain capital projects in our libraries carried out with the approval and guidance of An Comhairle Leabharlanna. This is a follow-up to the <Col N="1668" /> regulations made in 1961 which instituted such a subsidised system by which we hope to expand our library services throughout the country.  It was to be expected that during 1962, the year after the regulations were made, the demand would be relatively small. Schemes cannot yet have reached the point where the demand for money would reach any great amount.  If it should happen that the happy situation be reached that more money is found to be necessary, I do not think there would be any great difficulty in finding additional funds for this very useful service.  It should not be taken that our appreciation of the library service amounts to a mere £2,000.  This is merely a beginning of the scheme and the £2,000 is simply our estimate of what the demands will be during the current year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen made a plea for adequate community facilities, such as shops, schools, and recreation facilities, in our new housing areas.  I do not intend to deal with this matter now because one of the fundamental objects of the new Planning and Development Bill, which we shall be discussing in detail at a later stage, is the provision of proper and adequate facilities of all kinds in our housing estates and built-up areas.  Therefore, I shall leave that matter for the moment.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy also referred to the need for doing something about derelict property in the Smithfield, Queen Street, North King Street and Church Street areas.  We had two compulsory purchase orders relating to the acquisition of property in North King Street, Coleraine Street, Constitution Hill and Church Street.  These compulsory purchase orders have been confirmed.  I should add for the Deputy's information that no other proposals are before my Department at present for the compulsory acquisition of land in the areas mentioned for housing purposes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry, Deputy Tully in particular, and other Deputies mentioned the long drawn out period between the drawing board stage, as it were, of a housing scheme and the completion of the scheme.  That is unfortunately all too true in many cases, but these <Col N="1669" /> delays cannot be laid at the door of the Department of Local Government. All too many delays are caused by inadequate documentation on the part of local authorities in their submissions. Such absence of adequate documentation is a matter for the local authorities themselves to remedy and members of this House, who are also members of local authorities, should ensure proper documentation at their own level, rather than advocate that the Minister and his Department should be standing by all the time to try to avoid delays being made by others at the local level.  I suggest a very strict note should be taken of where delays are occurring.  Some delays are unavoidable.  Some are avoidable and would be avoided, were it not for the negligence, carelessness and &ldquo;couldn't-care-less&rdquo; attitude on the part of some dealing with these matters at local level.</P>
    <P>All aspects of housing have been raised in this debate.  We had the statement made by a Dublin Fine Gael Deputy that the Dublin County Council finds itself faced with a problem. We had the statement that the Dublin County Council has done everything possible to build all the houses needed and matters have now reached such a pitch that the Minister should instruct the county manager and the county engineer in cases where, according to Deputy Clinton, they have failed to do their part.</P>
    <P>To me, this is confused thinking in regard to the role of local authorities <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department because other speakers on that side of the House have indicated that interference by the Department with the local authorities, the managers and engineers is something to be deplored and that we should, in fact, keep our hands off that which appertains to the local authority.  But we have Deputy Clinton now advocating that the only way out, as far as progress in housing in County Dublin is concerned, is for the Minister to instruct the county manager and the county engineer to get on with the building of houses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton is a member of this House.  He has been a member of a local authority for the last seven years. <Col N="1670" /> It amazes me that he should suggest now that that is the way in which a local authority should be got to do its job.  If it is merely a question of ordering the manager, then the order should come from the council.  I am taking the case made here by the Deputy and, if his case is true, then it is the county council which should apply the necessary spur to the manager and the county engineer.  Both are employees of the county council. They are not employed by the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by the Leader of the Opposition, and others who followed him, that we are neglecting housing and concentrating unnecessarily on the bulding of luxury hotels and unessential office accommodation.  It is alleged money is being utilised for these rather wasteful purposes to the detriment of ordinary housing throughout the country.  I absolutely refute the suggestion that there is any question of housing being held up in any local authority for lack of money. I go further: I challenge any local authority to produce evidence that it is retarded in its building programme for lack of money.  I know that, in that challenge, we will find the true answer because no one will come forwsard to prove the case; in that way we will refute the wild and extravagant allegations made by the Leader of the Opposition in this matter.</P>

      <P>That interruption reminds me of Deputy Donegan's contribution to this debate.  I was not listening to him personally and, if I should misinterpret what he said, I will take any correction he may wish to make.  It is true, I think, that Deputy Donegan did mention that during the present Government's and a past Government's term in office, a certain trend was dictated because of non-availability of money for house-building and the housebuilding programme was trimmed; I think that was the word used.  The suggestion was that this Administration and a past Administration had ways and means of <Col N="1671" /> trimming housebuilding programmes by local authorities.</P>

      <P>I assert now that no such trimming process has been perpetrated since I went into the Department of Local Government.  Taking Deputy Donegan at his word, he would be talking with more authority about the past Administration, of which he was a supporter.  His suggestion is that a past Administration did, in fact, trim the housing programme to keep it in line with the money available.</P>

By the look of things, I do not think there is any danger that we will be called upon to try any manipulation similar to that of which a previous Administration was guilty.  It is a fact&mdash;this is proved not only by Deputy Donegan's admission but by others here on both sides of this House&mdash;that there was during a past Administration not only trimming but an absolute suppression of public works by local authorities in 1956.</P>

      <P>In 1956, the Minister for Finance ensured, through the Minister for Local Government, that local authorities throughout the country were instructed to certain effect.  If Deputies opposite want to deny that it may be because they do not know of it, but I am telling them that that is what happened and, if they do not know the facts, they can get them from the two personages I mentioned who are available to them to consult at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us have less talk about trimming <Col N="1672" /> of the housing programme and local authority schemes by the present Administration.  There has been no trimming; there has been no pressure; there has been no diversion.  No leads have been given or orders made by the Minister or the Department of Local Government to slow down any house-building programme.  There has been no slowing down, by orders or otherwise, of the Minister for Local Government of water schemes or sewerage programmes.  There has, on the other hand, been evidence that we are making every effort to induce and encourage local authorities to expand programmes under these heads.  Any expansion that takes place is welcomed by us and our co-operation is immediately available, without question, to those who propose to go in that direction.</P>
    <P>The old, old story has even at this stage been raised again in regard to house-building.  The record of this Administration compared with the last has been trotted out by a number of Deputies, not the least of whom was the Leader of the Opposition today.  I had hoped that we could leave this matter on the records of the House, as it has been discussed and debated from both sides for the past four or five years and left there for those who wish to read it and come to their own conclusions.  However, that is not the wish of the Opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who is still feeling sore and is still smarting from the predicament he and his Government found themselves in in 1956. He is still sore about the deplorable situation into which they led themselves in those years and he can never get on his feet without trying to cloud the issue so that the people may be misled, if not blinded, into the belief that in fact the happenings in 1956&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The final proof is that from September, 1956 until the advent of a Fianna Fáil Government in 1957 the suppression had taken effect to the extent that £3,000,000 worth of public schemes, housing, water and sewerage schemes, were lying awaiting sanction by the Minister for Local Government on the orders of his Government. There is the proof of the pudding&mdash;the eating of it.  It was more than the eating of it and in February and March of those years we had to eat it.</P>

      <P>The figures referred to by the Deputy show that in the last year in which Fianna Fáil were in office in the 1951-54 period, £11,000,000 approximately was spent on housing.  His figures also showed that in the years that followed, for the three years of the Coalition's term of office, the figure had fallen to £6,000,000.  The Deputy does not agree with that.  He does not agree that any trend is indicated there.  He does not, of course, agree with anything, unless it suits his book.  That is his own book according to his speech last night.  If those figures are not an indication of what was coming, nothing is, and I am not using any figures other than those for this particular argument.  In fact, I do not want any argument about it because it has been so well said so many times that nothing more need be said.</P>

      <P>Deputy Treacy referred to local authorities neglecting their own houses.  This is a matter of very grave concern to us all, whether or not we are members of a local authority, but particularly if we are members of a local authority.  I am not saying they are neglecting their own houses but it may be that, in a great many cases, they are neglecting them.  If that is so, I would say to Deputies who are members of local authorities and to members of local authorities who are not in this House that it is a very serious situation that the moneys that have been hard to come by, that have been subscribed over the years in the housing drive, which is a credit to the country, should be allowed to go to waste because local authorities are not preserving the houses.  It is deplorable and a scandal if that should be the case to any great degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask Deputies who are members of local authorities to consider the situation in their local authority areas and, if evidence of what Deputy Treacy says exists in any of these areas, to take the strongest possible action.  It is nothing short of criminal that houses that have been provided out of public funds should be allowed by local authorities, while in their possession, to fall into decay or disrepair to the point that they will have to be replaced, at even greater cost, not to mention the hardship and damage which may be caused to the tenants who are compelled to live in them at this date.  I make that plea to members of the House to take grave note of the situation and to take active steps in their own councils to ensure <Col N="1676" /> that such a practice is not allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>May I assure the Minister that I did not exaggerate in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the Deputy did.  I am merely saying that, if what the Deputy says is the case, and I am not inclined to disbelieve that it may be, I would ask all Deputies to take note of it and to take action in their local authorities to stop this waste of our housing stock, so dearly provided by all of us over the years.</P>
      <P>There is another matter that has been raised by very many Deputies. I shall not try to name the Deputies, so numerous were the references.  It is the question of repairs to cottages that are vested and the suggestion that local authorities will not repair cottages or houses, unless or until a tenant begins to purchase a house. That is a wrong, wasteful, extravagant approach, which should not be condoned. It is not the Minister who must insist on local authorities looking after these things.  It is for members of local authorities to bring pressure to bear, where necessary, in their own authorities to ensure that repairs are carried out, not only where application for vesting has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the complaints in regard to conditions for vesting. Numerous complaints have been made during the debate that there is something wrong, that repairs are not properly done, that the houses are handed over in a state in which they should not be handed over.  The Act of 1954 brought about the change to the present system under which an application by a tenant for the vesting of a cottage brings into train a series of conditions, one of which is that the cottage should be put in a proper state of repair.  If the applicant for vesting is not satisfied with the cottage in the state it is in, or after it has been repaired by the local authority, there is provision for an appeal to the Minister for Local Government.  Such appeals have been coming in in numbers which would indicate that there is a good deal in what is being <Col N="1677" /> said about the poor state of repair of some cottages.</P>
    <P>There are too many appeals coming in.  That is the way I feel about it. It does not prove anything in particular but it does suggest to me that there is some foundation for the allegation that these cottages are not being put into a proper state of repair.  The number of appeals which are successful in having further repairs carried out is such a high proportion of the total number that I am further convinced that there is not the care being taken in carrying out repairs which there should be, which the law calls for for the purpose of vesting.</P>
    <P>I shall give the figures: cottages vested, 4,956; appeals received, 1,191; appeals determined to require repair, 687.  Of the 1,191 appeals that have been made, the total determined to date is 896.  Of those 896, the number of cases determined to require repairs was 687, or 76.6 per cent.  That figure, taken in conjunction with the number of appeals that have come in over the years, creates the impression that not enough care is being given to the condition about repair and state of repair of cottages under the vesting procedure.</P>
    <P>The argument has been used that the system appears to have been changed.  It has been changed since 1954.  The procedure, prior to 1954, was that the cottage had to be put in a proper state of repair before vesting.  That brought about the situation which, to my personal knowledge occurred in my county, that applicants for vesting kept prodding the local authority to do this, that and the other work on the cottage and, when the cottage was completely repaired, refused to vest.  That was the reason for the change in the 1954 statute, under which the procedure is that the cottage should be put in a proper state of repair and an applicant who is not satisfied with the repair may appeal within 30 days and subsequently the Minister's determination of the appeal will indicate whether further repairs are necessary; but, when these further repairs are carried out, the cottage is finally in the possession of the occupant and cannot <Col N="1678" /> be got rid of.  He cannot say the day after: &ldquo;I do not want it; I would prefer to rent it.&rdquo; It is for that reason the change was made, as Deputies who remember the old situation will agree.</P>
    <P>That is a general picture of the vesting procedure at the moment.  I regard the suggestions made here that cottages generally are not kept in repair as a very serious matter.  It is not a case of my shedding my responsibility.  It is not my responsibility. It is the responsibility of the elected members of local authorities and I would appeal to them, in the interests of their local authorities and of the country generally, to consider this allegation of neglect of our housing stock in the ownership of local authorities and not let the position deteriorate further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subject to check, I think that is statutory and any change would have to be by way of amendment of legislation.  There is one thing I would say, that the form of the order which the applicant gets from the local authority is something I will consider. I do not know at this stage whether this form is uniform or whether it is printed or typed in the same manner in every county.  If it seems that more emphasis should be given to the part which indicates that an appeal is possible within 30 days&mdash;that little bit which is alleged to be in such small writing that many people do not see it&mdash;then we may be able to take steps to have the writing enlarged to such a degree that they cannot fail to see it.  That at least would eliminate complaints that they did not know they could appeal, or that they did not know it was within 30 days they had to appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jones mentioned that man to man talks between the local authorities and the central Government officials would be of great benefit.  I would say that is not an unknown practice or procedure, and I think during my time in the Department, we <Col N="1679" /> have even further extended that practice, with a view to cutting down time-wasting in letter writing, and possibly time-wasting details that may have occured through correspondence being dragged out for months about something which, as the Deputy said, could be settled in five minutes by the two appropriate officials having a word about it, whether on the technical or administrative side.  That is a procedure from which we are not at all adverse and which we have been putting into operation to an increasing degree as time goes on, and one which we will be utilising whenever and wherever it seems appropriate, necessary and useful to do so.</P>
    <P>Figures have been used here by a number of Deputies, which have emerged from the housing survey the local authorities were requested by me to undertake over the past couple of years.  First, I should say that figures have been quoted here which I think in most cases are the total number of unfit houses in a particular authority according to the survey.  The total number of unfit houses should not be confused with what is regarded as the number of houses requiring to be provided by a local authority or which a local authority have a duty to provide.</P>
    <P>These unfit houses in the survey as first gathered and garnered through the local authorities includes all the unfit houses in the territory.  No matter who owns them, or how well off the owner or occupier may be, they are all listed.  As I say, not minimising the problem the survey throws up, at the same time, it is only fair to draw the attention of the House to the fact that many of the figures which were used include all unfit and irreparable houses, irrespective of whether or not it is the duty of the local authority to provide housing for the occupants.  In many cases, it is not the duty of the local authority and the figures are rather exaggerated if looked at in the light in which they have been unwittingly looked at by several Deputies.</P>
    <P>No doubt, the survey result surprised many people but on the other hand, I think it is something which many of <Col N="1680" /> us expected, particularly those of us from rural Ireland who, because of the area in which we live, travel through the greater part of rural Ireland quite frequently.  The survey result has not surprised those of us in that category because we rather expected to find that there is a considerable job yet to be done in rural Ireland in the provision of good houses to replace unfit houses, whether they be replaced by private persons for their own use, or by a public authority for the occupancy and use of those tenants for whom it is the duty of the local authority to provide houses.</P>
    <P>There is a substantial problem there and, as I say, while it has surprised some, it has not surprised me.  The only thing I would say is that many of the people who have talked here and have mentioned these surveys have quoted figures that show all the needs in their county.  In fact, I have been checking them and I find that they have submitted returns of surveys which have not got to my Department yet, despite the fact that two years have gone by, that several reminders have been sent, and that the local authorities have a statutory duty to check their housing needs annually.  I have been amazed to find figures quoted from surveys that have not yet reached my Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>From many of the local authorities which have not yet sent in the complete figures.  That applies in greater part to county health districts rather than to urban or builtup areas where the job of surveying unfit houses is much easier than it is where you have to go out through the highways and the byways to find out the number of unfit houses in existence. That is not an easy job but it is necessary, if we are to see the problem. We must get the real figures <Col N="1681" /> before we can sit down and see where the problem is, and what impression we are making on it, whether or not the facilities available to the local authorities or to the public for private building are sufficient to liquidate the problem in time, or whether or not new and additional facilities may have to be devised.</P>
      <P>That has been and is one of the matters which is engaging the attention of the Department.  These figures were absolutely vital.  Even in the incomplete form in which we got them from many counties, they still show the pattern or picture which is necessary if we are to consider the problem in its true and full light.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch from Waterford talked about the standard of road behaviour being bad.  I do not think anyone would attempt to contradict that assertion.  It is not only bad but in many cases it is a scandal.  Any of us who travel the roads within the cities or anywhere in the country must realise that all the laws we make here and all the talking we do here are having little, if any, good <Col N="1682" /> effect on the road behaviour of our road users.  There are undoubtedly good, courteous and considerate drivers, but there are blackguardly drivers on the roads and their numbers seem to be increasing, or else they are travelling more than they did in the past and we see more of them on the roads.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that that relatively small percentage&mdash;but nevertheless very dangerous and effective percent-age&mdash;of road users, and particularly drivers of vehicles, are behaving in a most outrageous, not to mention dangerous manner.  Their behaviour is causing the toll of fatalities that inevitably follows in the train of that type of behaviour.  I would appeal to the public as I have done on many other occasions, and I would particularly appeal to members of the House to make their appeals on every possible occasion to the public in general, to try to keep in mind that consideration and courtesy is by far the greater part of the answer to our road problems and the fatalities that have been taking place.</P>
    <P>Laws alone, driving tests and all the rest that are foreshadowed in our traffic laws will not of themselves be of the slightest avail if we do not have a greater awareness on the part of the public that consideration and courtesy come first.  With the exercise of greater consideration for other road users, a great change could be made in the sad history of accidents and fatalities that are too often taking place on our roads.  I would ask the members of the House to use the various occasions on which they get the opportunity to bring home to all of our people, whether they be cyclists, pedestrains or vehicle drivers, that they should have consideration for other road users.  In courtesy and consideration lies the greater part of the answer to this problem of deaths on our roads which shows no sign of abating.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry mentioned the montrous growth of street furniture and what he described as footpath forests and put the spotlight on the ESB for their misdemeanours in this regard.  I cannot disagree with the Deputy in this matter but I would point out that <Col N="1683" /> we have a demand for more and more signs of all descriptions.  With the need for safety measures and precautions, new and additional signs must be erected.  While many of these signs are essential, it is possible that an improvement in their design could be effected.  Whether or not we shall effect such an improvement in design, not only in road signs but other types of signs that are regarded as a necessary part of our present way of living, I cannot tell the Deputy or the House. However, I do agree with the Deputy in his complaint about the matter.  If there is anything that can be done and if there is any suggestion anybody has to make as to how road signs and other signs can be improved in design and look less ugly than many of them do at the moment, I shall certainly, as far as my capacity as Minister for Local Government goes, give consideration to any proposals of that nature.</P>
    <P>More can and will be said on this matter in the planning Bill debate. Deputy Sherwin mentioned a stop sign at Lisburn Street that cannot be seen particularly at night.  The fact that signs are prescribed by regulation by the Minister for Local Government does bring about&mdash;whatever may be said about it from the point of view of design&mdash;a sign that normally should be seen at quite a distance, and particularly at night by car drivers.  By virtue of its shape, dimension and reflectorisation, there should be no necessity for anyone to complain that it cannot be seen.  It may well be that the placing of the sign is wrong and that the view is obstructed by something else.  It is something which can easily be found out and, if there is anything wrong, we can take the necessary steps to rectify it.</P>
    <P>Many contributions have been made here today and the last day we had this debate in relation to roads and different aspects of road building. Various criticisms were made of the manner in which road moneys are being used.  It has been said that we spend too much on main roads, that we make good roads better and ignore <Col N="1684" /> the roads that are bad, that we are straightening roads to an unnecessarily high degree, that this straightening will not necessarily bring about safer travel in the future but that the reverse will probably be the case.  It is said that more accidents occur on straight roads than on less straight ones.  It is also suggested that the jobs being done on the roads are too costly and that the Minister for Local Government should be responsible for ensuring that these costs are reduced and should take steps to that end.</P>
    <P>The first thing I should say in answer to the very many points that were made is that, by and large, out of the total road fund revenue which is disbursed by way of grants to the country as a whole each year, three or four times, and almost as high as five times, as much money goes to our county roads as is allocated to our main roads.  It will be said there are many more miles of county roads than of main roads.  On the other hand, none of us can deny that the improvement of our main roads to a point where they are capable of carrying, not only safely but economically, the increasing road traffic of today is something of which we must take cognisance.  Among some sections of the community, it is argued that we do not give enough money for the main arterial roads which are used by our commercial and industrial interests and by the great number of people who have to travel throughout the country.</P>
    <P>What we have been trying to do over the years, whether successfully or not, is to try to meet the demands of the various categories of roads to the best of our ability with the amount of money at our disposal from the Road Fund, supplemented by the local authority contributions.  I would say we have been holding a reasonably fair balance as regards the amounts being subscribed from the Road Fund for these various types of roads.  If any of the people, who take either one or the other view, can show that we are wrong and how a better job can be done than we are doing, any suggestions to that end would be welcomed and examined by me.  If they are <Col N="1685" /> feasible, I would have no hesitation whatsoever in putting them into operation.</P>
    <P>The amount of grants, as the House is aware, has been increasing over the years and it is hoped that a further increase will be possible in these road grant allocations next year.  I hope that will be so and, of course, any comments that have been made on the Road Fund and on allocations from the Road Fund to main and county roads respectively will be given very active consideration by the officers of my Department whose job it is to find out what we have available, what we will have available and the manner in which it is proposed to use it.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement to which the Deputy refers which was to the effect that, of the applications made by member-countries of the European Free Trade Association other than Britain, the Danish negotiations are furthest advanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, this country is not a member of the European Free Trade Association.  It seems, however, to be correct that the application of Denmark is somewhat more advanced than the application of Norway which is the other EFTA country seeking membership, but what this may signify in regard to the outcome of these applications is a matter on which I could not offer an opinion.  The fact that a particular country has had more negotiating meetings with the &ldquo;Six&rdquo; than another does not necessarily indicate the progress of the application. <Col N="1686" /> Real progress at meetings may be slow, and one country's application may involve more protracted negotiations than another's.</P>
    <P>The point to bear in mind in connection with the Deputy's Question is that the Member States of the Community are now giving the highest priority to the negotiations with Britain and that, until the outcome of these negotiations can be clearly seen, it is unlikely that there will be any developments of substance on any of the other applications.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not attach some grave significance to the fact that negotiations with Denmark are proceeding, while, according to the information he has afforded the House, negotiations are not proceeding with Ireland?  What significance does the Taoiseach attach to the fact that negotiations with Ireland are apparently suspended, pending conclusion of negotiations with Great Britain, whereas Denmark, who has announced she will not join the Common Market if Great Britain does not enter, is proceeding with negotiations.</P>

      <P>I have had inquiries made from the health authority and I am advised that the following is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The permanent district medical officer, Tarbert dispensary district, died on 30th August, 1961.  The medical officer who filled the post temporarily up to 31st October, 1961, <Col N="1691" /> resided in Glin, County Limerick.  The present temporary district medical officer took up duty on 1st November, 1961, and his address, as furnished to the health authority, is Moyvane.  The health authority state that they have no direct evidence that he is residing in Listowel.</P>
    <P>I have verified that, as stated in the question, there is no public telephone kiosk in Tarbert and that there are two private telephones with night extensions.  I am advised, however, that, in addition, the Gárda telephone is available for persons seeking the services of a doctor at night.  I have no ready means of checking the statement in the question that there had been a doctor resident in Tarbert for seventy years, but the available health authority records show that the medical officers of the district from 1927 up to recently resided at Tarbert.</P>
    <P>The health authority state that shortly after the death of the permanent district medical officer of Tarbert dispensary district, they received a petition from the residents of Tarbert asking that the district medical officer reside at Tarbert.  They tell me, also, that they received another petition from the residents of Moyvane asking that he reside at Moyvane.</P>
    <P>There is no public health nurse for the area; the dispensary midwife resides in Moyvane.</P>
    <P>Within the last month, the health authority submitted proposals to me for the re-organisation of the dispensary districts in the area, including Tarbert dispensary district.  These proposals are still under consideration.</P>

      <P>Details of minor employment schemes sanctioned for the year 1962/63 for the south west Cork area are contained in the copy of the list sent to the Deputy on 2nd November, 1962.  Details of the bog development schemes are contained in the copy of the lists, drainage and road, sent to the Deputy on 26th June and 20th November, 1962, respectively.  The number of rural improvement road schemes sanctioned for the area in the financial year to date is 18 schemes costing £4,879 of which the state grant is £4,103, the balance £776 being the farmers' <Col N="1694" /> contributions.  Particulars of the allocations for employment schemes in the urban areas of Clonakilty, Macroom and Skibbereen, for the non-urbanised towns of Bantry and Dunmanway, and for the minor marine works in the south west Cork area are appended to the end of this statement.  All money available this year for minor employment schemes, bog development schemes, urban and town schemes and marine proposals has already been allocated and no further allocation for this area will be made under these heads.  The further amount which may be allocated under rural improvements schemes is dependent on the contributions made by farmers and cannot, therefore, be anticipated.  Records of expenditure are not kept on a constituency basis but it is anticipated that with the exception of minor marine proposals all sums allocated will be expended by the end of the financial year.  It would not be possible at this stage to give details of the employment to be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the employment of industrial staff by Government Departments, the policy is to observe wages and conditions entered into by employers and trade unions.  This policy has been implemented at Shannon and Cork Airports, where the wages and conditions of employment of electricians employed by me are those laid down in the National Agreement negotiated between the Electrical Trade Union and the employers in the electrical industry.</P>
      <P>Claims have been made by the trade union on behalf of the electricians first at Shannon and later at Cork which were not in accordance with the National Agreement and which I was accordingly unable to accept.  As a result, a strike occurred at both Airports on 27th October which still continues. Since the strike occurred, a meeting between officers of my Department and the trade union has taken place under an independent chairman. Certain proposals were made at this meeting which were not in conflict with the National Agreement and it was agreed that these proposals should be recommended by both sides for approval.  I accepted these proposals but subsequently learned that the men concerned had rejected them.</P>
      <P>As negotiations are still continuing, I do not think that anything further I could say at this stage would be helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that conditions at Shannon Airport, as applied by other contractors, are far ahead of those for the men employed by the Minister and that all these electricians ask is that they be put on the same basis as the other tradesmen employed at Shannon Airport? Surely that is not asking the Minister to go too far?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he is aware that an applicant (name supplied) for a supply of electricity from the ESB was quoted in January 1962 a normal charge of 11/9d and a special charge of £3 7s 3d per bimensal period; and that in October <Col N="1702" /> last the quotation for special charge was increased to £6 1s 7d; and if he will say what is the reason for this excessive charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to the enactment of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1962 rural electrification subsidy was made available at the rate of 50 per cent of the capital cost of connection.  Since then rural electrification subsidy is made available at the rate of 75 per cent of the cost of connection subject to a maximum of £75 per dwelling.  On this basis it was estimated that of the 112,000 rural dwellings which remained unconnected 77,000 could be connected at normal fixed rates of charges and a further 23,000 with special service charges not exceeding 50 per cent of the normal fixed charges.  The remaining 12,000 dwellings which were the most isolated ones and which would be entirely uneconomic to connect would attract special service charges of more than twice the normal fixed rate of charge. The new subsidy scheme aims at securing the maximum number of connections and it is estimated that in due course some 96 per cent of rural dwellings will be connected.  This achievement will compare favourably with that of many better-off countries in Europe.  It was not anticipated that any of the 12,000 houses which were most uneconomic to connect would in fact seek connection and therefore the Government decided to make available to them the subsidy of £10 per house for bottled gas which was already available on islands where it was impracticable to provide electricity.</P>
      <P>In the case in which the Deputy is interested, the cost of connection would be £340 as compared with an average cost of connection of £48 per house. After taking account of maximum State subsidy of £75 the minimum economic charge would be the normal fixed charge plus a special service charge of £6 1s 7d per bimensal period as quoted by the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it unreasonable that a person should be asked to pay more than ten times the normal charge after a Bill has been introduced which was <Col N="1703" /> heralded as something that would bring relief to rural dwellers so far as the installation of electricity is concerned? Does his answer now mean that this cottier, who resides about 40 miles from Dublin, will never have the benefit of using electric light in his home because of the fact that he cannot meet these very high charges?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme was worked out so as to enable the maximum number of persons to be connected. The Deputy will recognise that it would cost an average of something like £200 to connect each of the people in the 12,000 class and that would add enormously to the total capital cost of the scheme.</P>

Yet the ESB charge has been increased from £3 to £6 in the last 12 months, when all the factors are the same today as they were 12 months ago.  What sort of manoeuvering is going on when everything remains static but the price goes up by 100 per cent?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there exists in urban areas a practice of high-power salesmen going from door to door in connection with hire-purchase selling which results in contracts being improvidently signed with the consequence that the husband is constrained either to continue paying the instalments or possibly face the prospect of criminal charges being brought against his wife as a result of the commodity purchased having been sold before the hire-purchase contract was discharged?

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are hire-purchase canvassers operating in the suburbs of all our cities.  The position was the same when this Act was passed two years ago.  I was not convinced by the arguments put forward then, nor am I convinced by anything which has happened since, that such a provision was necessary. In fact, on the contrary, what has happened since is that the report of the Moloney Committee on consumer <Col N="1705" /> protection in Britain proves that my view was correct.  It says:</P>
      <P>We are not prepared to endorse the view implicit in the idea that married women are less sensible and more gullible than their husbands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the wisdom appropriate to the urban populations of Great Britain does not necessarily operate here? Because the Moloney Commission so advises the British Government, is that any reason why we should facilitate the operations of a very small minority of chancers who are victimising respectable people and whom it is impossible to control unless some steps are taken merely to give their intended victims a chance of reflection?  What on earth objection can there be to asking a married woman entering into a hire-purchase contract either to have the contract signed by her husband or some independent security, so that if an attempt is subsequently made to victimise her, the hire-purchase firm must first sue the guarantor and not threaten the woman if the object has been sold?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that a number of road workers employed by the Kerry County Council have been laid off; and that more will probably be laid off in the near future owing to the delay in getting work under way out of the main road improvement grant; when he received proposals from the Kerry County Council with regard to work to be carried out under this grant; in what districts it was proposed by the Council to carry out the work; whether he has yet come to any decision with regard to the proposals of the Council in this matter; and, if so, at what date he reached such a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been a drop in the numbers employed on roads in Kerry in recent months as compared with last year's figures.  I understand that this is due chiefly to a hold-up in the acquisition of lands for the schemes which it was originally intended to carry out under this year's Main Road Improvement Grant and that an improvement in the employment position is expected in the near future as a result of the council undertaking alternative works.</P>
      <P>A scheme for the improvement of a section of the Tralee-Listowel road at Waterfall at an estimated cost of £13,000 under the council's 1962-63 main road improvement grant was received on 2nd October and is being approved subject to some technical adjustments designed to effect savings in cost.  The only other scheme submitted to date under the grant, a scheme for the final surfacing at a cost of £4,000 of a recently improved section of the Tralee-Killarney road, was received on 19th instant and is being considered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve orders, regulations and bye-laws have been made under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, and particulars of them will be given in the first annual statement which will indicate not only the orders, etc., made under the 1961 Act, but also those made under the 1933 Act which still apply.  This statement will be published in the near future.</P>
      <P>Regulations on three further subjects are at present being prepared. Regulations on other matters will follow in due course.  The making of bye-laws under the Act is a matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and there are no such bye-laws before me for my consent.  However, as I announced in my Estimates speech, a number of these are under consideration by the Commissioner at present, and it is expected that parking bye-laws relating to Dublin city and county will be submitted in the near future.</P>

As these pensions are paid by the local authorities out of local funds, no provision is made in the Budget for the cost of the increases apart from some minor provision to cover part of the cost of certain local authority pensions which rank for recoupment by the Exchequer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing agreement on social security between this country and Great Britain came into effect on 2nd May, 1960.</P>
      <P>As regards the duration of unemployment benefit payable in either country by virtue of contributions paid in the other, the provisions of the existing agreement are the same as those which obtained up to that date. In the course of the negotiations with the British authorities, extending over a number of years, in connection with the existing and preceding agreements, this country has always pressed for more favourable treatment for insured persons in relation to unemployment benefit, but the British authorities are not prepared to agree.  I have no reason to think that their views in this respect have changed during the short period which has elapsed since the present arrangements came into operation.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, and as any improvements in reciprocal arrangements entail mutual agreement between the parties concerned, I am satisfied that no useful purpose would be served by taking at this stage the steps requested by the Deputy.  I may say, however, that the arrangements in relation to unemployment benefit have never been regarded by this country as satisfactory and that the matter is being kept in mind in connection with any general review of the existing agreement which may be made.</P>

      <P>The person referred to by the Deputy was in receipt of unemployment assistance up to the 20th September, 1961, when his title ceased by reason of the revocation of his qualification certificate with effect as from that date.  The certificate was <Col N="1719" /> revoked by a deciding officer, in the exercise of his statutory duties, following a reinvestigation of the applicant's means, on the grounds that the means exceeded the statutory yearly limit then in force.  An appeal was made against the deciding officer's decision on the grounds that the income from the sources on which the assessment had been based had diminished subsequent to the withdrawal of unemployment assistance.  On the 21st August, 1962, an appeals officer who heard the appeal granted a qualification certificate to the appellant and he has since been in receipt of unemployment assistance at the maximum rate applicable in his case.  There is no power under the Unemployment Assistance Acts whereby unemployment assistance may be paid to a person for any period during which he was not the holder of a qualification certificate.</P>

      <P>This bog is situated mainly at Shannagurraun some three miles north of Spiddal.  It is proposed to distribute it by providing each allottee with a right of turbary over a separate, specifically defined plot. The claims of all applicants for turbary will be fully considered by the Land Commission but preference will necessarily be given to landowners in the locality who are in need of turbary. The extensive development works, which must precede allotment, have been authorised and the necessary funds sanctioned; these works will commence shortly and, if at all possible, allocations from the bog will be made in time for the next turfcutting season.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that many difficulties arise in this matter.  So far as forestry work is concerned, the adoption of a five-day week, without a reduction in working hours, would be impracticable in winter since working hours extend from daylight to dark; in summer, it would involve a standard day of nine and a half hours, with a ten hour day one day each week, these hours being exclusive of the luncheon break.

      <P>As explained in reply to a Question by Deputy Geoghegan on 7th November at Column 611 of the Official Report, the object is to transfer the fish-processing factories at Killybegs, Galway and Schull to private or co-operative enterprise if acceptable proposals are received and the underlying idea is to relieve An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, as far as practicable, of direct participation in commercial operations which can be effectively handled by private or co-operative interests and thus enable the Board to concentrate more intensively on development activities for the expansion of landings and sales of fish.  It is hoped that the factories will be transferred to sound commercial undertakings and that they will operate successfully as a result of the expansion of landings in which the Board will play an important part.

If they could be attended to promptly there would be no complaint. The difficulty is to get a skilled technician to the island quickly, particularly in bad weather conditions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether it is certain that adequate vocational school facilities will be available for day-release and block-release courses for apprentices required by the National Apprenticeship Board when the Apprenticeship Act, 1959, comes fully into operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>A committee has been established, representative of my Department and An Cheard-Chomhairle, to examine the extent to which existing vocational school facilities are sufficient to cater for apprenticeship training in the various trades which may be designated from time to time by An Cheard Chomhairle, and to advise as to what additional facilities may be needed.  In the circumstances I am satisfied that the work of An Cheard-Chomhairle will not be delayed or restricted because of inadequate accommodation in the schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is insufficient accommodation at the moment in Dublin for people attending vocational schools and, having regard to the fact that the Apprenticeship Act will come into full operation, in what manner does he propose to meet the eventuality that people will be seeking accommodation in vocational schools?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is news to the Minister.

I have been unable to get any evidence of the great number of complaints the Deputy speaks of but, if the Deputy or any other Deputy can submit evidence to me that there is undue frequency of change of textbooks, I will have the matter examined.  I have been unable to come to grips with the problem because I have been unable to get the evidence.</P>

      <P>As there have been very considerable changes in the rates and structure of the salary scales since many of the teachers concerned retired on pension, the calculation of the increases and resulting arrears in all the cases will not be completed before Christmas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if, in view of the fact that school transport is not <Col N="1752" /> provided for primary schoolchildren in rural Ireland who, on account of the very location of their homes, find difficulty in securing the same percentage of school attendance as their more fortunate town and urban fellow pupils, he will raise the age-group for primary school scholarships from 11-13 years to 11-14 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to now the upper age limit for these scholarships was 14 years.  The reduction proposed in that limit is five months in 1963 and 1964 and eight months thereafter. Educational and other considerations demanded that we should not be continuing a situation in which pupils were entering secondary schools at so late an age as 14.</P>
      <P>The first part of the Deputy's question does not appear to take cognisance of two facts.  The first is that transport services are provided where pupils reside outside of the statutory distance from school.  The second is that in the vast majority of the counties a very considerable number of the scholarships in question are reserved for pupils attending rural schools.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention, therefore, to return to an upper age limit of 14 years.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I think it right to say what planning is, what its aims are, and what it seeks to prevent, and why it is necessary to regulate in this way the conduct of people's domestic, social, commercial, and industrial activities.</P>
      <P>The object of planning is to make our towns, villages and countryside better places in which to live and work, by improving their appearance, their public services and facilities and their opportunities for employment and recreation.  This necessitates vigilance and constant effort.  A community's needs and expectations are not static: they are growing and changing all the time.  It is one of the tasks of planning to secure that current developments make allowance for this growth and for keeping up with changing or improving standards.  Thus we must plan not alone for the community's present needs but also for its future needs in the light of prospective growth in demand.  The future improvement of a street corner must not be made more costly, or perhaps rendered impracticable, by the shortsighted location of an expensive building.  The ever increasing demand for access to the more remote beaches and lake shores must not be frustrated by developments which block the only convenient access routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Road patterns must be made efficient and safe for vehicles, but allowance must be made for prospective residential developments and for the need of pedestrians to travel to work, to shops or to school with a <Col N="1762" /> minimum of crossing of roads carrying fast traffic.  On the other hand, costly road improvements must not be vitiated by permitting ribbon development of houses, shops, petrol stations and advertisement hoardings along the new frontages.  Planning seeks to secure the redevelopment of central areas of towns which have become outmoded and congested, but in relation to new development whether in the form of flat-dwellings, office blocks or other types of high density buildings it is the function of planning to ensure that adequate allowance is made for the traffic likely to be generated by the development.</P>
    <P>The avoidance of economic waste is one of the functions of planning. Property values must be conserved and where possible enhanced.  Discordant development, including discordant changes of use of existing property, in, say, a residential neighbourhood must not be permitted if the amenities of the neighbourhood would thereby be materially reduced.  In our countryside and coastline the conservation of amenities assumes prominent significance, both for the people who live there and for those who come there as visitors.  Good scenery is the raw material of tourism and much damage can be done by disfiguring advertisement panels, poor fencing, shacks or other insensitive structures and by the destruction of trees and physical features of amenity value.</P>
    <P>Planning has considerable significance in helping to foster economic development, especially in locations which offer prospects of becoming centres of commercial or industrial growth.  Good environment is important to existing industry and it can encourage new industry.  It has long been recognised in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, and many other countries that industrialists are influenced by good amenity, by the appearance of a place and by the facilities which it offers for leisure. Planning authorities can give a lead in these respects, and the Bill now before the House is designed to facilitate and encourage them in that task.  I would like to stress the point, that planning for a better physical environment is of national economic <Col N="1763" /> importance.  We are trying to attract new industry and encourage expansion of existing industry.  Our prospects of success will be enhanced if our towns are clean and bright and our countryside has a pleasant appearance.  A good environment and prosperity are closely associated.</P>
    <P>Planning of different kinds and degrees has, of course, been going on in this country for many generations, but that planning has too often in the past been spasmodic, unco-ordinated and directed towards short term aims or benefits.  It is now universally accepted that planning is a necessary, continuous and co-ordinated process directed towards the good of the community.  Improvements in communications, increasing urbanisation, rising standards of living and growing opportunities for both education and recreation, all generate demands, affecting so directly the physical environment in which people live, that there is no alternative but to have each individual make his personal contribution to orderly life in his environment.  To advise on the principles and measures necessary for the proper co-ordination of development is the function of the planner.</P>
    <P>Planning is not a luxury.  The poorer the resources of a country, the greater is the need for careful planning.  This is as true on the national scale as it is true of the individual citizen who must make the most of a limited income.  Planning will pay dividends in economic and social well-being in the years to come.  The implementation of planning objectives will, of course, proceed in stages, regard being had to existing economic factors and to the need to avoid overstraining central and local finances.  In the field of urban re-development, for example, local authorities may already have on hands cleared sites which can be made available for re-development by private enterprise.  Such re-development would be of direct value to the ratepayers because it increases the rateable valuation and generates local economic activity.</P>
    <P>An adequate planning system must <Col N="1764" /> provide for a statement of policy by the planning authority as to how land is to be allocated to uses which are best from the point of view of the community.  This is done by means of a development plan which includes a written statement of policy.  Secondly, an adequate planning system must provide for the control of development so as to secure that when an owner wishes to develop his property or make material changes in its use, the new development or use is in accordance with the plan.  Provision must also be made in the planning system for positive action to secure the objectives of the development plan.  Good public relations are important and the planning system must ensure that the public, including the land owner, the tenant, the house owner, the shopkeeper and the developer, will be enabled to know with as much assurance as possible how the development of their area is likely to proceed and how that development is likely to affect themselves.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is designed to satisfy these requirements. Whatever suggestions are made in the House for the improvement of its provisions will be carefully examined.  I am already indebted to professional and other bodies and individuals who contributed ideas and suggestions when it was announced that the existing code was under review.  There is considerable evidence of widespread public interest in the need for a planning code more suited to modern requirements.  Public interest in planning is, of course, nothing new.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1907, a Town Planning Exhibition was organised by the Royal Dublin Society.  Prior to that, the Public Health Acts, Housing Acts and Local Government Acts contained provisions for the regulation of building lines and the making of streets, the control of sky-signs and certain other forms of advertisements and the protection of amenities.  These provisions were purely regulatory.  The 1907 Exhibition led to the competition promoted by the Civics Institute from which emerged the prize-winning sketch plan for Dublin prepared in 1913 by the late Sir Patrick Abercrombie.  This pioneering effort <Col N="1765" /> resulted eventually in the appointment of Messrs.  Abercrombie, Manning Robertson and Kelly as Town Planning Consultants and it was they who prepared the sketch development plan in 1939 on which the Dublin Planning Scheme completed in recent years is based.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House that long before planning as such was given statutory recognition, Dublin had its Wide Streets Commissioners and its imaginative designers whose work produced the attractive streets and squares which gave the city an international reputation for good civic design.  Elsewhere in Ireland, some of our towns and villages reflect the work of enlightened individuals whose standards of design and landscaping have left us examples of what good planning and development can achieve. It is our task to preserve this heritage insofar as it is desirable and practicable to do so and at the same time to establish the legal and administrative framework which will facilitate development in harmony with current standards of expectation and demand.</P>
    <P>These aims are basically the same as the aims which inspired the Government and this House and all others who were responsible for the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934.  That Act attempted to provide a comprehensive system of planning, but it has been only partially successful. Its operation was dependent on a local authority adopting planning powers by passing a resolution deciding to make a planning scheme.  By this resolution they bound themselves to make a planning scheme &ldquo;with all convenient speed&rdquo; and were authorised to exercise control over all structural work, where applications were made for permission to erect such works, in the interim period prior to the coming into force of the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>Following the passing of the 1934 Act, the cities and larger urban districts and some county councils passed the statutory planning resolutions.  The great majority of the urban district councils and a number of county councils held back until a new awareness of the necessity for planning <Col N="1766" /> powers became evident in the post-war years.  The position now is that most of the urban councils have adopted the Act.  Some county councils have not and in a few counties the planning resolutions relate only to a part or parts of the county.</P>
    <P>Some progress has been made by several local authorities towards the preparation of planning schemes.  Consultants or salaried staffs were engaged and plans and explanatory documents were prepared.  But 28 years after the passing of the Act only one planning scheme has been submitted for confirmation.</P>
    <P>The operation of the 1934 Act has not been devoid of achievement.  Patterns for good development were worked out and much undesirable development has been prevented.  The administration of the Act has, however, thrown up some difficult problems. It was assumed that the interim period between the passing of a planning resolution and the coming into force of a planning scheme would be relatively short and that the exercise of interim control powers over structural works would be merely a temporary feature.  That assumption has proved to have been wrong.  Under the Act no compensation is payable to persons affected by restrictions imposed by the exercise of interim control powers until the planning scheme for the area has come into force.  The Town and Regional Planning Act, 1939, gave scope for some relief where the interim directions of the local authorities involved hardship; but the main problem of compensation rights and the question of collecting betterment from persons benefiting from planning provisions continued to depend for settlement on a planning scheme being brought into force under the 1934 Act.</P>
    <P>The 1934 Act had many defects.  It laid down a procedure for the making of a planning scheme which was too lengthy and too cumbersome.  The scheme itself once made would contain extensive powers to regulate development and control the use of land.  The provisions of a scheme would, therefore, require the most detailed preparation, and elaborate investigations of the provisions would be an essential prerequisite to its being brought into <Col N="1767" /> force.  It would require the Minister's approval and his approval could, in effect, be annulled by the Oireachtas or by the High Court.  Once made, a planning scheme would have the force of law and could be amended only by a repetition of the procedure required for the making of the original scheme.</P>
    <P>Since a scheme could not readily be adapted to changing circumstances, it should include all possible foreseeable developments.  It would be impracticable to make a workable plan on this basis, especially in an era of rapid technological and social change such as the present.  A planning scheme might entail a substantial aggregate of compensation liabilities as soon as it came into force.  This would put a premium on timid and inadequate schemes.  Even if the compensation liabilities could be met, there would be no guarantee that the provisions for development which occasioned them would ever mature.  Compensation paid in respect of interim directions cannot be recovered.  This means that a planning authority is more or less committed to including interim directions in the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>The revenue from betterment charges payable to the planning authority by those whose property is increased in value arising from the planning scheme would be impossible to determine or collect.  I understand that during the period of 15 years when provisions similar to our 1934 Act provisions were in operation in England, only three instances of the collection of betterment were recorded.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest obstacle to the use of the 1934 Act as an effective measure to secure proper planning and development is the fact that the powers provided are largely regulatory and only to a limited degree enable planning authorities to undertake or secure positive development.  A planning scheme might prevent bad development but it could not secure good development, because its main concern is with what development may be carried out, if and when someone is prepared to develop.  The system is thus inadequate to secure the redevelopment of central town areas&mdash;a defect which is increasingly <Col N="1768" /> apparent with the growth of traffic and the urgency of reconciling the needs of transport with those of the pedestrian.</P>
    <P>The principal purpose of the 1939 Act was to try to overcome some of the major defects of the 1934 Act insofar as those defects had then come to light.  In particular, the Act sought to relieve the planning authorities of the obligation to plan the lay-out of the development of their entire area when making a planning scheme.  It was thought that this would remove one of the major difficulties and make for greater flexibility, but in fact it made scarcely any impression on the basic weaknesses of the principal Act.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with these weaknesses because I am aware that there are those who think that the present legislation is fundamentally sound but that it has never been seriously tested.  I cannot share that view.  I understand that British experience of the working of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1952, to which our Act of 1934 was very similar, confirms my view.  There is also the fact that in Northern Ireland where similar legislation has been in operation for very many years no planning scheme has been brought into force.</P>
    <P>As I have said, only one planning scheme was submitted for confirmation. This scheme, as the House is aware, relates to Dublin city and was prepared within a restricted period as a result of a court order.  Some 1,500 objections to the scheme reached my Department. After investigation, it became apparent that no amendment of the scheme could be devised which would overcome inherent weaknesses&mdash;weaknesses which stemmed from fundamental defects in the enabling legislation.  The scheme itself contained much that is valuable in relation to the planning of Dublin, and the preparation of a development plan as provided for in the present Bill will be greatly facilitated as a result of the Corporation's research and projections for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given to the question of amending our present Planning Acts but no satisfactory solution was found practicable in that direction. Fundamental changes are inevitable. These changes are urgently needed in <Col N="1769" /> the interests of both the local authorities and property owners.  Interim control decisions are growing at an ever increasing rate while, at the same time, no prospect exists under the present law of an equitable reckoning of compensation rights and liabilities.</P>
    <P>It is not in this respect alone that the problems are increasing.  The marked improvement in recent years in our economy has stimulated development activities.  Expensive housing development at low densities is in demand and there is a growing tendency to move from town centres with attendant risks of urban sprawl and depreciation of central town areas. More space is in demand for factory development.  The growth of car ownership is making ever increasing demands on our street systems and the solution of this problem is basically a planning matter.</P>
    <P>The welcome expansion of tourism carries the threat of damage to the amenity of our scenic areas and coastline, while at the same time it demands the improvement of the appearance of our towns and countryside and the provision of more facilities for recreation. Planning by the local authorities cannot be undertaken with confidence and authority under the present law. Many parts of our finest coastal and inland scenic locations are not subject to any planning control.  Even where such controls are available, there is no assurance that insensitive and inharmonious developments do not occur, due to the uncertainties of the compensation position and the absence of up-to-date development plans.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House seeks to remedy this situation.  It provides that all planning authorities must make development plans and exercise planning controls over both structural works and material changes in the use of structures and other land.  Provision is made for an equitable system of compensation in respect of both future and past planning restrictions.</P>
    <P>The preservation and improvement of amenities is a prominent feature of the provisions of the Bill.  This is intended to supplement and strengthen the very commendable work already <Col N="1770" /> being carried out by local authorities, by voluntary and State financed bodies and by individuals.  I have found in recent years a growing public interest in curing the deficiencies in our physical surroundings.  The Derelict Sites Act, 1961, and the associated Derelict Sites Clearance Scheme have been widely welcomed and are making a steady impact on a long-standing problem of visual disfigurement, while the scheme of grants for the provision of public amenities is producing encouraging results.  Much remains to be done.  In view of the economic significance of tourism in our economy, amenity has a real cash value for us and this Bill recognises that the protection and improvement of amenity must nowadays have a serious and special place amongst the responsibilities of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains important provisions in the field of urban renewal. During my recent study tour in the United States and Canada I found that this important subject is being grappled with at one stage or another in all the major cities, with the strong support of the federal governments.  I found also that the absolute necessity of a master plan based on adequate technical and economic surveys is recognised in both countries.  The Bill proposes to widen considerably the powers of planning authorities to acquire land for positive development activities. Provision is also made to replace the existing building bye-law codes by regulations which will permit of more flexible standards in harmony with changes in building techniques and the use of new materials.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether or not the Bill becomes law precisely in its present form, it is clear that planning will become a major function of local authorities.  Special measures are being taken to increase the supply of trained personnel and to afford as much training as possible to existing engineering staffs engaged on planning work.  I am also arranging to secure some strengthening of the Department's planning staff.</P>
    <P>In explaining the purpose and content of this Bill, I do not propose to cover exactly the same ground as the <Col N="1771" /> explanatory memorandum which gives a reasonably clear exposition of its provisions and which is available to supplement what I have to say now.</P>
    <P>The main objects of the Bill are:</P>
    <P>(1)  To set up a new and more flexible planning system to be operated by local authorities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>(2)  To enable local authorities to facilitate industrial and commercial developments and to secure the re-development of these parts of built-up areas which have become outmoded, uneconomic or congested.</P>
    <P>(3)  To secure that the amenities of town and countryside are preserved and improved.</P>
    <P>(4)  To relate compensation to property owners to the restrictions imposed on them by individual planning decisions rather than to provisions in planning schemes and to end their liability for betterment charges.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into eight Parts and contains five Schedules.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill is concerned with preliminary and general matters.  Since it has such an important bearing on the scope of the Bill the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; is highly important.  It embraces first of all the carrying out of any works on land and &ldquo;works&rdquo; is defined as including any act or operation of construction, excavation, demolition, extension, alteration, repair or renewal.  Apart from exempted development, the general position will be that planning permission must be obtained for any structural works.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Development&rdquo; will include the making of any material change in the use of any structures or other land and in this respect goes further than the corresponding provisions in the 1934 Act which did not control user.  A material change of use of structures or land may substantially affect the character of the neighbourhood and may seriously impair its amenities. There are many examples of residential areas which have suffered from the conversion of houses and other structures into factories and work-shops or <Col N="1772" /> from the front room or ground floor being given over to use as a shop regardless of its unsuitability for such purpose and its impact on the amenities and value of neighbouring houses.</P>
    <P>The omission of use control in the interim period under the present law is an anomaly which may be attributed to the expectation that the period which would elapse between the decision to make a planning scheme and its coming into operation would be relatively short.  It was assumed that securing the cessor of a use would not present the difficulties which would arise in the case of a building contravening a planning scheme.  In other words, the establishment in the interim period of nonforming uses would not be likely to prejudice the efficient and economical execution of a planning scheme since they could be readily terminated.  As matters have turned out, the interim period has been protracted and, not only has much harm been done, but it is quite improbable that the position can be remedied as simply as was envisaged. It would, of course, be unreasonable to attempt to regulate every change which occurs in the use of land or other premises.  It is only a material change which will constitute &ldquo;development&rdquo; and will thus require planning permission from the planning authority.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;material change of use&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill because it would be impossible to cover satisfactorily the varied circumstances to which it may apply.  A broad classification of uses is possible under such headings as residential, commercial, industrial, etc. and it is on this basis that use zoning is usually carried out.  In most of the American cities which I have visited zoning ordinances prescribe or regulate uses in about six zones of this type.  It is common in other countries to have similar zoning laws and the principle is also embodied in British Planning Legislation. It is intended that the regulations to be made under subsection (2) of Section 4 will have the effect of classifying uses along these lines and that, in general, no permission will be required for any change of use within a use class.  The effect should be to <Col N="1773" /> simplify the control of user and restrict its operations to the minimum found to be essential.</P>
    <P>In order to put beyond doubt any question as to whether control may be applied to certain matters such as the use of land for dumping, camping, storage of caravans or exhibitions of advertisements, it is specifically provided that such uses of land shall be deemed to involve a material change of use.  Specific provision is made, on the other hand, for the exemption from development control of the use of any land for the purposes of agriculture or forestry, the use for any of these purposes of any building occupied together with land so used, and the use of any structure or other land within the curtilage of a dwelling-house for any purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse as such.  These exemptions could have been made under the Regulations which I have already mentioned but these are safeguards of sufficient importance to warrant their being written into the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>Other types of development which will be exempted by Section 4 are mainly in the nature of maintenance works and works under the Land Reclamation Act, 1949.  There is no need for me to comment in detail on these matters but I should like, in passing, to refer to the exemption of development undertaken by planning authorities themselves.  Under Section 22, a statutory duty is placed on each planning authority to take such steps as may be necessary for securing the objectives contained in its development plan.  Furthermore, Section 39 provides that they shall not effect any development in their district which contravenes materially the development plan.  Finally, Section 77 provides for regulations requiring public notice to be given by planning authorities before carrying out certain types of development and requiring the consent of the Minister to be obtained in the event of there being objections by any interested persons.</P>
    <P>Before passing to Part II of the Bill I would like to make some comment on the definition of &ldquo;planning authority&rdquo;.  Those who are familiar <Col N="1774" /> with the Act of 1934 will note that no change is being made in this respect and that the Bill proposes to entrust full planning responsibility for their districts to the councils of counties, county boroughs, boroughs and urban districts.  I am aware that in Britain the primary planning unit is the county and that following the Town and Country Planning Act of 1947 the number of planning authorities in England and Wales was reduced from 1,441 to 145.  It may well be true that a multiplicity of small planning authorities each operating in its own local interests militated against effective national planning and that it was essential to have units which would enable a broader view to be taken.  It seems to me, however, that this argument might have been used more effectively in support of regional planning, and that the solution adopted is not altogether satisfactory.  On the one hand we have heard of the abandonment of the regional planning offices of the Ministry and on the other of the extensive delegation of planning powers to borough, urban and rural councils.</P>
    <P>In deciding to retain the present planning organisation which we have had under the 1934 Act, I am not unmindful of the fact that it is in the urban areas rather than in the counties that planning has hitherto been attempted and that there is experience of dealing with urban planning problems.</P>
    <P>In so far as county planning is concerned, we have in this country special advantages deriving from the management system and the fact that not infrequently the county engineer or members of his staff also act as town surveyors.  In the Dublin Metropolitan region it has been possible to arrange that a single planning officer would advise all the separate planning authorities.  I think it is very important that development plans should be coordinated on a county basis and there is specific power in Section 22 of the Bill enabling the Minister to require co-ordination of development plans. While I see no reason why any undue difficulty should arise in planning authorities co-ordinating their proposals within the county framework, <Col N="1775" /> it would be my intention to make full use of the powers proposed in Section 22 should it be necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>As regards national planning, I am fully in favour of the maximum possible degree of leadership, advice and assistance being given by the central authority.  It is my intention to have my Department make a much more positive contribution to planning in this country than has been possible under the Act of 1934, in which the requirement that the Minister for Local Government must approve each planning scheme restricted the Department's participation in the preliminary work of local planning authorities even where interests of national planning were concerned.  This Bill does not provide for Ministerial approval of development plans in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the making of regulations by the Minister and for the laying of the regulations before each House of the Oireachtas.  The preparation of draft regulations is in hands and I will be in a position on Committee Stage to indicate, where necessary, the principles of the provisions which will be included in the regulations.</P>
    <P>The financial provisions set out in Part II of the Bill require scarcely any explanation from me, but I should like to draw attention to the provisions of Section 14.  One of the primary objects of the Bill is to facilitate the development of amenities which may benefit our people directly by the satisfaction of their aesthetic and recreational needs, and indirectly by providing or preserving attractions which are important to the tourist trade.  In this field local development associations, local development companies, archaeological societies and other voluntary organisations and, indeed, individuals, can play a leading part and many planning authorities recognise the value of their work and would be glad to assist them.  This Section provides the necessary power but its exercise is a reserved function in any case where it is proposed to give assistance in the form of a grant of money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1776" /> Section 15 provides for contributions to the funds of any body providing for training and research in relation to planning.  Although I have no definite proposals of this kind in mind at present, I think it desirable that the Bill should contain such a provision. The Town Planning Institute would be an appropriate body and the training and research which it may carry out with the help of local authority contributions might well result in lasting benefits to this country.</P>
    <P>The grants at present payable to local authorities and other bodies by the Minister for Local Government for the development of public amenities including the clearance of derelict sites will help to further the amenity objectives of the Bill.  The portion of the development plans relating to public works will, of course, rank for State assistance as at present.  Road improvements and carparks, housing schemes and sanitary services, libraries and institutions are examples of works and services which may be provided for in development plans but the cost of which is not ascribable to planning as such.</P>
    <P>In relation to Section 16, local authorities have readily availed of the agency powers conferred on them by Section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1955, and I anticipate that they will readily avail themselves of this provision for sharing the cost of the performance of planning functions. The section also enables a planning authority to bring disagreements on questions of cost before the Minister and to have the cost apportioned by him.  It is, of course, not my intention that any obligation should devolve on a planning authority in respect of works carried out without their consent by a neighbouring authority unless the latter has an absolutely compelling case.  A particular example which I have in mind is the development of Portmarnock as a seaside resort.  Dublin County Council have long urged that such development would be mainly in the interests of the citizens of Dublin and I believe that this has been accepted in principle by Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>Section 18 enables the Minister to <Col N="1777" /> award costs against the planning authority in the case of an appeal under the provisions of the Bill and, if he thinks fit, to specify a sum to be paid to him as compensation for his expenses in the matter.  In order to obviate frivolous appeals, costs may also be awarded against the appellant. These provisions are related to those of Section 80 which provides that an oral hearing may be requested by any party.</P>
    <P>Many people are content with the present system of appeals against interim directions under the Act of 1934.  They need only write a letter, addressed to the Minister or his Department in order to put the machinery in motion.  The appeal is considered on the basis of written representations submitted by the parties and if any objection is raised by the planning authority which was not disclosed initially, or if it is represented to the Minister that there are objections other than those indicated by the planning authority, it is the practice to afford the appellant an opportunity of submitting further representations on these points.  The site or the works are inspected and a report is made which is considered by the Minister together with the written representations before he determines the appeal.</P>
    <P>This procedure has the great advantage of being inexpensive and flexible. The appeals which are received vary from a simple letter from the appellant himself to submissions prepared by senior counsel.  They all receive my personal attention.  Because of the rise in the number of appeals during the past few years and, since the issues arising on modern development proposals are often very complex, it is increasingly difficult to keep abreast of the flood.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless there is some demand for oral hearings: I recognise the justice of this demand and suitable provision is accordingly made under Section 80.  The old system will continue to operate but, if many persons choose to request oral hearings, the cost of appeals is likely to be increased not merely in relation to the expense occasioned to my Department but also <Col N="1778" /> in the demand on the time of my inspectorate.</P>
    <P>The regulations which I am empowered to make with respect to oral hearings will give full facilities for legal representation, for the taking of evidence, for cross-examination of witnesses, etc. but it is my earnest hope that it will be possible to conduct such hearings with the minimum of formality and cost.  I do not intend that expenses should normally be payable to me by either party to an appeal. Neither do I wish to see costs imposed on either party if the case which they submit appears reasonable.  I hope rather that Section 18 may discourage frivolous appeals, lessen the demands on the time of my inspectors and the staff of planning authorities, and encourage a procedure for oral hearings which will be informal and expeditious.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill deals with the machinery of planning.  Section 19 requires every planning authority to make a development plan within three years or such longer period as may be allowed by the Minister.  A development plan will consist of a written statement of development objectives for the area and a plan to illustrate these objectives.  Certain minima are prescribed and, in the case of cities and towns, these are&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Zoning of land used for particular purposes whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(2)  Securing the greater convenience and safety of road users and pedestrians by the provision of parking places or road improvements or otherwise.</P>
    <P>(3)  Development and renewal of obsolete areas.</P>
    <P>(4)  Preserving and improving amenities.</P>
    <P>In county areas the plans must include objectives under the headings of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Development and renewal of obsolete areas.</P>
    <P>(2)  Preserving and improving amenities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1779" /> (3)  Provision of new water supplies and sewerage services and the extension of existing supplies and services.</P>
    <P>In addition to these minimum requirements, a development plan may indicate objectives for many other purposes related to the size, density, layout, etc. of structures such as houses and other buildings, and for the provision of schools, shops, churches, recreational facilities, and other aspects of community planning.  The purposes are listed in more detail in the Third Schedule of the Bill and include under the heading of amenity the reservation of land for open spaces, parks, etc., the preservation of scenic amenities, of trees and woodlands, and of public rights-of-way, the restriction of advertisements and the control of dumping and pollution.</P>
    <P>No doubt it will occur to Deputies that these provisions will enable a very considerable variation in the scope of plans made by different planning authorities.  That is, in fact, done deliberately having regard to the wide variation in the size, needs and circumstances of the areas which fall to be planned.  County councils will be required to prepare separate plans for the towns in their area which have Town Commissioners and for other towns of about 1,000 population or upward which have no separate local government authority &mdash; these towns are specified in the First Schedule.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the House will agree that small towns of this class deserve the special recognition which is given to them in the Bill.  No county planning can ignore the role of its towns and villages and, indeed it is a basic requirement of proper planning and development to survey and decide the particular function which each town has in the community structure of the county.  Furthermore, small towns have their own problems including the ever-growing problem of traffic and the need for redevelopment which, even though the scale is smaller, are important to these communities. While the Bill does not make it compulsory to prepare plans for towns of less than 1,000 population I <Col N="1780" /> expect that county councils will find it convenient and, in many cases, imperative to prepare separate plans for smaller towns and villages, particularly for centres that reveal growing development potential.</P>
    <P>The plans required for small towns may be relatively simple, containing few provisions other than those prescribed as appropriate, whereas the city authorities will require to state objectives for a greater variety of matters and will accordingly have more complicated plans.  In order to simplify the matter, provision is made for the preparation of plans in instalments; plans may be made for part of an area or to show particular objectives such as densities or zoning.</P>
    <P>I have recently heard planning defined as &ldquo;making the best of what you've got&rdquo;.  The first step, then, is to find out &ldquo;what you've got&rdquo;&mdash;to make a survey of the physical features of the area and matters such as suitability of particular land for various purposes for which there might be demand; to investigate population trends, the likelihood of industrial development and the provision which should be made for expansion of existing industries and for housing, open spaces, and public buildings. Regard must be had to the restrictions which may be imposed by limitations of sanitary services and the survey must take account of development projects by local authorities, public bodies and other agencies whether public or private.</P>
    <P>A survey may be compiled from existing data as well as from fresh inspections and it should be sufficiently informative to enable plans of a realistic and practical nature to be prepared. It may be that simple surveys will suffice in many cases and that in others it will be necessary only to bring up to date information already collected for the making of a planning scheme under the Act of 1934.</P>
    <P>Needless to say, much of the preparatory work for a development plan can be undertaken by persons who are not qualified planners. Extensive use can clearly be made of the professional and administrative skills which are found in every local <Col N="1781" /> authority establishment.  The engineering and architectural organisations in the various local areas have done excellent work over the years in the planning and execution of various structural programmes as well as the work specifically referable to the provisions of the Planning Acts.  I have every confidence in their ability to respond to the demands which the new Bill will make on their experience and co-operation and I repeat my assurance of Departmental advice and assistance in these new tasks.</P>
    <P>Under Section 22, it will be the duty of planning authorities to take such steps as may be necessary for securing the objectives which are contained in their development plans, and if they seek the good of their districts, they must ensure that the plans which they make are not merely collections of coloured maps.  Planning authorities should bear in mind that their task is to make &ldquo;the best of what they have got&rdquo;, and to ensure that the developments which must in any event be carried out as normal local government functions will in fact work well and look well as a result of their pre-planning and foresight.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 21 for public notice of the making of draft development plans (and draft variations thereof), for inspection of the drafts by the public, for the sending of documents to the Minister and to authorities to be prescribed by him and for notification of owners and occupiers of artistic, etc., buildings which are listed for preservation in the draft plan.  Planning authorities must take into consideration any objections or representations made to them within the period (at least three months) that the draft plan is available for inspection.  Copies of the final plan must be kept available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>Section 23 empowers the Minister to prepare and publish general instructions in relation to the preparation of development plans.  Before I leave the question of the procedure to be followed, I would like to draw attention to the special provisions of Section 21 in relation to public rights-of-way. Alleged obstruction of public rights-of-way <Col N="1782" /> has recently been in the news. Where it appears to a local authority that such a right-of-way exists, and that it gives access to seashore, mountain, lake shore, river bank, or other place of natural beauty or recreational utility, they may in reliance on paragraph 13 of Part IV of the Third Schedule, include in the draft development plan a provision relating to the preservation of the right-of-way.  Notice must be served on the owner and on the occupier of the land and must state that a right of appeal to the Circuit Court exists.</P>
    <P>If, on appeal, such court is satisfied that no public right-of-way subsists, the court shall so declare and the provision may not be included in the final development plan.  On the other hand if the court does not so declare, the provision may be included.  Then, under Section 49, the planning authority become responsible for the maintenance of the right-of-way and any person by whom it is damaged or obstructed or who hinders or interferes with the exercise of the right-of-way becomes guilty of an offence. The planning authority may prosecute such person and he will be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 and to a further penalty in the case of conviction for a continuing offence.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of local authorities' powers to protect public rights-of-way, I think that this will be a considerable improvement on the present legal position.  Furthermore, Section 47 and Section 48 of the Bill confer powers on planning authorities to create public rights-of-way by agreement or compulsorily.  If a serious problem exists or is threatened, planning authorities should be in a position to overcome it with the aid of these powers.</P>
    <P>Another important matter in Part III of the Bill is related to my earlier statement that planning and development is a continuous process.  In modern times it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty the forces, changes, pressures and influences which will affect our towns and countryside in the relatively near future.  At the same time, it is not only <Col N="1783" /> prudent but essential that we make plans to guide development and to profit from past mistakes.  If, as an alternative to the static, rigid type of scheme envisaged by the Act of 1934, we are to have flexible planning which will take account of current trends and new developments, then we must provide for periodical review and variation of development plans.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the view that this will seriously inconvenience or tend to frustrate the property owner or the prospective developer.  On the contrary, the ability of planning authorities to amend their plans without having to go through a tedious, long drawn out and complicated procedure, will discourage them from attempting to include in their plan any unnecessary or unduly long-term objectives. The effect can only be to reduce the incidence of planning blight&mdash;in other words, the value of property will not be depreciated by long-term threats of acquisition or disturbance, and prospective developers are less likely to be obstructed by provisions for remote planning contingencies.  This is not to say that development plans can be purely short-term projections. Clearly, the plans must in respect of some major aspects of planning look ahead 15 or perhaps 20 or more years.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained, the Minister's approval is not required to development plans: he is, however, one of the prescribed authorities to whom copies of development plans must be sent.  The other authorities to whom it is intended to prescribe and who must be furnished with prescribed documents include: (1) An Chomhairle Ealaíon, (2) An Taisce, (3) Bord Fáilte Éireann, (4) the National Monuments Advisory Council, (5) the Minister for Lands, (6) the Minister for Industry and Commerce, (7) the Minister for Defence, and (8) any local authority affected.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this provision is to enable these bodies to scrutinise the proposals of planning authorities and to make representations for the consideration of the planning authority before making their final plan.  I should like to take this opportunity to <Col N="1784" /> pay a special tribute to the work in the field of amenity of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, Bord Fáilte Éireann, An Taisce, and the National Monuments Advisory Council, and to thank them for their agreement to co-operate in the administration of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to my intention to provide as much guidance and assistance as it may be possible to afford to planning authorities.  I have also mentioned my belief that a good deal of national planning may be done in this way and that there should not be any excessive difficulty in securing co-operation between planning authorities themselves.  It is desirable, however, that the Minister should have specific powers in this regard and, accordingly, Section 22 enables him to require planning authorities to coordinate their plans with those of other planning authorities or to vary their plans as may be specified by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill sets up the machinery for control of development and for the enforcement of such control. I have already dealt at some length with the question of what constitutes development.  The control procedure is not substantially changed from that existing at present.  I would draw attenion to the provision in Section 26 that in dealing with applications for permission the planning authority will be restricted to considering the proper planning and development of their area (including the preservation and improvement of its amenities), regard being had to the development plan, to any special amenity area order and to any other material considerations.  Where permission is refused or conditions are imposed the reasons must be stated. Appeals against orders and decisions may be made to the Minister by any person and the criteria governing the determination of applications for permission will apply also to the determination of appeals.</P>
    <P>There has been some confusion in relation to the terms &ldquo;general permission&rdquo; and &ldquo;special permission&rdquo; and the distinction is not being continued in the Bill.  It is desirable, however, that developers be facilitated if they wish <Col N="1785" /> to ascertain whether development would be permissible if it were carried out in a certain manner or on a particular site.  Such inquiries are frequently made at a stage when the project is too uncertain to justify the preparation of detailed plans and the decision required is one of principle only.  Under Section 25 it is proposed that Regulations shall be made enabling planning authorities to deal with such outline applications and when giving permission, to reserve the right of approval of the details until a further application is made.</P>
    <P>I would like in particular to draw attention to other matters for which provision is made under Section 25. Regulations may require applicants to publish notices with respect to their applications for planning permission. This could be done either by posting a notice on the site or otherwise.  Planning authorities may also be required to furnish to any specified persons information with respect to any applications and the manner in which the applications have been dealt with.  The regulations may also require planning authorities to publish any specified information with respect to any applications or decisions on applications.</P>
    <P>I might point out also that under the Bill every planning authority will be obliged to keep a register in which they will note applications for planning permission, planning decisions and particulars of compensation paid for planning restrictions.  For a fee of 10/- a certificate of any entry in the register will be issued.  Under Section 41, the entry of particulars of planning applications and decisions must be made in the register within seven days.  The register must be kept available for public inspection.</P>
    <P>These provisions are designed to remedy what I consider to be an unsatisfactory lack of public information in the present planning control system. I am considering a further procedure of making decisions of local interest available through the local public representatives on the planning authority. It may also be found possible to have extracts from the register made available at the post offices, which would contain entries of local interest.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1786" /> The provisions of Part IV are readily understandable from the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the Bill. Detailed discussion on them will, perhaps, be more appropriate to the Committee Stage.  One provision of general interest, however, relates to the question of enforcement in relation to suburban housing estates which have been left by the developers in an incomplete and unsatisfactory state of development.  The difficulties experienced in this regard have created a most unsatisfactory position in many suburban areas.  The anxiety of many persons to secure houses in a time of scarcity led them to accept uncritically what might merely be implied from advertisements and plans.  Many houses were provided by builders working under a building lease who were not in a position to give any warranty for any other part of the estate development.  In other cases the developer was a man of straw or an incompetent businessman who had not the resources or the capacity to carry through the complete development proposed in his plans.  Other failures may be attributed to the death or illness of the developer or to the liquidation of his firm.  These failures may be understandable but there is considerable evidence that a large proportion of cases were due to the irresponsibility or unscrupulousness of the developer.</P>
    <P>It has been made amply clear to me in reviewing many such cases that householders need legal protection in this regard.  The Bill will confer on local authorities for the first time powers and duties to remedy a serious deficiency in the existing legislation. They will no longer be dependent on the exercise of pressure on developers by refusing to take in charge any road, grass verge, footpath, open space or sanitary services which did not comply with their requirements.  Steps such as these were necessary to protect the ratepayers as a whole from being saddled with the liabilities of unscrupulous developers but, unfortunately, it also left the householders involved without the necessary services.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that persons in receipt of ground rents from housing <Col N="1787" /> estates should be made responsible for the proper carrying out and completion of the development works. In practice, the interest of the ground landlord is often too remote from that of the developer to justify such a provision. On the other hand difficulty arises where the occupiers of the houses become owners of the land. Consideration has been given to the possibility of enabling a planning authority to charge their expenses for completion of unfinished estates on such interests as they considered appropriate.  This course might, however, be constitutionally objectionable, for example, where the interest of the owner of a house on one part of the estate would be charged with the expenses relating to works carried out on another part of the same estate.</P>
    <P>It is possible, of course, that the suggestion for attaching ground rents is intended only as a partial solution of the problem.  For instance it might be restricted to places where the developer was himself in receipt of the ground rents but, even in such a case, there is the difficulty that the provision could only apply to development taking place after the coming into operation of the Act.  Any retrospective application would have a penal effect and could not be defended.</P>
    <P>As drafted, Section 35 of the Bill has the advantage of enabling the planning authority to place responsibility on a developer, to make it an offence for him not to discharge his obligations, and to recover from him any expenses which they incur in making good his default.  If the planning authority fail to serve an enforcement notice under the section they may be compelled to do so by the Minister.  If the developer is in receipt of ground rents, they may be attached for the purpose of recovering expenses if such is necessary.  The most important aspect of the section is however, that it will be possible to apply it not only to future cases, but to many of those currently being dealt with.  This is because Section 89 provides that a permission for development granted under the Act of 1924 shall be treated as a permission granted under the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1788" /> As regards future estate developments, it is proposed that the planning authorities should have further power in addition to the power to serve enforcement notices requiring the development to conform with the relevant planning permission.  This further power is contained in Section 26.  Under that section the planning authority may in granting permission for development attach a condition requiring security to be given for the satisfactory completion of the proposed development, including maintenance until taken in charge by the local authority concerned of roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, watermains or drains.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill makes positive provisions not alone for the preservation of amenity (including trees, woodlands and other flora and also fauna) but also for improvement activities and for the provision of new amenity features.  Areas of special amenity are dealt with in Section 42.  An area of special amenity by reason of its natural beauty or scenic or other amenities (including recreational utility) may be made the subject of an Order by the planning authority under this section. An area of this kind may over-lap part of a contiguous planning district and accordingly provision is made that either of the planning authorities may, with the consent of the other, make an Order in such circumstances.  Dealing with an area of this kind, it is likely that a single Order would be preferable since there is an elaborate procedure for public notice, objections, the holding of a public local inquiry, confirmation by the Minister, and the laying of the Order before each House of the Oireachtas.  An even more compelling reason, I should think, is the fact that it is desirable that in such an area, there should be no disparity between the regulations affecting different parts of it.</P>
    <P>The making of an Amenity Area Order is a reserved function.  The Order comes into operation on being confirmed and may be revoked or varied by a subsequent Order.  Subsection (5) of Section 42 requires the Planning authority to review the matter from time to time and at least once in every period of five years for the <Col N="1789" /> purpose of deciding whether it is desirable to revoke or amend the Order.</P>
    <P>The purpose of an Order under Section 42 is to establish for the information of land owners, developers, and the public generally, that a particular area of land is under control of a specified nature.  The Order may provide for no development or for specified development only being permitted under the Act, or may restrict development to a limited part of the area.  Alternatively, the Order may impose limitations on the number of structures of any specified class which may be erected in any part of the area.</P>
    <P>The Order may be employed to preserve the areas of great natural beauty which are now threatened with development.  Areas of this kind are national&mdash;indeed one might say international&mdash;assets and are of prime importance to our tourist industry. Spoliation, whether by haphazard erection of inharmonious developments such as buildings, filling stations, advertisement hordings, or use for temporary huts or caravans, must be discouraged and, as far as possible prevented.  Accordingly, it is considered that areas of natural beauty should be capable of preservation without liability for compensation and Section 56 (1) (h) provides accordingly. An Order under this section may also be utilised to establish the precise boundaries and nature of development control in a green belt area.  Some of the objects of a green belt are:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  To secure economy by encouraging priority in the development of land in the area within the inner edge of the green belt and by preventing ribboning and unlimited sprawl (with consequential lengthening of lines of services and communications).</P>
    <P>(2)  To provide city dwellers with readier access to open country and to recreational areas, and (3)  To provide sites for institutions needing substantial grounds.</P>
    <P>Pockets for development must be excluded from green belts, for example, around existing towns or villages in order to relieve pressure for intrusion into the green belt proper, <Col N="1790" /> and to secure maximum use of services in the towns and villages.  In the green belt itself permissible development might include residences subject to the preservation of a density of not more than one house to five acres.  It might also include ancillary, domestic or agricultural outoffices.  Under Section 26, conditions requiring planting and landscaping may be attached to the grant of permission.  Amenity area orders must be reviewed at intervals in justice to the persons with land interests in the area, and also to allow of any peripheral expansion of built up areas that may be found to be essential.  It is also the case that the present concept of what is an amenity area may alter with the growth in motor traffic and the consequential greater mobility of people.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill deals with compensation.  The 1934 Act contemplated that the main awards of compensation in respect of Town Planning would be disbursed soon after the making of a planning scheme.  The Act provided that claims for compensation in respect of restrictions imposed by the planning scheme should be made on the local planning authority within 12 months of the coming into operation of the scheme, or such longer time as the scheme itself would provide.  Apart from other difficulties inherent in the Act itself, this single provision was sufficient to cause many local authorities to hesitate about making a planning scheme.  They were caught between the natural inclination to make a scheme which would provide for as many of the foreseeable developments in their areas as was practical and on the other hand risking that compensation claims beyond the means of the authority to pay would be submitted.  There are it is true considerable escape clauses in the Act but it is obviously unsatisfactory that a public body should go through the long procedure necessary to make a planning scheme, and then have to dodge the issue because at the last minute it found that the cumulative cost might be greater than it could afford to pay.</P>
    <P>It may be supposed that a planning authority could anticipate the likely <Col N="1791" /> compensation which would be payable in respect of a planning scheme but the widely differing figures which are frequently reported in the Press as the prices paid for individual properties in our towns and countryside show the impossibility of forecasting with any reasonable degree of certainty what compensation would amount to in respect of a comprehensive planning scheme.</P>
    <P>Part VI of this Bill has been drafted to avoid these difficulties and to remove the uncertainty in which the private property owner or developer is left as to when he is likely to be compensated.</P>
    <P>Section 55 of the Bill provides for compensation in respect of planning restrictions as they arise, that is when the planning authority refuses permission or grants conditional permission for development.  A very considerable advantage to property owners is the fact that a claim may be made without having to wait for any over-all plan or planning scheme to come into operation.  The section provides that a claim may be made within six months of the relevant decision or such longer period as the Minister may in any particular case allow.  The Act of 1934 did not provide for compensation on foot of interim control directions; the Act of 1939 allowed some concession in cases of hardship but otherwise, as I have said, a planning scheme had to be in operation and claims had to be related to the restrictions imposed by such a scheme.  The basis of compensation was the reduction in the value of the claimant's estate or interest in the property and, in the case of an occupier of such property, the damage (if any) to his trade, business or profession, occasioned by such restriction.  This basis is preserved in Section 55.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) sets out generally accepted principles for the purpose of removing any doubt which might arise on these points.  The effect of a refusal of permission for a particular development project need not be to sterilise the site completely.  Accordingly, in determining reduction of value, regard must be had to any alternative development <Col N="1792" /> for which permission is available or which the planning authority undertake to permit.  Regard must also be had to the fact that exempted development may be carried out without permission.  On the other hand, reasonable allowance must be made for the fact that certain minimum requirements and standards would have to be complied with if the development were permitted &mdash; these are covered by the reference to paragraphs 1, 2, 4 and 6 of Part II of the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that compensation shall not be payable thereunder in respect of any interest in land which it is the duty of the planning authority to acquire under Section 29.  This duty arises only if the owner claims that the land is incapable of reasonably beneficial use in its existing state and elects to serve a purchase notice; in other words, he has a choice of claiming for loss of value or, if the land is quite useless, of disposing of it to the planning authority.</P>
    <P>Section 56 sets out a number of matters in respect of which planning restrictions may be imposed without liability for compensation.  It has long been recognised that it is not in the public interest that property owners should have unrestricted right to use, develop or exploit their property as they see fit.  Property carries obligations as well as rights and the Constitution, while recognising rights of private property, provides that such rights may be delimited by law.</P>
    <P>Existing legislation provides that a planning scheme may contain declarations that no compensation shall be payable for a wide range of planning provisions included in the scheme. The Bill does not propose to extend materially those restrictions on compensation. I should point out that Section 56 will not operate so as to prevent payment of compensation where permission is refused for the replacement of structures demolished or destroyed by fire in the two years preceding application.</P>
    <P>Section 57 further restricts the liability of a planning authority to pay compensation in respect of the refusal <Col N="1793" /> of permission for development, if, when a claim is made for compensation, the planning authority undertake to grant or have already granted permission for development of a residential, commercial or industrial character, or any combination thereof.  This is really an extension of the provisions in regard to zoning, for example, if an area is zoned for residential purposes, no compensation would be payable in respect of a refusal of permission for the erection of, say, a factory in such zone.</P>
    <P>Where a planning authority give an undertaking to grant permission it is assumed for the purpose of this section that the only conditions which will be attached would not be such as would attract compensation&mdash;if other conditions are in fact later imposed that decision will itself enable the making of a fresh claim for compensation.</P>
    <P>If a permission is revoked or modified under Section 30 compensation may be claimed under Section 58.  Compensation is payable on the same basis as if the permission were refused in the first instance or, where the permission is modified by the imposition of conditions, compensation is payable as if the condition were imposed when the permission was granted originally. In either case if the revocation or modification renders abortive works already carried out in pursuance of the permission originally granted, this section requires that the planning authority shall pay compensation in respect of the expenditure incurred. The claim under this head may include expenditure reasonably incurred in the preparation of plans or upon other similar matters preparatory to the carrying out of the works.  As an alternative to a claim under this section, a purchase notice may be served under Section 29 and, if the notice is confirmed by the Minister or accepted by the planning authority, no compensation will be payable under the section.</P>
    <P>Section 59 deals with compensation for the removal or alteration of any structure under Section 36, that is a structure other than an unauthorised structure, and Section 60 with compensation for damage suffered by <Col N="1794" /> the depreciation of any interest in land as a result of the discontinuance of any use of land consequent on a notice under Section 37.  Compensation under Section 60 may also be claimed in respect of compliance with conditions imposed by a notice under Section 37. Other compensation provisions are made in Section 61 which relates to the removal or alteration of hedges consequent upon a notice under Section 44, Section 62 which relates to the compulsory creation of a public right-of-way, Section 63 which relates to powers of entry on land and Section 64 which relates to cables, wires and pipe lines passing through or over land other than a public road.</P>
    <P>Section 65 provides for claims which may be made for compensation in respect of planning restrictions imposed under the present Acts.  The existing position is that no liability falls on the planning authority until they have brought a scheme into operation. Affected property owners may then make their claim under Section 61 of the 1934 Act in respect of the covering provisions in the scheme.  If the scheme contains no covering provisions for the interim directions, compensation may be payable under Section 64 of the 1934 Act for unnecessary refusal of permission or making of a prohibition. Compensation might also be claimed under Section 60 of the 1934 Act in respect of any reduction in the value of property arising out of compliance with any condition attached to an interim direction.</P>
    <P>Section 65 aims at preserving the rights which have accrued under the 1934 Act.  Subsection (2) (a) covers cases arising under Sections 60 and 61 of the 1934 Act while subsection (3) covers cases arising under Section 64 of that Act.  The rights so being preserved are made subject to the restrictions and limitations on compensation which are contained in the 1934 Act.  A planning scheme may contain a declaration that no compensation is payable on account of the coming into operation of provisions relating to matters specified in the Acts of 1934 and 1939 but the 1934 Act also provides that the Minister is not to approve of a planning scheme containing any of these declarations <Col N="1795" /> unless he is satisfied that it is just and reasonable.</P>
    <P>The method proposed for continuing the position under the 1934 Act is to assume that a planning scheme has come into operation on the date on which this Bill comes into operation. Claims may be made within a period of twelve months from that date. Compensation will then be payable by the planning authority unless they decide that it would not have been payable under the presumed scheme by virtue of the Act of 1934.  The amount of compensation is to be the like amount as would have been appropriate to be paid under the Act of 1934.  Accordingly, subsection (4) provides that the amendment of the Act of 1919 affected by this Act shall be disregarded in the event of compensation under this section being determined by arbitration.  It is to be expected that a planning authority will endeavour to avoid payment of compensation in any case where it appears to them that their planning scheme might have included a declaration excluding compensation for the particular restriction involved.  If a scheme were really to be made, it would be for the Minister to decide whether such declaration was just and reasonable before confirming the scheme.  Accordingly, provision is made in this subsection whereby an appeal may be made to the Minister within one month of the decision of the planning authority and he may either refuse the appeal or annul the decision.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) (c) requires the Minister in deciding an appeal to have regard to the same considerations that he would have had regard to under Section 30 of the 1934 Act in relation to a declaration in the planning scheme prohibiting compensation.  He must be satisfied that, having regard to local circumstances, it is just and reasonable that the provision should be enforced without compensation.  He must also be satisfied that compensation for loss or injury is not excluded where a scheme would prevent maintenance or continued use of a building or structure or the making of reasonable <Col N="1796" /> alterations or additions thereto, or the replacement of a building or of a structure within two years after it had been demolished or destroyed by fire or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to make any assessment of the likely amount of compensation payable by planning authorities.  Interim control is in operation in the great majority of planning districts and there must be many cases where permission was refused or was granted subject to conditions.  In theory these cases will now be eligible for consideration under subsection (2) (a) but the likelihood is that alternative development has since taken place in many cases.  Even if a claim is made the planning authority may be able to show that it would be just and reasonable not to allow compensation. In many cases, also, changes of ownership will have occurred and the present owner may be interested in some other use or development of the land and may not enter any claim.</P>
    <P>The purpose of subsection (3) is to continue the provisions of Section 64 of the 1934 Act but, in view of the provisions of subsection (2) it is difficult to visualise what cases will arise. The original section appears to have been intended to cover a case where permission was refused or a prohibition order was made in respect of work which it transpired was not subsequently restricted or prevented by a provision in a planning scheme.  Compensation for loss was to be allowed unless in the opinion of the Arbitrator the doing of the work would have prejudiced the efficient and economical execution of the planning scheme.  It is now proposed under subsection (3) (a) that an appeal should lie to the Minister if a claim of this kind is refused by the planning authority on the grounds that the work would have prejudiced the efficient and economical execution of the planning scheme.</P>
    <P>I have explained Section 65 at some length because I think it is important to make it clear that as far as it is possible to do so, provision is being made to preserve the rights of any persons who might have obtained compensation under the Act of 1934. The remainder of the compensation <Col N="1797" /> provisions appear to be self explanatory but I will refer briefly to the provisions of Section 71.  The purpose of this section is to enable the planning authority to recover compensation if, within a period of fourteen years, the land in respect of which the compensation was paid is developed for residential, commercial or industrial purposes, or any combination thereof, or in such other manner as would make recovery reasonable.  The section is based on recognition of the need for elasticity in planning and that, as the planning objectives may have to be adapted to changing circumstances, planning authorities may from time to time change their minds about the type or extent of development which is permissible on particular lands.</P>
    <P>The object of Part VII of the Bill is to give planning authorities positive powers to secure, facilitate and carry out development.  Hitherto, planning authorities have tended to concentrate on the restrictive aspect of their functions.  This Bill envisages, however, that in the future planning authorities will play an active and indeed a leading part, in the fostering of rural communities, the resuscitation of our country towns, and the re-development of obsolete areas in our larger towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Planning authorities have power under Section 11 of the Local Government (No. 2) Act, 1960, to acquire land either by agreement or compulsorily for the purposes of any of their functions.  Without prejudice to that power Section 72 sets out a number of purposes for which land may be acquired by a planning authority.  The purpose of the section is to make explicit the right of planning authorities to engage in the development or re-development of land in the interests of orderly and economic development. These provisions are extended by Section 76 which enables sites to be acquired for a variety of purposes including industry and for the provision of factory buildings, offices and other premises, together with ancillary services.  Under Section 74 planning authorities may sell, lease or exchange any land acquired or appropriated by <Col N="1798" /> them for the purpose of securing the proper planning and development of their area.  The Minister's consent will not be necessary unless the price or rent is not the best reasonably obtainable or the development proposed for the land would materially contravene the development plan.</P>
    <P>These provisions of the Bill will enable planning authorities to undertake urban renewal.  Hitherto, planning had been hampered, especially in the central areas of towns, by the fact that land is split up into a great many parcels in different ownership.  As a result private re-development tends to be piecemeal, freezing for generations ahead the existing street pattern which is becoming increasingly outmoded by a mounting volume of car traffic and the needs of a developing economy. Re-planning and re-building on modern lines requires the assembly of sites, and this can often be achieved only if the planning authority acquire the area.</P>
    <P>Part VIII of the Bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, some of which I have already mentioned. I would like to draw attention to the fact that recognition of the importance of planning is such that specific provision is made to bind State authorities not to carry out the construction or extension of any building without such consultation with the appropriate planning authority as may be determined by the Minister for Local Government, and, if objections raised by the planning authority are not resolved, the Minister himself must be consulted.</P>
    <P>Section 83 enables a planning authority to run cables, wires or pipelines over land not forming part of a public road or through such land.  It also provides a procedure to deal with the case where the consent of the owner or occupier is unreasonably withheld.  These powers may usefully be employed in dealing with modern developments in relation to relay television services or the transport of commodities by pipeline.</P>
    <P>The new building regulations envisaged in Section 84 will provide in a more flexible, modern and comprehensive form, a uniform building code <Col N="1799" /> which will operate throughout the whole country.  Not only will this code be more easily revised than the numerous and varied existing bye-laws, but it is hoped to incorporate sufficient flexibility to meet the frequent criticisms by architects that existing bye-laws restrict or prohibit erection of structures which take advantage of the advances made in design and materials.  Provision is made for standards to be expressed in terms of performance, types of material, methods of construction or otherwise and such standards may be made in relation to all or any of the matters specified in the Fifth Schedule. As a further measure of flexibility, provision is made in Section 85 for relaxation of building regulations in certain circumstances, and Section 86 provides for an appeal against refusal by the planning authority to relax building regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 87 deals with the licensing of structures on public roads and enables regulations to be made prescribing the amount of the fees to be paid for such licences.  Similar provisions already exist in various statutes in relation to petrol pumps, hoardings and scaffolds but these are being repealed.</P>
    <P>Finally, transitional matters are dealt with in Section 89.</P>
    <P>I shall welcome the fullest possible discussion on the provisions of this far reaching measure and I am very conscious of the great responsibility which rests on me in respect of its contents.  I have taken steps to familiarise myself with modern thought and practice in the sphere of Town Planning in Britain and in America and have recently had an opportunity of visiting the United States and Canada.  What I have seen there has fully convinced me not only of the desirability of planning but also of the absolute necessity of making our legislation more up-to-date and effective if we are to adapt our environment to modern living.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Bill has also involved detailed research by officers of my Department in the planning laws <Col N="1800" /> of many other countries and attendance and participation in summer schools, seminars and conferences dealing with planning and urban renewal, both in this country and abroad.  I have also had the benefit of the views of professional bodies and local authority officials, in particular the officials of the Dublin and Cork Corporations who have had considerable experience in the administration of the present Planning Acts.  I have recently arranged, with the co-operation of the Irish Branch of the Town Planning Institute, to have the senior local government officials from every local authority in the country attend an appreciation course comprising lectures by the President and other leading personalities of the Institute.  It is my belief that these lectures were so valuable in explaining the purpose and methods of planning that it would be well worth while making special arrangements to enable local representatives to hear lectures of this kind. It gives me great pleasure to be able to say here that I found these eminent and busy planning experts very helpful indeed and that I have arranged to avail myself of their generous offers of further assistance.</P>
    <P>Legislation may provide the machinery for planning and development, but its ultimate effectiveness will depend on the interest of public representatives both central and local and on action by the authorities charged with responsibility for administering the legislation.  Local development associations and other similar bodies can also play an essential part and I would welcome their fullest co-operation in the task of improving the quality of environment in our towns and countryside.</P>
    <P>I now commend the Bill to the House in the belief that it constitutes an effective medium through which we can carry out major and far-reaching improvements in our environmental conditions and preserve our Irish heritage of natural amenities for ourselves and for our descendants.</P>
