      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing members of the European Economic Community have certain defence commitments under the North Atlantic Treaty to which they are all parties.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the under-developed state of Irish industry and of the decision by Britain not to enter the Common Market unless the preferential trading situation with commonwealth countries is not substantially changed Ireland could seek membership which would protect her preferential trading pattern with Britain and not subject her to the intense European competition in industry and agriculture implicit in full membership of EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As a basic objective of the European Economic Community is the creation of a Common Market in which no member would have preference over any other member, it would be unrealistic to think that we could obtain membership while preserving our preferential trading pattern with Britain.</P>

      <P>The minimum rates at present payable to agricultural workers are those prescribed under the Agricultural Wages (Minimum <Col N="1488" /> Rates) Order, 1961, which came into operation on 30th October, 1961.  The minimum weekly rates prescribed under this Order for males aged 20 years and over represent an average increase of £79 per annum on the corresponding rates in operation in January, 1955.</P>
      <P>The increase between December, 1954 and December, 1961 (the latest period for which the information is available) in the average weekly earnings of industrial workers employed in transportable goods industries represents an average increase of £144 per annum.</P>
      <P>Since January, 1955 the rates of non-contributory old age pensions have been increased by £22 per annum. Since January, 1961, contributory pensions at rates up to £3 10s. Od. per week have been introduced for persons over 70 years of age and the number of non-contributory old age pensioners has been reduced by about 25 per cent.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The public is aware, from the extensive press and television publicity which has been given to the matter, of the relationship between excessive cigarette smoking and lung cancer, but for such as might wish to examine the matter in greater detail, information can be supplied by my Department on request.</P>
      <P>In regard to the younger age groups, a leaflet warning of the undesirability of commencing cigarette smoking is circulated periodically by my Department. It is proposed in future to issue supplies of the leaflet to all school leavers and to other youth groups as a regular feature.  I feel that these measures should be adequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies may not appreciate that there is always danger of an adverse psychological reaction to propaganda of this nature and that this makes it imperative that measures to <Col N="1490" /> educate the public in matters of this kind should be carried out with responsibility and discretion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked the Minister whether he will take steps to make the facts known through the medium of advertising in the newspapers. Is the Minister not satisfied <Col N="1491" /> that his attempts to make the public aware of the danger are grossly inadequate, in view of the fact that the manufacturers are using television, newspapers and the radio?  The fact that lung cancer is increasing by reason of the consumption of tobacco is sufficient evidence that his campaign is grossly inadequate.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister should accept that this is a very serious subject, affecting the lives of many people, and will he not agree that it has been demonstrated by reliable authorities that the smoking of cigarettes is a dangerous practice? Does he not accept that he should take steps, as he has taken steps in the case of other dangerous drugs, to legislate in some way against the continued use of this dangerous drug?</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that in recent months both newspaper and television propaganda by the tobacco companies has been directed towards the younger age groups; and if he will take steps to see that such a pernicious practice is discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee </NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what the Deputies mean by &ldquo;the younger age groups&rdquo;.  If they mean children, I am not aware that there <Col N="1492" /> has been any advertising of cigarettes directed towards this group.  Such advertising would indeed be pernicious as it is an offence under the Children Act, 1908 to sell cigarettes to persons under 16 years of age.  If the Deputies mean young men and women, I think that persons who have reached this age can take a responsible decision as to whether or not to smoke, without being unduly influenced by the propaganda of cigarette manufacturers. In any case, I have no authority to censor newspapers and similar publications and television items in the manner suggested nor do I propose to ask the legislature to give me such authority.  I am sure that if I were to do so, it would cause widespread public resentment, particularly as, logically, such authority would need to be in general terms and could be applied to a wide variety of social habits, such as dancing, cinema-going and use of intoxicants which, in moderation, are not pernicious but in excess could be injurious to health.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, a reputable medical journal points out this week that &ldquo;Sweden's experience suggests that prohibition of tobacco advertising would have little effect on consumption&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to an article on the Pharmacy Bill, 1962, in the current issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association on the lack of any proposed statutory insistence on the appointment of qualified pharmacists in the larger hospitals, where pharmaceutical skill of a high standard is increasingly often being required; and whether he thinks it necessary to deal with the position by introducing an amendment to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee </NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate to include such provisions in the Bill.  There is no statutory requirement, for instance, <Col N="1494" /> that physicians, surgeons and nurses be appointed to hospitals and the staffing of hospitals has not suffered as a result.</P>
      <P>Under the Local Government Acts, the Minister for Health has powers to prescribe qualifications for various posts in local authority hospitals and it must be common knowledge that it is insisted that all pharmacists employed in such hospitals must be appropriately qualified.  Consequently, I can only conclude that the writer of the article has voluntary hospitals in mind and I do not feel that the legislature should be called upon to interfere with the internal arrangements of these hospitals in this respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated on 7th March, 1962, in reply to previous questions concerning the affairs of Irish Estates Limited, the allegations contained in the circular letter dated 23rd February, 1962, copies of which, I understand, were received by a number of Deputies, were conveyed to me by the writer in June last.  Having made appropriate inquiries, I was satisfied that the matter did not call for any further action by me.</P>
      <P>As I also stated on the 7th March, the Board of the parent company, the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited, have informed me that, in view of the publicity now given to the allegations, they have asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce to appoint an inspector to hold an investigation into the affairs of Irish Estates Limited under Section 109 of the Companies Act, 1908.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to take steps to initiate a public inquiry.</P>

      <P>There is another Minister concerned.  They only dealt with me as a shareholder.  What I told the House previously was that, as a shareholder, I had no reason to make any further inquiries.  As far as my inquiry went, I was satisfied there was nothing irregular.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Finance (1) the statutory provisions in relation to (a) Irish Estates Limited and (b) the Irish Life Assurance Company Limited under which the accounts of the companies were audited by an officer of the Comptroller and Auditor General, (2) the statutory provisions under which a private firm of auditors and accountants was appointed to examine and approve the accounts of the companies, <Col N="1498" /> (3) the name of the person or body responsible for the appointment of such private firm, (4) the funds out of which the fees payable to such private firms have been or will be paid, and (5) the reasons why it was decided to alter the practice by which the audit in respect of these companies was carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan </NameTxt>
      <P>While the Comptroller and Auditor General has acted as auditor for the Irish Life Assurance Co. Limited, I understand that he has never so acted for Irish Estates Limited.</P>
      <P>There are no statutory provisions relating specifically to the auditing of these two companies.  Every company registered under the Companies Act is obliged under Section 112 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, to appoint an auditor at each annual general meeting to hold office until the next annual general meeting.  The auditors of the two companies referred to are, therefore, appointed annually by the companies themselves which pay the audit fees.  A change of auditor is a matter entirely for a company itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan </NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the auditor for the parent company up to 1959 was the Comptroller and Auditor General?  Up to that date, a private company acted as auditors for Irish Estates Limited. Would the Minister now state why the Comptroller and Auditor General disappeared as auditor in 1959 and the private auditors for Irish Estates Ltd. moved in as auditors for the parent company?  Would the Minister explain to the House why, as a major shareholder, he has no knowledge of why that took place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a major shareholder, I agreed to it at the time.  It was put to me that the Irish Assurance Company was regarded by the people generally as a Government institution and the fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General made the audit lent a great deal of weight to that.  They wanted to get away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1499" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister's reply would appear to cast doubts on the weight the public would give to the Comptroller and Auditor General acting as auditor?  In view of the fact that he is auditor of many other State and semi-State concerns, the Minister will agree there is no apparent reason why this significant change took place in 1959?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other companies concerned may not have the same degree of competition in their dealings with the public.  I may say the Irish Assurance Company some years before that changed from the auditor they had to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  They did so of their own volition.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1500" /> The Government is unable to accept liability, by way of the creation of a fund or otherwise, for compensation to private individuals or business concerns who suffered losses as a result of the recent flooding.</P>
    <P>I would point out, however, that it is open to persons who have suffered damage of a structural nature to their private dwellings to apply to the Department of Local Government for a grant under the Housing Acts towards the cost of repairing the damage.  Local authorities are empowered to make supplementary grants for the same purpose, if they so wish, and may apply for loans from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47, 48 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of tidal flooding at Cork is one primarily for the local authorities concerned.  I understand that the responsible officers of the Cork Corporation have presented a report on the causes of the recent flooding.  I do not think that any useful purpose would be served by the carrying out of an inspection or investigation by my Department at this stage.  The determination of the preventive measures which might prove practicable and effective will require detailed and mature consideration by all the interests involved.  It would be premature <Col N="1518" /> to consider at this juncture the method of financing whatever scheme, if any, may be found practicable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand from the Minister that he has no expert in his Department who might be of assistance to Cork Corporation in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney </NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite probable that we have not got such an expert. Apart from that, as the Deputy is well aware, an investigation has been under way for some time under the auspices of the corporation, and probably the Harbour Authority as well, though I am not sure about the latter, and a report was presented yesterday to the Cork Corporation.  So far, my Department have not received the results of that preliminary investigation.  Until such time as we do, and until such time as we have had an opportunity of examining them, we are not in a position to advise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the Minister leaves the door open and does not inform us he will not assist us in the matter, I am quite satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister now state publicly for the benefit of the people of Cork city and county, and particularly those in Youghal, that he is prepared to come to the assistance of those who have been marooned or without house or home for the past week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Although that is a different matter, I should like to inform the Deputy that no such assurance can be given by me because I am not fully aware of the problem created by the recent flooding, other than the reports I have read in the newspapers, not all of which may be relevant on mature consideration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>Since the Consultative Council was set up in 1956 by agreement with the Subpostmasters' Union there have been three major pay settlements and a number of increases in allowances following agreements reached by the council.  These have <Col N="1521" /> resulted in a total increase of about £130,000 a year in the remuneration of subpostmasters.  In the circumstances, I cannot agree that the consultative machinery is inadequate.  I would not be prepared to receive a deputation from the union.</P>

We also have an exceptionally long coastline. These resources together with our friendliness are very favourable to our tourist industry.  Before the War, most of our hotels were closed for most of the year because our tourist season was short.  It covered a week in July, the month of August, and a week in September.  I am very glad that there has been a move to extend the season to cover, if possible, June, July, August and September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another great attraction and one for which the promoters must be complimented is the new Irish Derby.  The Irish Hospitals Trust are to be complimented on providing the big money prize.  The Irish Derby will be the most richly endowed race in Europe this year.  That is one of the results of taking over the National Stud and developing our bloodstock industry. Now that the owners of horses in Europe and all over the world have learned the value of the race they will bring their horses to race at the Curragh.  Instead of looking to <Col N="1526" /> England and the Continent, we now know that the potentialities are here at home and only need to be brought out.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that Telefís Éireann has proved to be so good.  It is better than many of us expected. The choice of programmes is good and I feel that Telefís Éireann will revive many of our Irish customs and much of our culture.  Anyone who watches English television knows that Scottish dances and music have been revived and given new life.  They have become very popular, and I feel that the same thing will happen here.  Our culture and our music will be revived and we will be able to compete with the imported American pop songs and all the rest from Tin Pan Alley.</P>
    <P>I am very keen to see films about Ireland.  I expect that such films will be made available by Telefís Éireann to other countries.  I was in Denmark a few years ago and stayed in a farmer's house.  One night the children were studying their books.  When they came to their English lessons they asked me to give them a hand. When I took up the English book I discovered that most of it was devoted to small pen pictures of the different countries of the world.  They took up roughly about two pages each. Naturally, coming from Ireland I was very anxious to read what the book had to say about Ireland.</P>
    <P>I was horrified when I read the story of Ireland in that book.  It said that we were a poor nation, that we had clay floors in our kitchens and rooms, and that pigs and poultry lived in the houses.  That struck me very forcibly. I bought a copy of the book and presented it to the Department here, and they took it up with the United Nations.  That is only one small incident. When films produced in Ireland go to other countries, those countries will realise the type of country Ireland is, what our standards are and what our homes are like.  They will get a completely different idea about Ireland. We must remember, if we join the Common Market, that there are quite a number of countries that do not realise what type of country ours is. <Col N="1527" /> The Scandinavian countries particularly think of us as another island beyond England and do not realise that we have our own identity and our own nation.</P>
    <P>When we went to Denmark we brought with us a film depicting the countryside in the West of Ireland and featuring the life of Yeats.  This film was widely discussed and appreciated. On our last night there the film &ldquo;The Quiet Man&rdquo; was shown.  The Danes were very impressed with the Irish countryside and scenery as shown in those films.  If films produced here for Telefís Éireann are sent abroad they will create a very favourable impression and will help the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will provide more money for the telephone service. Most Deputies are conscious of the large number of applicants awaiting telephone connection for a long time.</P>

      <P>It is gratifying to note that the Forestry Section have set a target of planting 25,000 acres each year.  It is an ambitious programme.  They purchase land on the open market.  Employment is provided and the wealth of the nation is being developed for the benefit of future generations.  Other countries realise the value of forestry. Fifty-five per cent. of the national income of Sweden is derived from forestry.  We shall feel the benefit of the forestry programme in the years ahead.  We cannot afford to allow our mountain and waste land to lie idle. Forestry is the ideal method of utilising such land.  I should like to see the waste land adjacent to bogs utilised more fully.  I am thinking now of areas such as Ballivor, Rochfort Bridge and Timahoe.</P>

    <P>In the past five years we have made the greatest progress ever in industrial development.  Hardly a week goes by that we do not read of the establishment of a new factory.

      <P>Thirty years ago, we depended solely on our agricultural exports to pay for our purchases abroad.  Now we have three strings to our bow: agriculture, industry and tourism.  Last year, exports from each of these sources were practically equal. More money is coming into the country, more money is in circulation and there is much more employment.</P>
      <P>Five years ago, the unemployment figure was about 90,000.  Today it is about 49,000.  When this Government came into office a programme of economic expansion was embarked upon.  The plight of the country at that time was such that a five-year plan was required.  The results have been extremely good.  In the first year, there was a two per cent. increase in production and there has been a five per cent. increase in each of the past three years.  That is much better than was expected and the country is feeling the beneficial results of the improvement.</P>
      <P>Seven thousand new jobs each year are provided through industry.  Observe how we have made use of our natural resources.  Consider Bord na Móna. Our bogs were lying derelict for years. They now provide considerable employment as well as electricity and fuel.  We must not forget the Electricity Supply Board and Aer Lingus.  It was said that Aer Lingus would never survive and that Shannon Airport would not be used.  It was said that the North Atlantic route could not pay.  In its first year of operation, it more than paid for itself and it has been showing a profit ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider the position of the factories which were set up here.  It is hoped that the aircraft factory at Baldonnel <Col N="1529" /> will provide another 1,700 jobs. There is not a hope of maintaining a high rate of employment on the land and therefore work must be provided for people in industry.  We are making very satisfactory progress in that regard.  In view of the results of the past five years and of the prospects which lie ahead, I have no hesitation in saying that we should pass this Vote on Account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote traditionally gives an opportunity of making a reference to the economic condition of the country.  Even a scant study of the debate in the past week or so indicates that there are Deputies who are not alive to the general economic condition of the country or to the position of our people.  It is rather tragic that, after 40 years of self-government, we have not made of this island much more than a waiting room for England.  Mention was made of additional jobs.  Were it not that England is convenient to us we should have a colossal unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>The emigrant ship has been the stand-by of this Government and, indeed, of all Governments since we achieved a measure of independence. That may be inevitable.  It may be that there is no overall solution for the problems which beset this nation.  At the same time, it behoves us to use our best endeavours to make it possible for Irish people to live here.  It behoves us to try to remove from the Irish scene this day to day picture of compulsory emigration.</P>
      <P>The problem of emigration has never been adequately tackled: I suppose it has never been adequately examined and the answers to the problem have not been thought out.  I do not say that I have the answers to it any more than anybody else but I think that, unless we find some way of stopping this emigratory trend we shall surely arrive, if not in our lifetime, certainly within the next 50 years, at a population of not more than 1,000,000 people.  That terrible process may well be speeded up by the advent of the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has been concerned to a considerable extent with our prospects <Col N="1530" /> in relation to the Common Market and, up and down the country, learned economists, professors, sea-lawyers, politicians and various people are talking about what the Common Market will mean in terms of our economy and what changes it may bring.  Really, nobody knows what it may bring; we have not the slightest idea of the effect our entry into the Common Market will produce, except that we anticipate, as has been said, greater competition and that will mean, as has also been said <i>ad nauseam</i>, that we must get our people to work harder, to produce more and become more efficient.</P>
    <P>These words and thoughts which have been expressed really add up to very little because we shall not know what we shall have to face until we are in the situation of the Common Market. Some people are inclined to think that we should not go into this integration of European economy but, of course, we have no real choice in the matter.  If Britain goes, we must go also.  In any event, even if that were not so, we cannot stand aside from the stream of progress but we must participate in world affairs.  We must do what we can to get our share of whatever prosperity this pooling of resources will produce.</P>
    <P>So far as workers are concerned, they are entitled to ask what it will mean in terms of wages and living conditions to them.  A certain standard of relative prosperity has been achieved by some sections of workers but the vast body of them, mainly in agriculture and rural employment such as roadwork and forestry, are living far below the level at which they should live in terms of conditions, in terms of housing, for one thing and in terms of income, for another.  Until that vast body of people have had their conditions improved very much, we cannot say that prosperity has advanced to any appreciable extent in the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Government have been proposing to improve the salaries of certain classes of public servants, such as judges and so on.  That indicates a great lack of appreciation of the relative importance of things&mdash;to have a proposal to increase the salary of a judge <Col N="1531" /> by the equivalent of what is paid to 15 old age pensioners per week, with no hint given that the lot of the old age pensioner will be improved even in the slightest degree.  How can anybody or any Government, in conscience, seek to justify such a step, that one person should have his income increased by £1,000 while the old age pensioners who, as we know are legion in number, are left struggling to live, and finding it very difficult, on 30/- a week?  It shows a complete and utter lack of what is needed and urgently needed from an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>A problem which bears heavily on local authorities and indeed on people generally is the need for the building of more houses.  After the last war, we were fortunate in having a Government in power who concentrated upon building the maximum number of houses. We were fortunate also in having in the Custom House a Minister now dead, the late Tim Murphy, who was dedicated to the solution of the housing problem, among other things.  While he was there, and certain of his successors, considerable progress was made in tackling this problem.  At that time, I recall the housing needs of Dublin city were estimated at some 30,000 and, due to the drive and enthusiasm put into the job by the public official who is now city manager, the number of houses provided since then has run up into the region of 20,000.</P>
    <P>At present, there is, and has been for the past couple of years, a slackening of effort in regard to housing.  In my view, this stems from the fact that the Department and the Minister for Local Government have not given the leadership and encouragement which should be given to local authorities in this matter.  They have not pressurised them as was done in other times to get results and get them quickly.</P>
    <P>One of the problems and blind spots in regard to the planning of rehousing our people is, to my mind, the fact that we seem to base our housing needs upon the immediate number of people who are at that particular time in need of houses.  This is a short-sighted and bad policy.  Local authorities should be directed by the Minister, when estimating <Col N="1532" /> housing needs, to provide a certain percentage of houses in excess of the actual then-existing figure which is estimated, because as we know, families grow up and new families develop and it is highly desirable that we should at least try to breast the tide by having more houses built than are actually required when the investigation of needs is undertaken.</P>
    <P>C.I.E. is a problem that has caused endless controversy over a long period of years.  As a Deputy representing Dublin bus users, I think that the manner in which they have been treated by C.I.E. is inexcusable.  The people of Dublin city and county have been used to bolster up the pretence that C.I.E. is becoming a viable economic unit.  They have been robbed and their pockets rifled by extortionate bus fares in order to create the illusion that the undertaking can be made economic in the accepted business sense of the word.  Surely it is the worst policy, and indefensible, that purely in order to get a favourable balance sheet, branch lines should be closed down and rural areas left without services and the working people of Dublin literally robbed in bus fares, purely to enable the Chairman of C.I.E. and perhaps the Minister to say: &ldquo;C.I.E. are breaking even.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Public transport is essential.  Railways and buses are essential.  No reason can be produced as to why they should be made pay in the sense that a business must.  That kind of thinking belongs to the Victorian era.  The most enlightened democratic countries today accept the fact that, even though there may be losses in the running of transport systems, as there must be losses in the running of hospitals, they are essential services.  There is no obligation, no divine law, which says: public transport must pay.  Therefore, the losses should be met.  However, they should not be met as they have been met, and as has been condoned by the Government and by the Minister concerned, by mulcting the working people in places such as Ballyfermot, Finglas, County Dublin and the rural areas in order to create the illusion of their being a viable economic unit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> I do not suppose there will be much change in the Minister's attitude on this matter.  He has obviously dug in his heels as far as C.I.E. are concerned and is prepared to condone anything they do.  The day is not far distant when something will have to be done. On the one hand, the workers are paying extortionate bus fares and, on the other hand, there is this time and motion effort&mdash;I do not know if Deputies are familiar with it&mdash;where for a couple of years there is a man employed with a stop watch doing nothing except watching men working, taking notes and getting £50 a week for it.</P>

      <P>I wish to make a passing reference to tourism.  I know very little about it except what I learned from living for a while in a seaside town where I saw visitors being fleeced on the general principle and assumption that they would never come that way again and therefore every advantage had to be taken of them. That mentality has prevailed in respect of a large number of our seaside towns. That kind of thing has done tourism a great deal of harm.</P>
      <P>I do not know how Bord Fáilte, who produce this luxurious stationery on which their annual reports appear, arrive at their figures as to the value of tourism to this country.  They talk in terms of millions and of increases in millions.  It is hard to understand how they can determine such figures, considering that a large proportion of what we call tourists are made up of returning emigrants, Irish people coming home with a few pounds they have saved in Manchester, London and elsewhere in order to spend Easter or Christmas with their families.  That surely must run into several million pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been considerable controversy in Dublin and justifiably so, over the proposed destruction by the E.S.B. of Georgian houses.  However, in regard to the monstrosity erected in the past couple of years by Bord Fáilte as their <Col N="1534" /> headquarters at Baggot Street Bridge, if this is an example of the thinking of Bord Fáilte in relation to modern architecture, then Heaven help us.  It is a poor look-out if the Georgian facade at Fitzwilliam Street is to be left to the mercies of modernistic architects such as are responsible for the Bord Fáilte building.</P>
    <P>That brings to mind the position of the E.S.B.  There has been developing amongst the officials who run the multiplicity of State companies and bodies of various kinds&mdash;I understand there are some 50 of them&mdash;an authoritarianism by which they consider themselves in many cases to be above all law.  We have often asked questions here about the running of the E.S.B., Bord na Móna or C.I.E., invariably to be told that the Minister has no function.  If you try to see some of the higher officials of some of these bodies &mdash;certainly as far as C.I.E. are concerned&mdash;you will not see them.  They are too busy to talk to members of the Dáil who might have something to say to them about the interests of their constituents.  They are unchallengeable and unchallenged.  That is a highly undesirable situation to allow to develop.</P>
    <P>It is quite conceivable that the E.S.B., in spite of the widely expressed opposition of the majority of the citizens of Dublin, may very well go ahead and demolish Fitzwilliam Street. There will be no remedy for that. Nobody will be able to make an effective protest nor can it be prevented because of the way the Dáil is harnessed and spanceled.  This applies particularly to the E.S.B., having regard to the arbitrary manner in which they operate their services&mdash;this business of cutting off lights without notice and leaving people literally in the dark.</P>
    <P>Many times in working class areas people have got into difficulties, could not pay their E.S.B. bill and so had the current disconnected.  This is done without any regard to the human side of the problem, without any consideration for the people who live in the house.  There is this authoritarian attitude: &ldquo;We are answerable to nobody and we shall do very much as we like.&rdquo; It is high time something was <Col N="1535" /> done to curb that attitude on the part of people who, after all, are no more than public servants.  Surely the elected representatives of the people should have the right to make these people answerable for their actions or inaction, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated recently that he will find it necessary to increase taxation in the coming Budget.  It is to be hoped that, in doing so, he will bring a different frame of mind to the problem from that which was applied to the increases in the judges' salaries.  If money is to be found by increased taxation, I think that the working people of this country are already sufficiently heavily taxed.  They are labouring under the burden of taxation far more than the farmers are.  Of course, the farmers have greater means of making their case and making themselves felt.  The wage earners are the people who have to pay for everything they buy&mdash;they are always cash customers. Most of them in regard to most aspects of the family economy have to meet the maximum, from the point of view of differential rents, bus fares and all the rest of it.  The cost of the pint to the worker at the present time is simply outrageous.  If the Minister is thinking in terms of making his own case, on his own head be the results.</P>

I hope the Minister will approach the problems of the future <Col N="1536" /> with far more responsibility than has been shown lately, especially in regard to the matter to which I refer&mdash;the extraordinary proposal to increase the salaries of judges, while no mention or thought whatsoever seems to be given to the deplorable conditions of the old age pensioner.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an Vóta seo.  I listened attentively during the past few days to this debate and I was particularly depressed by the sobs, moans and groans from the Opposition benches regarding the state of the country.  They would give the impression that the banshee was again on the trail.  Their wailing was more or less like the story of the walrus and the oysters.  Certainly, there did not seem to be anything constructive in quite a lot of their criticisms which would lead one to believe that they had any ambitions to get back to this side of the House.  If they had, I do not think their speeches would have wandered off at such a tangent.  I do not think they would have made such clearly irresponsible statements.</P>
      <P>In view of what was said regarding many of the provisions in the Vote on Account, I think it would not be out of place to give a few undeniable, stubborn and hard facts with regard to agriculture.  It is fully realised and admitted that our agricultural exports for 1961 were very much in excess of those for 1960, and 1960 was in itself a record year.  The volume of our agricultural production at home, both in 1960 and in 1961, has also increased. It is estimated that an extra £8 million has gone into the farmers' pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might be no harm for us to review briefly some of the help given out of general taxation towards helping the agricultural community.  There are various price supports&mdash;almost in the region of £12 million.  We have the fertiliser scheme which has as its aim increased production from the land.  It is being subsidised to the extent of £2 million or £3 million.  We have that other useful scheme&mdash;the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme.  Various sums are also provided under the heading of education and advisory services, not to mention the amount of money <Col N="1537" /> spent on trying to get the land reclaimed and put into useful production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have provided money for all those schemes, including land reclamation.  They have abandoned the scheme of spending £500 per acre on land under the so-called Land Project and provided a scheme which every farmer knows constitutes an intelligent approach to the matter.  I am not boasting about all the support given out of taxation to the farming community&mdash;by no means. I am merely stating these few facts in view of the moans we heard from the other side and in view of the fact that some of them would like the people to believe that we on this side of the House were totally and fully engaged in the process of trying to squeeze the ordinary farmers out of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who approaches agriculture from a sane point of view will realise that there are many difficulties which beset any agricultural community, and notably the Irish community.  We are in the difficult position that we have to export about one-third of our surplus agricultural goods.  We have to export these goods in a highly competitive market&mdash;a market into which goods are sent from many other countries.  These goods are subsidised by industries in those countries and we <Col N="1538" /> have to compete in those difficult circumstances.  Everybody realises that that leaves the Irish producer in a difficult position.</P>
    <P>In that respect, I think it would be no harm if we paid more attention to pig production, to the production of a higher grade of pigs for export to these markets and to a more intensive campaign in advertising our goods abroad, so that even our exiles in these countries would stand behind our products and support them, not only because they have personal ties with this country but also because the goods we are producing are better than anything else in the market at the same price.</P>
    <P>We all know the difficult problem of milk production in this country. The Government have been making efforts to have our surplus milk channelled to other purposes and milk powder factories are being established. I do not say that this will solve the problem because we shall be up against the difficulty of finding a market, but, at the same time, it must be admitted that of the total increase the milk producers got over the last decade, what they got from the Opposition was only a halfpenny per gallon.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to wheat is that we now grow more than we need.  Only about 75 per cent. of our total wheat yield is all that is needed by the millers.  It is a well-known fact that in countries where the standard of living is increased, the consumption of bread decreases and that is one of the principal reasons for the decrease in the amount of wheat needed in this country.  So far as the millability of wheat is concerned, there may have been some cases in which wheat was rejected by one miller and allowed to go through somewhere else, but generally these were exceptional cases. There is need for some standard of millability, in view of the decrease in the consumption of bread.</P>
    <P>It is known that when we go into the E.E.C., there will be a gradual process whereby various difficulties of agriculture will be smoothed out and it is expected that by 1970 the whole <Col N="1539" /> position will be more or less harmonised. Frequently very loose comparisons are made between this country and the member countries of E.E.C. and that is particularly so in relation to milk.  I do not think sufficient regard is paid to the standard of milk production and to the price per gallon in these countries and I refer particularly to the fat content of the milk.  There are also different standards in respect of wheat moisture.</P>
    <P>I make these points about agriculture to reassure the people that the Government do not feel that agriculture is down and out or that the people engaged in it are being wiped off the face of rural Ireland.  Very far from it &mdash;the Government are very concerned and are studying the matter day by day to see how they can help the agricultural community.  There has been much loose talk about the depopulation of our rural districts, but, as Deputy Leneghan has said, these people were living on congested farms. That was not their natural pattern; they were not there through choice; but they managed to live there until two World Wars came and produce from their farms was no longer sufficient to sustain them.  Everything possible should be done to transfer people from the congested areas to better farms in the rich lands.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made to help forestry in those rural areas.  It is gratifying to know that we are now able to plant 25,000 acres a year, but I think it will be more difficult in the future to acquire land, in view of the new fencing grants that have been introduced to help the sheep farmer to protect his stock from foxes and dogs and to help to build up the sheep economy of these areas which had been rather neglected.  People in the areas where shelter belts have been planted now realise that not alone do they help forests but they also improve the grass content of these areas. Farmers are still able to graze the same number of sheep through the shelter belts, in spite of the fact that half the farms may have been given over to forestry.  Strip forestry in some of these areas would be an advantage <Col N="1540" /> because the care of it could be handed over to the neighbouring farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government have been concentrating very much on building down through the years and rightly so. A people well housed are a comfortable people.  In view of the legacy of dilapidated, worn-down buildings which we inherited, it is gratifying to see the Government pushing the building of houses with such speed. There are many houses that still need to be renovated and replaced.  Dismay was expressed by the local authorities in 1956 and 1957 when the housing programme almost collapsed for want of finance.  In those days, many people in my county and other counties who had made application for housing grants found there was no money to meet them.  However, that is past history. Let us hope such a situation will never develop again and that the housing problem will be pursued until every family has a decent house to live in.</P>
    <P>Tourism can help in some little way to improve the economy of farmers living in some of our backward areas. Even though these areas may not have been blessed with productive land, God has given them good lakes and rivers and wild mountainsides.  In recent years, many of these areas have become tourist centres.  It is well known that if these places were properly advertised and such amenities as water and sewerage provided, there would be a great influx of fishing tourists, particularly those interested in coarse fishing, from the big cities in England, not to mention many of our own exiles in America who would be willing to come back if there were a vacant house where they could spend a month's holiday amongst the people they knew growing up.</P>
    <P>The Government have endeavoured to encourage the establishment of industry in some of these areas. Listening to the tale of woe from the other side, I think foreigners would seek information from other quarters before venturing into these areas if they believed they were so bad as has been stated here.  The Government <Col N="1541" /> realise that those establishing new industries naturally like to be near the seaports and the main roads, but now since rural electrification has been extended and the main roads throughout the country are made up to a reasonably good common standard, many of the people anxious to establish industry here could profitably go to these areas.  To make it worth their while, the Government have given special grants for people establishing industries in those areas; and they make no apology for doing so. In view of the poverty existing in those areas and the congestion in which the people have had to live, I do not think any fair-minded Deputy would regard it as unfair for the Government to draw on the public purse to support them in the effort to attract industry.</P>
    <P>That might help to arrest some of the emigration from these areas, but it is well known to anybody who has given the problem any serious thought that emigration does not always occur among the poorer sections of the community.  Many people who have received a university education here, subsidised by the taxpayers, have emigrated.  Instead of giving this country the benefit of their education, they have gone to work in other countries, despite the fact that jobs were available for them here.  Of course, we cannot have loose talk about curbing the individual's freedom to go abroad, if he wishes, but I do not think it is to the credit of any side of the House to bemoan these areas and take pride, if you like, in the conditions in such areas.</P>
    <P>This is a problem to the resolving of which everybody should try to apply the best brains possible.  We know there has been a drift from the land not only here but in most countries, even in America.  I know of many places in America where schools and colleges had to be closed because of the drift to the cities.  It is gratifying to know that something is being done in this direction and that, despite how much emigration we may have, there will always be people content and willing to remain in these areas.  Perhaps, when all is said and <Col N="1542" /> done, they may have there a more rewarding and enjoyable life.</P>
    <P>I have put forward only a few minor points.  I could have said something about the social services which have been provided.  A few people mentioned the old age pensioners.  No doubt, at all times the old age pensioners find it rather difficult to exist on their meagre pensions.  But surely it has never been suggested by any Deputy that the old age pensioners are expected to live on the meagre allowances paid to them out of State funds?  One would think that children in 1960, 1961 and 1962 would have more respect for their parents than to leave them in such a plight.  I know that where it has been proved they are unable to exist on these allowances, help is forthcoming from other quarters.  The Government have at all times considered raising the old age pension and in many cases have given increases.  It is a far cry from the day when the solution in some quarters was to take a shilling off the old age pensioners.</P>
    <P>I have put forward these two points because I believe the extra money being asked for in this Vote on Account is needed to maintain the services and to pay the increases granted to many sections of our people.  People must realise that money cannot be got <i>ad lib.:</i> taxation must provide it.  At any rate, it is one of the ways of getting it.  I realise it is the duty of an Opposition to criticise, and I do not mind constructive criticism, but I certainly do not like the sort of criticism designed to gain a temporary advantage and to try to convey to the people that everything is not well.</P>
    <P>I believe, and the people on this side of the House believe that conditions at present are very stable.  The Irish people have the faith to survive. They survived many vicissitudes in the past.  The Irish worker is fit and able to meet any competition from abroad. When he goes abroad, his services are always sought.  Let us hope that those people who have received increases will, if they have any money to spare, put it into loans for the benefit of the other sections of the community and <Col N="1543" /> assist industry and help to put more people into employment.  There is no need for despondency or gloom.  The future is bright.  We have good leadership and there is no need for anybody to fear association with members of the European Economic Community or fear our entry into it.  Every encouragement, at all levels, is being given and will willingly be given on the home front to people to achieve a higher standard of living and to pass on better conditions to coming generations.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that in view of our almost certain entry into the European Economic Community, we should stress our approach towards our own national ideals.  Everything we can do to preserve our individuality as a nation should be done and it should be the aim of every Deputy to do all he can to that end.  If we are not good nationally, I do not believe we can ever expect to be good internationally.</P>

      <P>I am intervening in this debate in order to join with my colleagues on the Fine Gael benches in trying to point out to the Taoiseach and members of the Government that their approach to the problems we are now facing, and the statements they have been making inside and outside this House are not in fact contributing anything to their solution.  The Taoiseach spoke last Thursday and as I sat here on this very seat listening to him, I wondered if he believed the things he was saying.  I wondered, <Col N="1544" /> because I always believed him to be a very sincere and straight man.  If he did believe them, I wondered if he was completely out of touch with the country.  If he was not sincere, which I do not accept, there can be no doubt that he was completely out of touch.</P>
      <P>I would be lacking in my duty as a Deputy representing the new Cork North-East constituency which stretches from Charleville on the one side to Youghal on the other, covering a distance of some 90 miles, and comprising a great number of farmers, big and small, if I did not express their view here as they themselves expressed it last Friday when they marched through Patrick Street in Cork to the courthouse where the county council meeting was being held.  I do not think that we in this House should ignore the parades of the farmers, no matter in what county they may be held, whether it is in Cork or Donegal, because the farmer is not easily moved to such a line of action.  When the chairman of the county council who is here on my right, and who is my colleague in the same constituency, and I saw 10,000 to 12,000 people parading outside the courthouse, we could not but ask ourselves the question, almost simultaneously: &ldquo;What is wrong here?&rdquo;  That parade, of course, was organised days before last Friday.  The fact that the Taoiseach spoke on Thursday and made a deliberate, brazen and outrageous attack on the National Farmers Association for their action in promoting those marches did not help Deputy Burton and myself in talking to those agitated farmers.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Taoiseach is a very sincere man and I accept that when he spoke here last Thursday and attacked the National Farmers Association and the farmers generally, as he did, he probably believed that he was right.  The people I blame most for allowing him to do that are his backbenchers in Fianna Fáil.  He must have had people like Deputy Corry and Deputy Moher from North-East Cork also, to advise him as to how the farmers feel in regard to the difficult situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking about Deputy Corry, I <Col N="1545" /> have here the Dáil Debates of barely 12 months ago.  I quote what he said at column 335, Volume 187, of 9th March, 1961.  It is in fact 12 months and a week old.  Speaking then on the Vote on Account, he said:</P>
    <P>There are in that respect&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>he was talking about agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>a couple of things to which I should like to call notice.  I should like to ask if there is any hope of ending the tide of emigration.</P>
    <P>He referred to that later.  He goes on to agriculture and says:</P>
    <P>The position in regard to agriculture is not so happy.  The time has arrived when the Minister for Finance and the Government will have to look at the question of rates on agricultural land from an entirely new standpoint.  The prices for agricultural produce have remained either static or very much reduced over the past few years. In 1952 and 1953 the price of feeding barley was around 48/- per barrel; today it is 38/- per barrel. The price of wheat dropped from 82/6d. per barrel to 70/- a barrel. As a result of the bovine T.B. eradication scheme there is a cloud over the livestock industry generally...</P>
    <P>Those were the remarks of Deputy Corry barely a year ago.  In view of them, can we on this side of the House be accused of overstating the facts in relation to the farmers?  In re-stating these facts today, I put forward the hope that before the debate ends, Deputy Corry will rise and give us the picture of the improvements he forecast 12 months ago.  I do not think that is likely to happen.  I believe we will not see him in the House again until the division bell rings.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that despite what Government Deputies have been saying, the farmers' position now is much worse than it was last year.  They are now faced with reduced prices for practically everything they have to sell, with the possibility of getting less for milk and a reduced price for wheat.  They are faced with this smaller price for milk at a time when <Col N="1546" /> every Deputy knows there are 12,000 tons of surplus butter in cold storage at the start of a season in milk production which promises to be the best since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I wonder where we are going?  We are entitled to ask on behalf of the farmers of north-east Cork, of Donegal, of Cavan and elsewhere, what hope they had while Fianna Fáil are in power.  Over the past five years, as Deputy Corry stated, farmers have had to make do with reduced incomes and as well, to face added charges in rates and other overheads and some of them who voted for Fianna Fáil in the general election are doubtless wondering when the tune will be called, when they will get an opportunity of being able to pay the piper. I am now asking the Minister for Finance and the Government to take cognisance of these facts and in the framing of the Budget, to show more consideration for the claims of the farmers which have been put forward by the National Farmers Association.</P>
    <P>There is another section of the community who also deserve consideration and who, in my honest opinion, are worse off than the farmers.  I refer to shopkeepers and business people in small towns and villages throughout the country.  If there is any section who have a genuinely serious grievance, it is those people who have had to suffer a progressive decline in business because of emigration and increased rates, electricity charges, wages and other overheads during the past number of years.  In my own town of Fermoy and in other towns throughout east Cork, the position is that many of those people are barely hanging on to their businesses by drawing on the little money they had accumulated from the 1920s onwards.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Minister for Finance must be reasonably in touch with that section of the community, judging by remarks they have made recently and I hope they will show some consideration for them when they are framing the Budget.  Some of those people lived very happily when the pattern of Irish business and of Irish agriculture was much different from what it is to-day.  They remember the <Col N="1547" /> time when the farmer and his wife came into town on market day, the farmer taking with him his oats and hay and his wife bringing eggs and poultry.  Unfortunately, that pattern has changed and the towns and villages have suffered to such an extent that some of them will be growing grass long before some of us in this House will be under the grass.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and those Fianna Fáil Deputies now in the House will agree that I have made a genuine case on behalf of these people.  I am not in the habit of painting a gloomy picture for political ends.  We are all Irishmen in this House, whether we be Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or Independent, and we should all like to be able to go back to the country and tell these people that we have made efforts to improve their lot.</P>
      <P>When we look at the figure in the Book of Estimates before us, the most frightening impact it makes is that in respect of a small section of the community who have worked for years, the pensioners.  Whether they are Civil Service pensioners, local authority pensioners, retired school-teachers or old age pensioners, the level of their income, having regard to the present cost of living, is unjust, if not entirely disgraceful, and I am appealing to the Government, when framing the Budget, no matter where the money comes from, to show some concern for that section who have served the country so well during the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I should like to say that this small country of ours cannot afford to go on indefinitely increasing its outlay at the rate of £8,000,000 a year.  There is, I think, an inordinate desire and craze on the part of the Government and local authorities to employ new techniques; with the new techniques come new technicians: with the new technicians come new consultants; with the new consultants more consultants; with more consultants <Col N="1548" /> come more management experts.  It is time we took notice of what is evolving because if we go too far in that direction east will ultimately be west.  We cannot afford in this small country to go on employing experts indefinitely.  Remember, it is experts on experts we are having now, and experts on experts mean experts squared.  It is time we took stock of our administrative and financial capacity to keep going in this direction.</P>
    <P>The really serious issue in relation to the rising cost of government is the declining number of people left to bear the burden.  It is no pleasure for me, on this side of the House, to say that 250,000 people left this country in the last five years.  But that is a plain statistical fact and there is no use in anyone, in Fianna Fáil or outside this House, telling me that those people left because they wanted to see what Liverpool was like, what Birmingham was like, what London was like, what America was like.  The vast majority left only because of the low economic standard set for them here.  They could not find a living in their own land.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to take stock of the existing situation.  I am surprised that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, and the other members of the Government, have not been told by their own backbenchers what the situation is.  Indeed, I believe they have been told.  I also believe that they did not take any notice of what they were told by Deputies representing rural areas.  The Government are living in a Utopia, of which Dublin is the centre and Dublin county is the boundary.  I appeal in all sincerity now to the Government to change their attitude.  We, on this side of the House, right from our Leader, Deputy James Dillon, down to the humblest backbencher like myself, are prepared to help, but we cannot help unless and until the Government admit the problems are there.  The unfortunate thing is that we on this side of the House are anxious to help, but how can we help a Government which emphatically denies problems exist? The plain fact of the matter is that there is a serious economic problem. <Col N="1549" /> Whatever the origin of that problem, the whole country is now concerned and it will need an all-out national effort to solve the problem.  I appeal to the Government to join with us in accepting the problem that is there. We, on his side of the House, assure the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Government that we will&mdash;we are in duty bound to&mdash;give them all the help we can from our experience.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable to have to state that since the Minister's opening statement a new difficulty has arisen for a certain percentage of our population.  I refer to the havoc and destruction caused by the tidal waves and flooding last week.  I assume the Government will take steps similar to those taken during 1955 when Dublin city suffered similar damage. I assume a fund will be provided to make compensation available.  If that is not done it will be difficult for many of these people to make good the extensive damage they have suffered.  I have no doubt the Minister will address himself to this matter in his concluding statement.  He has now entered the House and I should like to repeat briefly that I have been referring to the extensive damage caused over a wide area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This Vote on Account covers the period up to 31st July next. I assume that this problem will be dealt with by that date.</P>

      <P>That was because the Minister was not in the House.  Not only was there damage to personal property but there was also damage to public property.  It will be essential for central funds, together with local funds, to come to the rescue there also.  In making these statements I am mindful of the difficulty of finding additional funds.  I am well aware that this money will have to come out of the people's pockets.  It will not fall from heaven like manna.  I represent a constituency which suffered a good deal of damage and I believe there is an obligation on public funds to help when such an emergency arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the Taoiseach nor the Minister for Industry and Commerce painted a very rosy picture so far as additional employment is concerned. We suffer extensively from both unemployment and emigration and we are very anxious to help in any way we can to promote additional employment in those areas in which it is so badly needed.  I am surprised that the head of the Government should have had so little to say on this matter.  It is a big problem not only in the south-west but all along the western seaboard generally.  The Taoiseach's attitude is very different from his attitude when he stated&mdash;the statement has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>&mdash;during the inter-Party Government of 1954 to 1957 that, if he had the chance of getting the reins of office again, inside a short period, the unemployment problem would cease to exist.  He has held the reins of office in an exceptionally strong way for almost five years, and in a somewhat weaker way for the past six or seven months, and the position is that the necessity for the creation of additional jobs has been entirely forgotten. In no place in the Taoiseach's statement in this debate was it mentioned that it was likely that additional jobs would be provided.  Similarly, the Minister for Industry and Commerce had nothing to say about additional employment.  We must interpret the statements made during the election campaign as political statements drawn up and made with a view to encouraging or enticing the electorate <Col N="1551" /> to support the Fianna Fáil Party and return them to power.</P>
    <P>Since little or no effort is being made to honour those statements so far as employment is concerned we can only conclude, as did a big section of the Irish people in October last, that they were made with deceitful motives.  Be that as it may, the Government are in office for whatever length of time they can hold out, but they would be much better employed in devoting their time and energy to promoting employment, keeping our people at home, and not sending them to Birmingham, London, Manchester and other places where many difficulties and problems beset them.  It is evident to all of us that while a number of Irish emigrants make a very good impression in every sense of the word in other countries, unfortunately it is a fact that possibly a lesser percentage have to meet difficulties which would not arise for them if they could obtain employment here.</P>
    <P>In their review of this Vote on Account the Taoiseach and the Minister mentioned increased economic expansion and the additional remuneration enjoyed by several big sections of the community.  The Taoiseach said that when the additional payments have been met, and the additional rates of remuneration have been applied, we will all be very well-to-do, and our economy will expand.  I should like to ask the Minister how in the world will the giving of additional remuneration, in many cases to people who are already overpaid for their services, affect the lower income groups?</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that small as our population is&mdash;some 2¾ million&mdash; a big percentage exist on very small incomes.  When I speak of the rural workers in the areas along the western and southern seaboard I include, of course, the farming community, the self-employed people as well as the wage earners.  The Minister will appreciate that the constituency he represents is in many respects similar to the constituency of Cork south-West. It is very difficult for those <Col N="1552" /> workers who have not got continuous employment and for the small farmers to make ends meet, and to eke out a fair existence or livelihood for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Barry, complained about the position of the farmers in the constituency of Cork North-East.  Anyone who knows the geography of Cork or the position prevailing in the county of Cork knows there is a vast difference between the average farmer in Cork North-East and the average farmer in Cork South-West. Unfortunately, agricultural conditions vary greatly even within the county of Cork, not to speak of the country as a whole.  If, as alleged by Deputy Barry and possibly with some merit, the farmers in the Cork North-East constituency are finding it difficult to meet their commitments and to keep up their living standards, how much more must that apply to the farmers in the Cork South-West constituency, many of whom have holdings capable of carrying an average, possibly, of nine or ten cows?  As everyone will appreciate, it is indeed extremely difficult now for such farmers to maintain even the standard which they enjoyed in past years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture was asked a direct question a few weeks ago about increasing the incomes of that section of the community.  He made it very clear that the Government have no funds to do so.  It seems rather peculiar that the self-employed workers did not get an increase, and apparently are not being considered for an increase.  The Minister might have said that he had no funds at his disposal, or that money was scarce, or in short supply, but at the same time, during the same week, a Bill to increase the pay of other sections of the community was circulated.  I shall not nominate them, but I refer to a section already enjoying very big salaries.</P>
    <P>So far as the economy of our country goes, I maintain that if any man is in receipt of approximately £104 a week for his contribution to the State, we are not in a position to give him any more, and if there is money to be dished out surely the workers, the <Col N="1553" /> small farmers and the business people, as referred to by Deputy Barry, are more entitled to get it.  It seemed to me that the Taoiseach was very strong on that point.  He said he would stand over the giving of increases from big to small to State employees.</P>
    <P>It is indeed a rather peculiar position that we are about to enact legislation granting to one individual, the top individual in this country, a salary of £6,000 annually which, in my constituency, with the wage rates prevailing, would keep 17 men working continuously. It would be a welcome proposition in Cork South-West, or indeed in West Galway or any other constituency labouring under unemployment and emigration problems, if continuous employment could be obtained for so many workers.  If the Minister who is responsible for financial matters can find, say, £13 a week extra for a man already in receipt of £5,365 for his work, surely he can find additional money to increase the incomes of those sections I have already mentioned: the working people&mdash;wage earners, farmers, and particularly small farmers &mdash; shopkeepers and business people in our towns and villages?</P>
    <P>The activities of the Government in that direction are establishing a very bad precedent and creating a very bad atmosphere in the country.  That type of legislation is to some degree responsible for all the parades throughout the country.  It is very hard to blame that section of the community who read in the morning Press that we are giving an additional £6 to £13 a week to another section&mdash; and it appears that there is no difficulty about getting the money to do so&mdash;while, on the other hand, they cannot get any increase.</P>
    <P>A very important sideline of the farming community, the poultry industry, has, as everyone knows, been completely wiped out.  In fact, a prominent Fianna Fáil man in the Cork County Committee of Agriculture admitted a week ago that every hen is now dying in debt.  I know that the claim was made in relation to this important industry some time ago that, if certain people got an opportunity of dealing with it, <Col N="1554" /> markets would be found and conditions would improve.</P>
    <P>Another important sideline of the farming community is pig production. It is evident that profits from that source are declining.  That matter warrants more Government attention than, for instance, the question of increasing judicial allowances.</P>
    <P>On the subject of creamery milk suppliers, the Minister has made it quite clear that he has no funds at his disposal to help in that direction.  He may say we are speaking with two voices here as, if we increase the price to the supplier, the product must increase in price.  I said outside almost every church gate in my constituency during the general election campaign that that section of the community is entitled to an increase even if the price of the product must be increased.</P>
    <P>There is a vast differential in the incomes of public employees.  Take the income of a little more than £6 per week for the average skilled worker employed by the Minister's Department on land and drainage schemes and compare it with an income eighteen times as much which is proposed for the senior member of the Bench.  There should be a big differential in the incomes of these people. We appreciate that people with, possibly, very eminent qualifications and on whom a large amount of money was spent in preparing them to attain these qualifications should be paid salaries to which they are entitled, but in a country with a population of 2¾ millions, it is unfair that the work of one public servant should be valued eighteen times higher than the work of the fellow on a lower rung of the ladder.  One would think that ten times the wage of an ordinary worker would be a reasonable amount for the more highly paid official.</P>
    <P>Apart from that relatively small section of public employees, we notice in the Book of Estimates that several public servants now have salaries of £60 per week or an income of £3,000 a year.  It is also noticeable that money was found to increase these salaries still further in the past six or seven months.  It may be said that these <Col N="1555" /> people were just as entitled to an increase as the other sections who got them but, instead of commencing at the top of the ladder, the Minister should have commenced at the bottom.  The man earning £6 or £7 a week must pay the same sum for the pound of tea, the pound of sugar, the loaf of bread or the stone of flour as any of these people with larger incomes.</P>
    <P>It will be increasingly difficult to find the money to pay the big salaries which are meeting with the full approval of the Government.  I do not want to labour this point.  I am afraid the Government are creating difficulties for themselves.  I fear that, in a week or two, we shall hear that the Government propose to increase the wages of some people to a point which will create an atmosphere of dissatisfaction and agitation throughout the country and make things difficult for the Government I am not narrow in my views on this matter.  I base my argument on the fact that people with that amount of income are already sufficiently well to do and should not require further consideration.</P>
    <P>The uneconomic districts have been the subject of much debate and discussion. Deputies representing those districts make representations here almost every day to the various Government Departments, and have made them to different Governments, for some special concessions for these areas.  Large numbers of people have emigrated from these areas.  Surely some system could be devised to provide continuous employment for those who are left.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no co-ordination between the employing departments and the Department of Social Welfare. I refer to the Departments responsible for giving employment&mdash;in particular, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Local Government.</P>
    <P>It is a waste of money to give a man £3, £4 or £5 a week unemployment benefit.  If, for instance, the Office of Public Works supplemented that amount by a couple of pounds they would get a week's work from a <Col N="1556" /> man.  The workers in West Cork do not want unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance but must avail of it in order to exist.  Surely there could be some co-ordination between the Department of Social Welfare and the Office of Public Works or the Department of Local Government to supplement that £3 by another £3 thereby gaining the services of a man for a week?  The actual cost would represent only £3.</P>
    <P>People do not like drawing benefit of any kind.  That is my experience of the workers in West Cork.  They do not like to take the money they get by way of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  They would prefer the opportunity to earn the money.  I make that case as a Labour representative who knows the viewpoint of these people quite closely and quite well.  With the large number of works yet to be carried out on land rehabilitation, drainage, road improvements, and so on, surely some system could be devised in rural areas to create continuous employment with the help of the funds at present being made available by the Department of Social Welfare in unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I should like to endorse what has been said about the position of people in towns and villages.  Trade is declining and many shops in provincial towns and villages that used to enjoy reasonably good patronage are almost closed down.  It is very difficult for such people to maintain a reasonable standard of living at present.  In common, I am sure, with a number of my colleagues, I frequently receive representations from these people asking for extended time for the payment of rates and other liabilities.  It is the duty of the Minister and the Government to address themselves diligently to the problems confronting the small town and country traders.  I believe every Deputy who has contributed to this debate would endorse what I have said.</P>
    <P>I propose to conclude, as I commenced, by appealing to the Minister to consider representations being made on behalf of those who suffered in last <Col N="1557" /> weeks' disaster and to endeavour, if at all possible, to devise some scheme whereby reasonable compensation will be payable to all who suffered loss or injury.</P>

      <P>I hope to be very brief.  One would expect, on the Vote on Account, that some idea of Government policy would become apparent to the public and to members of the House but although I listened to a number of Government speakers and read the contributions of others I am at a loss to know what exactly Government policy is on a number of major issues.  The debate has had an air of unreality right through, perhaps because the Chair is responsible for the limiting of discussion and preventing speakers from developing points on Ireland's proposed entry into the Common Market.  Seeing that all policy is to be related to this very important decision made by the Government, it seems rather non-sensical that Deputies should be in the position that they cannot discuss Government policy on the Vote on Account in relation to our proposed entry into the Common Market.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that this debate is simply a repetition of what has gone on year after year for the last fifteen years to my personal knowledge since I came into the House.  The picture has been painted&mdash;and rightly&mdash;of things not being well.  The same picture has been painted by the Opposition in the past whether they were the group now in Opposition, or Fianna Fáil when in Opposition.  The only difference is that the position has steadily deteriorated and the falling population figures make it very serious indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make my position quite clear.  Although Opposition Deputies are perfectly accurate in their description of the situation that obtains in rural Ireland and the conditions under which farmers are expected to live and conditions in the rural towns, I say no solution has been offered by them which would alter those conditions. The only solution offered by the major Opposition Party is: put out Fianna Fáil and put us back The <Col N="1558" /> same solution has been offered by Fianna Fáil when they were in Opposition.  It is clear that the more Governments change the more they remain the same so far as their activities in the country are concerned.  It is a case of tweedledum and tweedledee and I have said that for the last twelve or fourteen years.  I have been described as a crank and otherwise but it is quite apparent that the two major Parties have more or less decided that the only reason they might oppose each other is for the fruits of office and these fruits will become smaller as the position of the country deteriorates.</P>
    <P>If there is any last scrap of nationality in them they should bury the civil war mentality at this stage and form one group in this House and let the people see who is on the Left and who is on the Right.  Let every man be assigned and let us know whether he is in the Conservative or in the Socialist or Left Wing group. We cannot have this mixum-gatherum on both sides that has be-devilled Irish politics for the last 40 years.  It is high time there was an air of reality as to where Deputies stand.</P>
    <P>There is no use in saying that a mere change of Government would alter the situation.  The farming community have been offered that carrot down the years, and for years they swallowed it, but I am very gratified that in the last couple of years a change has been taking place and what I may describe as the slumbering giant&mdash;the farming community&mdash;is beginning to awake and flex his muscles.  If he proceeds along the organisational lines developing at present and if he is properly led, the farmer will find his rightful place in this community and will become a power and will no longer be the stooge he has been up to the present, used as a political football by the two major groups in this House.</P>
    <P>This Government are hanging on to office by their fingernails.  The votes cast by one or two Dublin Deputies will decide whether or not a general election will be held.  In other words, one or two Deputies responsible to the Dublin community alone can make a <Col N="1559" /> decision in regard to the farming community. The decision is not to be made by Fianna Fáil Deputies from rural Ireland; it is to be made by one or two Dublin Deputies.  They will decide whether or not the farming community, the rural towns and the workers in rural Ireland should have a say at this stage in determining to reduce the strength of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael until they are forced to form a Government between them.  I do not think that day is far off.  Personally, I should welcome a general election if it brought about that very desirable first step in clarifying Irish politics for the first time in 40 years.</P>
    <P>I have not much to say on this Vote because what I have to say I have been saying for years but I should like to comment on one or two things the Taoiseach said.  I want to comment first on his smug, complacent attitude towards the problem of emigration. He gave the impression that emigration was not now the problem it was a few years ago.  He was supported in that view by one of his young satellites, the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Lenihan.</P>
    <P>What is the position about emigration? I understand from the figures given in this House that approximately 7,000 people have been placed in new jobs in Ireland in the last 12 months. I also understand from the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Childers, that a net figure of 2,000 people left the land.  I do not accept his statistics as being finally accurate but I do accept them for the purpose of having a figure established in this House today.  I will accept for the purpose of discussion that 2,000 people have left the land and left farming jobs in rural Ireland and that 7,000 new jobs have been created.  That leaves a net figure of 5,000 new jobs in the country over the 12 months.  The figures for the employment exchanges have gone down.  There is nothing like the number of people registered as unemployed as there was a few years ago.  Where are those people employed? Where are they hiding?  Are they in retirement in luxury down the country? Have they all got incomes so that <Col N="1560" /> they no longer need to go to the labour exchange?</P>
    <P>What useful purpose is served by stating that emigration is no longer a problem?  Has it not been such a problem that all those people who otherwise would be on the unemployment register are in England, America, Canada, New Zealand or some other place, the majority of them in England? That cannot be denied.  Were it not for the fact that the British House of Commons and the British employment centres disclosed figures in the last three or four years of the number of Irish people who came to Britain, registered and got permanent jobs, we would have no factual figure of the number going each year.  It is beyond dispute that they have been going at an average of 50,000 a year for the last five years.</P>
    <P>In spite of that, there is an air of complacency in this House amongst the Government group.  There is also an air of complacency outside this House amongst the people in the higher positions in the Church and State who should be the first to condemn any Government for the way the youth have left the country.  It is no solution to send half a dozen missioners over to London to preach to young men and women who have had to emigrate and to tell them: &ldquo;Be good in England.&rdquo;  These people would be much better employed telling the Government in Ireland how to get jobs for Irish people instead of following them up when the damage is done.</P>
    <P>It is a disgraceful position that over the last 12 months, since the recent Papal Encyclical was published, members of this House have been moving as far away from that teaching as they possibly could.  Only one national newspaper in Ireland had the decency to publish the full encyclical. Another daily newspaper sought to distort the teaching of the Pope.  That recent Papal Encyclical was a social manifesto.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am levelling criticism at the people in this House who try to misuse the Vatican.  The document produced by the Pope is one of the finest social documents of the century and has made it quite clear that the type of private enterprise such as has been in operation in Ireland for 40 years is one that should be changed.  If we examine that document closely we shall find running through it a condemnation of the system in operation in this country in regard to industry and agriculture and in regard to the vested interests that exploit the public, the worker and the farmer.</P>
      <P>There was a statement here from the Taoiseach of all the grants that are being given to the farming community. I know that for years the Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, has had no time whatever for the farming community or for rural Ireland.  I know he regards with impatience the idea of even paying a visit down the country.  He is obsessed with business, the interests of company directors, little factories processing raw material from abroad, little assembly industries, and so on.  His mind has been on that for the last 30 years.  He has no time for farming, from which the real wealth of the country comes, and his Party was not strong enough to force him to recognise that fact.  The tragedy of it is that the very foundation of our economy, agriculture, is our weakest link due to neglect over the years by the Government, whereas industry, which has been pampered, petted and protected and on which the Taoiseach, admittedly, has worked so hard has now to face the cold blast of competition from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Who will suffer on this account?  Is it the company directors?  Is it the group who got money to start factories? If anybody will suffer it is the worker because the Irish directors of a number of the protected industries that have been here over the years are now preparing to sell out to join larger groups so that they themselves will be saved, and will not lose their Jaguars <Col N="1562" /> or their yachts.  The people who have been depending for years for their livelihood on these industries will go to the wall.  They will have to travel to France, Germany and Denmark if and when there is a free flow of men as well as goods.</P>
    <P>Let me deal with the Taoiseach's criticism of the farming community. He lashed out at the N.F.A. last week for daring to bite the hand that fed it and pointed to all the grants that were given.  He dealt with fertiliser grants and the subsidies given to help the farmers.  Who gets the benefit of the fertiliser subsidy?  Is it the farmer who gets it direct or the fertiliser companies? What guarantee have the farmers that they would not be able to get fertilisers at a much more economic cost if these companies' accounts were open to inspection and if, instead of having the subsidy handed to them as it is, fertilisers were allowed in from abroad on a competitive basis?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us there was no end to the money being poured into rural Ireland for the elimination of bovine tuberculosis.  Admittedly, large sums are being spent.  It is no thanks to the Government.  They must do it because it has been done in Britain.  They must do it to get admittance for our store cattle and livestock to the British market.  In the process fantastic sums are wasted on the machinery being utilised to eradicate bovine T.B. because it was not done properly over a period of years. It was not started in time and it is a rushed job.</P>
    <P>I have no criticism to offer of the profession which is reaping huge profits on the programme taking place; it is their luck; but the farmers are not lucky.  They are not making on this.  I do not see why the Taoiseach should say the money is being paid into the farmers' pockets under the T.B. scheme.  This is a matter for the nation, which is almost totally dependent on the livestock trade.  If that goes by the board then the Taoiseach's industrial concerns and <Col N="1563" /> all the other types of economic activity will suffer as well.  It is in the national interest that money should be spent on the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Taoiseach that grants are given for farm buildings, land reclamation and drainage.  Let me put this point clearly to the House. What use is a grant to a farmer, if, when he produces more goods, he finds he has no market for them?  The Taoiseach asks us to look at all the money we are giving the farmers.  The poultry industry was mentioned. Mention was also made of turkeys and pigs.  What happened when there was an increase in output over the year? The minute the farmer produced, the bottom fell out of his market.  When he was exhorted to produce more, he got less for his pains.</P>
    <P>Does anybody think that the farmer is a fool?  Is the farmer to be blamed because he cannot sell his butter in Britain?  Is the farmer to be blamed because he was not able to sell his eggs or poultry in Britain?  Is the small farmer with 25 to 50 acres and even 100 acres to blame when he rears pigs, brings them to the market or fair and is then told by a buyer that he is not interested?  Is it the farmer's fault when the bottom falls out of the bacon industry?  I do not think it is. The farmer has produced all along the line when he was encouraged to do so but he never got the results, the market, the guarantee of continuity for the sale of his produce.</P>
    <P>Now the farmer is organising and he is criticised by the Government.  He is told that he is biting the hand that fed him.  &ldquo;We are giving them public assistance in the form of grants and now they are whinging&rdquo;&mdash;that is the Taoiseach's argument.  The farmer has not asked for this.  The farmer is not looking for public assistance.  He will not be treated as some kind of poor relation of protected industry.</P>
    <P>The farmer wants markets for his produce and if he gets the markets he will produce.  What attempt was made <Col N="1564" /> by the Government to get the markets for butter?  This is not a new problem. What markets have been secured for bacon, poultry and eggs?  The market has been there over the years.  It was there in spite of the Government; it was there because the British farmer needed Irish stock; it was there when we had not even a ship to carry the Irish cattle.  British buyers started the cattle marts in many parts of Ireland. British buyers make the arrangements for the transport of the cattle and for their distribution in England.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot claim any credit for the cattle trade.  They have nothing to do with the marketing of the cattle.  What have they done with regard to poultry, bacon, eggs and other agricultural produce?  I have not seen any steps taken over the years by the Government to do anything about those matters.</P>
    <P>I saw a sum of £250,000 voted in this House to enable the Government to explore immediately the possibility of setting up marketing boards and proper marketing channels for the farming community in the lines I mentioned? What is being spent on that? I do not think that even one-twentieth of that sum is spent so far.  Can you blame the farmers then?  Is it right for the Taoiseach to issue this diatribe on that section of the community, particularly the smaller farmer?  It is a serious matter and shows that the Taoiseach is far removed from realities.</P>
    <P>The question of marketing is a responsibility of the State.  If the State asks the farmers to produce more, it is only logical to suggest that some channel be provided through which that increased production can be got rid of at a price that will remunerate the farmer.  That channel has not been provided.  Now the farmers want to set up their own channel.  I think they should be encouraged. Let us be quite clear.  The system in operation was what was described as private enterprise.  It was allowed, without order, co-operation or anything else, to reap its profits and there was no guarantee of continuity of supply so far as the purchaser was concerned in Britain or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1565" /> In other words, the producer took the advice to heart and produced more but by the time his product reached the consumer, a horde of bandits descended on his produce and all made their profit until it reached the actual consumer.  No discipline was imposed.  No effort was made to prevent exploitation.  No effort was made to prevent the markets being choked.  No effort was made to prevent the depression of prices.  Agents were allowed to manipulate prices in the different fairs, markets and sales to suit themselves.  There was no interference because it was all done in the sacred name of private enterprise. You cannot interfere with the individual, although those individuals were in turn exploiting a large section of the community, the producer.</P>
    <P>I think that at that stage these people should be brought to heel. That is a form of socialism praised by the late Pope.  It is a form of socialism which I hope to see encouraged and expanded in this country, in spite of a lot of the Biddies we have inside and outside this House who condemn the idea of State interference as being something wrong.  Where we have State interference, we have discipline and a sense of security.</P>
    <P>We have it in companies like Bord na Móna and the Sugar Company. Admittedly, there is a case to be made &mdash;and some Deputies made it&mdash;for bringing these companies even more under the control of the House so that we can exercise more control on certain of their activities.  That is only a detail. In the broad field, these State companies are the only groups in the State doing a first class job.  I shall not refer to them in any great detail except to give an example of what the Sugar Company attempts to do in its own field to help the farmer to get into horticulture and have processed in this country the produce of the land.</P>
    <P>The company intends to get a market. It intends to make fertilisers, seed, capital and machinery available to the farming community to produce these goods.  What happened?  We had an outcry from a number of private companies in the State who said they were being put out of business.  They said <Col N="1566" /> the Sugar Company was going to squeeze them out.  These companies got to the Government's ear and the Sugar Company is prohibited by the Government from selling more than 10 per cent. of its produce on the home market.  It is scandalous to see a company, wholly Irish, employing Irishmen, producing its goods from the Irish soil and with Irish labour, being thwarted because of a suggestion that it is likely to hurt a number of companies in Ireland which are allegedly in the same field.  The whole thing is outrageous, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>Some of these other companies import their agricultural raw material from Denmark and other countries and they simply process it or can it here. They have the audacity to describe themselves as producing Irish foodstuffs. Are they to get protection against competition by the Irish Sugar Company?  Is there not room for the State to move in and discipline the field in that regard, to open up avenues for an Irish company so that it can develop along the proper lines?</P>
    <P>Why have the Government not made an attempt to develop other lines except the cattle trade in Britain?  How many trade attachés have we in London?  How many individuals with a knowledge of agriculture are employed by the Government at the moment in France or Germany, or any of the other European countries to search out markets in them?  In 1955, I made a trip to one or two European countries and to Britain and, as a result, I put questions down here about the cost of the London and Paris Embassies.  The two together cost £500,000.  In the London Embassy, there was a staff of 24 and one of these was employed full-time in the sale of agricultural products.  In France, there was a staff of 12 and one of these was a part-time officer whose speciality was looking after the sale of agricultural products.</P>
    <P>I know there are brilliant men and intellectuals in our embassies abroad but we can ill-afford the services of such people to keep up a semblance of royalty in these other countries and to ape countries which have far <Col N="1567" /> more resources than we have.  Instead, we should have utilised our money to look after the trade interests of our country.  The blame cannot be laid at the doors of the officials of the Department of External Affairs.  It is the Government who are to be blamed for seeking status on the same basis as countries with 40 times our resources.  Our Government are keeping up with the Joneses.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the employment content in the industrial field, having regard to the grants given under the Undeveloped Areas Acts to bring foreigners into industry here. At least 50 per cent. of the people who have got employment in these industries are girls.  Let me not be misunderstood.  I have no objection in the world to employment being given to girls, but I feel that the emphasis in industry should be on the male employment content.  To my knowledge, where female labour is employed in a number of factories, the wages are scandalous.  The girls are employed from 14 to 18 years of age and paid at the lowest possible rate and then, when they come to 18 years, their services are dispensed with.  Why is there not some inspection of those factories and some control exercised by the State instead of giving money to outfits that exploit the worker?  Were it not that the trade unions interfered, there would not be any improvement at all.</P>
    <P>A number of the new concerns that started operations here came in with obsolete machinery.  In their parent factories, they have been putting in the latest automation and the most up to date machinery.  They are bringing the machinery out of these factories to this country and grants are being made available to them for the purchase of this machinery.  There is nothing to prevent them from increasing the estimate of what they think this machinery is worth.  They are getting paid for bringing obsolete machinery over here and, in addition, they have ten years in which they pay no tax.</P>
    <P>They employ a few girls at the lowest possible rate of wages.  Is that a fair situation?  Is it fair for the <Col N="1568" /> Government to say that 7,000 new jobs were created last year, without telling the rate of wages of the young people working in these jobs?  I cannot understand why we are so anxious to tell people outside of the wonderful pool of cheap labour and the wonderful grants that are available in order to bring in industries that are simply assembly industries&mdash;a piece of thread, a bit of glue and a little skill.  And all the parts used in those industries are brought from abroad.</P>
    <P>If anyone in rural Ireland wishes to start in a big way in the growing of fruit and vegetables, the local bank manager would probably fire a double-barrelled shotgun at him.  When an Irish company want to expand the production and processing of Irish fruits, they are told that they cannot sell more than 10 per cent. of their output in this country because if they sold more they would harm X, Y and Z factories which have their headquarters outside this country.  As far as our industrial wing is concerned, the only thing it has done is to give employment to Mary Ellen and Michael Pat who might have otherwise been working in Manchester and other English cities at £10, £15 or maybe £20 a week.  Instead, they are now working in some part of Ireland at half that figure or less.</P>
    <P>However, the people who are employing them are getting equally as big a dividend as the people who would have been employing them in England.  There are lower wages in Ireland but not lower profits.  Can anybody tell me why it is possible for a firm to come half-way round the world from a country where there is a surplus population and the lowest possible wages to this country and set up an assembly factory here?  Is it because they know they can get coolie labour as cheap in Ireland as in the country from which they come?  I do not think that is a healthy state of affairs and it would be far better if we concentrated on our agriculture and the products that come from it.</P>
    <P>It amazes me to listen to the unctuous voices on the radio telling the people that another new factory has been set up in X town, that 25 or 50 people are to be employed initially <Col N="1569" /> and that it is hoped that number will increase to 200 in 18 months' time. How many of those concerns have reached the minimum since they were set up?  How many of them have gone the other 50 per cent. in employment content in the past five years? How many of them who started off with 30 employees and promised they would reach 300 within two or three years have done so?  We never get those figures.  It is always a fair carrot to say &ldquo;Right.  We are starting off with 30 but we may have 100 or 200 before we finish.&rdquo;  But I have yet to see the 100 or 200.  There is no incentive to these people to give extra employment if they have ten years to make their money here and then depart.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not like these statements.  I want to make it quite clear to him that, bad and all as it is to be handing out State money without any control over its expenditure, without any safeguards on the people's money, it is far worse to find Irish land left on the open market so that these people can not alone come in and establish industries but can buy up Irish land to the detriment of our farming community.</P>
    <P>I do not care what anybody outside or inside this House may think of what I have to say.  I am against that.  I hope I will not be described as being narrow minded in this.  I welcome the idea of visitors coming here.  I have nothing against the tourist trade, but I have everything against allowing the tourist to remain here and oust Irishmen.  If any Deputy thinks that the foreigner, no matter how good he may be, should have the same rights in Ireland as an Irishman, let him examine his conscience and examine also our Constitution, in which it is made quite clear that the Government's objective must be to set up the greatest number of economic holdings on which Irish people can make a reasonable living. I am not saying anything against foreigners as individuals or in their private capacities, but it would be a betrayal of that principle and a great tragedy if they were allowed to displace <Col N="1570" /> the Irish in their own country. They can do that if they are allowed in here without any form of restriction. I hope the Government will keep a weather eye open in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Government's chances of lasting any length of time are slim.  I would ask the Minister at this stage to get his Taoiseach to consult with the Leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Dillon.  I saw the two of them in close conversation around the Bishop of Clonfert at a recent conference.  I think the Bishop of Clonfert should resume his conference, call these two men together and tell them, since there is no difference between them, instead of play-acting in this House, to get together in one Party and form the next Government so that the Irish people will have an opportunity of judging on a political philosophy and of seeing the results of a combined approach to a question rather than the approaches of two different Parties with the same policy.  Until that is done there is very little hope for this country.  It must be done soon.  It must be done if there is any question of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>On that issue, Deputy Dillon has stated that Fine Gael are better negotiators than Fianna Fáil.  That was his only criticism of the team going over for this Government.  We know that as far as the team going to the Common Market negotiations is concerned it does not matter one iota whether it is Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil.  No one need try to cod the public that one is a better team than the other.  The material either team would have to use is limited and is the same.  Our bargaining power is limited. But, at least, if they got together at this stage it would clear the field for proper political development here.</P>

      <P>The last speaker has certainly put out a number of very alluring temptations to Deputies but I propose, in the dying stages of this debate, to confine myself to two topics and, with your permission, Sir, to make one comment on a matter which I think the public interest requires should be commented upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the last general <Col N="1571" /> election I carried out a practice I had endeavoured all the time to adhere to at general elections, not to give any pledges or make any promises.  As far as I made anything in the nature of a promise and an indication of my attitude towards certain topics, I did give something in the nature of a firm promise that I would at the first opportunity raise the question of the rights of Civil Service pensioners and pensioners of the Garda Síochána.  In fulfilment of that promise I wish to make a few observations today.</P>
    <P>I regret that a perusal of the Book of Estimates does not show or give any hope of finding that the Minister has made up his mind to formulate a comprehensive scheme for the pensioners to whom I have referred.  I would hope when he is concluding he will give some indication of his policy in that respect.  Certain remedial measures were taken and some relief was given in the Bill passed in 1959, the Pensions Increases Act of that year. From a humane point of view, having regard to their sufferings, even to the borders of starvation, and having regard to the efforts they have made, these people are worthy of consideration. I would appeal to the Minister that in this question, which I believe to be a non-Party question, he would give his best interest and use his utmost endeavours to secure a final resolution of this problem, which has been faced only piecemeal in the course of the last few years.</P>
    <P>The case of these civil servants and Garda pensioners can be stated in just three short propositions.  It is the only matter I intend to refer to to-night. These pensioners are suffering seriously from the reduced purchasing power of their pensions.  Those who retired before the 1st November, 1955, got merely minimum compensation. Those who retired since that did not get any, or any sufficient, increase. The claim, put shortly, is that when there is an increase in the cost of living or a fall in the purchasing power of money, the pensions of retired personnel be increased <i>pari passu</i> the salaries of serving State servants. There are seven or eight or even more different rates of pensions for officials <Col N="1572" /> who retired in the interval since 1948, to whom equal pension rights should apply.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to make a lengthy speech or even make a speech in advocating the claims of these people.  I gave such promises as I did&mdash;and it did not amount to a pledge&mdash;during the general election not because I wished to get any votes but because I had known these people in the Service and outside the Service.  I have known the suffering they have had to endure because of the fall in the purchasing power of money.  Not merely were they flouted in their own efforts, but they also saw serving civil servants getting increases and nothing being done for them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give as serious consideration as he can to this matter. I know the usual answer from every Minister for Finance and from the Department of Finance is: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  The amount of money involved, compared with the huge figure on the face of the Book of Estimates, is the merest trifle.  At all events, the money could be got very easily by savings under various subheads.</P>
    <P>I travel frequently from Dublin to Cork and every time I go on that journey, I wonder how much public money is spent on the roads of Ireland. There must be a vast sum of money being expended in this sum of £148,373,960 not only on the road programme, on turning the roads into good tourist roads, taking away dangerous corners, and dealing to some extent with country roads, but there must be a colossal figure for turning what are fairly good roads into roads with two carriageways and three or four carriageways.  While it is very pleasant to be able to knock three-quarters of an hour off your journey to Cork, the amount of money being spent is not realised by the public.</P>
    <P>I suggest that&mdash;I am using a phrase once dear to the Department of Finance&mdash;by raiding the Road Fund, they might at least, if they have not any other source, take the small item that would be necessary to discharge this human claim for these State pensioners. <Col N="1573" /> There are other ways in which money could be saved also.  It is ridiculous that there should be this queer sort of patchwork in dealing with this very human tragedy.  The Minister would gain for himself and be doing a very great humanitarian thing if he could deal with the rights of these State servants.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to raise is the question of An Comhairle Ealaíon. I notice that in the Book of Estimates there is no increase provided for the activities of the Arts Council, or the Comhairle Ealaíon, on the provision last year.  I have spoken on many occasions of the importance, not merely from the cultural point of view but from the severely practical point of view of our export trade and even of employment in our own country, of giving every possible assistance and support to the activities of the Arts Council.  I do not intend to deal with the matter at any length but only very briefly.</P>
    <P>The realisation of the urgent necessity for giving further and very much greater finance to the Arts Council should have become apparent to the Government, following the report of the foreign experts on our design in industry and our lack of appreciation of the arts.  I have said before in the Dáil, and I repeat it, and I think everybody agrees, that one of the most urgent necessities for our economic and social advancement is an increase in our export trade.  We cannot hope, in the teeth of the fierce competition that exists in the markets of the world, to gain any decent foothold in those markets, to secure profitable returns for the products of our manufacturing industries, unless we have the most superb and unique designs that man can conceive and design.</P>
    <P>We cannot sell our goods merely because they are Irish or merely because they happen to be very good. We can sell them only because they are better than somebody else's.  In those crafts and industries where we could be paramount, there is scope, and great scope, for increasing our export trade.</P>
    <P>I spoke on this matter on many <Col N="1574" /> occasions in this House.  The late Professor Bodkin was the pioneer in this country and was my inspiration down the years.  No man is a prophet in his own country.  Nobody took any notice of us but I was pleased and delighted when foreign experts came over and in this report, severely criticised the attitude of Irish industrialists in failing in their duty in this respect.  They were magnificent people and it was grand that they had the courage to come out and express their views.  I was pleased to learn on Telefís Éireann, and in reports from other sources, that the report was welcomed.</P>
    <P>I remember the reception we got&mdash; and I in particular&mdash;when we passed the Arts Act setting up the Arts Council.  I remember when I was last in office asking my colleague the Tánaiste and Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Norton, if he would try to arrange a meeting in his Department between the various heads of manufacturing industries in Ireland, with a view to persuading them to change their attitude towards the necessity for better design and for the application of art to industry, on the basis that it was good business for the country.  The attitude was: &ldquo;It's good enough for us; we can sell all we can of articles A, B and C with the design we have at the moment on the home market and why should we bother.  It is good enough to be purchased under heavy tariffs.&rdquo;  That was the attitude at that time.  It was some satisfaction, to me at all events, to see that our efforts had got the sanction of these foreign experts.</P>
    <P>But I am not interested in showing that I was right some years before. What I am interested in is that the recommendations of those experts, even if they did not take my advice, will be put into practice and that manufacturing industrialists capturing the home market by virtue of tariffs, particularly in light of changing circumstances of the export trade in the future, will be made, under sanctions, if necessary, to change that design and change their attitude towards industrial design and craftsmanship.  It would be a good day's work if we in <Col N="1575" /> this House could make it mandatory upon our manufacturing industries to see that there are greater crafts and arts in Ireland and that in the export market, we have available in this country the best designers we can get at any price.</P>
    <P>Sweden was able to do that, as well as other countries.  In big emporiums in New York, Chicago and elsewhere in the U.S.A., I was glad to see on some of the counters designs of Irish glass and other products but I was told what I knew, that the merchants will tell you that they cannot sell Irish goods on sentimental grounds.  They will sell them if they are good value or if they have better designs or are more artistic creations than those from Sweden or France.  Our manufacturers must wake up to that and not say: &ldquo;What is good enough for Irish people is good enough for export; we can make our money.&rdquo;  It has been found that is not good enough for the country.</P>
    <P>The lesson to be learned from the remarks in that report are obvious and clear.  I regret that the Minister did not give expression to his view on that aspect by giving a very much greater grant, or rather, I should say it is surprising that the Taoiseach did not give expression to his view, being independent of the Department of Finance, on greater activity in this context than is permissible under the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to make is in relation to a statement made by a Deputy and reported at column 1109 of the Official Reports for March 7th last.  That Deputy spoke about the judiciary and continued :</P>
    <P>There is in this Vote on Account a very substantial sum for increasing the salaries of about 20 lazy, unworked, unproductive judges.</P>
    <P>There was then an interruption by the Ceann Comhairle and the Deputy continued :</P>
    <P>When we have non-productive citizens who work about four or five hours a day without having to stand up and who produce nothing <Col N="1576" /> but only draw spiders in cobwebs with green pencils and red pencils...</P>
    <P>I want to say that I utterly refute that, speaking from my own personal view.  It would be contrary to the public interest that it should be allowed to go unchallenged and I felt it incumbent on me to repudiate it. There may be, and it is permissible that there should be, differences of opinion as to whether, in particular circumstances, the salaries of judges should or should not be increased. That is a matter for legitimate discussion, and the expression of differences of opinion in certain circumstances, but I do suggest to Deputies on all sides of this House that one of the basic institutions in the Constitution of this country from 1922 has been an independent, impartial judiciary, that an independent, impartial judiciary is essential for the maintenance of our democratic system and that any expressions of that kind, which are utterly unfounded and completely false, should not be allowed to go unchallenged on the records of this House.  For that reason, I felt it my duty to repudiate these expressions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this Vote on Account, we must take into consideration that it would be impossible to have general increases in salaries without having provision for such increases included in the Book of Estimates. I had the pleasure of listening to the speech made by Deputy Richard Barry this evening and I read some of the speeches made by other Deputies. I should like to point out to the House the changes that have occurred during past months in the constituency served by Deputy Barry and myself.  In the town of Cobh, there are 600 men employed today who were not in employment 12 months ago.  In the employment of Irish Steel Limited, there are some 213 extra men today who were idle 12 months ago.</P>
      <P>In the town of Youghal, there is not one man idle; as a matter of fact, the contractor building Youghal Bridge had to go across into Waterford for labour.  There is the same position in Midleton.  There is no unemployment in Mallow.  That was largely the job we set out to do&mdash;to find employment and a livelihood in this country for the young men and women who heretofore had to emigrate.  As far as I can see, we are doing that job fairly successfully in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to agriculture, I was rather amused to hear Deputy Corish's complaint about farmers being refused extra acreage for beet.  It was highly amusing coming from the Leader of the Labour Party, seeing that it was the former leader of that Party, <Col N="1578" /> Deputy Norton, and the present Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Dillon, who were responsible for that situation.  Deputy Dillon, then Minister for Agriculture in the inter-Party Government, and his then colleague, Deputy Norton, went across to Britain and made an agreement under which a levy of £16 a ton was placed on Irish sugar exported to Britain.</P>
    <P>I noticed one statement from Deputy Dillon during this debate:</P>
    <P>That will not happen for 12 or 18 months after the evil course has been embarked upon.</P>
    <P>That quotation is from the Official Debates of March 8th, 1962, at column 1221.  The evil was bound to follow the trip of Deputy Dillon and his colleague and it resulted in a cut in the acreage of the only crop which the farmers were growing in respect of which we had succeeded in getting contracts.  I have been referring to this matter for the past two years and I do not think the conditions have improved.  In fact, I think they have worsened.  It is very easy to lose a trick but very hard to get that trick back and that is the position in the beet industry up to the present time: there is a levy on sugar exports to Britain which has prevented the Irish Sugar Company giving extra acreage of beet to farmers.  The people responsible for that are Deputies Norton and Dillon.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Dillon to come along afterwards and say this may have been discussed by the inter-Party Government but that he does not recollect it.  The result is the loss of a market worth anything from £2 million to £4 million a year to the farming community.  If Deputies were situated as I am, they would know what it means very quickly, particularly during the past two months when I have been getting dozens of letters asking for an extra acre or so of beet.  I have not seen any apologies yet from either Deputy Norton or Deputy Dillon for their action in that regard.  It is just as well to be clear on that.</P>
    <P>I turn now to what I hope will be of some assistance to the small tillage <Col N="1579" /> farmer.  Obviously alleviation will be found only in the intensive production of those vegetables which give a large return per acre and a considerable amount of employment.  The Sugar Company have embarked on that.  The scheme is working out very successfully, so successfully that arrangements have been made for an extra branch in North Kerry, an extra branch in West Cork, and an extra branch in East Cork.  All this will provide more employment in an industry centred on an area in which there are large numbers of what are ordinarily described as uneconomic holders.  This scheme will considerably improve their position.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the main position with regard to agriculture, there are certainly a couple of problems, problems which could have been and should have been solved before this.  I was rather amused at Deputy Dillon moaning about the price of wheat&mdash;Deputy Dillon, of any man on God's earth! He was the man who took the Irish loaf and squeezed the water out of it, and then looked at it to decide whether it was boot polish or bread; if it was boot polish, you used it to shine your boots and shoes; if it was bread, you tried to masticate it, if you were fit. That was Deputy Dillon on Irish wheat.  He now complains about the price being paid for it.</P>
    <P>We know what has happened in the past eight or nine years.  The whole aspect of wheat growing has changed. It is no longer the ordinary tillage farmer who is the grower of wheat. Wheat is now grown here by gentlemen out in South Africa, or somewhere else, who come along here and take 500, 600, or as much as 1,500 acres in conacre.  I have been shown a cheque paid to one grower of wheat last year, a cheque for £37,000.</P>

He has it worked out that if he gets one quarter of a barrel net profit out of his <Col N="1580" /> transaction, it pays him.  I should like to see anybody here telling any farmer that a quarter of a barrel of wheat net profit is sufficient for him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>So much for that.  The position is the same with regard to other crops.  I hear complaints here about marketing.  I put it to the House that where you have one section, a pretty considerable section at that, paid less for their produce now than they were paid in 1948, where their labour is valued at under £6 per week, and where, on the other hand, there are industries, as there are industries in my constituency, in which men start at a minimum wage of from £9 5s. to £11 per week, you cannot expect men to remain on the land. They would be damn &ldquo;eejits&rdquo;, if they did.  Coupled with that, you have the rising trend in rates, brought about very largely because of the betterment of conditions for other sections of the community.  In that set of circumstances, there is bound to be uneasiness amongst the agricultural community. If it is the intention that we <Col N="1581" /> will compete with Northern Ireland and Great Britain, we are entitled to be put in the same position as the farmers in Northern Ireland.  They pay no rates on agricultural land.</P>
      <P>The first essential is the provision of employment for our own people.  I hold this Government have done their job in that respect.  Certainly, in my constituency, they are doing their job. Employment is being provided there. Each day the position is improving. We are seeing to it that our people get a decent crack of the whip in that respect.  Not very many years ago, the only employment for the people in the town of Cobh was an auction of scrap machinery every six months over in Haulbowline.  I have seen Ministers of State stand up here and defend that position.  That situation has now changed.  There has been expansion, and ultimately there will be employment for about 1,200 men in Haulbowline alone.  There was a caretaker in Rushbrooke Dockyard when Fine Gael were in office, and Cumann na nGaedheal before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There has been the dickens of a change there since, and if Deputy Barrett's fellow-citizens kept their paws off, the change would have occurred three years earlier.  Deputy Barrett should remember that.  Within about 100 yards of my house, there are six agricultural labourers' cottages.  A few months ago, I counted what was coming into those houses.  There is some £276 a week coming up my hill every Saturday night into those six houses.  I admit that but for all the changes, and the changing conditions, those boys would be over in England, or somewhere else, looking for a day's work, but they are not doing that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That whole situation is due to the enormous change in the general attitude of the people, and to those who were prepared to invest money in the country during the past five years. While the inter-Party Government were in office, everyone went in fear and trembling, and no one was prepared to move one foot.  Even State controlled and semi-State controlled <Col N="1582" /> industries got that evil influence pushed down their throats.  If the inter-Party Government had continued in office for a further 12 months, it would have been completely impossible to get Irish industry back on its feet again.  A barrier was put up against buying even first-rate scrap, not to speak of fine billets.  Third-rate scrap was considered good enough to be put into Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. to produce iron and steel for this country. As a result, there was a reduction in employment during their period of office.</P>
    <P>When I look at the condition of affairs which obtained in 1957 and at the condition of affairs today, I see a complete change, due very largely to the Taoiseach and his attitude to industry.  There is no doubt about his work in that respect.  Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. was first started in Haulbowline in 1939, and on three occasions since then, that industry went bankrupt.  On those three occasions, the Taoiseach&mdash;we were lucky enough to have him as Minister for Industry and Commerce on those occasions&mdash; stepped in and refloated the sinking ship.  That industry has increased its employment during the past 12 months, and is in a position to increase it by some 100 more between now and this time 12 months, when I shall be talking here again on this matter.</P>

Because of those changes, I say that we have accomplished what we set out to do, namely, to find more employment for our own people.  After all, it is the first consideration of any decent Irishman or Irish representative to find employment at home for our own people.</P>
      <P>I understand that an agreement as to time has been reached and I do not wish to break it.  That is the position as I see it and those are the changes I consider essential, if we are to progress in the work we started out to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheridan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the annual Vote on Account and I think it is a debate to which even I, who am not prone to saying too much in this House, should contribute.  I have listened attentively to the speeches from both sides of the House, some of which were sensible and constructive, whilst others were plainly political&mdash;one would almost call them pre-election, chapel-gate speeches&mdash; and would not impress anybody.</P>
      <P>Agriculture seemed to be the main topic, or should I say uppermost in the minds of both town and county Deputies.  Coming from a midland constituency and being a farmer myself, naturally agriculture is my first concern.  The Taoiseach speaking on the Vote on Account on Thursday of last week stated:</P>
      <P>This country lives by its external trade.  This must determine not merely the policy of the Government but the thinking of every element in our community.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
      <P>Our national progress in any direction requires further expansion of our export business.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with what the Taoiseach has stated in this regard. We must export if we are to survive as a nation.  Our chief sources of exports are the land and the farms of Ireland.  I hold that the soundest economic policy for this country is to have industries based on the land rather than industries for which we have to import all the raw material. There is plenty of raw material in this country, if it were availed of to the fullest extent and we have the best market in the world at our door, the British market.</P>
      <P>What progress have we made in the exploitation of new markets?  Some time ago, the sum of £250,000 was made available for market research and the finding of new markets.  I should like to know how much we have progressed since in the finding of new markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have asked the farmer for increased production and I agree with that.  It is the only hope <Col N="1584" /> for this country.  We must be prepared to guarantee the farmer that he will not suffer as a result of that increase. He has suffered when he increased the supply of milk, the supply of pigs and the supply of wheat.  The National Exchequer suffers also as most of those products have to be subsidised. We have now reached the stage at which we must pay for this and the only way we can do so is by rapidly increasing our export trade, both agricultural and industrial.</P>
    <P>The one bright spot in agriculture at the moment is the buoyancy in our cattle trade.  This is due, in my opinion, in part to the subsidy on fat cattle and meat exports and again to the efficiency and co-operation between the farmers and the Department of Agriculture in clearing the midland and western counties of bovine T.B. Great credit is due to the farmers, the Department of Agriculture and the cattle dealers and exporters for their co-operation in the carrying out of this scheme.</P>
    <P>Somebody stated here last week that out of 10,000 herds in County Limerick, only 15 were fully attested. My experienced opinion is that the quicker the farmers comply with the scheme in a voluntary manner, the sooner will their area be cleared up and this will prove very beneficial to themselves.</P>
    <P>Coming back to my own constituency of Longford-Westmeath, I am glad to say great progress has been made with this scheme.  Credit is due again to the officers of the Department in charge of this scheme.  The result is that the majority of cattle in Longford and Westmeath are now blue-card cattle.</P>
    <P>Whilst I am grateful to the Minister concerned for declaring Longford an undeveloped area, I am somewhat disappointed that Westmeath was not treated in the same manner.  Westmeath is starved of industries, with the exception of Athlone.  We have a virile industrial association in Kilbeggan. This is a town that has lost its only industry that was there for the past 150 years and unless something is done by way of an industry for Kilbeggan, it will soon be a dead town.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1585" /> We have a hard-working chamber of commerce in Mullingar who are trying to bring industries there.  The sad and unfortunate point is that industrialists who would have Mullingar in mind for a factory by-pass the town simply because they get better grants in the neighbouring counties or anywhere west of the Shannon.  It is a great pity that no Government have looked kindly on Mullingar or those midland towns.  Here you have a fine countryside, raw materials from the land can be produced for the asking and as everywhere else, we have our unemployment and emigration problem.  Mullingar town is bad in that respect and if it were not for the military barracks, mental hospital, and Bord na Móna, employment there would be almost nil.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government and the Ministers concerned for their help in having industries started in Westmeath, especially in the towns I have mentioned.  Longford town will soon have new industries.  This will mean a big boost to the town and it will be to everybody's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I shall now make a special appeal to the Minister for Agriculture on behalf of the small farmers in North Longford and I shall quote the spirit of the Treaty of Rome&mdash;the preservation of the family farm: the abolition of subsidies.</P>
    <P>A commission should be set up to examine the plight of the small farmer and on this commission should be the best brains of the country.  We cannot evict the small farmer, nor can we stand idly by and let time evict him. I ask aid for the small farmer for the transitional period of the next few years and I am not asking too much. North Longford is a problem area of small farmers.  Their homes were not built off the land and they may give a false picture of prosperity.  They are more entitled to special schemes than their neighbours in Roscommon, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Leitrim or anywhere else.</P>
    <P>More tillage is wanted in this area. When I speak of tillage, I do not mean wheat-growing: I mean crops to be fed to stock.  I ask for special seeds <Col N="1586" /> and fertiliser schemes for the congested districts to be restored to the farmers of North Longford for at least the transitional period with a lead and a helping hand between now and our entry into the Common Market.  Longford farmers gave results that were an example for the rest of the country in the bovine T.B. eradication scheme and they will do the same in other schemes if they get the chance.  I am not asking the Minister for anything new.  I am only asking him to open a door that has been closed temporarily as those schemes existed here before, that is, seeds and fertilisers at half-price. I come from that very area myself and I know the mettle that is in those people to fight and endure if given the help they require.</P>

      <P>It has often been observed that when a person changes his religion and beliefs he once adhered to and adopts others of a different faith, he becomes, more than those who believed all the time, a great upholder of the new tenets and a great man to criticise what he has left.  I suppose what can be said of religion can be said also of political or economic beliefs.  I read with astonishment that in his speech of 8th March, 1962, the Taoiseach, as reported at column 1195 of the Official Debate, spoke in favour of the benefits given by way of new emoluments to State personnel, civil servants, the Garda, Army and teachers.  He announced he was prepared to defend here, if necessary, the decision of the Government to permit State employees of all grades, both wage and salary earners, from the highest to the lowest, to obtain income increases in line with those secured in private employment.  You will not get many takers of this challenge, of course, unless, in a moment of abstraction, members of the Government or people who sit behind them may forget the change that has occurred in the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1954, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, brought in a Supplementary Estimate to pay certain remuneration in respect of the year 1952-53 and at column 1683 of the Official Report of 15th December, <Col N="1587" /> 1954, Deputy Sweetman put the matter in this line of principle:</P>
    <P>But the House and the Deputies in it will, I think, readily accept the view that public servants should be on the same basis in regard to increases in the cost of living as are persons in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>He then continues:</P>
    <P>It is common knowledge to us all that the cost of living rose substantially during 1952, that in fact the figure &mdash; the cost-of-living index figure&mdash;rose from a figure of 115 points in May of that year to 123 points in the following November.</P>
    <P>There was the proposal to increase the moneys sanctioned by this House for the payment of extra remuneration to State personnel.  The present Minister for External Affairs, then Deputy Aiken, retorted to that at column 1687. His remarks were these:</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for the Government and civil servants to be equated in their relationship to that of a private employer and his workers.  The Government is not in the position of an employer paying out his own money, in the course of his own business to his own workers. If an ordinary individual in the course of business goes to arbitration over a wage dispute with his employees and if the arbitrator gives what he thinks is an excessive award, he can go out of business.</P>
    <P>But the Government cannot go out of business and the Government is not paying out of its own pocket. It is going to pay out of the pockets of the general public, so that it is absolute nonsense to equate the Government's position to the position of the normal employer.  The Government does not find the money out of its own pocket; it finds it out of the pockets of the taxpayer.  In fact, in the last analysis, the Government and the Dáil became the arbitrator between the servants and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Later, in the same column, he speaks of other matters which should be <Col N="1588" /> brought into consideration, the state of the country's finances, what people could afford to pay in a particular year and so on.</P>
    <P>The predecessor of the Taoiseach, speaking at column 1704, a few columns further on poured scorn on this idea that the Government were in the same position as ordinary employers or that employees of the State should get increases in accord with the extra remuneration of the type got by people employed elsewhere.  He brought himself to the very difficult matter of arbitration.  For years the civil servants in this country and those in similar positions, teachers, men in the Army and Gardaí had been seeking arbitration but as long as Fianna Fáil had the majority they had prior to 1947 arbitration was consistently refused.</P>
    <P>At column 1707 of Volume 147 the predecessor of the Taoiseach brings himself to that point and says:</P>
    <P>Why did we not earlier apply it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;arbitration&mdash;</P>
    <P>to the Civil Service?</P>
    <P>He then gave, with approval, a statement of what Deputy Aiken had said previously:</P>
    <P>The reason has already been referred to here, that in one sense the Government is itself an arbitrator. It is not private moneys that it is dealing with.  It is money it had to get by way of taxation.</P>
    <P>Later, he says it is easy to be beneficial to other people at the other chap's expense and, of course, the Government would have liked to be popular by paying the civil servants equal remuneration in the way of what was being got in outside employment, but he felt it was the wrong thing to do. They would not accept the easy road to popularity by paying the increases. They preferred to do the Civil Service and State personnel out of what other people thought was due to them.</P>
    <P>The promise that had been made that something just short of £1,000,000 which had been wrongfully withheld following an arbitration award would <Col N="1589" /> be paid was honoured to a certain extent but was not made retrospective to the point the arbitrator had suggested. It was pointed out that there was plenty of money in the revenue for the year to pay the amount of almost £1,000,000 and that was steadily refused until there was an election in 1954 and the Government who came back as a result decided, having spoken in the constituencies of the unfairness of keeping this money from State personnel, to implement the promise and to pay the moneys.  That particular payment reverberated for many months through debates in this House. We were told it was the payment of that money that sparked off a certain type of inflation that occurred here. We were told it gave a bad lead to employers outside.  We were told it was the root of all evil in so far as there was any evil associated with membership of the Government in those days.</P>
    <P>It is a welcome thing to find that the Taoiseach now challenges people and says he is prepared to defend here the decision of the Government to pay salaries in line with the increases secured in private employment.  The conversion is a good one but I am wondering is it lasting.  I know where it comes from.  That statement would not have been made a year ago.  We have only to look back at what happened last year in regard to C.I.E. employees, in regard to E.S.B. employees and, towards the end of last year, to what happened in regard to members of the Garda.  Instead of money being found to pay these increases there would have been the same hobnailed boot treatment as was suggested for the C.I.E. people and brought into the public light here by the legislation introduced, a wages standstill order, in connection with those employed by the E.S.B.  The fact that the Government have not a majority of 14 but depend on the precarious support of some Independent Deputies has made a great change in their attitude and I presume the conversion will last as long as that political state of affairs lasts.</P>
    <P>We remember, when previous increases were given, the wail that came from the ranks of Fianna Fáil.  I <Col N="1590" /> have here the facsimile of the phrases that were used by the present Senator Boland, who was then Deputy Boland and a member of the Fianna Fáil Government reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 1949.  The heading which had been put on it in the political advertisement is: &ldquo;What Fianna Fáil Want to Prevent&rdquo;.  The text of the remarks of Senator Boland read:</P>
    <P>The increase in Civil Service salaries would cost about £700,000 in a full year, according to the Minister.  The Army, Gardaí and teachers are also entitled to increases but the total cost is not yet disclosed. Local government officials will naturally expect increases also, as will workers all over the country. This was the situation which Fianna Fáil was determined to prevent and would have prevented if three of the six lost Dublin seats had been held, for that would have given Mr. de Valera a majority on February 18th last.</P>
    <P>There was the old mood.  What Fianna Fáil wanted to prevent and would have prevented if only they had got their majority was the type of increases that are now being voted, that the Taoiseach tells us he will defend against anybody who dares to contest them.  As I said, it was an easy challenge becauses the only people who were likely to contest them were those who remembered what the then Deputy Boland had said.</P>
    <P>There was their refusal in regard to arbitration over the years and when eventually arbitration arrangements were made, Fianna Fáil honoured the arbitration awards very reluctantly and stopped nearly £1 million that was due to State personnel by not dating the increase from the time the arbitration board had suggested.</P>
    <P>I referred to the situation last year in connection with those who were employed in C.I.E. and those who were employed by the E.S.B.  I suggested there was no doubt about the reality of the situation that was then disclosed, that the Fianna Fáil Government were hankering after their old standstill order on wages. The legislation they presented here <Col N="1591" /> tentatively and from which they ran away after this House had got discussing it was clearly an effort to put a standstill order on certain employees in the E.S.B. as they had tried earlier in regard to C.I.E. employees.  We had the dismal spectacle of the Minister for Transport and Power complaining that he knew nothing about any dispute in regard to employment conditions or wages amongst the employees of C.I.E. although he is Minister for Transport and Power. The conciliation that was attempted with the E.S.B. people, which also should be one for the Minister for Transport and Power, was handled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce but not with any great success.</P>
    <P>In September, 1961, during the election the Taoiseach said in Clonmel:</P>
    <P>According to newspaper reports a Labour Party speaker had suggested the Government was contemplating a wage freeze or a wage stall.  This was absurd and was only an election stunt the same as that Party had used at other elections.</P>
    <P>In December of last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce set out to kill a rumour which I had never heard.  He spoke in these terms:</P>
    <P>I want to say emphatically that any belief which is abroad that wages will be pegged when the Common Market materialises is unfounded and erroneous.</P>
    <P>I never heard the statement being made.  Nobody ever suggested in my hearing that there was any belief that the Common Market would lead to any pegging of wages but people did often say in my hearing that it was quite clear from the E.S.B. legislation produced here before the election that if the Government had a majority it would not be a matter of waiting for the Common Market to determine wages here.  There would be a recrudescence of the old policy of a standstill upon wages.  It was quite clearly shown in the legislation and I should imagine that the only reason <Col N="1592" /> why the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that was that he himself knew there was that belief through the community and there was that fear.  There was the possibility that by gaining a little support from certain Independents they could get back to the old situation in which wages and salaries would be kept at a fixed level no matter what the cost of living went to.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce was the worst possible person to choose as a mouthpiece for that statement.  People will remember that he came into this House first on an election sheet which he broadcast through Cork City and in which he promised bigger and better subsidies for everybody, and then voted out subsidies. A little later it was in his constituency that the most specific promises were given in regard to 100,000 new jobs inside five years and he came back to this House to vote out the remnant of the subsidies and tried to explain to the people there never was any promise about 100,000 new jobs.  It was merely a statement of plans, a blueprint or something like that.  The same Minister told the people in the previous elections there was no question of cutting out subsidies and there was no question of new taxes, the expression being: &ldquo;We do not believe in that sort of thing.  It is not part of our policy.&rdquo; Immediately on his coming back into the House and being elevated to a ministerial post what he denied previously was implemented.  All that was required of this Minister was to say in regard to wages, if he remembered the phrase: &ldquo;It is no part of our policy to peg wages.  We have never believed in that sort of thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have presented to us here a fierce bill completely contrary to all the promises that were made during the election.  We were told the Government would exercise direct and strict control on expenditure, that the number of State personnel would be cut down, that the cost of living would be kept in check.  State personnel have not decreased in numbers except in so far as Army recruiting has failed to bring the Army up to the strength <Col N="1593" /> which is supposed to be a safe one.  As regards the civil personnel of the State, the number if anything has increased. The cost of living has gone up by 15 points, the greatest single increase over a short period of years that has ever been experienced in this State.</P>
    <P>It is because the cost of living rose, hit by the Government attitude towards the butter subsidy, that, under arbitration conditions, State personnel had to get the increases we are now paying.  I have no objection to those increases.  I look upon it as one of the fortunate circumstances of my life that it was in my time the arbitration machinery was established and we got the State personnel out of the position they had been walked into by Fianna Fáil Government agencies in the old days that, whatever went on in the outside world, State personnel were under the thumb of the Government and would not get the wages people could get in outside employment. However, this bill is really all mad expenditure and fancy produce. The necessity for doing justice to State personnel is that the Government by their own positive activities, on the one hand, and negligence on the other hand, have allowed the cost of living index to rise to an outrageous point.  Therefore, in a weakened community we are asked to bear the heaviest charges that there ever have been.</P>
    <P>I do not know what there is in the country that people are satisfied about.  I look at the various matters referred to here: the new airports, new radar equipment, television costing £2 million.  We cannot have a helicopter service to rescue people who are in danger of being lost at sea because it is too expensive.  It is possible that there will be a new police body to represent that organisation which may produce better representation for the civic guards.  Aer Lingus has been asked to put certain extra items on charge.  In any event it has been shown, with all the boasting about our transport on land, sea and in the air, that it is all being subsidised no matter what gloss may be put on it by speaking here of operational profits.</P>
    <P>We are now told that many State <Col N="1594" /> concerns are not so solid as they would seem to be.  I am not speaking of semi-State bodies; I am speaking of bodies which have got grants through the Industrial Credit Corporation or sometimes through the Agricultural Credit Corporation and in respect of which we have had disclosures now and again that things are not at all as happy as they were made out to be.  We are told that we are to gear ourselves for a new era. So far as speeches and exhortations can do any good, people may be well prepared but so far as preparation goes otherwise, nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>Grave doubt has been cast upon the way in which the accounts of State bodies are presented.  I listened to several speakers today: some wanted more State control and some wanted less but all agree that the accounts of these bodies should be presented on the basis on which commercial accounts are presented.  It has become recognised that the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General are very limited.  He does not make the same examination as commercial accountants would make.  The things he is mainly responsible for are to see that the money is properly voted and that it gets into the hands of those for whom it is intended.  What happens in between, whether it is a good concern or whether it is losing money, is none of his business.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the procedure adopted in regard to the Electricity Supply Board should be applied to all State companies and that the Board itself, or whatever the institution may be, should have its own auditor.  But over and above that, there should be an auditor and an accountant of the ordinary business type who would ask the questions that would be asked of an ordinary business and would show whether, in fact, the concerns were making money or not. The Minister for Transport and Power boasted last year that a concern like Irish Shipping was making money. The profit was put somewhere in the region of £300,000, when, in fact, it was losing money to the extent of over £500,000.  I suggest that the country will not be able to form a proper line of policy until the correct <Col N="1595" /> figures are put before the public in the form of properly audited accounts.</P>
    <P>We come to the position in which we have the highest emigration ever&mdash; it is still continuing&mdash;the highest taxes ever&mdash;they are likely to be increased&mdash; the highest prices ever, with no question of their being reduced, the lowest population ever and 51,000 people fewer in employment than there were in 1955.  In that weakened state, the Minister for Finance proposes to throw fresh burdens upon the people.</P>
    <P>I heard comments with regard to emigration.  All I know about emigration is this: The census return promulgated last year showed that this country had dropped in its population to 2,814,000.  The natural increase in the population is some 27,000.  The population had been driven down to 2,814,000 by April of 1961.  I think it is a safe bet that, when the returns of the Registrar General come out in April, 1962, we shall have got below the figure of 2,800,000.  We shall have lost the 14,000 and will hit a new low as far as population is concerned.</P>
    <P>I hear vague talk here of 6,000 extra people being put into employment. During the election, the Minister for Transport and Power said that emigration was halved.  The Minister for Finance at an Institute of Bankers function said he was optimistic about the trend of emigration, but he did not go any further than that.</P>
    <P>Some comment was made today that it was rather a scandal to have the clergy of this country concerning themselves about the conditions of living which our emigrants have to meet in Birmingham, instead of bending their efforts to see that emigration would cease or be lessened.  I say that our clergy have done as much as can be expected by calling attention to the situation; it is not for them to suggest economic measures.  That is the Government's job.  The clergy have given every help they can by way of drawing attention to the picture as it presents itself to them.</P>
    <P>I have about five quotations which I could give from various bishops and people holding high rank in the clergy <Col N="1596" /> who attend some of these meetings of Muintir na Tíre and other associations and who are forever speaking about emigration as it appears to them.  I take one comment made at a Dublin symposium.  It was a symposium on urban-rural relations, sponsored by Catholic technologists and held in the Gresham Hotel.  It was reported in the papers of 24th February last year. A professor from Maynooth expressed his view this way:</P>
    <P>The possibility is a real one.  The future may see Ireland a prosperous nation with a favourable balance of trade and no emigration, with its people packed into a few huge cities and its countryside a prairie very sparsely populated by wealthy farmers and haunted by the ghosts of dead towns and villages.</P>
    <P>As far as I can make out, that seems to be the ideal of some members of the Government who tell us that this movement away from the rural areas into the towns is a world movement. They tell us, indeed, that the pattern of wages paid to people occupying the towns is greater than the pattern in the country.  They tell us that that is a worldwide pattern and not to be put down to any failures on the part of the Government.  There is a complacency about accepting all this which, as a Labour leader said, is frightening.</P>
    <P>We are faced with an advance towards an association bigger than we ever had before.  We have made application for membership of the European Economic Community. There have been many expressions of opinion on that to which I will not refer.  It will be a national rebuff to this country if it is not accorded full membership, having applied for it in the way the application was made.  It will certainly be a day of dreadful humiliation if this country is told, either for political or sociological reasons, on the one hand, or economic reasons, on the other, that it is not regarded as fit for membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>It may be that an association would work out all right for this country but with certain defects, of course, in the <Col N="1597" /> new situation.  If the possibility still exists that this country might be offered associateship, after seven or eight years' preparation to get ourselves even up to that point, we certainly will be exposed in a way one could not believe possible if one attended only to Ministerial speeches at functions and dinners.  If there is as much prosperity in this country as there is in the after dinner speeches of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, no doubt we shall be welcomed with open arms into any community, economic, political or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is this complacency that is the frightening thing.  I find, as I read what has been said, that the only realism in connection with forecasting the future comes from those who are close to labour and the employees.</P>
    <P>If I put to one side the speeches made by Ministers, telling us that everything is lovely, that the Government are making every endeavour to see that we will fit into the Common Market, and the speeches of business men welcoming the challenge offered to them and the new stimulus that is being afforded to them&mdash;and I often wonder when I hear enthusiastic industrialists telling of the challenge and the stimulus why they did not accept that challenge earlier, why they did not make themselves ready for the challenge of free competition and not hide behind highly protected tariff walls&mdash;when I put all these things aside, I see several Labour representatives who have spoken recently and who are not quite so complacent.</P>
    <P>One of them, who was formerly a member of this House, referred to the fact that there was luxury and extravagant living for a few in this country, while thousands of people had not enough to live on.  The Chairman of the Dublin Regional Council of the Labour Party on 11th of this month expressed misgivings about the ability of the industrial sector of our economy to meet the fierce competition that we would face, if we were admitted to the European Economic Community and added that large numbers of firms would not survive <Col N="1598" /> without drastic reorganisation of their methods.</P>
    <P>Another lecturer said that whatever difficulties we would find inside the Common Market, the alternative of a small country living on the fringe of that market and not in it was a barren one.  Another union leader forecast a sell-out by many firms if Ireland secured admission to the E.E.C.  He said that the directors of old Irish firms which had not been well managed in the past would be ready to sell out and there might be a rush of Americans and others trying to take whatever advantage they could get from being in business in this country.  The research officer of the Irish Trade Union Congress in July last year said that, in theory, everybody was equal in the Common Market but the brutal fact was that some were more equal than others.</P>
    <P>These statements are a clearer expression of the views of people who are facing the realities of the situation than the statements of Ministers speaking at dinners and other functions on the great prosperity of the country. It is a better approach than that of the industrialists who have been sheltered behind high protection walls and who now tell us that they are ready to face anything that is to come.  I often wonder what that complacency is founded on.  Years ago, when I was in the Department of Industry and Commerce, two grounds were always put up when a case was being made for the imposition of a tariff.  One was that the industry would be able to face normal competition but that it could not meet dumping by firms in Britain who wanted to sell their goods over here.  To my mind, these claims about dumping were never solidly established.</P>
    <P>Apart from the allegation about dumping there were generally two other grounds for the application of the tariff: that we had not the raw materials for the industry here or that they would have to be brought in at high transport cost and that both of these would set back the proposed manufacture of the goods.  As far as the question of dumping was concerned, I have read the Treaty of Rome and I do not think it provides any great <Col N="1599" /> safeguards against that.  However, that does not matter so much because I never believed that there was any great foundation for the allegations of dumping.  As far as the transport of raw materials is concerned, if that was the objection up to this, it will not be removed by the fact that we are going into different markets.  If we have to manufacture from imported raw materials, that will still be the situation and we shall be competing with people who have these raw materials close to hand.  We shall still have to pay the transport charges and they will only have to pay their internal transport charges.</P>
    <P>I cannot see where there is any basis for the hope that we are going to have a better life, if we achieve the Community.  What our situation will be and the various answers that will be given to our application, only the future will disclose.  It may be membership, or associateship, or either with a time period attached to it, but our real trouble only starts when we get in.  It has been said that practically all our products were able to enter the British market free.  There was no preference against us.  We had the advantage that our competitors, except those from the old-time Commonwealth, were definitely prejudiced.  Edward Nevin, who is nothing to the research officer of the Irish Trade Union Congress but who is a member of one of the Committees set up by the Department of Industry and Commerce that affect our membership of E.E.C., in <i>Studies</i> in 1961 pointed out that at the present moment, although Ireland enjoys unrestricted access to the United Kingdom market, it accounts for less than two and a half per cent. of the total value of imports there and less than five per cent. of the food imports.</P>
    <P>Those who speak of the new Community with a consuming population of 100,000,000 should remember that it is not the millions that count but the price levels inside the new area.  We have a community of 50,000,000 people beside us.  With all kinds of preferences for our products, with a very fine situation which we are never likely to meet again, of all their <Col N="1600" /> imports, we supply only two and a half per cent. and of their food imports, we supply only five per cent.  Where are we likely to get a bigger export on any side, industrial or agricultural? We have had a preferred market beside us and open to us for so many years, with competition against us heavily tariffed, so what is to lead us to believe that we are walking into a new paradise if we are admitted to the Community?</P>
    <P>I am not against going into the Community&mdash;we have no alternative. If we stay out and Britain goes in, we are in isolation and we are in for a lengthy period of desperate poverty. We must go in if Britain goes in, and there should be no qualms about saying that.  If Britain stays out, I do not think there is any reason why we should go into the Community, but there may be some argument on that.</P>
    <P>However, we are so situated geographically and economically so inextricably mixed that this country has no future, save in a Common Market Britain decides to go into.  If we have got only to the point of having 2½ per cent. or five per cent. of British imports accorded to us in a preferred market, what chance have we if that market is to be tariffed against us?  Instead of having an easy run into the British market, we will find ourselves with our competitors at a distinct advantage over us.</P>
    <P>The Minister put on the face of his Book of Estimates a sum of £24 million as being the Capital Services.  I await his explanation, which I hope to get through questions, whether there is any sum for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis in that and how far that compares with the figure of almost £21 million that appeared on the face of the Book of Estimates for last year.  I want to have a glance at these capital moneys, because I must confess great disappointment over the result.</P>
    <P>Speaking at a meeting in Arklow in January, 1960, the Minister for Finance made certain statements.  I welcomed those statements when they were made. As far as my memory goes, they were made in answer to certain comments made either by the bankers' association or chambers of commerce&mdash;some <Col N="1601" /> group who had complained that the State was borrowing too much and, so to speak, entering too much into the investment field.  I believe what the Minister said was in answer to those comments.  In so far as it was in answer to those comments, what he said was perfectly sound.  His phrase was this:</P>
    <P>If one were to visualise the situation in which the Government decided to desist from capital expenditure and consequent borrowing, there is no doubt that the adverse effect on employment, social conditions and national economic development would be little short of disastrous.</P>
    <P>Commenting on that afterwards, I agreed it was a good point of view to have and that it was very well expressed, but I pointed out that that was the very situation of disaster which the group to which the present Minister belonged, the Fianna Fáil Party, had accepted from 1932 to 1947, when they had not accepted the idea of capital expenditure on these services.</P>
    <P>That really started in 1950.  There were some small matters&mdash;what we used to call below-the-line services and the odd £300,000 or £400,000 given for harbours and such matters &mdash;but no real scheme of capital expenditure developed until 1950.  The Minister asked us to see what would be the disastrous situation if capital development were stopped.  I want to look at the not too satisfactory situation in regard to long-term capital development.  I have tried to take out as well as I can the figures for Capital Services since 1950.</P>
    <P>The first appearance of the segregation of Capital from other Services was in the front of the Estimates for 1951, that is, for the year ending 31st March, 1951.  On the return of Fianna Fáil in 1952, they abandoned the practice of segregating the Capital Services from the other services on the front of the Volume.  The excuse was given that, first of all, the phrase &ldquo;Capital Services&rdquo; was not a very accurate phrase.  Some people might consider certain services were capital services and others might not.  In <Col N="1602" /> addition, there was a question about moneys being voted and not being spent.</P>
    <P>As one way to get a particular calculation, I take the figures on the front of the Book where they are and I go then to the Budget speeches and to the Estimates and make my own calculation as to what capital services would be in the years in which they are not segregated on the front page of the Book.  I find the situation to be that, between 1951 and 1955, there were £61 million described as what was to be spent on capital services.  I know that is not the full tale.  When the change was made about not breaking them up, there was a note put in that there were also direct issues from the Central Fund for advances to the Local Loans Fund, the E.S.B. and so on, estimates of which would be found in the White Paper of receipts and expenditure published prior to the Budget.  I take these, in any event, as giving some way of discovering what was spent over the years.</P>
    <P>Again, I take time to point out that these are the moneys put on the front of the Book; how much was spent is another matter.  The amount purported to have been spent on capital services in the five years between 1951 and 1955 was £61,000,831.  That is an average of £12 million a year.  In the second period, the five years between 1956 and 1960, the figure is almost £61 million.  In any event, between these two five-year periods practically the same amount was devoted to capital services&mdash;£60 million in each five-year period.  The whole tot over the ten years is practically £122 million, pratically the same as the £12 million a year average.  The Minister in his speech at Arklow said supposing all that was stopped, what he described as &ldquo;little short of disastrous&rdquo; would be the result on employment, social conditions and national economic development.</P>
    <P>I turn, as an aside to that, to the publication compiled by the Central Statistics Office and issued by the Government, <i>Economic Statistics,</i> which is issued prior to the Budget.  I am waiting for the one for this year <Col N="1603" /> and I have to confine myself to the one issued prior to the Budget in 1961.  In 1951, the employment as between industry and agriculture was 1,209,000 and in 1960, as between industry and agriculture, it was 1,112,000.  In other words, employment as between industry and agriculture had declined by 90,000 people. So we had a loss of 90,000, even though we had capital expenditure at less than £12 million a year.</P>
    <P>I consider that very unsatisfactory. I do not know whether any attention has been given to it or any investigation made to find out what happened. Is it possible that we are faced with a prospect of finding £12 million a year expenditure on capital services with a declining population and, worse than that, even with a declining population having a decline in those employed as between agriculture and industry?  It may be put to me that that is not such an important amount at all.  I understand from all the speakers that the great objective nowadays is to get back to industry based on the land, that that will give employment to those at present forced to take the emigrant ship out of this country.</P>
    <P>In his speech on March 8th, the Taoiseach spoke about the help being given to agriculture.  At column 1203, Volume 8, of the Official Debates, he says that his calculations refute &ldquo;any suggestion that the Government have not contributed very substantially to the growth of farm incomes.&rdquo;  He tells us then that he does not like subsidies for agriculture.  At column 1204. he says that &ldquo;it would not appear to be wise for us to provoke further action against our exports by extending our system of price supports in a way that might have that result.  The repercussions could be very quick as well as very serious.&rdquo;  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In the European Economic Community, for which we have applied for membership, aids to farming or any other forms of production which are decided to be of a character that distorts competition will be ruled out.  But, of course, they will be ruled out in circumstances in which <Col N="1604" /> open market prices will be higher and in which they will be secured by support measures of a different kind.</P>
    <P>Later, he says:</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to arrange new subsidies which in the circumstances of our membership of the Common Market would have to be withdrawn again.</P>
    <P>This beats me.  I asked a question in connection with certain Votes produced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to whether the type of aid we were giving to industrial exports by remission of taxes, by the provision of plant, by the provision of sites and by a number of other matters, were of such a type of support or subsidy as would be regarded as distorting competition and therefore would not be allowed under the European Economic Community conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told me that this type of support was all right.  Apparently it is for industrial exports, but when it comes to agricultural exports, the Taoiseach is very firm that these would be distorting competition and if they did distort competition, they would be ruled out. I read my version of the Rome Treaty without discovering any such distinction in the terms of the Treaty.  The whole idea of the Rome Treaty is the possible free trade amongst those who join it, but we are told that is good enough, that we have to be very strict with our farming community and not give them support, but as far as industry is concerned, it is different.</P>
    <P>We have on hands for discussion tomorrow or next week a piece of legislation entitled the Imposition of Duties (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1952.  We received an explanatory paper with that Bill which tells us of 17 types of duties referred to in the Bill.  Some of these are relaxations but most are increases in the way of tariffs on industrial products.  We are in the position that while awaiting a decision on our application for membership, we cannot give subsidies or price supports to farmers but we can bring in legislation to confirm the imposition of duties of an industrial type.</P>
    <P>I see no logic in this.  I can see no <Col N="1605" /> basis for it in the Rome Treaty and we can only believe it was elevated into an argument by the Taoiseach because he had nothing else to put up against the farmers in their present plight.  The farmers are marching at the moment. That is regarded almost as disorderly conduct on their part.  The Garda have been sent around to take farmers' names.  The Garda have been told that they are to find out by questioning these farmers whether they are proposing anything illegal.  I hope they give them the usual warning, that they need not answer such questions.</P>
    <P>In any event, the Garda are looking now after the organiser of the N.F.A. and other farming associations and taking their names.  In County Mayo, they took the names of several members of the N.F.A., a public meeting was told in Castlebar.  Why are the names being taken?  People in this House away back in 1939 will remember the first victims of the Offences Against the State Act were the farmers of County Dublin and County Kildare who had the temerity to stage a strike because they felt they were not getting sufficient value for their produce.  The Offences Against the State Act was launched against these people and special courts were set up to try them.  The proclamation that was made in August, 1939, to the effect that the courts were inadequate to do justice and to preserve peace and order has never been withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Since 1939, this Parliament, through the lines of successive Governments, has maintained that the courts, since 1939, have been inadequate for justice and to preserve public peace and order.  Now we get a new outbreak. The farmers are actually marching and calling attention to what they think are their worsening conditions.</P>

I believe they have a claim for sympathy.  They are putting up their demands through documents and they are having public meetings for what they say shall be taken down and used against them.</P>
      <P>During the election, the Taoiseach was brought as a guest to the Muintir na Tíre rural week in St. Patrick's College, Cavan.  His remarks are reported in the papers of 16th August, 1961.  From Rome, there had just been published a new Encyclical entitled <i>Mater et Magistra</i> and the Taoiseach saw fit to bring that into the periphery of an election and said that we could be excused if we thought the Holy Father had Ireland and Irish conditions in mind when he wrote the Encyclical.  He said that he had been studying very intently the directives given in it.  The Holy Father had given certain directives on how to proceed in order that:</P>
      <P>Disproportion in productive efficiency between the agricultural sector on the one hand, and on the other, the industrial sector and that of services, be reduced; that the standard of living of the farm-rural population be as close as possible to the standard of living of city people.</P>
      <P>Having given that quotation the Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
      <P>They had been examining those directives in relation to the measures which they in Ireland had already taken or had decided to take, so as to help towards making a judgment on the extent to which they conformed, or failed to conform, to the directives which the Supreme Pontiff had set forth.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As might have been expected,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we found little evidence of failure to conform.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that they noted the first directive was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That the desire to keep down prices to consumers could not be used as an argument to compel a part of the citizens to a permanent state of economic inferiority, by depriving them of the indispensable <Col N="1607" /> purchasing power in keeping with man's dignity.</P>
    <P>He thinks that <i>Mater et Magister</i> could almost have been written for this country.  It might almost have been a memorandum from the Department of Industry and Commerce as to how industry was to be minimised so that agriculture could be raised to keep them on a level with those in industry.  The result is that when the farmers protest about their conditions and when we get a demand, whether it be big or small, exaggerated or little, they are, as somebody said, slapped down and severely rebuked and treated very intolerantly by the Taoiseach in his speech in defence of the present burden of the Estimates, to be followed by bigger burdens in the Budget.</P>
    <P>Ministers have told us that they are doing their best but rising costs are beating them.  One way in which they were helped was by a piece of legislation passed in 1956 when we decided on a certain capital programme. In the Budget of that year, various incentives were given to people with experience and knowledge to come here and to get goods produced here for export markets.</P>
    <P>That was derided.  We were told by the present Taoiseach that was not the way to deal with the matter and he promised to repeal all that legislation and to disrupt the whole Industrial Development Authority when he returned to office.</P>
    <P>In the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1956, we also introduced the system of Prize Bonds.  That was quite a valuable way of getting certain moneys from the population, from people who would not lend in the ordinary way but who would be tempted by the thought that they would win a £5,000 prize.  We got a considerable sum of money by capitalising on the gambling instincts of the people.</P>
    <P>When that legislation was brought in here it was very definitely derided by the present Tánaiste who described it as a gamble and likened it to the Minister and the Government making a book.  The best comment of all came <Col N="1608" /> from the Deputy who is now Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy J. Brennan.  Deputy Brennan spoke of it as a system whereby, when you wanted to raise the wind for any project that was in a shaky position, you resorted to what is known as a raffle and he expressed his complete distrust of a project which was, he said, to the minds of the country folk, a national raffle.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Brennan did not stay in the House because I have in my hand here a letter printed on Seanad Éireann notepaper over the signature of Bernard McGlinchey, who describes himself as Honorary Secretary of the Letterkenny Fianna Fáil Cumann.  The letter begins &ldquo;A Chara&rdquo; and says:</P>
    <P>The Letterkenny Fianna Fáil Cumann is holding the Annual Bazaar in the Devlin Hall on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of this week.</P>
    <P>This is all now past.  The letter goes on:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be brief on this Vote on Account which covers <Col N="1609" /> such a wide range.  What struck me most forcibly in the debate was that the Taoiseach laid considerable stress on one important point&mdash;he had been doing that throughout the country and so also had other Ministers and Deputies of the Government Party&mdash; the question of wage and salary increases.  The suggestion was that these increases are the cause of the present rise in the cost of living.  What we must realise in this context is that most of these wage and salary increases went before the Labour Court and it ill becomes the Taoiseach or any other member of the Government to suggest that members of the Labour Court were so incompetent as to make recommendations giving increases in wages and salaries without there first being a corresponding increase in the cost of living.</P>
      <P>I maintain that the present round of wage and salary increases only brings the workers into line with increases in the cost of living.  I give all credit to the Taoiseach, but I think he was most unfair in suggesting that the present increases in the cost of living have been brought about by wage and salary increases.</P>
      <P>I noticed that during the debate the Taoiseach made no comment whatsoever on increases in the values of bank shares.  We have seen Press reports suggesting that they had risen by 80 per cent, and even more.  Surely it would have been only right that the Taoiseach should comment on these profits during this very important debate. Bank charges come into the Vote on Account.  The Taoiseach also avoided any reference to increases in the price of the various commodities on sale in shops.  I say quite openly that many of these increases during the past four or five years have been unjustified and that the trouble arose in 1957 with the Taoiseach's action in respect to the Prices Advisory Body. Since 1957, profits have been allowed to increase so it is no wonder that the banks are now able to issue bonus shares and, even when the increased profits have been divided out, have also been able to give dividends on the bonus shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How, therefore, can the Minister <Col N="1610" /> or any other member of the Government suggest that wage increases have caused increases in the prices of commodities? Fianna Fáil Governments have failed since 1957 to do anything about increases in the prices of necessary commodities.  Deputy McGilligan mentioned the possibility of certain businesses selling out because they may not be able to meet fair competition in the future.  What about the man who was one of the victims of the recent flooding and on whose land two cartons of Friendly matches were washed up?  I suppose he was hoping that in the circumstances prevailing, there would be an increase in the price of matches.  What are the Government doing to control prices?  Surely the Minister must know that the unfortunate workers who have been moving for increases in their wages and salaries are doing so merely to protect themselves against the prices that are being charged, charged with the full consent of this Government?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go back on this subject, but it is true that the removal of the food subsidies is still having its impact on the people and is, in fact, inflicting deprivation on many.  Even public institutions are faced with increased rates in the coming year. That is all part of the effect of the removal of the food subsidies.  The Minister's actions at that time are still causing hardship.  A few years ago, the hospital charges were increased from 6/- to 10/- per day maximum.  Within the past few weeks, we have had a demand from the Minister for Health to impose yet another increase in the rates, an increase brought about by the failure of the Government to fulfil their obligation, for the first time, of paying the 100 per cent, in the case of increased charges.  That is not fair to the community.  It is not fair of the Government to say that everything is going well, when, at the same time, they are transferring so much of their own burden of central responsibility over to the local authorities and, through them, on to the people in the various parishes and townlands.</P>
    <P>In this Vote on Account we are asked to provide moneys for the continuance of State services.  The obligation <Col N="1611" /> to support the request for this Vote on Account is imposed upon the Labour Party at this stage because, by this Vote on Account, we are automatically protecting the position of the widow and the orphan, of State servants and workers in the various State industries.  Criticism is essential and the right time for criticism will come. We have made it clear to the Government that we condemn their line of aproach, that we cannot support their policy in general.  Budget day will be the day of reckoning on that issue. That will be the day of decision as to whether or not Government policy is favourable or unfavourable to the people generally.  If, when that time comes, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, or any other member of the Government, wishes to criticise, let him at least be just in his criticism.</P>
    <P>I have avoided all reference here to the strike or to the marches.  I have refrained from discussing the Common Market.  Within the past few months, self-styled experts have been cropping up at the rate of two a penny, telling us what we should do, telling us the glorious advantages that will be ours. One expert recently went so far as to suggest, according to the public Press, that anyone who might be doubtful or slow to support our galloping into the Common Market was either a fool or a danger to the country.  Of course, these people will have to eat their own words if Britain eventually decides not to go into the Common Market.  I wonder what they will say then, having decided to hang up the stocking, and finding that there is no Father Christmas coming?  They will have to discover some excuse.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are opposed to many aspects of Government policy but we shall vote for this Vote on Account to enable the moneys to be found for the widow and the orphan, the State employee, and so on, during the next four months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The continued growth of State expenditure is a matter of real concern to all who have the welfare of the State at heart. Increased spending means increased taxation.  Nothing illustrates the declining value of the £ more than <Col N="1612" /> the huge sums which are annually spent to keep the State functioning. Not so many years ago, State expenditure was much less; there was a great outcry here at that time that the State, the people, the taxpayers, could not bear the burden.  Now expenditure is increasing by leaps and bounds.  Even allowing for the depreciation in the value of money, it is obvious that it is now costing more to administer this little State, with a declining population, than it cost heretofore.</P>
      <P>The point is that Government speakers inside and outside this House lose no opportunity of telling us how prosperous the country is.  Prosperity should be reflected in income.  We should, therefore, if that assumption is correct, have less taxation.  Unfortunately, that is not the position.  I represent a rural constituency and I can tell Fianna Fáil that prosperity is not reflected in the agricultural community, in the small towns and villages in my constituency. This is primarily a dairying country where there are many small farmers, hard-working people, who have not an eight-hour day or a five-day week.  They probably work an average of 12 hours a day and their families help on the little holdings.  It would not be possible for them to have a fair standard of living within the family, if they had to pay for labour.  Those people are not getting a fair opportunity to make a living, with all their hard work.  They are not compensated in a fair way.  They are not getting an opportunity of making a fair profit for their work.</P>
      <P>The dairy farmers are the backbone of our economy.  That was recognised very belatedly, but it is recognised now, and we hear many people talking about helping the farmers, but unfortunately much of it is lip service only.  Other categories of the community are being compensated all along the line for the increased cost of living, and rightly so.  They are entitled to it and we are not objecting to it, but, according to the Taoiseach and the Government, other people have not the right to protest in an orderly manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> Several references have been made here to these marches.  It is no wonder, with the grave unrest there is in the country, that they should march.  It is obvious that these marches rankle with the Government or there would not be so many references to them, or so much emphasis on them.  They are entitled to protest at, or focus attention on their plight in the best way possible. Other categories can do it in other ways, but they chose to do it in a very orderly way.  They are trying to preserve their living on the land, not only for themselves but for their children.  I hope their protests will focus attention on, and that a solution will be found for, their problems.  Surely to goodness, 160,000 farmers would not go marching all over the country, unless they had a grave problem.</P>
    <P>Redistribution of the burden on a more widespread level of general taxation would be more equitable and just. There should be a huge reduction in the rates which would give a fillip to industry and farming in general.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, I represent a farming constituency.  Deputy Corry sits for the same constituency.  He contributed to the debate a short time ago and very naïvely but cleverly, as usual, skipped around the farmers' problems.  He said there was some unrest in the farming community, but that was his only reference to it.  He said that if we were to compete with Northern Ireland&mdash;and those were his words&mdash;we should give the farmers a better deal.  After that, he went on a tour of part of his constituency, but he did not tell the House that the constituency we now represent after the last change in the constituencies, is nearly 100 miles from one point to another.</P>
    <P>He very cleverly started at Cobh and Rushbrooke where we have a ship-building industry and are lucky to have it, but he did not tell us&mdash;and I speak subject to correction&mdash;that £4,000,000 of the taxpayers' money went to start that industry.  He went then to Youghal, where there are industries, and Midleton.  He went so far as Mallow to the beet factory but he did not continue north to Kanturk, Newmarket.  Rockchapel and Meelin and he did not go north again to <Col N="1614" /> Charleville, Doneraile and Buttevant, all of which is dairying country.  He did not refer to them at all because it suited him to mention places where things were good and to emphasise how well industry had done.</P>
    <P>We were delighted to hear it, but not all industries are so successful as are some of those to which Deputy Corry referred.  I was rather surprised that he even admitted that one problem got the better of him, that is, the sugar levy.  Regularly, when Martin is playing to the gallery, we hear him giving assurances that no problem is too big for him and that he will get a solution for it, but he admitted in the House tonight that neither he nor Lieutenant-General Costello had found a solution for that problem yet. Unable to offer a solution, he attacked Deputy Dillon and somebody else. Naturally, Martin delights in that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Everyone, no matter on which side of the House, will agree that they have a problem and that they are entitled to consideration.</P>

      <P>Very well.  The bill now before the House for discussion is for a sum of £148,373,960, and I think the people of my constituency will have a great problem in paying their portion of it due entirely to the reason that it is hit by emigration, the high cost of living and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various speakers on the Government benches referred to economic expansion.  This economic expansion is not solving any problem in my constituency. <Col N="1615" /> Emigration is hitting it at a higher rate than ever before.  It has taken a completely new course.  Heretofore, of an average family of four or five children, they all emigrated down to the youngest.  They sent back money so that the youngest could build up the homestead, reconstruct the house and do various jobs that would enable him to live on the holding.  What has been happening in the past few years?  When the youngest comes of age, he emigrates and sends home sufficient money to take out his father and mother.  He also sends home sufficient money to buy a big padlock to put on the door of the holding.</P>
    <P>I want to quote population figures in respect of my constituency.  The population of Leitrim in 1926 was 55,907; in 1936, it was 50,908.  It dropped in ten years by a total of 5,000.  In 1951, the population was 41,209; in 1961, it was 33,468.  That represents a drop in those ten years of 7,741 people, making a total drop for Leitrim in a period of 35 years of 22,439 people.</P>
    <P>The position in the other part of my constituency, Roscommon, is something similar.  The total drop in a period of 35 years in Roscommon was 24,341.  If we add the two figures we get a total drop of 66,780 people in a period of 35 years.  I took those two ten-year periods in order to prove to the people opposite that I had not a political mind when I was preparing them.  That Government, the previous Government or any other Government have done nothing to stop emigration in the constituency I represent.</P>
    <P>During the period of office of the inter-Party Government, a reporter for the <i>Irish Press</i> found time to visit every port and airport in this country. He got the names and addresses of the people who emigrated.  He published them in the following day's paper and on occasions he published photographs. That was the only move ever made to solve emigration in the constituency I represent.  Deputies can decide for themselves whether that move was advisable or not but it certainly paid no dividends.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> Various statements have been made about the recent marches of members of the National Farmers' Association. I found, in Leitrim, particularly, that not alone did members of the National Farmers' Association march but also a number of business people.  These people were conveying to the Government and to us in this House that they are unable to pay the demands made upon them.</P>
    <P>A Deputy opposite pointed out yesterday that the Estimate for Agriculture had gone up roughly 200 per cent. since the Government took office.  The figure he quoted in respect of the inter-Party Government was £8 million.  He said the estimated figure is within the region of £26½ million, a total increase of 200 per cent.  I wonder if he was trying to convey, by that statement, that the farmers are better off now than they were in 1948.  If he was, I would ask him to come again.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that the prices of agricultural produce, if they have not dropped, have stayed where they were. Against that, the price of every commodity purchased by the the farming community has increased &mdash; bread, flour, butter, tea, sugar, feeding stuffs and there are higher postal rates&mdash; there is an increase now from 3d. to 4d. for an ordinary letter&mdash;higher telephone charges, higher electricity charges.  Everything the farmer requires has increased in price.</P>
    <P>Rumour has it that there is a question of increases in salaries for judges. I fully realise that judges may be very hard worked.  They probably work a short day.  In 1959, the lowest paid judge was in receipt of £1,740 per annum.  He got an increase last year bringing him up to £1,925.  The proposal apparently is to bring that salary up to from £2,000 to £2,050.  I want to ask the Government, if they increase that salary, what will they do for the other sections of the community?</P>

      <P>I suppose I would be expected to reply to the debate of the past few days.  It is not an easy matter.  The majority of Deputies criticised the Vote on Account because it did not do something to give some relief or provide more money for some sections of the <Col N="1617" /> community.  Most of the speakers complained that certain sections of the community were not getting fair treatment. On the other hand, in many cases, the same Deputies criticised the Vote on Account because the taxpayer had to contribute too much.  I instance that to show that it is not an easy matter to reply to this debate. These criticisms are all very vague.</P>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that for the whole four days of the debate, there was not one concrete suggestion by any Deputy from Fine Gael or any other bench that any expenditure could be reduced by even one penny. There was not one concrete suggestion that we should give more money or more relief to any other person.  The debate consisted of vague criticisms which are very hard to deal with.  I suppose they were calculated to make certain people in the country discontented with their lot.</P>
      <P>Why is any Deputy voting against this Vote on Account?  They have not said we should cut anything out of it. Surely they must know we have to carry on the public services?  If they want to take anything out of a particular Estimate, they will have an opportunity of saying so when that Estimate comes before the House.  I suppose it is unfair to ask the question because Deputies opposite have not an opportunity to reply but I presume they will vote against it.  Most of the Fine Gael criticisms were based on false figures and misrepresentation. There are, undoubtedly, many problems to be solved and a good Opposition should be helpful in the solution of them but members of this Dáil, whether on the Government or Opposition side, if they want to get down seriously to solving a problem, should at least see what the facts are before going further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, there appears to be a general belief in the Fine Gael Party that when they were in power with their colleagues at that time, the Labour Party, the cost of living was kept down and that when a Fianna Fáil Government are in power the cost of living goes up.  I think they actually believe that because they always say it.  Deputy Dillon, Leader of that Party, said that <Col N="1618" /> when they were in office they made every effort to maintain stable economic conditions and prices.  Deputy O'Sullivan went on similar lines and said that they kept the cost of living down and that when we came in, it went up.  What is the fact?  I am not giving any figures tonight about which I am not prepared to say that if a Parliamentary Question is put down afterwards the same figures will be given in reply.  I am not quoting any figure that cannot be vouched for.</P>
    <P>When the Coalition Government were in office for three years from 1954 to 1957 the Cost of Living Index went up by 11 points.  If you like to do the sum for yourself that means it went up 3 per cent. per annum for those three years.  We were in office for five years and now, taking the cost of living from February to February again&mdash;I am not sure if the February figure for this year is yet published&mdash; it is 154, something over 3 per cent. If you take that figure, the cost of living index went up 19 points in five years which is 2.8 per cent. per annum, slightly better than the Coalition Government figure was.  Yet they always talk as if they kept the cost of living down and we are blamed for putting it up.  I am sure they will still go on saying that even though I give these figures and give an undertaking that if a Parliamentary Question is put down they will get a reply in the same form as I am giving it now.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the food subsidies.  They were removed in 1957 and they are included in the increased cost of living in our time.  The results of removing those subsidies were all included.  Yet, our record on the cost of living figure is better than theirs.  A Labour Deputy a few minutes ago blamed us for not retaining price control.  These Parties, when in government, had some price control and yet, although we dropped it, we got out better than they did.  We came to the conclusion that when you have price control people are inclined to keep up to those prices even though they may not be justified in doing so. There is no doubt you do get prices to come down, occasionally at any rate, by dropping the controls.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the food subsidies I <Col N="1619" /> might also say&mdash;I have mentioned this before&mdash;that when I brought in the 1957 Budget and when it was under discussion both the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy Sweetman, and the ex-Taoiseach, Deputy Costello, said in that debate that they had got the Government to agree to reduce expenditure to £96.5 million that year. That was exactly what I brought it down to, through cutting out food subsidies.  Is it not fairly obvious that the Government had made up their mind to get rid of food subsidies?  I congratulate them on that because there was no other way out of the mess into which they had put the State at that time.</P>
    <P>Let us take another point, misrepresentation or false figures.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan said the farmers got 80/- for wheat in 1954 and now get 69/-.  That is perfectly true but they also got 69/- in 1956 because Deputy Dillon took 12/- off wheat.  I suppose Deputy Flanagan meant to criticise us for that job but it was Deputy Dillon who did it.  You will remember about that time also Deputy Dillon made the proposition that he would reduce milk to 1/- a gallon but he did not get away with that.</P>

      <P>And I say it now.  I got the figures from Wexford, my own county, and in 1953-54 there was a rate for public assistance of 5/8¾; health, 1/2½ and mental homes 2/5½ but they are all now grouped under health.  Perhaps some innocent Fine Gael Deputy&mdash;if there is such a person &mdash;looked at these figures and did not advert to the fact that public assistance is under health now.  The rate in Wexford for this year is 15s. 0½d. so that the total increase from the year before the Health Act came in until this year was 5/8d.  Yet, we had Deputies&mdash;and I think Deputy O'Sullivan was one of them&mdash;talking about an increase of 12/- or 14/-.</P>

      <P>Others said 10/-, but the total increase for health charges in Wexford is 5/8d.  Take mental hospitals. These are not affected by the Health Act.  The charge has gone up by 1/3d. so that brings the sum down to 4/5d.  The increased salaries of county hospital staff, district hospital staff, fever hospital and sanatoria staff and dispensary doctors amounts to 2/6d. in the £.  That is 3/9d. of an increase irrespective of the Health Act which brings the first figure down to 1/11d. I am going further than that, of course.</P>

      <P>Deputy Sweetman said that the improvement in our economy and in national output was largely due to the fact that our neighbours were better off.  That is not true.  Back in 1956 we were at the bottom of the list and our neighbours were all much better off than we were.  We are now third from the top of the list and our neighbours are down near the bottom so that the truth is actually the reverse of what Deputy Sweetman says.  These figures can be given, if necessary.  There are only two countries in Europe above us at present, Italy and Germany.</P>

      <P>Here is further misrepresentation: Deputy O'Higgins said the <Col N="1622" /> Taoiseach sneered at the pensioners, sneered at the Fine Gael resolution on pensioners.  What did the Taoiseach say?  At column 194 on last Thursday he said Deputies opposite complained about the rising cost of Government and went on to say:</P>
      <P>There are on the Order Paper of the Dáil to-day more than a dozen motions in the names of Opposition Deputies, some of them Fine Gael Deputies, all demanding further increases in Government expenditure. In view of the declarations we have heard from the Fine Gael Deputies yesterday and to-day, expressing their concern about the increase in the total cost of Government, will these motions be withdrawn?</P>
      <P>That was described as a sneer at the Fine Gael motion on health.  It shows the distance that the Fine Gael Party are prepared to depart from the truth in order to accuse the Taoiseach of being so unsympathetic towards the pensioners as to sneer at them.  The Taoiseach was referring to the fact, as I read out, that they are calling for a reduction in expenditure and at the same time putting down a motion for increases.  I was looking through these motions by the Deputies opposite and the total cost is between £20,000,000 and £30,000,000.  They can go on safely asking for that knowing that it cannot be done in any case.</P>
      <P>Practically every Deputy who spoke from that side of the House spoke about the Taoiseach's &ldquo;attack&rdquo;, some of them said, on the N.F.A., and used words of that kind.  The Taoiseach did not attack the N.F.A.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall quote the whole thing if you like.  I shall go on through his statement to see if there is anything with which fault could be found as far as statements are concerned.  He said, first of all, that the income per person in agriculture was favourable compared to industry up to a certain date and not so favourable since that.  That is perfectly right.  At the end of 1960 &mdash;I have not seen figures for 1961&mdash; the average income of people employed in transportable industries was £395 per year and in agriculture £374 per year, a difference of £21 per annum between the two.  The next statement which I shall read is where he said:</P>
      <P>It is very easy to understand and to sympathise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>He said &ldquo;to sympathise&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with the feelings of farmers who have seen in recent months many classes of urban workers securing quite considerable increases in their incomes without too much apparent difficulty.</P>
      <P>He said he understood and sympathised with them.  But, for political reasons, of course, because, as I have said before, Fine Gael have existed as an opportunist Party by taking advantage of political opportunities whether they were justified in doing so or not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>We are awfully clever, are we not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very clever at twisting the truth.  The Taoiseach goes on to say that the increase in farm incomes in 1961 over 1960 was between £15,000,000 and £16,000,000, which is correct, and he said that of that sum the Government had contributed <Col N="1624" /> directly £5.1 million.  That is not correct because he put it too low.  It should have been £5.1 million to cattle and £2.75 million to milk and bacon over the previous year.  He said the Fine Gael Party, when they were in office, had given £13 million to help agriculture and that our figure is £36 million.  That figure, again, is correct.  The last figure I shall quote is this: He said that the British aid to agriculture was 1¼ per cent. of their national income and ours is 6 per cent. That figure is also correct.</P>
      <P>As I have said already, if we have problems and want to solve them, let us at least know what the truth is and what the figures are and then we may have a chance of dealing with the problems.  I want again to draw attention to the fact that the Taoiseach said he could understand and sympathise with the farmers but we are accused here of condemning their marches.  I do not think we did any such thing. I made it clear in any speech I made in the last two or three years that I was entirely in favour of a farmers' organisation.  I think the Taoiseach said the same thing.  Of course, although these marches are not condemned by us they are welcomed by Fine Gael, not indeed because they have any sympathy with the farmers but as a possible source of embarrassment to the Government.  That is the only interest they have in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies on the other side spoke about increasing taxation.  There are two ways of looking at that matter.  One is the entire amount that is collected by the Exchequer each year and the other is the level of taxation one year with another.  I do not think any reasonable person would expect a Government to carry on on the amount of £109 million, or whatever it was six years ago, in face of increased costs and if the Government can show they have not imposed increased taxes taking one year with another, they are doing fairly well.  In 1957/58, there was a net increase of £1.325 million in taxes; next year there was a net decrease of £.135 million; next year there was a net decrease of £3.745 million; next year, a net decrease of £1.35 million; and <Col N="1625" /> last year there was a net decrease of somewhere in the region of £1.6 million.  The total decrease in taxation over that period was about £5 million.</P>
    <P>There are items which I am not taking into account.  For instance, I am not taking into account the tax relief on exports because we never had it.  If we had not given that relief, we would be getting money out of it at the moment.  I am not counting benefits given to income tax payers when they came under P.A.Y.E.  If the level of taxation had remained as it was when I took office in 1957-1958 and I had made no change, I would be getting £5,000,000 more now by way of revenue.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Sweetman who drew attention to the reduction in the number of cattle.  There was a reduction from 1951 and 1952, but over five years there is no reduction. There is an increase in cows and heifers.  There is an increase also in the number of cattle.  It is a small increase of about 100,000 but still it is an increase.  I certainly would like to see the increase very much bigger.  That, at any rate, was the position.</P>
    <P>Why do the Fine Gael people stop at cattle?  The number of sheep has gone up a great deal in the past few years and also the number of pigs.  As a matter of fact, in January, 1957, the number of pigs was 741,000.  It is now 944,000, which is a very big increase.  With regard to pigs, if one were to draw a graph of the number of pigs and cut off the lower points, that would give the exact time Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture. Twice it happened, from 1948 to 1951 and again from 1954 to 1957.</P>
    <P>We are accused of not being friends of the small farmer.  Let us have a look at this relief of rates.  In 1932, there was a change made for the first time in the payment of this relief and for the first time a bigger relief was given on the first £10 valuation.  In 1935, that was again improved.  In 1946, the present scheme of three-fifths relief on the first £20 valuation was brought in and also the employment allowance.  That is undoubtedly <Col N="1626" /> a very big advantage to the small farmer.  We are making no apologies for devoting most of the money to the small farmer.</P>
    <P>There was some talk about people leaving the land.  We were blamed for making the excuse that that is going on in every other country, and so it is.  These figures have been quoted so often that I do not want to bother the House with them again.  Every country is having that experience and even in agricultural countries like Holland and Denmark, there is a fairly substantial increase in the number of people leaving the land.  As pointed out by many people already, the only way to help the smaller farmer who finds it hard to make a living is to give him a supplement of some sort to his income.</P>
    <P>We have been trying to extend forestry as far as possible so as to come within his reach.  We have also done our best with regard to placing industries in these remotes areas but that does not, indeed, catch very much.  We have not had any suggestions, however, from people on the opposite side whether any other method could be devised to enable the small farmers to remain on their holdings.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment in industry, there were three Deputies&mdash;I think they were Deputies O'Sullivan, Flanagan and Dillon, evidently all speaking from the Fine Gael brief&mdash; who said that the figure last year was not any better than the figure for 1955. The figure for 1955 was 158,000.  In 1961, it was 167,000, so it is better. Here is the point.  In 1953, when we were in office, it was 154,000; in 1954, it was 156,000; and in 1957, it was 158,000.  It was going up by 2,000 a year.  Then it got the knock.  In the black year of 1956, it went down to 150,000.  It was on the downward trend, so much so that it took us about two years to get it right again.  Since 1958, it has been going up again.  It is now on the upward trend and I hope it will remain that way.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about emigration.  There are some things which I think should be taken together in this connection&mdash;employment <Col N="1627" /> and unemployment.  If there is more employment and less unemployment, surely we are going in the right direction?  We may not have gone far enough yet.  I have given the figures in relation to employment at least in industry.  As far as agriculture is concerned, while no definite figures will be available before the Budget, I think there is one thing I could say for certain, that is, that the reduction in agricultural employment will not be as much as the increase in industrial employment, so that for the first time, therefore, we will have an increase in employment.</P>
    <P>We had, in 1954, the last year Fianna Fáil were in office, reached stability.  One balanced the other, but the years 1955, 1956 and 1957 were very bad because, when the Coalition came in, things went wrong in that way.  They did not come right again until 1960.  In 1960, the figures balanced and in 1961, we had a plus in employment for the first time.</P>
    <P>Unemployment since 1957 has come down from 93,000 to 58,000, a reduction of 35,000 over these years. What certain Deputies said is true&mdash; that we cannot produce firm emigration figures between the census times because we do not know what the movement is over the Border, but we can at least give the comparison, which is often given, of the movement by sea or air from this country outwards and inwards.  The average emigration figure for 1955-56, before we came into office, was about 44,000. From 1957 to 1960, four years after we came in, it was about the same, but in 1961, it was down to 27,000.  That is the number by sea and air.  That is all we can give and that is the trend.  It is practically half of what it was for the previous six years.  With employment going up and emigration and unemployment going down, we have practically reached the figure for emigration which would correspond with our natural increase in population. If we can bring down the emigration figure, our population will begin to increase again.  That will dispel any notion that was given expression to here in some of the rather <Col N="1628" /> dismal speeches from the Fine Gael side that our population was going down and down more than before.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word or two on housing because it is alleged that the figures in respect of those employed in housing have gone down very much. The number of houses in progress is 2,400.  The number of workers engaged in the building industry which includes not only local authority housing but all other housing has risen from 26,000 to 28,000, so we have no reason to be ashamed of our record, so far as housing is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan said that the increased wages had come as a result of our policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that we were accused of creating conditions which made it incumbent on the workers to look for higher wages.  That increase was not due to an increase in the cost of living.  It was a status increase. The Government improved the standard of living and as a result the workers got an increase in wages.  As the Taoiseach has pointed out, that may be followed by an increase in prices and it will certainly be followed by an increase in prices, if it is not exceeded, and thus justified, by an increase in national production.  Again, as the Taoiseach pointed out, that can happen and I think it will happen, if we go on increasing our productivity. We will very soon catch up on the wages that were given and everything will come right again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any cost, whether wages or salaries or dividends, that is put on industry has the same effect and these costs will have to be overtaken by productivity before we can be sure that we shall escape the ill-effects of what might take place.  Where there is an increase in money incomes, as there would be <Col N="1629" /> in a case like this, and if the increase is going faster than the growth in productivity, it may have an inflationary effect.  That means that the increases will be used, not for saving, but for buying goods that are either scarce, thus driving up the price, or goods that perhaps must be imported.  This increases the volume of our imports and makes it difficult to export sufficient to meet that increase.  There are these dangers when there is more money being distributed, whether it is through wages, dividends or salaries. But I think these dangers will be avoided and that our productivity will be sufficient after a short time to take care of the matter.</P>
    <P>Coming back again to agricultural prices, I want to say that between 1953 and the end of 1961, agricultural prices rose by 3½ per cent, as against 15 per cent. for industrial prices.  We take the industrial prices from the increase in the wholesale prices.  Over the past three years, agricultural prices rose by one per cent. and wholesale prices by 1½ per cent., so that they kept on fairly even lines in that time.  From 1953 to 1961, the volume of our agricultural output increased by 12½ per cent. and that of transportable goods by 23 per cent.  We have this difference and these are the figures we have to examine to see how we will get over our difficulties.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that we have increased very substantially the aids we have given to agriculture over the past six or seven years, and I should say, in passing, that when Deputies see the big increase in Exchequer income in the past five years, it may be some consolation to them to know that, out of that increase, the three Departments of Agriculture, Education and Social Welfare, got £23,000,000 more than in 1957. There is no Deputy who will say that we have given too much to agriculture, education or social welfare, so that £23,000,000 was spent in a way that everybody approved of.</P>
    <P>In agriculture, the assistance given was very substantial.  To give more to agriculture, as was pointed out here by some Deputies, it must be given either by way of aids to production <Col N="1630" /> or subsidies for the finished product. If you take the case of butter, we pay a fairly substantial price for butter for home consumption but we pay the price that we think is fair to the farmer.  If we had no butter for export, we would pay the price that we think fair to the farmer and to the butter consumer at home.  The surplus that we export has to be subsidised by the Exchequer.  As I have said, there are two ways to assist agriculture, aids to production such as the fertiliser subsidy or by subsidy on the selling price of the product such as the subsidy on butter.  To do more in that connection, we must get more money and we must take that money from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Let us see how the industrial earner has fared over the past six or seven years.  If we examine the position over the past ten years up to the eighth round of wage increases, it will be found that these increases marched almost exactly with increased productivity, so that it was all right for the workers to get those increases.  No harm could come from that because the productivity was there to cover it and the worker has not done anybody any harm by taking it.  We must, however, take some money from these people if we are to help the farmers to a greater extent.  It may be said that it is only fair, if a certain section are doing well, to take a little from them for their unfortunate neighbours, but that is a thing that cannot be overdone because those contributing might be discontented and say that while they were working hard, they were not being paid properly for their services.</P>
    <P>The industrial worker has earned his increase by increased productivity but unfortunately&mdash;and of course it is not the farmer's fault&mdash;productivity in agriculture did not keep pace with the standard in industry.  Therefore, the farmers on their own productivity were not in a position to get more for their labour.  Why?  We all know they work hard.  We all know we have helped them in every way possible.  We all say they would undoubtedly produce more if there were a good market <Col N="1631" /> for their produce.  We come down therefore to the point that it is the marketing of agricultural produce that must be tackled.  In the past six months or so, we have, as Deputies are aware, set up two marketing boards&mdash; the Milk Board and the Bacon Board and the producers are represented on these boards.  I can only hope they will do something better for themselves than has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>We were accused of not doing anything with regard to foreign markets. We have explored them, but they are not easy to get.  I would say in passing that we did not commence this business now; we started in 1932 to explore foreign markets and we had neither sympathy nor help from the other Party at that time.  They thought it was a joke.  They do not think it is a joke now.</P>

      <P>We have been listening to the Fine Gael Party for the past four days and really, when one comes to analyse it, they were appealing to the lowest instincts of the farmer: they were trying to make the farmer jealous of his urban neighbour, his neighbour in his market town.  They were trying to convince the farmer that the Fianna Fáil Party were hostile to him.  He will not believe that.  But more ludicrous still, they were trying to persuade him that the Fine Gael Party were friendly to him.  He certainly will not believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a lot of vague demands. I have tried to state the position and come down to the point.  What more can we do for agriculture?  Where do we do it?  We had a lot of vague demands from the Opposition.  Nobody made a concrete suggestion about which one could say: &ldquo;Well, there is a suggestion.  We will examine that.&rdquo;<Col N="1632" /> I suppose the only remedy the Fine Gael Party have for the farmer is that we should go out and they should come in.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party are very interested in the discontent of the farmers.  They are not in the least interested in trying to get rid of it because it suits them to have discontent there.  I shall read an extract from an article, which I think is apt to the situation.  It is this:</P>
      <P>Pessimism is not warranted and is not helpful.  Faint hearts will contribute nothing either to the solution of our immediate problems or to the planning of the measures required to ensure future prosperity.  We are justified in pointing with pride to what has been hitherto achieved, and in contemplating those achievements we may well take courage and face the future with calm resolve, with confidence and with hope.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The man who wrote that certainly had confidence and hope.  He said that in 1956.  It was the former Taoiseach, Deputy John A. Costello, for whom I have the greatest respect. The man who had the courage to say that in 1956 would have the courage to say anything.  Surely we have a better right to make that same appeal now?  As I say, it is the same old story from Fine Gael: the people want a change.  I have been listening to that story for the past 30 years. Every time they come along, they say the people want a change, but when they go to the country, they do not change to Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether Labour are confident of coming to the top. <Col N="1633" /> Perhaps they are.  I cannot be so confident about their Party as I can be about Fine Gael &mdash; but surely not a coalition?  We heard a lot here about the things done in 1955 and 1956 and not done since, but not a single man there will say: &ldquo;Give us back a coalition.&rdquo;  Not a single Deputy in Fine Gael or Labour will say he wants a coalition back again.</P>

But let us hear what the remedy is.  There is no use in this talk that we should help the farmers.  How are we going to help them?  Let us know how it can be done.  If we get good advice, we will take it, but it is no us telling us how badly off they are and making no suggestions.  We have given almost three times as much money by way of subsidy and so on as the Coalition Government gave.  Do we want to give more?  If it were useful, we would give more.</P>

The bankers are no fools.  They do not give out money unless they feel they will get it back.  They think the farmer is a good mark and they are lending him money.  He is getting that money, and I say he is getting it more liberally than ever before.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate:    Cigarette Smoking and Lung Cancer.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan </NameTxt>
      <P>I addressed a question to the Minister for Health to-day.  I asked :</P>
      <P>... if he would take steps to warn the public through advertisements in the newspapers about the danger of contracting lung cancer from cigarette smoking and if he will ask each local authority to organise a campaign against cigarette smoking so as to safeguard the public against the possibility of large scale lung cancer.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied :</P>
      <P>The public is aware, from the extensive press and television publicity which has been given to the matter, of the relationship between excessive cigarette smoking and lung cancer, but for such as might wish to examine the matter in greater detail, information can be supplied by my Department on request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raise this matter from a strong sense of public duty in the hope that the Minister for Health, charged with responsibility for the Department of Health, will give a lead in this matter. Such a lead is all the more urgent in view of the information he himself gave the House earlier today.  He told us that in 1954 there were 4,213 deaths <Col N="1640" /> from cancer; in addition, there were 606 deaths from lung cancer.  In 1960, deaths from lung cancer increased to 648.  In 1961, there was a further increase in the deaths from lung cancer, the figure for that year being 680.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is only natural that we should examine the report, some 70 pages in length, submitted by the Royal College of Physicians in Britain on the subject of cancer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan </NameTxt>
      <P>How many died on the roads in Britain in the period covered by the report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan </NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, lung cancer is, according to the report, demonstrably attributable to cigarette smoking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan </NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusion drawn from the report is that cigarette smoking is the most likely cause of the recent world-wide increase in deaths from lung cancer, and the death rate is at present higher in Britain than in any other country in the world. Again, yet another conclusion drawn from this extensive report is that cigarette smoking is a contributory cause to an increasing death rate from tuberculosis in elderly people.  But the report goes even further.  It says that cigarette smoking probably increases the risk of dying from coronary heart diseases, particularly in the early middle age.  It is also stated that cigarette smoking is responsible for many early deaths from heart failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sir Robert Platt told a Press conference in London that last year in Britain there were 20,000 deaths from lung cancer in men; in all cases, the disease was attributed to heavy cigarette smoking.  Those 20,000 <Col N="1641" /> deaths do not take account of the numbers of cigarette smokers who died from coronary trouble, heart failure or tuberculosis.  There is convincing evidence of a very definite link between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, indeed between cigarette smoking and an increasing death rate.</P>
    <P>The trend in this country also shows an increase.  It is in that situation that I think the Minister should give a lead.  As Minister for Health, he should take all the steps necessary to warn people against cigarette smoking.  Such a warning could be given in many ways.  The Minister told us he has a number of leaflets in his Department and, as each child leaves school, the Minister will ensure one of these leaflets is put into the child's hands.</P>
    <P>Apparently that is as far as the Department of Health is prepared to go in this very serious situation.  I put it to the Minister that it is his duty in this alarming situation to give a lead.  The Minister said today the county medical officers were familiar with the situation.  If all the Minister can do is issue a leaflet, what more can the county medical officers do?</P>
    <P>The Minister has a serious obligation. As head of the Department of Health, responsibility in this matter lies at his door.  He should forthwith examine the situation revealed and take the necessary steps to ensure that our people, particularly our youth, are discouraged from smoking cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I do not advance the argument that every man and woman should immediately stop smoking cigarettes.  I am myself a non-smoker.  But in the interests of smokers, and in the interests of public health generally, I think they ought at least to cut down on their consumption of cigarettes.  As well as that, an all-out effort should be made to discourage those leaving school from cigarette smoking.  Those unaware of the seriousness of the situation should be informed and also discouraged.</P>
    <P>Efforts should be made by each local authority to have a publicity <Col N="1642" /> campaign against smoking organised by the local health authorities.  The Department of Health might use a considerable amount of public funds for this very important publicity campaign. The support of the Press should be solicited.  The Press could be used for extensive and large-scale advertisements drawing attention to the dangers of smoking.  Suitable advertisements could be put in all the public papers, for example: &ldquo;Don't Purchase Cancer At 3/4d. Per Pack&rdquo; or a slogan like: &ldquo;If You Want To Live Don't Smoke&rdquo;, etc., which would focus attention on the seriousness of the matter.</P>
    <P>At one time T.B. was a very serious plague in this country.  It has been revealed that there is an extraordinary and astonishing number of deaths from cancer.  No cure has been found for that dread disease.  We are not spending enough on cancer research. In the United States and elsewhere substantial sums of money are spent on cancer research.  We will probably have to depend on the results revealed by research in the United States and elsewhere but, at least, we should do our part to maintain the present health of our people and to prevent a further growth of lung cancer by advising young people not to smoke.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that the support of the cinema proprietors should be solicited in this campaign. They could put warnings on their screens about the risk of lung cancer associated with smoking.  Suitable posters could be published&mdash;in substitution for the few leaflets the Minister has&mdash;at railway stations and on notice boards in public places and at prominent places in provincial towns. The help and assistance of Radio Éireann and Telefís Éireann should also be solicited.  The Department of Education should be approached by the Minister for Health with a view, not to warning children when they are leaving school, but to having frequent talks in the schools advising children against cigarette smoking and warning them of its very dangerous effects.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter in the hope that the Minister will take a more serious <Col N="1643" /> view of it than he has up to the present.  I cannot say what weight of influence from the manufacturers may be behind the Minister, but he should not worry about that.  He is responsible for the health of the people, the health of the nation.  It is his responsibility to advise people against heavy cigarette smoking if he sees there is a danger of fatal results from that habit.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that people will get together and start a great voluntary effort warning and advising our people against cigarette smoking.  If such a movement were undertaken I am sure it would have the co-operation and support of everyone, and the goodwill of the Minister.  I trust his Department will be more alive to their responsibility and duty in this regard to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>The tirade we have just listened to is apparently based on statistics which I furnished to the Deputy, and a number of other Deputies, in reply to Questions Nos. 8 and 9 which were addressed to me to-day.  Those statistics show that the number of deaths which were diagnosed as being due to lung cancer in 1957 was 606, and that in 1961 it is envisaged it may be 680.  The Deputy assumed from that that lung cancer was more prevalent in this country in the year 1961 than it was in the year 1957. That is an unfounded assumption. After all, a great deal of money is being spent and a great deal of research is being conducted, in order to ensure that cancer will be diagnosed in every case in which it occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite possible&mdash;I am not suggesting that it is positively true but it is possible&mdash;that the increase in the number of deaths now recorded as being due to lung cancer is due to the fact that our cancer services have been expanding and improving and that methods of diagnosis are very much more accurate than they were in 1957.  I must say I was surprised when I heard that Deputy Flanagan had notified the Chair that he proposed to raise this question on the Adjournment.  I could <Col N="1644" /> not see what reason he could have for doing so.  I understand now that there may be one or two reasons: first of all, that the Deputy is a sort of political pharisee and that he raised the question in order that he might parade his virtues and be able to inform the House, and through the House, the country, that he neither drank nor smoked.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan </NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee </NameTxt>
      <P>If he wants to single himself out in that peculiar way, he is entitled to do so, but I hope he will do it with some sincerity.  The Deputy has attacked the Minister for Health apparently because he thinks the Minister does not appear to be as active as he should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee </NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, if the Minister is inactive, it is up to Deputy Flanagan or any other member of the House to spur him on and make certain that he does his duty.  On 6th June, 1959, I wrote a letter to Deputy Flanagan.  I shall quote the first paragraph:</P>
      <P>Last year I examined the reports of a number of scientific investigations which had been made in different parts of the world into the marked rise which had taken place in recent years in the death rate from cancer of the lung, with particular reference to the possible association between tobacco smoking and the disease.  These investigations showed with regard to lung cancer in men that the death rate is higher in smokers than in non-smokers, and is the highest among heavy cigarette smokers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invited the Deputy to co-operate with the Minister for Health in bringing this fact home to the general public.  What was the response which I got from Deputy Flanagan?  He did not even answer my letter, in contradistinction to my usual practice.  I receive letters from Deputy Flanagan and other Deputies and the least that can be said is that they get an acknowledgement and, whatever matter they bring <Col N="1645" /> before me, at least, I look at and investigate to see if I can help Deputies out of their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Here is a case where Deputy Flanagan was written to by me&mdash;in a letter signed by me personally&mdash;inviting him to co-operate in a campaign to bring home to our young people, in particular, the dangers which are inherent in excessive cigarette smoking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan </NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee </NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy agrees with me.  After all, I am trying to do my duty.  The Deputy is a public man, and a very important public man in his constituency.  He headed the poll at a number of general elections.  A man with such a commanding influence among people who know him could be of the greatest possible help to the Minister for Health and to the health authorities in a matter of this kind, but I have never heard that Deputy Flanagan once raised this matter at any health authority meeting in the county of Laois. I have never heard him speak.  I have never seen a letter written by him on this subject.  What happened?  He thought Deputy Dr. Browne was on a good thing, politically, and he became the whipper-in to Deputy Dr. Browne. When Deputy Dr. Browne put down this question, Deputy O.J. Flanagan wanted to get a little of the limelight. He stole Deputy Dr. Browne's thunder. He gave notice he would raise this question on the Adjournment in order that he might advertise himself, a little, too.  That is why I call him a political pharisee.</P>
      <P>The Deputy had one or two slogans &mdash;quite useful slogans, I will admit.  It only shows his <i>expertise</i> as a politician. He is able to coin a phrase.  He coined phrases tonight and flung them across the floor of this House.  I began to wonder if Deputy O.J. Flanagan, when he was advocating that we should engage in a Press campaign, was thinking of starting an advertising agency himself and wanted to show the people what sort of goods he could deliver to his customer.  That is not the way in which I approach this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were raising this matter on the Adjournment, I should go to the root <Col N="1646" /> of it.  I should try to deduce evidence that the people did not fully realise the dangers inherent in excessive cigarette smoking.  So far as the Stock Exchange may regard it, so far as one hears among those with whom one associates, there are very few people in this country who do not realise that if you smoke excessively you are incurring the risk of premature death.  When people realise that, what is the use of carrying out an intensive advertising campaign?</P>
    <P>We are getting to the root of this matter through the schools.  We are pointing out to the young people that if they want to lead healthy, active lives the best thing for them to do is not to start smoking at all.  When we are doing that&mdash;and we are doing it at some expense&mdash;why should we spend money on a campaign which is really not likely to be very highly effective?</P>
    <P>I saw the Deputy in the Opposition Lobby on the Vote on Account.  He voted against providing the necessary sum&mdash;£49 million, or whatever it may be&mdash;to carry on the public services for another few months.  He voted against it because he felt it was an excessive burden on the people.  In that £49 million there is provision for old age pensions, for all the social welfare benefits, for the education of the children, for the health services, for assisting agriculture to develop and become competitive.  All these things were embodied in that Vote on Account and Deputy O.J. Flanagan voted against it because he thought the sum we were asking for was excessive, that the people could not bear it.</P>
    <P>Now he wants to impose an additional burden&mdash;and, I think, an unnecessary burden&mdash;on their backs by asking me to intensify a campaign which has already been conducted, in the most effective way, in getting at the evil at the root and in trying to persuade young people not to form the habit of smoking.  Everybody knows &mdash;it is the common experience of mankind, we do not have to prove it&mdash; if people are told by a Government to do a thing, their first reaction as independent persons is to ignore what <Col N="1647" /> the Government ask them to do, particularly if it affects their private lives and ordinary habits of living.  Therefore, as I said in reply to Deputy Dr. Browne this afternoon, we have to bear in mind that, in order to secure the proper response from adults, we have to conduct these campaigns with some sense of responsibility and discretion&mdash;and that is the line I have taken.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any reason <Col N="1648" /> for me to be apologetic.  I have dealt with this problem&mdash;it is a great problem for the Minister for Finance&mdash;in a rational way guided and directed by ordinary common sense.</P>
