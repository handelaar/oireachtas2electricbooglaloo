      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the invitation of the Council of the European Economic Community, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I attended a preliminary meeting in Brussels on the 18th January with representatives of the States members of the Community, at which I made a comprehensive statement concerning our application for membership of the Community.  The text of this statement has been published. There was no substantive discussion <Col N="2" /> as the representatives of the Six wished to have time to study the statement.  The matter will come before the Council early in March and it was agreed that there will be a further meeting between us and the representatives of the Member States at the end of March or early in April.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government will publish, in a White Paper or in some other form, a reasonably detailed account of the present position of external tariffs applied by Ireland as compared with the present tariff position of the countries of the European Economic Community and with the tariff position, internal and external, which the European Economic Community hopes to reach by 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Copies of the tariffs of the member countries of the European Economic Community, as operative prior to the 1st January, 1962, and of the common external tariff of the Community are available <Col N="3" /> in the Library.  The January, 1962, editions of the tariffs of the member countries will be available shortly. Copies of the Irish tariff transposed into the same nomenclature as those of the member countries and entitled &ldquo;Draft Customs and Excise Tariff&rdquo; are also available in the Library.  This draft tariff enables comparisons to be made between Irish rates of duty and those in the tariffs of the member countries and in the common external tariff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to a similar question on 15th November. Of the developments which have taken place in the meantime, those of most consequence to us are the decisions taken by the EEC Council of Ministers in relation to the common agricultural policy.  I propose to make available to members of the Oireachtas, in an appropriate form, information in regard to these decisions as soon as the final texts have been received and examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give us any indication when that is likely to be?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is desirable to get a clear statement of the texts so that the implications of these decisions can be fully understood.  As soon as they are available, they will be circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not recall that on a previous occasion we asked for a White Paper and at first, it did not seem expedient to him <Col N="4" /> to provide it?  Then it became obvious that a White Paper was urgently needed, and he provided it at very short notice.  Would the Taoiseach consider, in view of the considerable public discussion so easily generated about certain facets of the Common Market situation, that it might be desirable to provide an up-to-date White Paper, giving not only the strictly economic implications of the Agreement provided for under the Rome Treaty but the political and other consequences that may probably fall due for consideration if the negotiations proceed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the statement of 23rd January by Dr. Willi Birkelbach in an EEC report that membership of the Common Market entails a clear cut siding with the EEC on foreign policy and defence matters he has had any discussion, apart from the <Col N="6" /> references made to the matter in his opening statement in the Brussels negotiations, on the subject of Ireland joining NATO; and, if so, what have been the results of such discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take together Questions Nos. 5 to 13 inclusive.</P>
      <P>No proposal, request or suggestion regarding Ireland's position in relation to NATO has been made, formally or informally, by the European Economic Community, or by the Government of any member thereof; and no question of a change of policy in this regard has been considered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach give the House an assurance that we will not be insinuated into NATO by indiscreet speeches made by Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can certainly give an assurance we will not be insinuated into NATO or anything else and also that Ministers will not make, and never have made, indiscreet speeches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach not read the report of the speech of the Minister for Lands in the <i>Irish Press</i> of the 6th of this month in which he said it would be unrealistic not to have regard to the fact that the six EEC countries were now members of NATO and that they were brought into that by reason of the fact that they had common policies on foreign affairs and on defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite get the point of the Deputy's supplementary. It is of course necessary to take account of the realities.  The Minister for Lands referred to the realities.  May I say in this regard that I think it would be highly undesirable that remarks made here should give the impression in Europe that there is a public opinion in this country which regards membership of NATO as something discreditable.  The view of the Government in that regard has been made clear.  We think the existence of NATO is necessary for the preservation of peace and for the defence of the countries of Western <Col N="7" /> Europe, including this country. Although we are not members of NATO, we are in full agreement with its aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the fact that we may be giving a wrong impression abroad.  Would he also have regard to the feelings of the people in Ireland who, after reading the speech of the Minister for Lands, believed that this was the thin end of the wedge to get this country into NATO?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no evidence that anybody believed that, except the political correspondent of the <i>Irish Times</i> and Deputy Corish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> had the Minister's statement as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that anybody can produce to him the evidence of the people at that dinner who heard with their own ears the Minister for Lands making a statement diametrically opposite to what the Taoiseach has stated, and would the proper course for the Taoiseach then not be to call for the Minister's resignation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No sober person at that dinner could have heard differently from what the Press reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Taoiseach to have chosen the word &ldquo;sober&rdquo; quite deliberately?  Do I understand the Taoiseach to make the allegation that the people there present who heard the Minister were not sober, or who was it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands was dropping a stone down a well, listening for the echo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach suggest that we have some moral responsibility to join NATO?  Is it not right that from 1941 to 1945 Ireland supported the American steps against Nazism and Communism though we did not take any part in that battle? What has now caused the change over in support of NATO?  What is the moral responsibility?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say if he approves of the statement made by the Minister for Lands in relation to the unworthy insinuation against a member of this House who found it necessary to comment on the statements made by him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a question in relation to the Minister's statement later on the Order Paper but it seems to me that nobody who read the actual text of what the Minister said could have misunderstood it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> It should hardly be necessary for me to say that there is no possibility that this or any other Irish Government would give an undertaking, in any circumstances, which would impede in any degree the fulfilment of the national will to restore the territorial unity of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that one of the reasons put forward by the Taoiseach's predecessor against joining NATO was that if we did, we would have to respect the so-called territorial rights of Britain in the Six Counties and that his predecessor was not prepared to do that?  Does the Taoiseach now change and say there is no responsibility on us to accept the British rights in the Six Counties?</P>

      <P>In my view, it is not in the national interest to represent that as implying an undertaking to preserve the Partition situation, having regard to a corresponding phrase in the Charter of the United Nations, and indeed of the old League of Nations, which we have accepted.</P>

      <P>It will be recalled that in replying to a number of questions on 15th November last I mentioned that discussions had been taking place within a Special Committee appointed by the Member States of the EEC to produce an instrument which would give effect to the Bonn Declaration of 18th July last and that this instrument would provide for consultation and co-operation over a wide field including foreign policy.

      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to circulate in the Official Report the text of the Bonn statement of the 18th July, 1961, which is generally referred to as &ldquo;the Bonn Declaration&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I might add that the July-August, 1961, issue of the <i>Bulletin of the European Economic Community,</i> which is available in the Library, incorporates the text of the statement.</P>
      <P>The statement is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P Just="Center">Statement Issued by the Heads of State or Government.</P>
      <P Just="Center">(Meeting in Bonn on 18 July, 1961)</P>
      <P>The heads of State or Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg as well as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, desirous of affirming the spiritual values and political traditions which form their common heritage, united in the awareness of the great tasks which Europe is called upon to fulfil within the community of free peoples in order to safeguard liberty and peace in the world, anxious to strengthen the political, economic, social and cultural ties which exist between their peoples, especially in the framework of the European Communities, and to advance towards the union of Europe;</P>
      <P>Convinced that only a united Europe, allied to the United States of America and to other free peoples, is in a position to face the dangers which menace the existence of Europe and of the whole free world, and that it is important to unite the energies, capabilities, and resources of all those for whom liberty is an inalienable possession; resolved to develop their political co-operation with a view to the union of Europe and to continue at the same time the work already undertaken in the European Communities;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wishing for the accession to the European Communities of other European States ready to assume in all <Col N="16" /> spheres the same responsibilities and the same obligations, have decided:</P>
    <P>1.  To give shape to the will for political union already implicit in the Treaties establishing the European Communities, and for this purpose to organise their co-operation, to provide for its development and to secure for it the regularity which will progressively create the conditions for a common policy and will ultimately make it possible to embody in institutions the work that has been begun;</P>
    <P>2.  To hold at regular intervals meetings whose aim will be to compare their views, to concert their policies and to reach common positions in order to further the political union of Europe, thereby strengthening the Atlantic alliance.  The necessary practical measures will be taken to prepare these meetings.  In addition, the continuation of active co-operation among the Foreign Ministers will contribute to the continuity of the action undertaken in common. The co-operation of the Six must go beyond the strictly political field, and will in particular be extended to the sphere of education, of culture, and of research, where it will be ensured by periodical meetings of the Ministers concerned;</P>
    <P>3.  To instruct their Committee to submit to them proposals on the means which will as soon as possible enable a statutory character to be given to the union of their peoples.</P>
    <P>The heads of State or Government are convinced that by thus organising their co-operation they will further the application of the Rome and Paris Treaties.  They also believe that their co-operation will facilitate any reforms which might seem opportune in the interests of the greater efficiency of the Communities.</P>
    <P>To this end they have decided:</P>
    <P>(a)  To have a study made of the various points of the Resolution of the European Parliament of 29 June, 1961, on the subject of political co-operation among the Member States of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> (b)  To associate public opinion more closely with the efforts already undertaken, by inciting the European Parliament to extend the range of its debates to new fields, with the co-operation of the Governments.</P>
    <P>Declaration on Cultural Co-operation.</P>
    <P>The following Declaration on Cultural Co-operation among the Six was adopted in Bonn:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Conference of heads of State or Government, meeting in Bonn on 18 July, 1961, has taken note of the report drawn up by the Study Committee on the subject of co-operation in the field of higher education and research.</P>
    <P>It has envisaged the establishment of a Council composed of the Ministers of National Education or the Ministers whose responsibilities include international cultural relations, assisted by a committee of experts, as well as the negotiation of one or several conventions on the following subjects:</P>
    <P>(a)  Co-operation and exchanges between universities of the Member Countries of the European Communities;</P>
    <P>(b)  The &ldquo;European status&rdquo; (&ldquo;vocation européenne&rdquo;) which could be accorded to university or research institutes in the various countries;</P>
    <P>(c)  The establishment by Italy of a European University in Florence, to the intellectual life and financing of which the six Governments will contribute;</P>
    <P>(d)  The possible establishment of other European institutes devoted to university teaching or to scientific research.</P>
    <P>The Study Committee has been instructed to work out as quickly as possible drafts for the conventions and acts which are to embody this plan for cultural co-operation.&rdquo;</P>

Would it not be better to circulate it separately?  We do not want to reach the stage in Dáil Éireann, a stage which has been reached in certain other deliberative assemblies, in which any of us desiring to have something recorded in the records of the Dáil can, by leave of the Chair, get it inserted. We have never done that heretofore so far as I know.  Might I suggest to the Taoiseach it might be a better procedure simply to send a copy to each individual Deputy?</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree it would be a considerable advantage to the members of this House and to the public if they knew the lines on which the statesmen and parliamentarians of Europe are discussing the problems underlying the political implications of the Rome Treaty?  To my own knowledge there has been considerable debate already in the Parliament of the Six concerning these.

      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to consider a supplementary matter arising out of the last question.  Would he agree that in this country, having taken the decision to join the European Economic Community, two duties have to devolve on any patriotic opposition?  One is to ask the questions which have to be asked in regard to this matter and the second is to forbear from harassing the Government with hypothetical questions, the replies to which must inevitably embarrass the Government, both at home and abroad.  Having regard to those responsibilities of the Opposition, would the Taoiseach not consider the desirability of providing a most comprehensive White Paper setting out the situation as it is at the earliest convenient date so that the fullest information may be provided and so that a responsible Opposition may confine its questions to the Government only in so far as they deal with the information the Government has got?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully.  It is my intention to keep the House provided with all the information which I can, while accepting, as the Deputy <Col N="25" /> does, the undesirability of dealing with hypothetical questions relating to matters that may be the subject of discussion with the EEC.  So far as the present position is concerned, the White Paper published last year dealt fairly fully with the mechanism and procedures of the Treaty of Rome. Nothing of any great import has developed in the meantime, except with regard to the agricultural position, which is, of course, of special significance to us.  I am most anxious to get that information to the House and to the country as quickly as possible but the secretariat in Brussels seem to be engaged in a process of settling what has been decided and until that is clarified by the secretariat, it would be impossible to give an informative document to the House.  As soon as we can get an authoritative statement of the decisions, my intention is to have them translated and circulated with some supplementary information relating to Irish conditions.  With regard to the political implications, it is clear that nothing of any authority can be said until the Fouchet Committee has completed its deliberations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately the Deputy's question is of such a nature as to demand a detailed reply which, notwithstanding my efforts to compress it, is somewhat lengthy.  I should be glad, therefore, if I were permitted to treat the question as one for written answer so that the information may appear in the Official Report without its being necessary for me to trespass on the time of the House by reading it.</P>
      <P>Following is the written answer:</P>
      <P>I have seen some Press reports expressing concern at the mortality among elderly patients in the County Home, Stranorlar, during the recent cold spell.  These reports referred to an allegation by a member of the Donegal County Council that there was an abnormally high death rate in the County Home during that period and that this was due to a lack of adequate heating facilities in the Institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cold spell in the Donegal area, mentioned in the press reports, lasted, I understand, from the 25th December to 4th January, that is, for eleven days.  The mean daily temperature at Malin Head, the nearest meteorological station, during the period ranged from 32.6 degrees to 38.4 degrees.  The average of the daily means was 35.6 degrees.  I have been informed by the local authority that four patients died in the County Home <Col N="33" /> during that period.  The ages of these four patients ranged from 77 to 90 years.  During the corresponding eleven days in 1960/61 the temperatures were considerably higher.  The lowest mean figure was 38.3 degrees and the average of the daily means was 41 degrees.  During that period, five deaths occurred.  Furthermore, I have been informed that during the whole of December and January last the number of deaths which occurred in this Institution, of about 200 beds, was 15, which figure was the lowest for these months for the last five years. It would appear from these figures, therefore, that recent mortality among patients in the Home is not abnormally high.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that accommodation and facilities for the care of patients in the County Home, Stranorlar, are inadequate and unsatisfactory by modern standards.  I am equally well aware that the present lack of proper heating facilities in that Institution can be a source of particular hardship to the old people there in very cold weather.  Installation of an effective system of central heating, as part of the comprehensive scheme of improvements now being planned, will remedy the latter defect.  The local authority, with my approval, have made some effort to improve the heating facilities in the meantime by the installation, about a year ago, of 20 electric heaters. An additional 14 heaters are at present being installed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Deputy's query as to the action taken by my Department in dealing with proposals for the general improvement of the County Home, I think it well to place the following facts on record.</P>
    <P>Following the issue, in October, 1951, of the White Paper announcing the Government's proposals for a comprehensive programme of reconstruction and improvement of County Homes, the Donegal County Council, in common with other local authorities, undertook the preparation of a scheme for the improvement of their County Home.  Agreement was reached on the future bed complement of the Home and draft plans for the reconstruction of the premises were submitted by the Council in July, 1956 when, unfortunately, <Col N="34" /> the financial stringency, which occurred in the latter part of that year, intervened to cause a suspension of planning of county home schemes generally.</P>
    <P>In March, 1959, due to the improved Exchequer position, I was able to authorise a resumption of planning of such schemes and my anxiety to press ahead with the Stranorlar project was conveyed to the local authority.  The Council informed the Department in July, 1959, that they had decided on the preparation of a revised comprehensive scheme of improvements.  Such a scheme was submitted by the local authority in May, 1960, but examination of it by the Department had to be suspended when the Council indicated in October, 1960, that they were concerned at the elaborate nature and cost of the scheme and that they intended to consider a smaller scheme.</P>
    <P>The Department did not approve of the modified scheme adopted at the Council's meeting on the 30th January, 1961, as it would leave unremedied some of the grosser defects in the County Home.  The Council were pressed in March, 1961, to proceed with the comprehensive scheme and they eventually agreed to do so.  This scheme, suitably amended in accordance with suggestions made by the Department, was submitted by the local authority in August, 1961, but a final decision on it was held up until a report from the Council on the condition of the existing timber work was received.  That report was received in the Department on 15th December, 1961.  The scheme has now been generally approved and the Council have instructed their architect to prepare working drawings for the proposed new extension to the Home and new boilerhouse.  The erection of these new units will comprise the first stage of the scheme and will facilitate the temporary evacuation of a section of the present accommodation to make way for the second stage&mdash;the reconstruction of the existing buildings.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that planning the reconstruction and modernisation of structures like these County Homes, originally built over a century ago according to the very different standards then obtaining, is a matter of <Col N="35" /> considerable technical difficulty.  This has, no doubt, been a contributory cause of delay in the preparation of an acceptable scheme for the County Home at Stranorlar, but I should like to assure the Deputy that my Department will do everything possible to ensure that the scheme, the nature and scope of which has now been approved, will be speedily implemented with a view to providing a reasonable standard of accommodation and comfort for the patients there.</P>
    <P>While, as I have said, conditions in the County Home are far from satisfactory and must be improved substantially, I think this reply might give an incorrect picture if it did not make mention of the enormous improvement in hospital accommodation which has been achieved in recent years by the joint efforts of the Donegal County Council and the Department of Health. Three entirely new hospitals have been provided, the County Hospital at Letterkenny, the District Hospital at Dungloe and the Sanatorium at Killybegs. The District Hospital at Carndonagh has been entirely reconstructed and major improvements have been carried out at other hospitals throughout the county.  This represents a large programme in terms of planning and expenditure which deserves to be taken into account when dealing with the shortcomings of an institution to which it was not possible, for a variety of reasons, to give the priority which it merited.</P>

      <P>I can, however, offer the Deputy such assurance as arises from the fact that there are arrangements, on a reciprocal basis, under which health administrations in the United Kingdom and in the greater part of Western Europe have undertaken to notify my Department of the name of any known contact who travels to this country. In addition, there has been an excellent response to the appeals made to travellers coming from affected areas to disclose the fact to the health control at seaports and airports of entry and in such cases particulars are forwarded to the health authority in the area to which the traveller is proceeding.</P>

      <P>I assume that the benefits to which the Deputy refers are the allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations and under the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations.</P>
      <P>The rates of allowances specified in the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) regulations are maximum rates and the amount payable in any particular instance is at the discretion of the health authority within the specified maximum applicable to the circumstances of the case.  Income from other sources, including social welfare benefits, is ordinarily taken into account but where in exceptional cases, a health authority considers that undue hardship would be caused by adhering strictly to this policy, they have discretion to disregard such income in whole or in part and, accordingly, it is possible, in cases where hardship would otherwise result, to allow recipients of maintenance allowances the benefit of social welfare increases.  Apart from hardship cases, I advised health authorities, when social welfare benefits were increased in January, 1961, to disregard these increases in the cases of persons who were recipients of both Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Allowances and social welfare benefits at the time of the increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining the amount of an allowance under the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations, 1960, a health authority must, in accordance with the regulations, have regard to the applicant's means, other than income from public assistance.  Having regard to their nature as a residual form of assistance, Disabled Persons Allowances would not ordinarily be payable to a person in receipt of social welfare benefits, but a health authority may, in exceptional circumstances, pay an allowance in such a case and may, if they consider that hardship would otherwise result, disregard any increase in <Col N="38" /> social welfare benefits when reviewing the allowance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The maximum domiciliary allowance payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations to an eligible person with dependent spouse is £3 8s. 0d. per week where such person is resident in a county borough and £3 3s. 0d. per week where resident elsewhere.  In addition, allowances for other dependants, including children, and, in appropriate cases, domestic <Col N="39" /> help and rent allowances are also payable.  I do not consider that these allowances compare unfavourably with the maximum amount paid to a married couple in receipt of the old age pension which is £3 10s. 0d. at the contributory rate and £3 at the non-contributory rate.</P>
    <P>The allowance payable under the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations is a personal allowance which was introduced to provide some measure of relief for certain disabled persons who do not qualify for social welfare benefits. Expenditure on these allowances now exceeds £700,000 per annum and I would not be prepared at this stage to vary this allowance in such a manner as to impose an additional burden on the taxpayers and ratepayers. The maximum rate was increased from 20s. to 22s. 6d. per week on 1st January, 1961.</P>

The particulars given are for the area comprising the five dispensary districts as the information is not available in respect of the exact section of the constituency.</P>
    <P>A revision of the general medical services register in County Westmeath was carried ou in 1961; this was the first revision since 1957 and accounts for the proportionately large number of medical cards withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Of the 20 cards withdrawn in the Meath section of the constituency, 16 were accounted for by deaths and departures from the area of the card holders, and 4 by improved circumstances.</P>
    <P>Of the 169 cards withdrawn in the Westmeath section of the constituency 67 were due to deaths and departures and 102 to altered circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In June, 1960, there was submitted for my sanction a proposal by the Dublin Health Authority to pay C.I.E. a subsidy of £1,000 per annum in respect of the provision by C.I.E. of free transport between St. Ita's Hospital and Donabate Railway Station for, mainly, mental hospital staff and the wives of such staff.</P>
      <P>After the most careful examination, I told the Dublin Health Authority that I was not satisfied that there was any statutory authority for the proposed payment.  In view, however, of the fact that certain staff (and wives in some cases) had enjoyed the privilege of free transport, I intimated that I would be prepared to consider a proposal to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to those who had been enjoying the privilege, in compensation for the loss of the privilege previously enjoyed by them.</P>

      <P>My attention has been drawn to the statement referred to by the Deputy.  I may point out, however, that, in the health authority area in question, the average cost of medicines and appliances per person eligible for general medical services is not excessive, by reference to the estimated national average.  In the case of the main general hospital in the area, the average cost of these items per patient day appears to be increasing rather rapidly and I am having the position looked into.</P>
      <P>While the cost of drugs and medicines supplied by health authorities under the health services is kept under review by my Department, I have no functions regarding an inquiry into the prices which the general public must pay for medicines; this would be a matter for the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <P>Under Section 41 (1) of the Health Act, 1947, health authorities may make provision for the training and education of persons suffering from or recovering from an infectious disease for employment suitable to their condition of health.  The infectious diseases to which this Section applies, at present, are tuberculosis and acute anterior poliomyelitis. A health authority could, therefore, contribute towards the living expenses of a former tuberculosis or poliomyelitis patient, not ordinarily resident in Dublin, during a rehabilitation training course in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The making of Regulations under Section 50 (2) of the Health Act, 1953 which would require health authorities to provide a service for the training and placement of other classes of disabled persons is at present under consideration in my Department.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance what securities are at present accepted at the nominal value thereof for death duties; and what conditions govern such acceptance.</P>

      <P>As the reply contains a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prospectuses of certain National Loans contain an undertaking regarding the acceptance of the relevant securities at face value in payment of Death Duties.  The undertaking (which is in <Col N="48" /> similar terms in each of the prospectuses) given in the prospectus of the 6 per cent.  Exchequer Stock, 1980-85 is as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Stock of this issue will be accepted, at its face value, with due allowance for any unpaid interest accrued thereon, as the equivalent of cash in satisfaction of Death Duties payable in respect of any property, provided it has formed part of that property continuously up to the date of death from the date of the original subscription or for a period of not less than three months immediately preceding the date of death.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Effect is given to the undertakings under the provisions of Section 16 of the Finance Act, 1953 (which is concerned with the 5 per cent. National Loan, 1962-72) and Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1954 (which applies to the 4½ per cent.  National Loan, 1973-78 and subsequent loans).  The sections provide for the making of regulations by the Minister for Finance prescribing the conditions under which the relevant securities may be accepted in payment of Death Duties.</P>
    <P>The National Loans, the prospectuses of which contain an undertaking in the terms referred to, are listed in the following table together with the statutory reference numbers of the appropriate regulations:</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the financial year 1960/61 Exchequer expenditure on public service pensions represented approximately 3.7 per cent. of total Exchequer expenditure on non-capital services.  This does not, however, take account of other benefits such as lump sums, death gratuities, etc., which, if included, would raise the proportion to approximately 4.7 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind the considerable shrinking in purchasing power since many of these pensions were fixed and the constant increases now taking place in the prices of commodities, could the Minister at this stage indicate that while it may take some time to give the increases to those concerned he at least admits the principle that increases are overdue and will make early provision for them? Many of these people are suffering dire hardship?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in the Dáil on this subject on 22nd November last.  In that reply I stated that it was desirable, where circumstances permitted, that the Irish investing public be given the opportunity of sharing as widely as practicable in the control of State-sponsored concerns and I pointed out that the issue to the public of shares in these concerns would not only encourage more private investment in Irish commercial and industrial projects by widening the field of investment but would also result in the freeing of State owned capital for other desirable purposes.</P>
      <P>I further stated that I had under examination the possibility of putting on the public market some of the capital of State-sponsored companies.</P>
      <P>This examination will be a lengthy one and I am not yet in a position to indicate all the criteria which will be adopted.  As I have already indicated they will include such matters as obtaining for the State a fair recompense in respect of capital already invested and, where a monopoly position is enjoyed, ensuring that the affairs of the companies will continue to be conducted in the national interest.</P>

Accordingly, it is not possible at present to say whether a satisfactory scheme can be produced and it will be about two years before a decision can be taken.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 76 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>In November last in reply to a number of questions I stated that we had been in consultation with the British Government concerning the provisions of the British Immigrants Bill and the question of how the freedom of movement of persons between Ireland and Britain might be preserved. As has now been stated by the British Home Secretary, it is not intended, in practice, to apply to persons coming from Ireland the provisions of the Bill restricting immigration to Britain. Consequently in order to preserve free movement between both countries it will be necessary for us to take steps which would enable us to control entry to Ireland from all countries other than Britain.  This matter is under active consideration and we are in touch with the British authorities concerning it.</P>
      <P>The question of the necessity for legislation to deal with the matter is also under consideration.</P>

I understand that increases in prices are due to (1) higher import prices for potassic and nitrogenous fertilisers and (2) increased manufacturing and importation costs due to rising labour and handling charges.  The price of one fertiliser, however&mdash;basic slag&mdash;shows a reduction on last season.</P>

The decision was based on financial and organisational considerations of a fundamental nature which could not have been affected by any steps taken by me or by my Department.</P>
      <P>There were frequent consultations between officials of my Department and of the company at all stages prior to the company's final decision.  I am glad to say that the company will continue to operate both scheduled and non-scheduled flights through the Airport in 1962.</P>

    <Title>State Lands (Workhouses) Bill, 1961&mdash; Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workhouse lands and buildings are at present vested in the State and the purpose of the Bill is to transfer these properties to the local health authorities. The lands and buildings in question became vested in the State under the Constitution of 1922.  They remained the property of the State <Col N="101" /> although, concurrent with their transfer, the workhouse system was dismantled. However, under the Constitution, they could not be alienated. Under the State Lands (Workhouses) Act, 1930, they may be leased by the Minister for periods up to ninety-nine years, or for shorter periods by the local public assistance authority, as the Minister's agent.  In either case, any net income received is applied to offset local expenditure on health services.</P>
    <P>Under Bunreacht na h-Éireann, State lands may be sold or transferred to other bodies or persons in accordance with legislation.  The State Property Act, 1954, provides for such sale or transfers of State lands generally, but not of the workhouse lands.  Thus there is as yet no statutory power under which the Minister for Health could dispose permanently of any of these lands.</P>
    <P>It is only by an accident of history that these lands are vested in the Minister for Health and not in the local health authorities, as successors of the old local Poor Law Guardians. Nowadays lands on which a local authority institution is built are normally vested in that authority.  Indeed, when, under the Tuberculosis (Establishment of Sanatoria) Act, 1945, the Minister for Health received power to acquire land for the building of sanatoria, he was specifically required by the Act to vest in the appropriate local authority when a sanatorium was completed all the lands requisite for the needs of the institution.  I consider it a logical step to provide at this point for the vesting of the workhouse lands in the health authorities, who occupy many of them and who, but for some quirks of constitutional and administrative history, would now be the actual owners or lessees.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill contains the necessary definitions.  Under Section 2 it is proposed that, on the Act coming into operation in relation to a parcel of workhouse land, that parcel will, without further legal formalities, be vested in the health authority in whose area it is situate.  The legal interest which will thus pass to the <Col N="102" /> health authority is that which is at present held by the State and varies from parcel to parcel.  In some cases it is freehold or fee simple ownership. In other it is ownership on a fee farm grant, that is, it is freehold but subject to a perpetual yearly rent.  In the remaining cases the lands are held on leases of varying lengths.</P>
    <P>Workhouse lands which are not used by the local health authorities are generally let by the Minister to other persons for miscellaneous purposes. Under Section 2 the benefit of leases and licences issued to such persons will be transferred to the health authority.  The net effect of this will be that rents receivable will go direct to the health authority, instead of first to the Minister and from him to the health authority.</P>
    <P>Land transferred to a health authority under the Act will be regarded as having been acquired by the authority under the Health Act of 1947 for the purposes of their powers and duties.  This will mean that the land can be used for some health purpose or, if it is not needed for such a purpose, may be put to use by the local authority in the discharge of some of their other functions&mdash;for example in the provision of houses.  If the health authority do not wish to put the land to any such use, they will have power with the Minister's consent to sell, exchange, let or otherwise dispose of it&mdash;subject of course to any standing commitments under existing leases or licences such as I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Some of the workhouse lands are at present held by county councils for purposes other than health purposes. Such lands will continue to be held for their present purposes.  Amongst other things this will facilitate many county councils in schemes to vest the ownership of any labourers' cottages which are situated on workhouse lands in the tenants of those cottages.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3, it is proposed to make provision that reports will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas at half-yearly intervals giving particulars regarding any of these lands, for the disposal of which the Minister has, during the preceding <Col N="103" /> six months, given his consent.  Leases for periods of less than twenty-one years will be exempted from this requirement.  These provisions are similar to those for state lands, as contained in the State Property Act, 1954. It could be held that the procedure is not necessary in the case of the workhouse lands as their disposal by the health authority will have been effected in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 83 of the Local Government Act, 1946, involving adequate prior notice to each member of the authority and the power of veto exercisable by the members on the disposal itself and on the terms of such disposal.</P>
    <P>Further, as the disposal and the terms of disposal are subject to the sanction of the Minister, the Minister is accountable to the Dáil and can be required to defend his action in conveying sanction.  However, it is, I think, appropriate that, although the ownership of these lands will now pass from the State, the Oireachtas should receive information at regular intervals on their eventual disposal.</P>
    <P>There are about 140 of these old workhouses in the State.  Some have been adapted for county homes. Others have been maintained for other uses, but many of the buildings are in various stages of decay.  The total area of land involved is about 1,700 acres.  The annual rentals payable to the Minister for Health for the lands that are leased amount in all to about £2,250 and the local authorities are also in receipt of smaller sums in respect of short leases granted by them.  The amount of property which will be subject to the provisions of the Bill is, therefore, relatively unsubstantial.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this Bill will make a minor but useful change in the law and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I wish to say that we are prepared to accept this Bill, as it appears to be a purely administrative change turning over certain lands from the Department of Health to the local authorities.  That, <Col N="104" /> in itself, is a desirable thing in any of the matters relating to health.  I have always been in favour of localising these matters as far as possible.  This appears to be a Bill for the transfer of workhouse lands and the Minister has said that it really does not concern workhouse lands as they are already in the possession of local authorities. That puzzles me.</P>

      <P>Then the Bill just transfer the ownership from the Department of Health to the local authority even though the lands are already in the possession of the local authority.

      <P>We believe this Bill is long overdue and we think it makes a very necessary change.  The whole point is that the lands at present in the occupation of the local authority will pass to their actual possession so that they will be entitled to vest houses and cottages.  That is the really important point.  In Meath there is a number of houses built on such lands and, while cottages built on local authority lands can be vested in the tenants, cottages built on workhouse lands cannot be so vested.  For that reason, we think the Bill will solve this problem and there should be no opposition to it.  It is welcomed by us and I am sure will be welcomed by everybody else in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable ratification by Ireland of the four Geneva Conventions which were concluded on the 12th August, 1949 at Geneva and signed on behalf of this country on the 19th December, 1949. The Conventions came into force in <Col N="106" /> October, 1950 and already 82 States have ratified or acceded to them.  The texts of the Conventions are scheduled to this Bill and members will have seen that they constitute an extensive and clear statement of the humanitarian principles which should be recognised and honoured in time of war.  The Conventions are, indeed, at the same time, the greatest single contribution ever made to the laws of war. They will always be associated with the Red Cross, both as to the past and as to the present.  The original Geneva Conventions, to which I shall make reference shortly, were concluded under the auspices and impetus of the Red Cross, and the Conventions which we have here are also due, to a very great extent, to the preparation and enthusiasm of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the years subsequent to World War II.  The Conventions deal with many interstate obligations but the Red Cross is nearly always concerned in the carrying out of those obligations.</P>
    <P>As members are aware, it is our long-established practice not to become a party to any international agreement unless we are in a position to enforce the provisions of the agreement. In the case of most international agreements there is no conflict with our law and we may, therefore, become parties without legislation. Sometimes, however, it is necessary either to change the provisions of our domestic legislation which are in conflict with the terms of the international agreement or, as in the present case, to provide that our domestic legislation is properly equipped to enforce the provisions of the international agreement in question. There is, of course, no conflict between our domestic legislation and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions but we would not be in a position fully to enforce those provisions unless this legislation were passed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is not intended to enact into our domestic law all the Articles of the Geneva Conventions&mdash;even though the Conventions are fully set out in the Schedules to the Bill.  In fact, only those Articles of the Conventions which are specifically covered <Col N="107" /> in the eight sections of the Bill are brought into our domestic law.</P>
    <P>The Conventions which are scheduled to the present Bill are the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>I.  Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field.</P>
    <P>This is the first or &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Geneva Convention and takes the place of the Convention on the same subject concluded also at Geneva on 27 July, 1929.  This, in turn, had replaced earlier Conventions in 1906 and 1864.  The 1864 Convention was one of the first achievements of the Red Cross, which was then only one year old.  Switzerland, a European country, not great in size but, then, as now, certainly great in spirit, acting on a recommendation of the Red Cross Conference of the previous year, called an interstate conference which drew up the 1864 Convention.</P>
    <P>II.  The Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea.</P>
    <P>The second or &ldquo;Maritime&rdquo; Convention, which is very similar in purpose and structure to the First Convention, replaces the Tenth Hague Convention of 18 October, 1907, which had also replaced Conventions of 1868 and 1899.  The general principle underlying the Convention is that members of the armed forces, and those assimilated to them, who are at sea and who are sick, wounded or shipwrecked must be respected and protected in all circumstances.  Like sick or wounded armed forces on land, they must be treated humanely.</P>
    <P>III.  The Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.</P>
    <P>The third or &ldquo;Prisoners-of-War&rdquo; Convention is also a development of a 1929 Convention but this latter was the first international treaty on the protection of prisoners-of-war.  During World War II, the 1929 Convention provided the basis for action by <Col N="108" /> the International Committee of the Red Cross on behalf of millions of prisoners-of-war.  It made it possible for the Red Cross to carry out over 11,000 camp visits and to have a cardindex on prisoners-of-war amounting to 30,000,000.  Particularly in the war in Western Europe and in North Africa, the 1929 Convention was successful. The system of the protecting powers operated extensively, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, working on the basis of the 1929 Convention, was very active.</P>
    <P>IV.  The Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.</P>
    <P>According as war becomes more and more devastating, there is less and less distinction between its effects on armies, on the one hand, and civilian populations, on the other.  The fourth or &ldquo;Civilians&rdquo; Convention is the first international treaty of its kind and responds to a long-felt need in positive international law to protect effectively civilians in time of war.</P>
    <P>Our law is already adequate to carry out most of the requirements of the Conventions; this Bill will enable us to meet all their requirements fully.  The principle purpose of the Bill is to provide for the punishment of &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; of the Conventions in accordance with Article 49 of the First Convention, Article 50 of the Second Convention, Article 129 of the Third Convention and Article 146 of the Fourth Convention.  The following matters are included in the term &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo;: wilful killing; torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments; wilfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health; extensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly; compelling prisoners-of-war or other protected persons to serve in the forces of the hostile power; wilfully depriving protected persons of the rights of fair and regular trial prescribed in the Conventions; the taking of hostages; unlawful deportation or transfer or unlawful confinement of protected persons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="109" /> In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Conventions to which I have referred it is necessary that Irish legislation should provide not only for the punishment of &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; if committed within the country but also if they are committed by Irish citizens or citizens of other countries outside Ireland.  This is a new departure in our criminal law but it may be regarded as justified by the gravity and international character of the crimes involved.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for punishment of &ldquo;minor breaches&rdquo; of the Conventions. As Deputies will have seen, the Articles in each of the Conventions which deal with the &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; also make it obligatory for contracting parties &ldquo;to take measures necessary for the suppression of all acts contrary to the provisions&rdquo; of the Convention in question.  I am advised that this involves the obligation to provide specifically for the punishment of these acts and we are therefore taking this opportunity of so providing.  The following are examples of minor breaches: non-burial of persons protected by the Conventions or nonrespect of the graves of deceased protected persons which would be contrary to Article 17 of Convention I, Article 120 of Convention III or Article 130 of Convention IV; non-transmission of correspondence which would be contrary to Article 76 of Convention III or Article 107 of Convention IV; exposing prisoners-of-war to public humiliation which would be contrary to Article 13 of Convention III.</P>
    <P>Procedural guarantees are ensured in the remaining sections of the Bill. These relate, first, to the necessity to serve notice on a protecting power regarding the trial of prisoners of war and internees, secondly, an accused person's right to legal representation and, thirdly, appeals.  These Articles reproduce to a large extent the provisions of the earlier Conventions to which I have referred and, as far as prisoners of war are concerned, have proved in the past to be of practical advantage to accused persons.</P>
    <P>Two Acts have already been passed by the Oirechtas to enable ratification of these Conventions.  The Red Cross Act, 1954 and the Prisoners of War <Col N="110" /> and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956.  The purpose of the 1954 Act was to make it one of the primary objects of the Irish Red Cross Society to furnish relief to civilians who are protected persons within the meaning of the Convention relative to the Treatment of Civilian Persons in Time of War and enable internationally-recognised symbols used by certain countries instead of the Red Cross, viz., the Red Crescent and the Red Lion and Sun, to be protected from future unauthorised use in this country.  The 1956 Act was intended to provide for the internment and treatment of prisoners of war and enemy aliens so that the conditions of internment, discipline, etc., of such persons should accord with the requirements of the Conventions.</P>
    <P>This, then, is the third piece of legislation introduced to enable us to become parties to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and I have no doubt that it will meet with the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The steps being taken to ratify these three Conventions meet with approval from this side of the House.  A frequent test in the community of nations of the <i>bona fides</i> of a State is the extent to which it is prepared to ratify and accept international conventions.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that this country should ratify as many of these international conventions as possible. Whilst it is appreciated that in this case it is necessary to introduce legislation to give effect to the requirements of the conventions, so that they can formally be ratified, I would like to know whether there are other conventions which we would be prepared to ratify but which require legislative sanction of one sort or another and, if there are, I should be glad if the Minister would indicate if it is proposed to introduce legislation so that they may be ratified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We enact this piece of legislation in the firm hope that we shall never have to implement any part of it.  We do so in the firm hope that the circumstances in which these conventions may be required to operate will never arise.  In time of war, international conventions are very frequently relegated <Col N="111" /> to the back of the minds of the participants but, as the Minister pointed out, the work of these international organisations in the past has borne considerable fruit in times of war.</P>
    <P>Whilst it is, perhaps, legitimate to be cynical about the expressions that certain States are prepared to utter in times of war, the fact is that these Conventions in the past have helped to ameliorate the lot of people who suffered from the awful effects of war. The working of the Red Cross in this regard is something to which it is proper to give recognition.  As the Minister has pointed out, the fact that the Red Cross has helped so admirably so many unfortunate persons in previous conflicts is something to which we should give recognition and approbation.</P>
    <P>The only matter of detail to which I should like to refer is the rather wide terms of Section 3 of the Bill which refers to the indictment of persons committing grievous breaches of the Scheduled Conventions.  As drafted, the Bill would empower our Attorney-General to approve in proceedings being instituted against any person, whatever his nationality, who committed an offence anywhere in the world in respect of these Conventions. It may or may not be desirable that such a very wide ambit should be given to the enabling part of this legislation but it seems to me that we are introducing a very new and novel concept into our criminal law and I wonder is it necessary for the proper legal status of these Conventions that such wide power should be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister says, this Bill is for the purpose of enabling us to become parties to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.  We in the Labour Party would find little, if anything at all, to disagree with in the suggestion that we should now ratify them but there are one or two things I should like the Minister to let me know when he is replying, if the information is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, the provisions laid down in the Bill are highly desirable. <Col N="112" /> Whether they are going to be much use if there is a nuclear war is a matter which is very doubtful but I suppose we have to take things as they come. The 1949 Conventions replace the 1929 Conventions.  I wonder if the Minister would say what countries have subscribed already to the 1949 Conventions?  Are there set rules laid down?</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the punishment of people, who might not be in this country, who committed an offence in respect of the Conventions. I should like to know if, in fact, this applies to all other countries that have accepted the Conventions.  Can they act in a similar way or are there certain punishments laid down in this country, similar to those obtaining in the countries that have accepted the Conventions?</P>
    <P>The only other thing I want to do is to point out that Article 47, Schedule 1, provides that information as to the content of the principles of the Geneva Conventions should be as widely disseminated as possible among military forces and the general public. Would the Minister say if any special arrangements are made to bring this matter to the notice of the armed Forces of this country and of the general public?</P>
    <P>My final point concerns the fact that these Conventions were supposed to be signed on 12th February, 1950.  I am glad that even at this late stage we have got round to signing them, even if we are 12 years behind time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Costello, I should like just to say that Section 3 which provides that anyone can be tried here for committing grave breaches of the Scheduled Conventions in any part of the world is in accordance with the Conventions.  The Conventions lay it down.  Therefore, before we can sign them, we must provide by law that it can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tully referred to the 1949 Convention and asked how many countries signed it.  In fact, I gave the number.  I think it was 82.  So, indeed, I take it that nearly all the countries that existed until the recent hive of new countries have signed it. One part of the course of training in <Col N="113" /> respect of our Armed Forces consists of instruction on their responsibilities towards prisoners of war and towards the Conventions that existed up to this time.  That covered them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a new departure&mdash;a new arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is part of the general instruction.  The officers deal with it very fully at the Military College.  They are expected to instruct their men.  I would take it that the Irish soldiers would abide by the provisions for humane treatment that are laid down as being obligatory whether it was the law or not.  It is only ordinary, common, decent treatment of a person who is in trouble, whether he is a military prisoner or a civilian.</P>
      <P>Deputy Declan Costello asked me were there any other Conventions which we were prepared to ratify that we cannot ratify in the absence of appropriate legislation.  I just do not know offhand whether there are any such.  I will look into the matter. Perhaps, if the Deputy raises the matter again on Committee Stage I will have a reply by that time.</P>

    <P>The effect of this amendment is to exclude from the definition of registered medical practitioner persons who have been registered provisionally or temporarily in the Irish Medical Register.  At present a post-mortem examination for the purposes of a coroner's inquest can be carried out by a doctor who is only provisionally registered, notwithstanding that the manner in which the post-mortem is performed and the inferences to be drawn from it may be of critical importance in subsequent murder or manslaughter proceedings.

If there is any question then of an amendment being required after the passage of years has shown it is required, it could be brought in.  The qualifications should be declared generally.  To put the matter in the more obvious form&mdash;the matter of local appointments and appointments made otherwise&mdash;in the case of local appointments, it was considered a good step to put them outside the reach, so to speak, of political patronage.  The way that was done was to have the local Appointments Commissioners deal with certain types of work.  It was discovered that one way of taking away the virtue of the local appointments system was that a person was chosen on political grounds and then qualifications for a particular post were prescribed which suited X who was political favourite and did not suit anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was all achieved by having power to make the qualifications specially for a particular individual; I mean, to relate the conditions to a particular individual.  For instance, there was sometimes a question about the age limits for a certain appointment. In order to crush out a number of competitors the age limit was put down so that only one particular individual would be qualified by it. The only answer to that is to make whatever qualifications that there should be for a particular post <Col N="117" /> general; they should be stated generally. Of course, allowance has to be made for the possibility that a general statement of qualifications is made and time shows either that these were badly stated or that certain people would be ruled out.  The answer to that is to give power by regulation which would come before the House to change the general statement of qualifications.  That would give room for anybody who knew that any political patronage was being worked to expose it in the Dáil, if a change in qualifications was being made to suit a particular appointment.  That is what I mean by amendment No. 5.</P>
    <P>As far as amendment No. 4 is concerned, I want to make subsections (1) and (2) of Section 7 apply to the office of coroner.  The sections I am referring to are those allowing an appointment by the local authority without the approval of the Commissioners where a person already&mdash;these are the circumstances&mdash;holds a pensionable allowance or grant from the local authority and some economy can be worked by giving that person another appointment.  In such cases the approval of the Local Appointments Commissioners is not necessary.  That should not apply in these circumstances. I do not think there is any necessity for making that exception in the case of local appointments.</P>
    <P>I have other amendments down and perhaps we could take those together also.  Amendment No. 7 is to say that the qualifications should be not merely as to age, health and character but should also include residence. Residence should not come in that particular order but it was the only way I could put it in by suitable amendment.  In the local appointments system the question of residence is a matter for regulation of a general type.  With regard to a coroner I understand the situation to be that he would be supposed to reside, or have his ordinary permanent residence, inside his area.</P>

      <P>There are provisions here for an exception to be made <Col N="118" /> and, of course, special provision would be made without regard to the deputy coroner who need not reside inside the coroner's area.  I do not see why, if there is to be a regulation, it should not be of the form it has been, that the coroner shall live in his area, not necessarily within a certain distance of what the coroner's area is.  These regulations should be made general with power to alter them. That could be dealt with by a later amendment.  The alteration must be done by regulation which will have to come before the House and be approved.  There is not sufficient elasticity to enable conditions of qualification which are of a general type to be varied, but notice would be given if there were any political background and that could be exposed.  That is what I am at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take amendment No. 4 first.  That amendment is designed to delete the words &ldquo;subsections (1) and (2) of Section 7&rdquo; from paragraph (b), subsection (3) of Section 8.  The reason those words were inserted in the Bill originally was to bring this matter of the appointment of coroners into line with general local government practice.  The effect of including the words in the paragraph is to bring about a situation where the conditions and qualifications laid down for the appointment of coroners would be prescribed and decided upon by the Minister, after consultation with the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been the position with regard to practically all other local government appointments since the passing of the Local Government Act, 1941.  Section 21, subsection (4) of the Local Government Act, 1941, provided that subsections (1) and (2) of Section 7 of the Act of 1926&mdash;which are the provisions we are dealing with here&mdash;&ldquo;shall cease to have effect in relation to every office under a local authority ...&rdquo; except the office of coroner and a few others.  So, in 1941, this way of doing things was brought into operation for practically all local government appointments except the office of coroner.  In other words, the situation was brought about <Col N="119" /> in 1941, in regard to all local government appointments, that qualifications and conditions would be decided upon mainly by the Minister in consultation with the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>The purpose of paragraph (b) is to bring that situation about with regard to the appointment of coroners also.  I think that is the correct thing to do.  I think that basically it is the Minister for Justice in this case&mdash;in the other cases, the Minister for Local Government&mdash;who should decide the particular qualifications, in consultation with the Local Appointments Commission, and then leave the selection of the coroner to the Local Appointments Commission in accordance with those conditions.  That deals with amendment No. 4.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5, proposed by Deputy McGilligan, would remove from the appointments a certain amount of flexibility which I think is desirable. I agree that, generally speaking, it should be sufficient to lay down conditions generally, as suggested by Deputy McGilligan, but I think there could arise a case in relation to a particular appointment where the Minister, in consultation with the Local Appointments Commission, would want to prescribe particular conditions. The type of thing I have in mind in that regard is that, because of the size and importance of a particular coroner's district, the Minister for Justice might want to prescribe different and probably more stringent qualifications than would be appropriate generally for coroners' districts throughout the country.  I think it is desirable that we should leave that amount of flexibility in Section 8, and for that reason I am opposing amendment No. 5.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, in proposing amendment No. 7, is, if I may say so, a little confused.  The Bill provides that, subject to exceptions, the coroner must reside in his district.  That proviso comes into operation and takes effect after the coroner has been appointed.  The effect of amendment No. 7 would be to lay down a stipulation as to residence of candidates for <Col N="120" /> appointment, and I do not think Deputy McGilligan wants that.  In other words, the effect of inserting the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in paragraph (c), subsection (3) of Section 8 would be that the place in which the candidates resided would become relevant to their appointment.  I do not think that is desirable at all.  It is not where the candidate lives that would be important from the point of view of his appointment as coroner, but his qualifications generally.  The proviso with regard to where he should reside comes into operation only subsequent to his appointment.  I do not think there is any need, therefore, to insert the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in paragraph (c) as suggested by amendment No. 7.  The paragraph as it reads is sufficient for our purposes, namely, that the qualifications would be qualifications as to age, health and character, and residence as such would not be relevant from the point of view of qualifications of candidates for appointments.</P>
    <P>While dealing with these amendments I might as well explain amendment No. 6 which is an official amendment in my name to correct a drafting error.  The amendment proposes to delete &ldquo;and subject to <i>Section</i> 14 of this Act&rdquo; because those words are not necessary.</P>

      <P>In relation to amendment No. 4 in the name of Deputy McGilligan, the Minister mentioned that the alteration which was brought about in relation to a number of appointments of officials of local authorities by the 1941 Act specifically excluded coroners.  I have not looked up the Dáil discussions on the matter but I take it there must have been substantial reasons at the time why the office of coroner should have been excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know to what extent it was examined but it seems to me that there are reasons why the office of coroner should not be put <Col N="121" /> in precisely the same boat as other local authority offices.  While it is true that the coroner will be paid by the local authority, he is not an employee of the local authority in the same sense as are most other officials of the local authority.  The coroner will occupy at least a quasi-judicial position and in his official position as coroner it may very well be that he will be charged with the responsibility of investigating in some sense the actions of people who might be his superiors in the local authority's service.  It does seem to me that there are reasons why the post of coroner should not be filled in exactly the same way as other local authority posts.  While, to some extent, it may be a distinction without a difference, it might be worth preserving the distinction that exists already, that the Appointments Commissioners fix the conditions with the consent of the Minister rather than that we would now make a change that the Minister fixes the conditions in consultation with the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy McGilligan's amendment No. 5, the Minister mentioned that circumstances might arise in relation to a particular appointment where particular conditions might be necessary.  Although it is not the meaning which the Minister gave to it, that is precisely the reason for the nervousness displayed by Deputy McGilligan. If you look on the Minister's words in another way, that particular condition might be fixed to suit a particular appointment in the sense of the particular person being considered for the appointment, it will be clear to the Minister why Deputy McGilligan has moved this amendment and the force behind the argument which he put up for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the question of general and particular qualifications, the reason the office of coroner was left out of the change which was made in the 1941 Act may simply have been that the Minister appropriate to him was the Minister for Justice.  Even in Section 7 of the Act of 1926 which Deputy McGilligan is anxious, as it were, to hold on to, there is this power to prescribe particular <Col N="122" /> conditions for a particular office. I quote subsection (1) of Section 7:</P>
      <P>Whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend a person for appointment to an office to which this Act applies the Commissioners shall with the consent of the Minister prescribe the qualifications as to age, health, character, education, training, experience and (where in the opinion of the Commissioners the duties of the office so require) sex for such office.</P>
      <P>So that subsection (1) of Section 7 is, in effect, making provision for the prescribing of conditions and qualifications for a particular office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the change I wish to make is desirable.  It is the Minister nowadays who should prescribe and it is in keeping with legislation generally of this sort.  This would avoid the political jobbery to which Deputy McGilligan referred and it is achieved by leaving the selection to the Appointments Commissioners in accordance with the conditions decided, in the main, by the Minister.  I think that is the trend in relation to these <Col N="123" /> things as specifically laid down in the Local Government Act, 1941.  I want to achieve the same thing here, that the Minister for Justice will be the person primarily responsible for prescribing the qualifications.</P>
      <P>In addition, I think we should retain the principle which is already in the 1926 Act, the principle of flexibility, and that we should have available to the Minister, in consultation all the time with the Local Appointments Commissioners, the right to prescribe particular conditions for a particular office.  It is quite clear that a little flexibility is desirable and could be important on certain occasions. You may have a particularly important coroner's office and want to prescribe certain conditions for it.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy McGilligan need have any fears on this matter. After all, the conditions are prescribed and so long as the selection is made by the Commissioners, any fears Deputy McGilligan might have of political patronage are groundless. The Minister's only power in the matter is to prescribe the qualifications. After that, he is out of it.</P>

      <P>The Minister ought to make inquiries from the Department of Local Government where he would find a number of examples of qualifications being made to suit a certain limited number of <Col N="124" /> people in the hope that the Party candidate would get through.  In this piece of legislation, we are giving coroners an amazing position.  They are almost being equated to judges. Coroners can be appointed here with very little in the way of overriding qualifications because matters regarding professional training do not count for much.  We shall discuss that on Section 12 and 14.</P>
      <P>The situation now is that coroners can be appointed and hold office up to a certain age limit and can be dismissed only in what I might call the judicial way by an order which says that a coroner is guilty of misbehaviour or incapacity.  The two words are covered by a multitude of phrases.  I think, in such a position as that, there should be some better guardianship. I think it is desirable to have the Local Appointments Commissioners taking the lead in the matter, having the consent of the Minister.  The qualifications should be stated generally.  The more definitely that course is followed, the less chance there is for political jobbery.  If it is possible to change the qualifications for a particular position without notice being given to the House with regard to that, then of course the field for jobbery is somewhat enlarged.

I agree there ought to be flexibility.  I say you might have a proper scheme of qualifications laid down and it might be found to be unworkable or you might not get the proper people.  That ought to be brought to the notice of the House.  I have said already I would prefer to go back to the system before the 1941 Act and have the initiative in the matter taken by the Local Appointments Commissioners.

While I agree there ought to be some <Col N="126" /> degree of flexibility, I think it is absurd to have this swing over to the Minister instead of the Local Appointments Commissioners, who are being put in the position that they have only to be consulted and no notice is to be given so far as this House is concerned.

      <P>The word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; as a matter of qualification, is included in the 1941 Act.  It is a small matter.  I want to stress that it is important, now that the matter has been changed over to the Minister, that he should not be given power to change the conditions of appointment. He should not be allowed to say: &ldquo;That is all right for certain areas, but here is a different area and I want to change the qualifications.&rdquo;  I do not think that should be allowed.  If it is going to be allowed in the small matters we are talking of, let it be done with the consent of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Let the Minister settle the general conditions.  If he wants changes for particular posts, let him get the consent of the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>

      <P>It seems clear that if one inserts the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in paragraph (c), one is laying down conditions of residence as a qualification for candidates.  The whole question of a coroner being compelled to reside in his district is dealt with in Section 12. There is a straightforward mandatory provision that a coroner must have his ordinary residence in the coroner's district, subject to the Minister giving him permission to reside outside.  That is one aspect of the matter that is clear. Here, in paragraph (e) of subsection (3) of Section 8, we are dealing with the qualifications of people entitled to be considered for appointment as coroners.  Deputy McGilligan wants to insert the word &ldquo;residence&rdquo; in that regard.  If that means anything, to my mind it means that the conditions with regard to those eligible for appointment would include conditions as to where the candidates resided.  To my mind, that would be ridiculous. You are entitled to prescribe conditions and qualifications as to age, <Col N="129" /> health and character; but surely we would envisage a situation where a person could apply for a position as a coroner in any district, no matter where he resided?  It would be nonsensical to prescribe conditions of residence as a qualification for appointment.</P>

      <P>(5)  The Local Appointments Commissioners shall, before recommending a person for appointment to the office of coroner, satisfy themselves that the person possesses the requisite knowledge and ability for the proper discharge of the duties of that office.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make it clear that there will be no obligation on the Local Appointments Commissioners to recommend a candidate for a particular appointment as coroner if all the candidates fail to satisfy the Commissioners as to their standard of knowledge and ability for the appointment.  It might be argued, otherwise, that the Commissioners, having announced a vacancy and invited applicants, were bound to recommend a candidate notwithstanding that no candidate was found to be qualified by reference to the minimum standards deemed to be requisite.</P>
      <P>A similar provision to this is applied to local authority appointments generally by section 21 (10) of the Local Government Act, 1941.</P>

My suggestion is that the Minister should either amend that to a period of three months or in the next amendment take a discretion as to the extent of the period beyond the month.  If he wants to keep the period of a month in the section, I suggest he should add the words: &ldquo;or such longer period as the Minister may allow.&rdquo;  There should be some discretion.</P>

      <P>I use this amendment for the purpose of getting enlightenment on the position with regard to coroners in the future.  Section 11 looks at the future. It says:</P>
      <P>Every coroner appointed after the commencement of the Act shall, unless he sooner dies, resigns or is removed from office, hold office until he reaches the age of 70 years.</P>

    <P>Death will determine itself and so will resignation.  I see subsection (2) of the section says the section &ldquo;shall noe apply to a coroner after the commencement of the Act where the qualifications of his appointment were prescribed before such commencement.&rdquo; I take it the purpose of this is to see that existing coroners will remain in office without any age limit and I take it they will be kept on under the old conditions.  Are all coroners appointed subject to removal by somebody?  In the country you may have a coroner who has been appointed for many years and who is verging on the age of 70.  He is to go on.  Is he to be faced now with <Col N="134" /> Section 15 where the Minister may say he is of the opinion that the coroner cannot discharge his duties because of physical or mental infirmity?  If you are going to say to a present occupant of a post who was appointed before the age limit came in: &ldquo;Carry on till you die,&rdquo; I do not see why you should not also say: &ldquo;You were appointed without any possibility of being removed.&rdquo;</P>

The aim of subsection (2) is to ensure that this age limit of 70 years will not apply to an appointment made after the commencement of the Act, if the qualifications for appointment were prescribed before such commencement.  I think that is only fair.  The subsection is effective as it stands without the addition of the words proposed in Deputy McGilligan's amendment.  In any event, I do not think the words apply because a coroner does not have <Col N="135" /> conditions of appointment in the sense I think Deputy McGilligan means.  His conditions are statutory.

It is quite conceivable that the coroner would live a mile or two outside the city.

      <P Just="Center">SECTION 14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 19, 20 and 21 and substitute &ldquo;coroner unless he is a barrister, solicitor, or medical practitioner who has been actually and regularly practising as such in a five year period immediately preceding the date of appointment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I want to discuss amendments Nos. 14 and 15 together as they are really alternatives.  This is the old matter of a practising barrister of so many years standing.  If they are not practising they are not barristers, except by academic qualification and my first shot at this matter is to cut out the word &ldquo;practising&rdquo;.  That makes it quite clear that the qualifications for the course are to be a barrister of five years' standing or a solicitor of five years' standing.  That only means that when you go to look at their qualifications, you find out the year in which they were qualified and that makes them barristers of five years' standing. Putting in the word &ldquo;practising&rdquo; in that context means nothing.  What counts is the standing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person has not been in practice at all for the reason that he has not been participating actually in practice that does not matter.  This type of qualification is attached to the post of district justice and a young man was appointed some years ago to the office of district justice who had never done any practice.  He had filled up the intervening years from the time of his qualification by working on the staff <Col N="139" /> of a newspaper.  It is not easy to get a phrase to meet the situation but I have groped in certain other Acts and I have got a phrase which I have put down in my second amendment.  I assume it is acceptable that for the appointment of a coroner, you want people who not merely have textbook acquaintance with law or medicine but who know what practice is, who have been through the mill and have done a period of time either as a medical or legal practitioner.</P>
    <P>My second amendment means that no person shall be appointed a coroner, unless he has been a barrister, solicitor or medical practitioner who has been actually and regularly practising as such for a five year period prior to the date of appointment.  That means that a person will have to have been in practice.  You cannot say that a person must have been in practice for five years before the date of appointment because he might have been ill for four or five months of that period.  The phrase &ldquo;actually in practice&rdquo; is used in the Juries Act where certain people are exempted from jury service, one of the grounds being that they are barristers or solicitors actually practising as such. I think we ought to insist that people who are to be appointed as coroners are not merely people who pass their examinations but are people who have been in practice.  I have added the word &ldquo;regularly&rdquo; which is not in the Juries Act because such a person might have been ill during the period of practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Or he might have been on a month's holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>He is not merely to be a person who has taken out legal qualifications and gone on to some other occupation but he must have been in practice as an actual matter of practical business regularly for over five years.  The word &ldquo;practising&rdquo; means nothing because if a person is a barrister or a solicitor of five years' standing, it is the same as saying that he is a practising barrister or solicitor. I hold that these posts ought to be reserved for people who have been <Col N="140" /> active in the practice of these professions and the way to do that is to say that they have been actually and regularly practising.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tabled an amendment in which he envisages a person who has been registered under the Medical Practitioners Acts or who has been entitled to be registered for at least five years.  I do not understand why the phrase &ldquo;entitled to be registered&rdquo; should be put in here at all.  A man is entitled to be registered if he takes the qualifying examinations, but are we to appoint a person to be coroner here who has been qualified for five years and has not bothered to register in Ireland?  I do not think we should do that.  I do not think we should appoint people who have not practised here or who have practised only in England and have not bothered to pay their registration fees here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that it is desirable that in so far as possible the requirement which Section 14 lays down should be that the person to be appointed should be a doctor, barrister or solicitor of five years' standing, and in addition, that he should have five years' practice.  That is the general meaning of the phrase.  Deputies will recall that we had precisely the same discussion on the Courts Bills which went through the Dáil last year.  I am reluctant to change from this form of words which is in general use in this regard although I do admit it has the weakness to which Deputy McGilligan refers.  The problem is, of course, to find some other form of words which would achieve what we would all like to achieve but I do not think Deputy McGilligan succeeds in achieving what he wants to achieve by the form he sets out in amendment No.  14.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say this, however, to the House.  Section 14 here is only a stipulation as to who shall not be appointed.  We still have the situation that the qualifications will be prescribed and that the Local Appointments Commissioners will make a selection.  It is most unlikely, indeed it is hardly conceivable, that if you had the type of person Deputy <Col N="141" /> McGilligan is worried about, namely, a gentleman doctor who qualified but did not practise or who was only in practice for a week before the date of appointment, as against the experienced professional man with five or six years' actual practice, the Local Appointments Commissioners would appoint the type of person to whom Deputy McGilligan refers.  On the whole, therefore, I think it is better to adhere to the established form of words we have here, aware of its weakness but relying on the fact that the Local Appointments Commissioners will still have to make a selection, thus obviating the dangers Deputy McGilligan mentions.</P>
    <P>My reason for the amendment which I propose, that is, Amendment No. 16, and which involves the concept &ldquo;or who has been entitled to be so registered, for at least five years&rdquo; is to enable Irish doctors who are living and practising in England to apply for appointments as coroners here.  I think that is fair, desirable and reasonable.</P>

That cuts out a gentleman <Col N="147" /> who comes down to the Library on the odd occasion and who cannot be described as in regular practice.  As we have it, it is a sham.  A practising barrister of so many years' standing means nothing.  That was not decided in connection with the district justice appointment I speak of.  It was decided in connection with an old County Court appointment.  The point was that a certain person was not regularly in practice.  The ruling was that it meant a person qualified for the number of years, five years or ten years or whatever it may be.  They counted back to the date of his qualifications&mdash;ten years' standing&mdash;and that was all there was to it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 7, line 22, before &ldquo;is&rdquo; to insert the following: &ldquo;after due investigation and after affording a coroner or deputy coroner a reasonable opportunity of answering an allegation of misconduct, neglect of duty, unfitness for office or incapacity to discharge the duties of his office.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 15 deals with the removal of a coroner or a deputy coroner.  It provides:</P>
      <P>Whenever the Minister is satisfied that any coroner or deputy coroner has been guilty of misconduct or neglect of duty or is unfit for office or incapable of the due discharge of his duties by reason of physical or mental infirmity, the Minister may by order remove such coroner or deputy coroner from office.</P>
      <P>I am suggesting in amendment No. 18 that after the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; we should insert the words I have suggested so that subsection (1) would read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever the Minister is satisfied <Col N="150" /> after due investigation and after affording a coroner or deputy coroner a reasonable opportunity of answering an allegation of misconduct, neglect of duty, unfitness for office or incapacity to discharge the duties of his office that any coroner or deputy coroner has been guilty of misconduct...the Minister may remove him.</P>
    <P>The section, as it is drafted, does not provide that the coroner will be charged in any way with misconduct, neglect of duty or even that he will be told the reasons which unfit him for the office or make him incapable of the due discharge of his duties.  I think in this connection and in connection with the latter portion of subsection (1) referring to incapability of the discharge of his duties by reason of physical or mental infirmity, it is worth remembering that, even in the case of a person alleged to be of unsound mind and found to be of unsound mind and made a ward of court, the proceedings are served on that person and he is given an opportunity of objecting to them.  I think I am correct in saying that the section, as drafted by the Minister, is a rehash of the earlier provisions in the 1927 Act.  In fact, the coroner who is in the Minister's mind being accused of misconduct or of inability to discharge his duties will be given no opportunity whatever of making a case in answer to the case made against him.  In fact, the section, as it stands, does not impose any particular onus on the Minister to carry out an investigation.</P>
    <P>If someone tells the Minister that the coroner is unfit for his duties, the Minister need not satisfy himself further than satisfying himself that he believes his informant is reliable. There is no provision in the section for any investigation at all by the Minister.  There is no provision in the section that the coroner who is going to be dismissed will be given an opportunity, in advance of his dismissal, of knowing the grounds on which he is being dismissed.  There is provision in subsection (2) that, when the Minister makes his order removing <Col N="151" /> the coroner, the order will specify the reason for the removal.  That is <i>post factum</i>.  When the Minister has come to his decision and made his order he then notifies the coroner by virtue of the order of what is alleged against him whether it be a question of unfitness by reason of misconduct, neglect of duty or physical or mental infirmity.  That does not seem to me to be right.</P>
    <P>It is no defence of this section for the Minister to say that this is simply a re-enactment of previous legislation on the subject.  I think, as I suggested in my amendment, that there should be an onus on the Minister to carry out an investigation and to give the coroner, who is in jeopardy of being dismissed, an opportunity of answering the charges against him.  I also suggest&mdash;and I will consider it between this and Report Stage for the purpose of an amendment&mdash;that, in addition to that, the coroner should have some opportunity of appealing against an order made by the Minister or, if the coroner has not an opportunity of appealing against it, it seems to me that there should be some machinery in the Bill, whether by way of investigation or by resolution of the Dáil, to remedy a situation which could give rise to a serious injustice.</P>
    <P>In saying that, I am not for a moment making an allegation against the present Minister or anyone who may succeed him in his office.  I assume that the Minister acts in a <i>bona fide</i> manner under the law as it will be enacted by us.  It could be that the Minister will make a mistake.  If the section is allowed to stand as it is at the moment, the Minister may on insufficient material and on insufficient grounds feel satisfied that he is justified in making an order removing the coroner.  It may be that there will be other elements of which the Minister is not aware and which the coroner has no opportunity of presenting and which are not presented to the Minister. There is no machinery in the section for remedying any injustice that may be done in that way.</P>
    <P>I would urge very strongly on the Minister that he should accept this <Col N="152" /> amendment.  If he feels he can meet me in some way by an alteration of the phrasing or something else, I am quite happy to leave it to the Minister and the Parliamentary draftsman to work it out.  The amendment I am suggesting would contain what I believe are the essential safeguards for any person put in jeopardy as a coroner would be under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, in principle, in sympathy with the case made by Deputy O'Higgins.  In that regard I am not being unmindful of the fact that in the Local Government Act, 1941, to which we have already referred there is a provision of the sort suggested by the Deputy.  Subsection (3) of Section 25 of that Act enables the Minister for Local Government in that case to send by post to the holder of the office at the principal office of the authority by which he is employed a notice in writing stating that in his opinion any of the statutory grounds for removal from office exists as regards him and further provides that if the Minister after seven days from the sending of the notice and after consideration of the representations (if any) made to him by the person in question, remains of the said opinion he may by order remove him from office.</P>
      <P>Deputies will realise that a provision along the lines suggested by the Deputy is, in fact, in the Local Government Act of 1941.  It is also true that in the original Section 16 of the 1927 Act, the forerunner of the present Section 15, there is no such provision as that to which the Deputy refers but I think I would be prepared to accept the suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy withdraws his amendment, I shall go into the matter with the Parliamentary Draftsman to see whether something along the lines of the 1941 Act could be inserted here. I am sure that would meet the Deputy's point.  I would not be at all happy about the wording of the amendment as put down but I feel we should probably be able to get something into the section between now and the Report Stage which would meet the Deputy's point.  Even though it was not in the 1927 Act, I still think that <Col N="153" /> it would be in accordance with modern thinking in these matters that the coroner should be given, as Deputy O'Higgins suggested, an opportunity at least of answering the allegations made against him.  I am quite happy to give an undertaking to endeavour to make some such provision.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 7, line 22, to delete &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I indicated on the Second Stage that I should be moving an amendment of this kind.  The proposal is to delete the words &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; and insert instead &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.  The present law, which is contained in subsection (2) of Section 16 of the 1927 Act uses the phrase that the Minister for Justice may &ldquo;if he thinks fit&rdquo; in relation to removal on ground of misconduct. To keep in line with that conception, I propose to make a change from &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; to &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider this.  There is some measure of protection afforded by retaining the expression &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; because at least it means that a Minister for Justice who is going to discharge his duties conscientiously will have to satisfy himself in some way as to the allegations whereas if the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; is to be replaced by &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; it seems to me to weaken the obligation of the Minister in this matter.  All he need do if the phrase is &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; is simply have a stray thought about it and decide: &ldquo;That is my opinion anyhow and I need not defend it because no one can question what my opinion is.&rdquo;  In the other case, at least if he is challenged, he has to show he is satisfied and presumably give his reasons.  This cropped up earlier in a different way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister <Col N="154" /> mentioned the question of the use of the phrase &ldquo;is of opinion.&rdquo;  We know it did crop up in connection with the Road Traffic Act in the last Dáil but the reasoning there was somewhat different.  My recollection is that the reason why the Road Traffic Act was changed in a number of places was that there were different sections which went something like this: &ldquo;If the garda finds or is satisfied...&rdquo;  In all of these cases the Minister in charge of the Bill had that changed to &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo; and the reason given, to the best of my recollection, was that it had been suggested that if a garda had to &ldquo;find&rdquo; something he was exercising a judicial function and therefore there was danger that it might be repugnant to the Constitution and the safer wording was &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.  I do not think that reasoning applies to this case and I should prefer the Minister's original phrasing of that part of the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>My main idea is to make this thing workable and a number of Deputies will be aware of the difficulties in which the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; could involve a Minister.  I think we would be quite safe in using &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.  If I do bring in the suggested amendment which I have undertaken to consider favourably the situation would come about in which, if the Minister decided that a coroner should be removed from office, he would notify the coroner of that opinion and would be bound to receive from the coroner whatever representations he might like to make, to give weight to them and then form an opinion.  I think we might leave the discussion there until we come to the Report Stage and when we see in what way I have been able to meet Deputy O'Higgins on the other point we could discuss it together with this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we pass from this I want to give a warning. The Minister is in a very distinct <Col N="155" /> dilemma.  The phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; has already received judicial interpretation in the Offences Against the State Act.  The late Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy held in respect of that Act that the internment part of it was illegal because it was there phrased &ldquo;where the Minister is satisfied...&rdquo;  Then it went on that somebody ought be put into internment and in a lengthy judgment in a famous case the late Judge said that the use of the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; imported, first of all, that the Minister had to act judiciously&mdash; that was one thing&mdash;but that he also had to act judicially.  There is a big difference.  &ldquo;Judiciously&rdquo; only meant that he had to get certain statements of the case and so on but &ldquo;judicially&rdquo; is the word used where a certain person does something affecting the rights or liabilities of other people.</P>
      <P>This is certainly going to affect certain rights that coroners will have on their appointment.  If the Minister keeps the phrase &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; he faces a difficulty.  Although the case I have mentioned was subsequently overruled by an amending Act, at the same time the points in the decision are still there and in my submission have not been answered at all.  To keep &ldquo;is satisfied&rdquo; does import a certain determination to look at evidence and come to a conclusion.  If that conclusion affects the liberty of any person, it might be found to be a judicial proceeding.  The Minister is not a judge.  He has not judicial status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an article in the Constitution which permits 13 people who are not judges limited powers and functions of a judicial type.  That also has been interpreted in the courts in regard to the Solicitors Act where people were struck off the roll.  The machinery that operated and had to be geared to strike a person off the Roll as a professional solicitor was a very important type of machinery.  What I might call a penal committee was presided over by the Chief Justice, but notwithstanding that, the Supreme Court held that the Solicitors Act was unconstitutional in so far as it allowed a body of people not judges to interfere. The point on which the decision <Col N="156" /> turned was whether the functions were such that a person's life, liberty, livelihood or reputation was affected. Clearly, some will be affected in this. The Minister may feel that he can get out of that dilemma and remove himself a little from the judicial area by the use of the phrase &ldquo;is of opinion&rdquo;.  The Minister should watch his step and take advice on this matter. The courts may say this is a very slack way of dealing with these things. It is a very casual serious interference with the livelihood of a man appointed and in receipt of a salary.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is considering the point put to him by Deputy O'Higgins, I wish he would consider the whole matter of whether this is an encroachment on the judicial office.  He may make me the easy answer: &ldquo;We can do this with regard to a judge.&rdquo;  Judges may be removed on the grounds of misbehaviour or incapacity by a vote of the two Houses, because the Constitution says so and gives that power to the two Houses of the Oireachtas which is not given with regard to anything else.  Removing a solicitor from acting in a professional capacity is much less serious than removing a judge; yet in that limited area of work the courts decided that the Solicitors Act was unconstitutional.  It seems to me that this could fall easily under the same ruling.  It gives the Minister certain limited powers and functions of a judicial nature, and he is not a judge.  He might take some advice on the ruling on the Solicitors Act the standard of which was the effect on a person's life, liberty, livelihood or reputation. I think that if the Minister does not accept Deputy O'Higgins's phrase or bring in something else, he leaves himself very vulnerable to that decision.  If the matters involved in Deputy O'Higgins's amendment are not attended to, the whole thing will be grossly contrary to natural justice, which is of course protected constitutionally.</P>
    <P>I want to go on to a couple of points on the section.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>Every order removing a coroner or deputy coroner from office shall specify the reason for the removal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> I want to add &ldquo;and shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo; I also want to add that no order should come into operation until it has been approved by the House.  Whether we go on to the second amendment or not, surely it is right that when the coroner has been appointed, after a whole set of qualifications have been laid down, and the Minister for Justice decides to remove him from office because of certain conditions, the House should be informed of it and publicity should be given to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister might reply that when a person is going to be removed, if he realises that he has become physically incapable or that he has been guilty of misconduct, he may not want that revealed, and he can resign and so avoid it.  In an interruption, the Minister said that the reason for the removal will have to be specified in the order.  That would be taken in the context of Deputy O'Higgins' amendment suggesting that certain things ought to be a matter of knowledge. I do not know whether the Minister contemplates that the order of removal would specify the detailed reason for the removal.  That has not been the interpretation.</P>
    <P>So far in this Parliament, we have been very lucky: on one occasion only was a resolution tabled to remove a judge from office and that was withdrawn. The judge retired before it appeared on the Order Paper.  He retired before the matter was discussed.  It was merely stated then that the reason was incapacity, or physical infirmity, I think, was involved. If the Minister feels that he will set out a whole list of the facts that came before him which he investigated and considered, and on which he ruled after consideration that the person should be removed, he will find that he is giving a very wide interpretation to a phrase which merely means that the removal is for misconduct, neglect of duty or physical infirmity.</P>
    <P>The coroners are being put into an exalted position by this legislation.  I think it is rather ludicrous that they are being put into that position.  We are giving them a sort of quasi-judicial <Col N="158" /> position.  They are appointed for a term of years and they are retained in office until they are removed or die or resign.  The two latter will determine themselves.  Otherwise, it is a judicial status.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy McGilligan is to some extent hoist with his own petard.  I have not at any stage argued or indicated that coroners are judicial, semi-judicial or quasi-judicial in any way.  Indeed, the whole tenor and trend of the Bill before us is the opposite.  There was a time when the office of coroner was, if not judicial, certainly quasi-judicial, but now when this Bill becomes law, the coroner will, in effect, be nothing more or less than an employee of the local authority.  Admittedly, he is an important employee and an employee with very important public duties, but to all intents and purposes, he will be appointed by the local authority in the same way as any other local authority employee.  He will have roughly the same terms and conditions and it is I who want to make his removal from office comparable with the procedure which would be appropriate to any other local government employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan, on the other hand, comes along and accuses me of building up this office and says it is ludicrous to say it is a quasi-judicial office but he is the person who wants, by virtue of this amendment, to stipulate that these orders shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as if we were removing a judge from office.  He is being completely inconsistent there.  I think my approach to the matter is consistent.  I am treating the coroners throughout the Bill as responsible and important officers of the local authorities and I hope that when we come to recast Section 15, we shall be able to satisfy Deputy O'Higgins at least that the conditions under which they can be removed from office will be fair and <Col N="160" /> just.  Certainly I do not want to create an elaborate procedure which would be appropriate only to persons holding judicial office.</P>

      <P>Upwards, yes, and I am suggesting that it seems that for this relatively simple task of informing the coroner, it is somewhat ridiculous that the duty should be imposed on a superintendent or a person in the Garda Síochána holding higher rank.  Later in the various other sections of this Bill, there are considerably more important duties delegated to inspectors who are not officers within the meaning of the section. I suggest that for the sake of uniformity, if nothing else, the Minister should say &ldquo;a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector&rdquo;.  In other words an inspector should be capable of discharging the duty of informing the coroner and he should not have, first of all, to tell the superintendent who would go along and inform the coroner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the phraseology came into subsection (3) in the first instance because normally in this type of thing the obligation is placed on an officer of the Garda Síochána and of course the inspector, the sergeant, and so on, are not officers of the force.  They are, if you like, non-commissioned officers.  A superintendent is the lowest rank of officer in the Garda Síochána.  I would not be particularly opposed to Deputy O'Higgins's amendment, but there is the consideration which will arise when we come to amendment No. 26 which I shall be proposing later.  Amendment No. 26 will, if you like, to some extent make the obligation placed in subsection (4) a little easier to discharge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Therefore, to be consistent, there will be a tie-up between subsection (3) and subsection (5).  It will be an officer, namely, a superintendent or higher, rank in both cases. For that reason, I would prefer to leave subsection (3) as it is, although if it were not for the fact that I will be putting in this new subsection (5) I would not argue very much against Deputy O'Higgins's proposal.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider this?  I do not ask him to do it now but, between now and Report Stage, assuming his amendment for the new subsection (5) goes through, would he consider amending that further?  Later on in the Bill, if you look at Section 20, it says &ldquo;A Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector.&rdquo;  If you look at Section 25, where there is an important function in connection with the adjournment of inquests, there again it is a Garda Síochaná not below the rank of Superintendent.  If you look at Section 33, you will see the same phrase.  It seems to me that while you are giving in the Bill definite and important functions which can be discharged by inspectors&mdash;as, for example, dealing with the request for an adjournment, which could be a matter of serious decision&mdash;for the relatively simple task of informing the coroner of a death, it seems strange that it should be essential under the Bill that that task should be performed by a Superintendent.</P>

      <P>In subsection (4), page 8, line 32, after &ldquo;believe&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;from facts and circumstances known to him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Subsection 4 imposes the obligation of reporting the facts and circumstances relating to the death on a whole variety of people: medical practitioners, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker and every occupier of a house or mobile dwelling and every person in charge of any institution or premises, in which the deceased person was residing, who has reason to believe that the deceased person died, either directly or indirectly, under certain circumstances. It says at the end that that person must notify the coroner in whose district the body of the deceased person is lying of the facts and circumstances relating to the death. The new amendment says that the obligation can be discharged, if that person notifies an officer of the Garda Síochána of the facts and circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man can notify only what he knows.  I simply want to say: &ldquo;if he has reason to believe from the facts and circumstances known to him.&rdquo; That is the effect of the amendment.  I do not think it could be interpreted as anything else.  The facts and circumstances a man may get to know afterwards may add to his first impression, but he is bound to notify if he gets certain information, if he has reason to believe that the deceased person died, either directly or indirectly, as a result of violence or misadventure or by unfair means, or as a result of negligence or misconduct or malpractice on the part of others, or from any cause other than natural illness or disease&mdash;then we have the disputed part&mdash;for which he had been seen and <Col N="165" /> treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before his death, or in such circumstances as may require investigation.</P>
    <P>Does that person on whom that obligation has been put have any protection? One knows the way rumours get around about a death in a remote part of the country.  Supposing somebody steps into the Civic Guard office and says: &ldquo;I believe that person died under very peculiar circumstances&rdquo; and there is an investigation and the circumstances are inquired into, the name of the informer may be given.

    <P>I should like to discuss amendment No. 25 also, Sir.  That would delete all words from &ldquo;for which&rdquo; in line 36 down to and including &ldquo;death&rdquo; in line 38.  The way it runs at the moment is: if I know that a person has died from any cause other than natural illness and disease, for which the dead person had been seen and treated by a registered medical practitioner within one month before his death, I must notify the coroner.  Supposing I know a person is dying.  As far as my information goes, that person has died from natural causes.  But suppose I know that that person has not been seen by a medical practitioner within a month of his death, I must report the death.  It is made an offence not to report it.  Surely that is unnecessary? The matter is sufficiently guarded, I suggest, by saying: if I know a person died from all unnatural causes or from any cause other than illness or disease.  Why should there <Col N="166" /> be this limitation?  I think it is entirely unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support Deputy McGilligan's amendment in general in relation to subsection (4).  It seems to me if the words which Deputy McGilligan wants to have taken out under amendment 25 were to be left in, it would put people positively on inquiry.  They will have to make inquiry as to whether or not the person was seen by a registered medical practitioner within a month of his death.  You have odd situations created where people just do not know. They know a person has been ill, for example, and they understand he has been going to a doctor, but they do not know.  Have they got to check around until they find the doctor and get confirmation that he has been seen by the doctor within this period of a month of his death?</P>
      <P>There is another point not dealt with by way of amendment at the moment.  I should like to ask the Minister to look at it.  It is that the provision regarding where a person was residing should refer specifically to where he was residing at the time of his death; in other words, it should be made clear that it is residence at the time of death.  That is the particular of importance in relation to this function. The section reads:</P>
      <P>Every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker and every occupier of a house or mobile dwelling, and every person in charge of any institution or premises, in which a deceased person was residing ....</P>
      <P>He may have been residing in a number of different places within a year or possibly two years.  I think we should limit it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  First of all, I agree that what we want to get at in subsection (4) is the house or institution in which the deceased person was residing at the time of death.  If that is not exactly what the subsection says at the moment, we will see if we can change it to make it read more precisely.  I smiled when Deputy McGilligan proposed Amendment No. 24 because I am quite certain this is a situation in which, if I had put in the Bill the words &ldquo;from facts and circumstances known to him&rdquo;, Deputy McGilligan would have an amendment to delete them on the grounds that they added nothing to the sense of the section. That is, in fact, the position.  I do not think they add anything to the sense of the subsection at all; in fact, the subsection achieves exactly what we want from it.</P>
      <P>I do, however, feel more strongly about Amendment No. 25 and I would not like to see the deletion Deputy McGilligan proposes because the subsection is framed as it is for two reasons which I indicated on the Second Stage.  The first is that we want to ensure that all questionable deaths of any sort are notified to the coroner&mdash;from the point of view of the coroner's duty to hold inquests.  There is no doubt that we want here to step up the number of deaths notified, particularly in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is eminently desirable that we have a higher number of deaths notified than we have at the moment.  We have a very high proportion of uncertified deaths.  If the subsection achieves that, it is a considerable advantage.  It is also important from the point of view that it will tend over the years to have doctors called in more regularly and more often in cases of persons who are in danger of death.  I think that socially that is also desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, generally speaking, I think the objectives which subsection (4) attempts to achieve are very desirable and that, if at all possible, we should do what we can to achieve them.  The only objection there might be is that we are placing an onerous responsibility on the people concerned. I do not think we are.  I do not think anybody could object seriously to this <Col N="168" /> obligation we are putting on such people as medical practitioners, occupiers of houses or persons in charge of institutions where people die.  They are a limited class of people and I think it is no more than their social duty to do what subsection (4) proposes to make them do.</P>
    <P>I feel on very safe ground in asking Deputy McGilligan not to press the amendment because I think a great deal of good will come from leaving these words in the subsection and thereby achieving this greater degree of notification of deaths and achieving a position where doctors will be called in more often in these cases.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (5), to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The obligation imposed on a person by subsection (4) of this section shall be deemed to be discharged if he immediately notifies an officer of the Garda Síochána of the facts and circumstances required to be notified under that subsection.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, this amendment is designed to facilitate persons on whom an obligation of notifying the coroner is being imposed in discharging that obligation.  As was mentioned by, I think, Deputy Tully on the Second Stage, it might be difficult for a person to seek out the coroner where it would be more convenient for them to communicate the particular notification to the police.  The new subsection (5) which Amendment No. 26 proposes to insert will bring about the situation whereby the obligation which subsection (4) places on this category of persons can be discharged by notification to a superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  By virtue of subsection (3) of Section 18, there is <Col N="169" /> an obligation on the superintendent to notify the coroner.</P>

I feel sure the Minister can think as I can of a number of areas where it means a very considerable trek for a person to find the superintendent or coroner or, in some cases, even an inspector.</P>

      <P>In relation to dead bodies, I should point out that in this amendment we are dealing with the Garda Síochána who were set up by the State here to carry out this kind of function and I think that if a person finds a dead body or if someone dies in his house, the normal reaction would be to telephone the local Garda station and mention to the station sergeant that somebody has died and then to give the full information.  I think that should be regarded as discharging the function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to suggest, too, that the Minister might consider incorporating this new subsection in subsection (4). It is a simple question of drafting.  I think it would be preferable to say: &ldquo;Every person shall immediately notify the coroner or an official of the Garda Síochána,&rdquo; rather than that you should say: &ldquo;He shall notify the coroner and even though he does not, he is taken as notifying the coroner if he notifies someone else.&rdquo;  Why not simply put in the words &ldquo;notify the coroner or an office, of the Garda <Col N="170" /> Síochána&rdquo; into subsection (4)?  Again, what is the purpose of specifically including the words in brackets in subsection (4) &ldquo;including death as the result of the administration of an anaesthetic?&rdquo;  Is there any particular reason for calling special attention to that?  Whether it is or is not included, it is one of the matters about which, I assume, information would be given.</P>

      <P>I agree with the contention put forward by Deputy O'Higgins that it should be sufficient to notify any member of the Garda Síochána, irrespective of rank.  I cannot see any difficulty on the part of the Minister's Department in making it obligatory on any member of the Garda Síochána, so notified, to make a report either to the coroner or to the superintendent.  One can visualise the difficulties that confront relatives if a man dies suddenly in an isolated area. According to the Minister, the obligation will be on them to get in touch with either the coroner or the superintendent.  I think it should meet the obligation if they were to ask a neighbour to ring the local Garda station and make a report to whatever officer is available there.  There is nothing to preclude the Minister making a regulation stipulating that it is the duty of that station to report the matter either to the coroner or the superintendent.  Would that not be a simple way of getting over the difficulty?</P>

      <P>Consider the position of a husband and wife residing in an isolated area.  The wife dies suddenly.  Is it the Minister's contention <Col N="172" /> that the husband should take no steps to summon the priest or the doctor but should, rather, try to meet the superintendent or the coroner? Surely he would be within his rights in asking a neighbour&mdash;neighbours are helpful in times of emergency&mdash;to notify the Garda Síochána.  That should be sufficient.  We have too many of these &ldquo;ifs&rdquo; and &ldquo;ands&rdquo; and &ldquo;buts&rdquo; in legislation.  We have too many impositions on people.  What the Minister seeks to do is to make the position more difficult still for those confronted with sudden death in the family.  I cannot see any reason for making a report other than to any member of the Garda Síochána in the local station.</P>

I think it should be called the &ldquo;Extra Remuneration for Doctors and Lawyers Bill.&rdquo;  That would be a much better name for it. I come from an area where most people are older than I am, and I am not young.  If the policy pursued in this country over the past 40 years continues, in a very short time, these people will be much older still.  There are many people who are chronic invalids. They have not seen a doctor for years.  There is no point in calling the doctor because even the most modern drugs will be ineffective.</P>

According to this Bill, if these people die, the coroner or the superintendent will have to be notified. The cause of death will be perfectly obvious&mdash;senile decay.  Indeed, senile decay will be the main cause of death in most parts of this country in a very short time because there are scarcely any young people left.  It is futile to insist that people living in isolated areas in the west should get a doctor to sit by the bedside of some aged man or woman in order to certify the cause of death.</P>

It is no use trying to ram it down our necks that he will.  A doctor wants to make money like everyone else.  Coroners and lawyers will make a fortune if this Bill goes through.  It is no use trying to hoodwink us about that.  If this measure went to the people it would be turned down straightaway.  The Opposition is not very strong.

      <P>In subsection (2), it is stated that nothing in the section shall authorise a coroner to dispense with holding an inquest in relation to a death if he is of opinion that the death may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner.  In effect, that subsection is taken from Section 17 but there is one important phrase omitted.  The phrase, &ldquo;or suddenly and from unknown causes&rdquo; has been dropped.  I understand that there is a close relationship between Sections 17 and 19, but Section 19, subsection (2), does not contain the reference to sudden death that is contained in Section 17.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to explain this section because I do not understand the purpose of it.  The section provides that</P>
      <P>(1)  Where the Attorney General has reason to believe that a person has died in circumstances which in his opinion make the holding of an inquest advisable he may direct any coroner (whether or not he is a coroner who would ordinarily hold the inquest) to hold an inquest in relation to the death ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can appreciate that circumstances may arise by reason of urgency, shortage of time or something else in which it would be desirable that the <Col N="179" /> Attorney General would not necessarily be pinned to having an inquest held by the coroner who ordinarily should hold it.  However, that is a far cry from giving the Attorney General discretion to pick and choose any coroner he likes throughout the State in any of these circumstances to which Section 24 applies.  The Minister will probably say to me that normally the Attorney General will request the coroner who ordinarily would be responsible for the particular inquest to hold it and that that is the practice which it is intended to follow.  I should like some explanation as to why the Minister for Justice himself is not given this extraordinary discretion which the Attorney General is being given.  Why should the Attorney General be allowed to nominate any coroner he likes?</P>

      <P>In connection with subsection (2) (a), is there any way in which the Minister can be sure that the power given to the jury would be brought to their attention. I think there should be some provision written into the Act which would oblige the coroner to make jurors aware of the fact that if a majority of them, by a requisition in writing, call on him to do this, he will have to comply with it.  The power is given there but normally jurors at an inquest are not going to be aware of the contents of the Coroners Act.  It is nearly certain that unless they are told of this power by the coroner, they will be quite unaware of it.  It would not be going too far to impose some obligation on the coroner so to inform the jurors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 42, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and accordingly&rdquo; to the end of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to have this section in a simple form in regard to the question of civil or criminal liability being investigated at an inquest.  The principle of the <Col N="181" /> section is all right and the House generally accepted that on the Second Reading.  However, I have to take this section and read it with the next one, Section 31 which says:</P>
    <P>(1) Neither the verdict nor any rider to the verdict at an inquest shall contain a censure or exoneration of any person.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that Section 30 in the abbreviated form I propose is all that is required.</P>
    <P>I think it is wrong to go on to say that every inquest shall be confined to ascertaining the identity of the person in relation to whose death the inquest is being held and how, when, and where the death occurred.  Take a case as an example.  A person is found dead with a revolver beside him and wounds in his head and such marks on the revolver and marks on the part of the body where the bullets entered to indicate that the wounds were self-inflicted. Surely the coroner's jury ought to be able to say he died from wounds self-inflicted?</P>
    <P>Take another case where, say, there are people who are part of the armed forces of the State.  In certain conditions, they are ordered by a superior officer to fire and kill somebody.  The ordinary verdict that would be looked for there would be &ldquo;shot by a member of the Defence Forces in the execution of his duty&rdquo;.  If the limitation is that the only things to be determined are who is dead and how, when and where the death occurred, the &ldquo;how&rdquo; there would be &ldquo;gunshot wounds&rdquo; or &ldquo;revolver shots in the head&rdquo;.  If it is a clear case of a person having taken his own life, why should the jury not be entitled to say that?  Under Section 31, that might be regarded as a censure of a person but I do not think it could be a censure of a person who has killed himself.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the object of this clause is to prevent a coroner's jury from intermeddling with what will be dealt with afterwards either by the civil or criminal courts.  I think that can be achieved if you say that a question of civil or criminal liability shall not be considered.  What the <Col N="182" /> coroner's jury says is not evidence at other proceedings.  What may be made evidence in other proceedings is if witnesses come before another court and make depositions or statements. Such depositions or statements may be evidence but the findings of a coroner's jury are completely irrelevant in civil or criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the clear case of a suicide, a person who has shot himself and everything is there to prove it, I think a coroner should be entitled to say he died of gunshot wounds self-inflicted. A tragic case which occurred recently comes to my mind.  It involved a man in a shooting accident with a friend. He had a gun, obviously with a defective trigger, in the back of the car and, on getting out of the car, it discharged and he got the contents somewhere about his chest and was killed. Surely a coroner's jury might easily find that as a verdict?  To allow the coroner's jury to say how death occurred would meet these two examples.  I suggest we should not limit them merely to saying who the dead person in and how, when and where the death occurred.</P>
    <P>I have set out only two or three circumstances.  I do not see why a coroner's jury, which is composed of sensible men, should not say &ldquo;self-inflicted&rdquo; or &ldquo;accidentally discharged&rdquo;. To say &ldquo;gun accidentally discharged&rdquo; might be regarded as exoneration.  The friend was with him and it went off.  There was no suspicion of foul play.  It seems to me that the coroner's jury ought to be able to clear up the matter.  That is why I say a question of civil or criminal liability would not be considered.</P>

      <P>Despite Deputy McGilligan's arguments, I still think it is desirable to retain these words. Unlike the 1927 Act, this Bill does not give us any power to prescribe by regulation the procedure to be followed at inquests.  It is necessary to go further than merely stating that questions of civil or criminal liability <Col N="183" /> shall not be considered and to take the positive step of telling the coroner's court exactly what it shall determine.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan went into some details.  I am not sure that a lot of what he had to say would not be covered by the &ldquo;how, when and where the death occurred.&rdquo;  Surely, though, the question of suicide would involve some element of criminal liability? Suicide in itself is a crime.  Therefore, it would be covered by the reference to criminal liability.</P>
      <P>I also think that a number of examples given by Deputy McGilligan and the verdicts which he propounded would bring him in conflict with the principles set out in subsection (1) of Section 31 which states that there should not be any element of censure or exoneration in the verdict.  It is obvious that we must give a positive indication to the coroner and the jury as to what exactly the findings should cover.</P>

      <P>What the Minister is providing in the Bill, whether it be in Section 33 or in Section 52, is that a doctor who attended a person within a month of death shall not carry out a post mortem examination.  There is something to be said from the point of view that a superficial examination&mdash;that is, where the special examination which the Minister may require is not being carried out&mdash;should be made by a doctor who is conversant with the medical history and the facts of the case.  It may be of considerable assistance to the coroner to have such a doctor to carry out an examination of that type. The Minister seems to be precluding that under the subsection which he now seeks to translate from Section 33 to Section 52.  I suggest he might consider that point of view and also that he might consider providing in the case of examination by way of autopsy or dissection, that such examination should be carried out by an experienced pathologist.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann is of the opinion that, as a practical step to stimulate increased production through the improvement of the fertility of our land by badly needed drainage schemes and at the same time to help to relieve unemployment in rural areas, the necessary moneys to put the Local Authorities (Works) Act into operation should <Col N="185" /> be provided immediately.&rdquo;  (Deputies Browne and McQuillan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned the discussion on this motion on 29th November last, I had dealt with the reasons why, in my opinion, it would be well if the Government decided to resume the allocation of moneys for expenditure under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  This motion does not require the introduction of fresh legislation.  The legislation is there. All that would be necessary would be a Ministerial Order making available to the local authorities throughout the country the moneys necessary to resume operations under that scheme.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of repeating the arguments I advanced on the last occasion.  I had almost exhausted them when the House rose.  I wish to emphasise for the last time the need there is in the rural parts of the country for operations such as were carried out when the scheme was formerly in operation.  Today there is a need to give employment to the men who were at one time employed on such schemes and to the men who have been displaced on road work, not alone for the purpose of giving them employment but for the purpose of providing work of a character which would relieve flooding on much productive land which at the moment is incapable of being used to its maximum capacity because of the dangers attendant upon periodic flooding. Public roadways are also affected in very many instances because of flooding.</P>
      <P>It is not only the non-availability of funds that is involved in this but the legal powers enshrined in the Local Authorities (Works) Act to permit of work of such a character to be undertaken. On the last occasion I cited instances where individuals and local authorities were desirous of carrying out such works but could not go in upon the land because they had not the right to enter property.  If the Local Authorities (Works) Act were in operation that difficulty would not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even since the House rose a particular instance has come to my attention <Col N="186" /> of a village in West Cork which has been seriously affected by flooding on the upper reaches of the River Lee. The local authority and various committees looked into this question and found they had no rights to go into this case of flooding which seriously affected not only lands but the houses in the village itself.  Bridges and a roadway were also affected by the flooding.  In fact, it went so far that members of the Minister's own Party on the council enquired whether, if the council itself advanced the money, the provisions of the Local Authorities (Works) Act would permit them to go in to do this work.  They were informed by the Manager that they could not as the money had not been voted by the local authority under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Consequently, it could not be done.  I merely cite that as just another instance of very many we can bring to mind where work is waiting to be done and cannot be done because the authority is not there to embark upon it.</P>
    <P>There is also the financial obligation. Every member of this House who is a member of a local authority knows very well, particularly in these weeks, how important local expenditure is becoming in the eyes of the people and how difficult it is becoming for the ratepayers to meet the charges levied upon them.  We know how much work is awaiting any expenditure which can be embarked upon by local authorities, such as drainage, sanitary services, the provision of water supplies and so on.</P>
    <P>Here was a scheme in which there was no charge on local rates and in which the very minimum of supervisory staff was necessary to carry out the scheme and in which the very maximum was spent in direct payment to the men engaged in doing the work. That was one of the most attractive features of the work done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <P>There are many men today who, unfortunately, have had to have recourse to labour exchanges because they were of an age at which they could not emigrate.  They had lost <Col N="187" /> employment on the roads.  They could be employed on schemes such as this. Some Deputies support the Government in an effort to bolster up whatever case the Government may have in their obstinacy in refusing to implement this scheme, in complete opposition to the expressions voiced at the Ard-Fheis and in complete contradiction of the views expressed by their own members on local authorities. They continue, despite the frequent appeals to resume this scheme, to be almost adamant in their decision.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that reason will prevail and that they will decide to resume these operations.  Deputies who have tried to make a case in support of the Government in their attitude up to now have said that some money was not properly spent; there was not a proper return for the money involved.  If that is the argument used, there is not a single measure ever introduced in this House by any Government where that argument could not be raised.  There is not an Act in operation in the State today which should not be repealed if that argument holds good for all.  In the expenditure of moneys some cases are more isolated than others.  If there were instances in which money was not properly spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act they were extremely few.  Not alone did that Act bring employment to the rural parts and increased production and employment in rural areas but it also relieved the charges on the local authorities by preserving local authority property from the ravages of flooding.</P>
    <P>I earnestly appeal to the Minister and the Government to accept this motion and re-allocate the moneys in the coming financial year.  They should bear in mind the measure of support that exists both in the House and in every local authority throughout the country for the Minister to resume the Local Authorities (Works) Act that was so effective in the past.  I am confident that if they do that they will find no better outlet for the expenditure of the relatively little amount of money which would give employment to so many and effect such good not alone in relation to the people directly <Col N="188" /> involved but in regard to the communities in the areas served by schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act&mdash;schemes which would have to wait for many a long year if they were to be done under the arterial drainage scheme or any other existing scheme.</P>
    <P>It is for those reasons that we in the Fine Gael Party feel it would be an excellent thing if these works were reopened and if the moneys were reallocated. We have the staffs ready in the county council offices.  There would be complete co-operation on the part of the members of local authorities, no matter what Party they belong to, in order to ensure that whatever money is allocated for the works would be properly spent.  The works that would be selected in co-operation with the local engineering staff would be such that the Government would be satisfied that the moneys spent would bring to local authorities and the country at large increased production and employment and help considerably the people who at the moment face great obstacles in trying to work small farms and road-side holdings.  For this reason, we whole-heartedly support the motion.</P>

      <P>We found that there was an Arterial Drainage Act passed that was never put into operation, because many people were being driven from the land by flooding.  We found there was no employment in the rural areas.  We had the Land Reclamation Act introduced about that time by the first inter-Party Minister for Agriculture and, in many cases, the work of land reclamation could not proceed because the outfall drains were choked.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act was introduced and put into effect and tremendously good work was done under it for the two years it existed.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil came into power in 1951 and did not cut out the Act completely.  They went half way.  For the three years they were in office until 1954, they reduced by half each year the amount of money that we had been spending on it.  We came back in 1954 and put the Act into full operation again until 1957.  When Fianna Fáil got an overall majority in 1957&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil found they had an overall majority, they took courage and killed the Local Authorities Act, apparently for no other reason than that it was introduced by the inter-Party Government. One reason since given for killing it then is that there was no maintenance work done under it.  Every speaker on the Government side who wants to justify that killing says there was no maintenance and therefore it was a bad Act.  Let us examine that as that is the only reason I have heard put <Col N="190" /> forward at any time.  It is a very poor reason and if it be the reason for discontinuing the Local Authorities Act, then minor employment scheme and rural improvement scheme drainage should never have been done because there is no provision for maintenance, even where the Special Employment Schemes Office carries out a minor employment scheme or rural improvement scheme.</P>
      <P>One would imagine that drainage under the Local Authorities Act should be done permanently as they do it in Switzerland or in some advanced Continental countries where the bottom of the pipe is concreted so that it will never need attention again.  That is not the case here, nor could our finances afford it.  Excellent work was done under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and it makes me smile when Deputy Seán Flanagan and Deputy Cunningham stand up and, parrot-like, repeat that the Act was a waste of money because there was no maintenance. Maintenance must always be done, time and time again.  That is one of the first things we must face up to.  I am sorry I have taken up so much time in blowing that Fianna Fáil scheme sky high.</P>
      <P>From time to time, the Government tells the farmers that the whole economy of the country depends on more production.  They are asked to produce more, and work harder.  But what help has the Government given them?  Does the Minister know that Deputy McQuillan and I, to take two examples in two counties side by side, can quote cases of thousands of farmers literally driven from their homes because of choked-up land drainage.  I know of one area myself&mdash;Deputy Seán Flanagan mentioned it in his speech; it is not far from Ballyhaunis, adjoining the Lung river, portion of which forms the boundary between Mayo and Roscommon in the northeastern part of Mayo-where I am told on good authority that between Mayo and Roscommon there are 2,000 farmers, more than half of whose land is flooded for half the year because the second part of the Lung river has not been drained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the time of the first inter-Party Government&mdash;although Deputy <Col N="191" /> Seán Flanagan says it did more harm than good&mdash;for a reasonably small sum of money, half of the Lung river was done&mdash;it is also known as the Boyle river&mdash;and the famous Tinacarra Rock that was the heartbreak of farmers in that part of the country for years, was blasted and cut away, taking something like four to six feet off the level of Lough Gara and lowering the water table of the surrounding country and thus leaving hundreds of holdings perfectly dry for the first time.  Deputy Seán Flanagan says the farmers lower down are suffering.  Perhaps Deputy McQuillan could better enlighten the House on that but it is strange that I did not hear any complaints from the farmers who are supposed to be flooded as a result of this work.  Perhaps it is just another reason like the &ldquo;no maintenance&rdquo; reason, for killing the Act.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister realise what it is like trying to live on a small holding and, for half the year, to see half that holding flooded, the bogs flooded and the roads leading to the house flooded when the rainfall is heavy; to see the cocks of hay in the summertime, and in harvest time, the stooks of corn, under water during exceptional rainfall, all simply because the Minister and his colleagues are too busy bringing foreigners into the country, giving them £750,000, as they are doing in one case for a factory that will give employment here.  That is a very good job&mdash;I have no fault to find with it&mdash;but surely if we are able to disburse £750,000 for a foreigner to set up a factory, we could think of the poor slaves of our own flesh and blood who are trying to live on these flooded farms, bearing in mind that if they do not pay their annuities to the Land Commission, the sheriff will be down on them.  They are asked to pay for land which they cannot in most cases use for six months of the year.</P>
    <P>That attitude of the Government is particularly callous.  The Government have a great deal to account for in leaving our own people in such a plight that they are forcing them&mdash;and that is what the Government are doing &mdash;to lock up their houses and move <Col N="192" /> out.  It is no wonder that despair, among small farmers particularly, is as prevalent as it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>Not the most important but one of the most important effects of the Local Authorities (Works) Act was the employment it gave in the rural areas. At present no employment is provided by the local authorities or the Government. There seems to be a ban or a deliberate close down in the rural areas.  We are asked to develop our own country.  What are the Government doing towards developing it? One of the first necessities in making land available for production is to take off the surplus water.  The ordinary farmer cannot do that; it must be done by the Government.  We hear talk about non-maintenance, and Deputy Cunningham said&mdash;and there is no harm in quoting him&mdash;that all the drainage in this country should be in the hands of one authority.</P>
    <P>Let me speak for myself.  I do not care two hoots what authority takes over the drainage, so long as the job is done.  I do not care if the Office of Public Works do it.  Did Deputy Seán Flanagan and Deputy Cunningham approach the Government or make any representations to the Government that the Office of Public Works should take over the drainage that was being done by the local authorities?  Did they make any representations to the Minister for Finance to make money available to the Office of Public Works for drainage work.? As I say, I do not care two hoots whether the local authorities, the Office of Public Works or the Special Employment Schemes Office do the job.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion&mdash;and it is an excellent motion&mdash;is to get the drainage done.  Deputy Cunningham described it in most insulting terms as being the &ldquo;bug&rdquo; of Deputy McQuillan. Perhaps he is one of those blessed mortals who come into this House and would not be seen anywhere near a homestead, and think that a farmer is a kind of lesser vermin who does his work, produces food and pays taxes and rates in all circumstances, good, bad and indifferent, and that if he does <Col N="193" /> not like it, he can go to England or the United States.  That is the attitude of the Government towards the farmers at the present time, and has been their attitude all along.  I can never understand what grudge Fianna Fáil have against the ordinary small farmers but definitely, every chance they get, they seem keen to banish them from the country, and they have very nearly done so, I regret to say.</P>
    <P>If the Minister thinks that the old method of carrying out drainage envisaged in this motion was not correct, or if he thinks the local authorities were not the correct vehicle to do the drainage work, let him hand it over to the office of Public Works, the Special Employment Scheme Office, or set up a separate authority.  Deputy Seán Flanagan said that he does not mind if he waits ten, 12 or 20 years for the drainage to be done.  I wonder if he lived on a small holding and had no other means of livelihood, would he be content to wait ten, 12, or 20 years?</P>
    <P>Let me put it another way.  Would he be content to come into this House as a public representative, wait for ten, 12 or 20 years for the allowance which every Deputy gets, continue to work and pay the expenses of keeping a house and rearing a family during that time.  That is an exact parallel of what he wants for the small farmers, until some grand scheme comes along which would just suit certain armchair gentlemen who would not be seen dead near a holding of land.  Just to suit those people, the farmers should wait ten, 12 or 20 years for a grand scheme to come along from the Office of Public Works! The people should be told to clear out, that they will get no help from a Fianna Fáil Government.  I think they do not expect it now.  They know what they will get.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the motion and I am fully behind it, but in case there is any doubt, I want to make clear that what I am asking is that some intermediate body, the local authorities, the Office of Public Works or the Special Employment Schemes Office, should take over the drainage the Arterial Drainage Act will never reach.  That is a very urgent necessity.  In my opinion, the Arterial Drainage Act will <Col N="194" /> not be able to overtake all the drainage work for a long time.  Excellent work has been done which is a credit and a monument to the engineers of the Board of Works, and I should like to pay tribute to them.  There are 105 catchment areas all over the country, and they are doing the work as fast as both staff and finances will allow, but since only seven or eight have been undertaken or completed since 1948, I am not exaggerating when I say that it will take another 50 or 70 years to complete most of the arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, something else must be done.  Some effort should be made to do the work which the Local Authorities (Works) Act was intended to do, and did while it was in operation. That is a vital necessity, if we are to retain our small farmers.  If we do not intend to retain them, let me suggest to the Minister that the decent thing would be to tell them not to waste their time hoping that the job will be done by the Government.  It would be more decent to tell them to go by the boat, as we say, to clear off and not waste their time trying to make a living on flooded land, waiting for an unsympathetic and harsh Government who have not the foggiest notion of coming to their aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the suspension of this Act in 1957, repeated attempts have been made in this House to have it reintroduced.  The motion before us to-night is a repeat of a similar motion which was discussed here in 1959, more than two years ago.  At that time, the idea of this motion had almost unanimous support so far as public expressions in this House were concerned.  In fact, one member of Fianna Fáil of long standing here said it was the best Act that was ever introduced, so far as the farmers of this country are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, at that time the Minister put us at our ease.  He told us that the main fault he found with the measure was that it should not be administered by the local authorities, that the work could be much more effectively carried out by the Office of Public Works, and that accordingly he would not give back to the local authorities powers to carry out these intermediate and minor <Col N="195" /> drainage schemes which the Office of Public Works would carry out instead. I was quite satisfied with that assurance, because, as mentioned by Deputy Blowick, we did not mind whether the local authorities or the Office of Public Works carried out the jobs so long as they were carried out.</P>
    <P>I must say, however, since two years have now passed since the Minister made that statement that it was a deceitful statement.  I cannot otherwise describe it.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, I want to make it quite clear that the Local Authorities (Works) Act grants of 100 per cent. will not be revived by the Government and that the Government adhere to the decision arrived at in 1957 and, with the new relief that we now foresee coming into being in the very near future, under the Office of Public Works we propose to deal with these useful jobs of intermediate river drainage.</P>

      <P>Column 1464, Volume 178 of the Official Report.  At that time the Minister gave the House to understand definitely that in the near future the Office of Public Works would carry out those jobs.  I should like the Minister to define what he means by the term &ldquo;in the very near future&rdquo;.  It is now more than two years and two months since the Minister made that statement.  Will he stand up here tonight and in his address on this motion state what jobs have been carried out by the Office of Public Works since he made the statement on 11th December, 1959?  None has been carried out that I know of in West Cork or, I believe, in any part of Ireland.  Consequently, I affirm again my description of the Minister's remarks at that time, that it was deceitful. Possibly he anticipated that an election was pending and in order to tide himself over, gave these rather definite assurances which have now been dishonoured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to mention again the many advantages that accrued from this measure which helped to develop <Col N="196" /> the fertility of the land and our main industry, agriculture, to a very great extent.  There was a second and an equally important advantage.  It afforded productive employment to a large number of workers in rural Ireland who were unable to find alternative employment.  As Deputy Blowick mentioned, we give hundreds of thousands of pounds to foreigners to set up industries but is not the development of agriculture and the provision of employment in that field as important as development in the industrial field?</P>
    <P>Is the Minister not well aware that the General Council of County Councils and every local authority have made repeated representations with a view to getting this Act reintroduced? Foremost in the claimants to have it reintroduced are members of the Minister's Party.  I do not know whether he has imposed a silence on them in this discussion as I have not seen any of them eager to address the House.  There is no case to make against it.  I must say, however, that if one were making a case, then the best case was made by Deputy Corry of the Fianna Fáil Party, an honoured member of this House with 35 years' membership and who is thoroughly conversant with legislation passed here over that extended period.  I have already mentioned his commendation that it is the best piece of legislation passed by this House, so far as the farmers are concerned.  That should indeed weigh heavily with the Minister and the Government.  It is unnecessary to repeat the many other commendations which this measure has got from Deputies of other Parties and indeed from public representatives and vocational organisations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>What has the adverse affect been in County Cork?  What are we losing as a result of the Government's action in 1957 in withdrawing these grants? First of all, we are losing the opportunity of relieving flooding in many areas.  We have had repeated representations by various people to try to get drainage schemes implemented. Secondly, we have lost a large amount of money by way of grants because <Col N="197" /> during the operation of the scheme in Cork county from 1949 to its suspension in 1957, the amount of money expended was £631,497.  In Cork county alone, more than £631,000 was expended under this Act and I am aware of many of the schemes carried out with that money.  I am quite satisfied that the beneficiaries were satisfied with the work carried out and that in almost all cases, with a few exceptions, good work was done.  I know the advantage it was to the workers in the different districts in which the schemes were operated and the large amount of employment that was provided.  All that has been lost as a result of the action in 1957.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the question. On 11th December, 1959, the Minister told us that we could more or less make our minds easy about these works, that the county council engineers were not capable and had not got the training to do the job and that they did not care whether the work was carried out properly or not.  I disagreed with that assertion at that time. It was an assertion previously made by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Smith, when he was Minister for Local Government.  He stated here that some of the engineers sabotaged the effort and he mentioned specifically that that had happened in his county of Cavan.</P>
    <P>The other side of the picture is that not alone has the Office of Public Works not carried out any of these minor drainage schemes since the suspension of the Act but it is very difficult to get drainage schemes carried out at present under the rural improvements scheme.  All applications for road works and drainage works under the rural improvements scheme have been delayed and when a person submits an application for these grants, let it be for road or drainage work, he can rest assured it will not be inspected for 12 months.  Will the Minister say what is the cause of the delay when heretofore from the date of application not more than eight to nine months could elapse before the actual scheme was implemented?  Now the position is that people must wait more than two years.</P>

      <P>They could be incidental to local authority works.  I do not intend to delay the House unduly as the time is very limited but it is regrettable that we should have to have this motion on our Order Paper again, seeing that we had it more than two years ago and received an assurance then.  I am sure the movers of the motion were satisfied with the Minister's assurance, or satisfied to a reasonable extent.  I am sure they anticipated that as a result of the motion, the Office of Public Works would carry out these jobs.  It is no wonder that we have it on the Order Paper in view of the deliberate deceitfulness of the Minister.</P>
      <P>I appeal to members of this Assembly to support this motion.  We have the position obtaining that, even apart from the Government Party, there is sufficient support outside it to carry a measure such as this.  When we debated this question in December, 1959, we were not in the same favourable position because even though the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were probably as much, if not more, in support of it as those of us who voted for it, they had to vote against it on direction.  That no longer applies. They have lost their majority and are in a minority of three and there are sufficient members to get this motion passed.  I am appealing to these members, whether they be Party members or Independent members, to vote in favour of this motion and direct the Government to do the job they should have done long ago.</P>

      <P>Listening to the various speakers who have contributed to this debate, and in particular the last two, one is struck by the complete absence of any balance in their approach to the matter of drainage as we know it is being carried out at the moment.  It would be fair to say, as far as Deputy Blowick is concerned, that if he could suck as well as he can blow, there would be no water left in the West at all.  But that is not likely to happen. <Col N="199" /> As was stated, this motion was discussed some years ago.  My opinions have not been shaken in any way by my experience since then.  In fact, if anything, I am confirmed in my views in regard to the merits or demerits of the Local Authorities (Works) Act at that time.</P>
      <P>If you can correlate the various views being put forward here, the point would seem to be that we would need the moneys that could be provided under this Act in order to provide employment in rural Ireland.  Since this motion was last discussed, the unemployment figure in rural Ireland has considerably decreased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Murphy did not say all he intended when he was on his feet.  Much play has also been made about the allegedly laudable drainage work done under this Act and it is suggested that it helped production on the land.  Again, since we last discussed this matter, there has been a six per cent. increase in agricultural production throughout the country.  Therefore, both in regard to employment and agricultural production, the picture is brighter today than it was two years ago when we last considered this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This justifies my view that 100 per cent. grants under this Act are not justified and cannot be justified on the record of achievement for the £7½ million spent willy-nilly by the Government of the day under this scheme.  Compare the effects of that expenditure with the undoubtedly useful work that has been done under the Arterial Drainage Act.  To date, an all-in figure of approximately £10 million has been spent on arterial drainage.  Nobody will deny the value of that work or that it will bring very great benefits to the regions that have been drained.  Can we show any comparable results for the £7½ million spent under the Local Authorities (Works) Act in the Fifties?  About 50 per cent. of the money spent was on drainage and the remainder was on road work or work associated with <Col N="200" /> roads.  It has been said here that valuable property of local authorities cannot be saved from being washed away because I will not provide 100 per cent. grants under this Act.  Do the people who make these allegations have any regard to the truth?  Do they realise that the Act is still there and there is nothing to prevent any council who fears its property will be washed away by the floods from spending the money?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Their own money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the whole point.  It is all very well to spend somebody else's money; but even though, as is alleged here, valuable property is being washed away, we cannot see our way in our councils to utilise the statute still on the books and to spend our own money in providing 100 per cent. grants.  When we hear an interjection like that just heard, surely we must ask ourselves does it not provide the answer.  Spend the money you get for nothing, spend it anywhere; but no matter how meritorious the case made about the damage to the council's property, councillors are so blind to the facts that they say, first, they have no authority to go in; secondly, that they have no authority to spend the money; but, finally, they will not spend the money because it would be council money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Should the same care not be taken in the expenditure of the taxpayers' money by county councils as would be taken in the expenditure of the rates money?  Apparently, those who have spoken here to-night use a completely different yardstick when measuring the good that may accrue from the expenditure of the taxpayers' money as against the good that may accrue from the expenditure of the ratepayers' money.  Take that home and consider it and do not come into this House, as was done to-night, and suggest a manager told his council there was no power to do any of these jobs, even to save their own property from flood waters.  I would advise the people holding those views to find out <Col N="201" /> the law on the matter and not to be wasting our time and misleading us.</P>
    <P>In regard to the intermediate river drainage schemes, I am as disappointed by the apparent lack of progress as any other Deputy.  I now realise that the slowness has not been due to neglect by the Board of Works but rather to the procedure whereby these schemes have to be surveyed and exhibited in order to ensure that no undue damage will be done to some other landowner in the area.  Today, under this scheme, the drainage of one river is in progress; tenders have been received for a second scheme, and that job is likely to go to the contractor in the near future; the third and fourth jobs are on the way to be advertised and will also come to the work stage during the course of this year.  Four further rivers have already been surveyed and they, in turn, now that the scheme has got under way, will be the four rivers in 1963 to follow the four of 1962, providing, as I said in 1959, a programme of four intermediate rivers per year.  Progress has been disappointingly slow, but now that the schemes have started, after certain time has been spent on work not immediately evident&mdash;work by technical experts who know their job inside out&mdash;these four schemes will be at the work stage this year; there will be four more next year, and that grouping of four will follow in each successive year.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the position in relation to the relief of urban flooding.  A new additional help is now being given to urban authorities to relieve flooding in their areas.  That new scheme is to the extent of 40 per cent. of the loan charges being made available by way of subsidy in normal cases, and probably in abnormal cases it may go as high as 60 per cent.  In addition to the intermediate river drainage programme I have mentioned, there is, in so far as the urban population and urban authorities are concerned, this new additional subsidy for the relief of flooding in their functional areas. Those two schemes, I feel, constitute a much better and more promising means of relieving flooding in a proper, planned way than was the willynilly <Col N="202" /> approach of the operations under the Local Authorities (Works) Act of which I have had experience as a county councillor when it was in operation.</P>
    <P>However, we are being charged here tonight with neglecting the small farmers, with having no regard for them.  We are being really blackguarded by people who decry the efforts of this Government to get industrialists to come in and set up industries here, not for the benefit of the foreigners who set them up but fundamentally for the provision of much-needed employment for our own people.  Stop this carping and criticism of foreigners and make use of the industries they are providing; stop making out that they are undesirable.  They are most desirable if they bring with them the know-how and the selling experience, if they are men competent to run factories which will give muchneeded employment to our people.</P>
    <P>We have been charged with handing out money to the foreigners only for the foreigners' benefit.  We are charged with neglecting the small farmers. Have we forgotten that since 1957, and as late as 1961, money by way of subsidies went down to the smallest farmer in our community, that we have increased these subsidies from the £17 million provided by the previous Coalition Government to a figure of over £35 million.  Does that denote in Fianna Fáil or the Government any lack of thought or care for the farmers, let them be large or small?</P>
    <P>On the question of drainage, let us come to the actual figures.  If we take the whole range of drainage measures available at the moment, we can start on the farmers' land with the Land Project operations.  We then have minor improvement schemes which include road works, rural improvement grants which again provide for drainage as well as road works.  We have bog development schemes which do drainage on bogs and cater for bog road, and we have the intermediate river drainage programme of which we have talked already tonight, together with the larger overall programme of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>What do you find?  The position is <Col N="203" /> that the aggregate amount of money spent on drainage under all heads in rural Ireland comes to somewhere in the region of £4 million in the year that lies ahead.  Does anyone in his senses suggest that under all those heads, which are directed in a very special way to drainage of agricultural land, the £4 million per annum being spent by this Government, in addition to moneys I have already mentioned by way of general subsidies, are not a very real and very big effort on the part of the Government and of the taxpayer in trying to make the life of our farmers a better life, a fuller life, a more productive and more profitable life?</P>
    <P>Again, we have heard from Deputy M.P. Murphy that somewhere in the region of £630,000 in grants were paid during the course of the Local Authorities (Works) Act to his county and that they are not now being paid that and that there is therefore this big loss to the county.  It would appear as if nothing has improved or increased since then.  Does the same Deputy, who should be well aware of the facts, appreciate that while that money may not now be going into County Cork for work which, in the main, was pretty useless, if not entirely so, there is in fact going into that county money which will give labourers who worked on the Local Authorities (Works) Act schemes much better employment?  He should give some recognition to that fact and not make these comparisons of what has been lost.  He should also consider what has been gained and in the overall, he will probably find that in those two matters alone the balance is well in favour of what is now going into that county as against what it was then.</P>

      <P>We will cease roaming now and come back to the point.  Some of the Opposition speakers had some strange things to say here to-night. I think it was Deputy Blowick again who said it would take either 15 to 17 years, or 50 to 70 years&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash;to get all the arterial drainage required done.  He also asserted that in 1948 when the first Coalition misfortune befell the country, <Col N="206" /> nothing was being done in the line of arterial drainage.  The Act was there but it was not being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to recall to Deputy Blowick's memory the fact that when the Act was put on the Statute Book by the present Minister for Agriculture&mdash;he was then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance in charge of the Office of Public Works&mdash;he said it would take approximately five years to build up the staff and personnel&mdash;both then non-existent&mdash;requisite to put the work in hands.  If the Coalition Government were able to step up the tempo of arterial drainage in 1949, that was because of the five years' build-up of personnel and technical know-how undertaken by the previous Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly a bit of blowing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said in 1944 that it would take five years to build up the staff and technical know-how.  Pressed as to how long it would take to complete the entire arterial drainage programme, he said that the overall job would probably take a further 30 years.  In present circumstances, we know now that that figure was not so wild as it may have appeared then.  I am glad that the increasing tempo in the past four or five years is having the result that, within the next 15 years, the last of the arterial drainage jobs will have been entered on.  The calculation made in 1944 indicates very sound reasoning on the part of the Parliamentary Secretary at the time, Deputy Smith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Complaint has been made that it takes from six to nine months to get an inspector on a rural improvements application job.  That, of course, has nothing to do with this debate, but the Deputy who makes the charge does not know what he is talking about or else was deliberately misleading the House.  I have as much experience of rural improvements applications and I have never known of any delay of <Col N="207" /> the duration mentioned by the Deputy, provided the application was properly made and furnished to the proper address.  If the Deputy thinks over that, he may find the real reason for the delay.</P>
    <P>To those who sponsor this motion and, in particular, to Deputy McQuillan, I should like to say that I still stand over what I said in regard to the wastage that occurred on drainage jobs because of the lack of maintenance subsequently and because of the hurried planning.  In the Deputy's county, I have had reports from some of the council engineers showing that wastage has clearly occurred because of lack of maintenance since the scheme was carried out seven years ago.</P>
    <P>Overall, the amount spent on drainage has increased over the years.  The fact that the Office of Public Works is now handling these intermediate rivers is a vast improvement.  Intermediate river drainage carried out by the Board of Works will, in time, be a credit to us and will be a tremendous benefit to people generally.  The more drainage handled expertly by the Office of Public Works, the better return we will have for the money spent and the sooner we will get the problem of drainage completed to the benefit of all.</P>

When one touched the spring, Jack shoved up his head; when one pressed it again, he disappeared into his box.  There are five Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who are also members of the Galway County Council.  The Chairman of the Council, Deputy Carty, is <Col N="208" /> a member of this House; so is Deputy Geoghegan; so is Deputy Millar; so is Deputy Coogan.  Galway County Council dominated by Fianna Fáil, passed a unanimous resolution, which they forwarded to the Minister, requesting him to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  They were blowing to the people down in Galway but there is not one of them in the House tonight to discuss this important motion.  There is not one of them here to support that resolution, proposed by one of them, seconded, and carried unanimously.  They are outside waiting to be whipped in.</P>

      <P>That is hypocrisy of the worst type.  The Minister talked tonight about arterial drainage.  When the first inter-Party Government came in in 1948, the Minister had very little interest in arterial drainage.  It was we who started the first arterial drainage scheme.  All the machinery in the Board of Works in June, 1948, consisted of two out-of-date excavators.  We had to buy £1,500,000 worth of machinery to carry out arterial drainage and, when we did we were told we were putting the country into pawn.  We left them the machinery to do the work, and we paid for that machinery.  Where is Deputy Corry to-night?  I remember him paying a tribute, and a well deserved tribute, to the then Minister <Col N="209" /> for Local Government, the late Deputy Tadhg Murphy, when he was putting this Act through the Dáil.  Where is he to-night?  He is waiting with the Fianna Fáil members of the Galway County Council to vote against this&mdash; the silent vote.</P>
      <P>I would ask every fair-minded man in this House to vote for the restoration of this Act.  It is an important Act and a good one.  Deputy Murphy said he had been deceived, that he thought the Board of Works was going to take it over.  I was not deceived.  I was Parliamentary Secretary at the time and the Board of Works decided, and rightly, that they had enough on their hands with arterial drainage and that they would hand it over to the local authorities.  The Minister states that the local authorities would have to spend money on these schemes. Whose money is he spending?  Is not he spending the local authorities' money as well?</P>

      <P>There is very little that I can say at this stage on drainage that I have not said thousands of times already.  I have no illusions as to what to expect from the Government on this matter but I think it was necessary to repeat this motion since it was last discussed in 1959 in order to expose the hypocrisy of the so-called rural Party, Fianna Fáil.  This shows that the Dublin spectacles are the ones through which rural problems are looked at and it shows the contempt with which the Taoiseach treats the views of those who support him in rural Ireland.  When they go into their little cells and cumainn in the country they say that the Local Authorities (Works) Act must be restored but when they come to Dublin they take off their caps before the big fellows in the Party in the city, the whip is cracked and they are all small boys up from the country.  These are hard words but they are true.</P>

      <P>If I am getting under the Minister's skin he should not let it show.  I did not interrupt him for the 20 minutes he was speaking.  In April, 1959, the two intermediate drain age schemes the Minister has referred to were introduced into the Board of Works.  From the middle of April 1959 to the middle of February, 1961 is almost three years and in that time not as much as one scheme has been completed.  The Minister tells us that <Col N="211" /> one scheme is under way and that two or three more are to be put up for contract.</P>

      <P>How long are we going to wait for another scheme?  The Minister says that schemes would not be maintained.  It is a simple thing to bring a one line Bill into this House to say that maintenance charges would be imposed.  The Minister has said that there are fewer people needing employment in rural Ireland.  Of course there are fewer people needing employment and there will be fewer still if the Minister is let get away with the ideas he is trying to put across the House. He said there was an increase of six per cent. in the production from the land.  That is in direct conflict with the speech made by the Minister for Finance in Cork when he said that our output from the land in terms of cattle would be down next year.</P>
