    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of his statement of 15th November that the Government's expectation is that in the circumstances of the EEC there will be such considerable development of new industries that overall employment will increase, not diminish, he will state on what studies, carried out by Governmental or other bodies, his statement is based; whether he has any certain knowledge of new industries which would be set up in this country should Ireland become a member of EEC; and, if so, what industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Future industrial expansion in this country depends almost entirely on the prospects of export markets.  It is obvious that these prospects will be enhanced by our membership of the European Economic Community.  On the other hand, with Britain proposing to join the Community, it is clear that any <Col N="2" /> doubt about our intention to do likewise would discourage further industrial development here.</P>
      <P>The expectation I have expressed that the growth of new industries will lead to an overall increase in industrial employment is based on the industrial expansion now taking place and on the flow of new industrial proposals which is continuing because of our known intention of joining the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that the increase in employment in these industries which he anticipates will be sufficient to take up any disemployment or unemployment that may occur in the initial stages of our membership of the European Economic Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we hope that will be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach state at this stage what, in his judgment, <Col N="3" /> would be the results on the prospective industrial development here if Great Britain joined the Community and we did not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that not merely would all present development cease but many existing industries would be greatly handicapped in their future development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is useful to have that on record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he accepts, as representing the present policy of the Government, the position set out in the <i>Aide Memoire</i> handed to the American Ambassador on the 8th February, 1949, by the Minister for External Affairs on behalf of the then Government that, because of the continued partition of Ireland, any military alliance with, or commitment involving military action jointly with, the State that is responsible for the unnatural division of Ireland, which occupies a portion of this country with its armed forces, and which supports undemocratic institutions in the north-eastern corner of Ireland, would be entirely repugnant and unacceptable to the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to a similar Question in this House on the 14th February last.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

In fact, my information is that this has been the first instance of a serious accident in this country involving a beet harvester. Furthermore, I understand that the types of beet harvesters used here are accepted as conforming to the safety standards adopted in Britain.</P>
      <P>I do not see what can be done to ensure a greater degree of safety in the working of these machines other than to warn all operators of the necessity for exercising common sense and care in their use and for adhering rigidly to manufacturers' instructions.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to his Question on 12th April, 1962, proposals were at that time before me from Shannon Repair Services Ltd. for the provision at Shannon Airport of full scale engineering facilities for aircraft and of a limited amount of traffic handling, mainly for non-scheduled operations <Col N="25" /> at the Airport.  A licence to operate at Shannon Airport was issued to the company on 8th May, 1962.</P>
      <P>The conditions attached to the licence are such as to ensure that a satisfactory standard of service is offered for both engineering and traffic handling services and that in the case of traffic handling the new company may provide such services only for carriers assigned to it by me. Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to give exact details of the licence which is in the nature of a commercial contract.</P>
      <P>Widespread publication to all interested parties as to the division of traffic handling services between Aer Lingus and Shannon Repair Services Ltd., was given in a Civil Aviation Bulletin issued by my Department on 3rd May, 1962 and carriers operating non-scheduled service were advised specifically of the new arrangements.</P>
      <P>I have no information that the services being rendered by Shannon Repair Services Ltd. are unsatisfactory. I am not prepared to give details of the private business arrangements of the carriers using Shannon Airport.</P>
      <P>The establishment of two traffic handling organisations at Shannon was sanctioned by me in the interest of Shannon Airport since there were definite prospects that the establishment of the additional engineering services in conjunction with traffic handling by Shannon Repair Services would attract additional traffic to the Airport.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 26 and 27 together. The recent increase in the import duties on knitted synthetic fabrics was necessary to protect the Irish manufacturers of these fabrics against imported materials which were being landed at dumped prices.  The question of removing or reducing the duty does not arise at present.  The action to be taken in relation to Customs duties generally (including this duty) on the occasion of our entry into the Common Market will be determined by the terms and conditions on which our application for membership is accepted.</P>
      <P>Representations have been made to me recently, on behalf of a number of factories which use the fabrics in question as a raw material, concerning the range and specifications of the materials available from the Irish mills.  I am having these representations examined as a matter of urgency with a view to ascertaining whether the complaints are well founded.</P>

      <P>Is it not strange that while we talk about reducing tariffs, in this case we have jumped them from 37½ per cent. to 85 per cent., and to 100 per cent. in some cases?

      <P>I understand from representations which have been made to me that there are firms with contractual obligations for the purchase of certain foreign knitted synthetic fabrics.</P>
      <P>The increased duty in this case is intended to prevent the large-scale importation of low priced fabrics.  Its purpose would be defeated if licences were now given for the importation of any substantial quantity of these fabrics at the old rates of duty.</P>

His combined income from his new special allowance and old age pension is, in fact, greater than his income from his previous special allowance and the disability benefit which ceased when he became eligible for old age pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1.</P>
      <P>In page 12, to delete section 30, lines 35 to 41, and to insert the following section:</P>
      <P> (1)  Sections 102, 103 and 114 and Parts XIII to XVI (which provisions relate to sea fisheries and certain other matters) of the Principal Act shall (notwithstanding section 325 of that Act) extend to the Moville Area and, for the purpose of giving full effect to the said provisions, every other provision of the Principal Act or of this Act which is applicable in relation to any of the said provisions shall also extend to that Area.</P>
      <P>(2)  The provisions of the Fisheries Acts, 1842 to 1958, corresponding to the said extended provisions of the Principal Act shall, in so far as they continued to be in force in the Moville Area by reason of the operation of section 325 of that Act, cease to be in force.</P>
      <P>(3)  Section 29 of this Act shall not extend to the Moville Area.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> On the Committee Stage, I undertook to review those of the provisions of the Bill which will apply in the Moville Area, that is, the part of the Foyle area which is within the State.</P>
    <P>In order to get a clear picture it is necessary to go back to the Foyle Fisheries Act of 1952.  That Act, with its counterpart enacted in parallel terms by the Belfast Parliament, provided a common code of law for the administration of the salmon fisheries of the Foyle Area by the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  The then existing provisions of the Fisheries Acts, 1842 to 1949, were repealed for the Foyle area in so far as the Foyle Acts rendered their retention unnecessary. It was necessary, however, to retain for the Moville area a considerable body of the pre-1952 law, for instance, the provisions dealing with sea fisheries.  Even when those provisions were consolidated in 1959 for the remainder of the State, they remained in force in their old form in the Moville Area.  Section 325 of the Consolidation Act had that effect.  This situation was changed by the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Act of 1961 when the opportunity was taken to extend corresponding provisions of the Consolidation Act to the Moville Area.</P>
    <P>The present position, therefore, is that some sections of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, apply throughout the entire State and others do not apply in the Moville area because there are corresponding provisions in the Foyle Fisheries Acts. In other words, there are two codes of fishery law in the Moville area, one under the Foyle Acts connected with the administration of the Foyle Area and the other under the Consolidation Act.</P>
    <P>The present Bill amends and extends the Consolidation Act of 1959 and, so far as the Moville area is concerned, it is convenient to consider the sections of the Bill in four groups.  One group of 16 sections 2 to 7, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 24, 26, 27, 31 and 33, will not apply in the Moville area because they amend provisions of the 1959 Act which do not apply in that area.  The second group of 19 sections.  Sections 1, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18 to 23, 25 to 28, <Col N="47" /> 32, 34, 36, 37 and 38, will apply in the Moville Area because they relate to provisions applicable to that area.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill, which is alone in the third category, specifically extends to the Moville Area further provisions of the 1959 Act, mainly those relating to sea fisheries.  Only two sections&mdash;Sections 29 and 35&mdash; remain for the final group representing new legislation which will, in the absence of any provision to the contrary, apply throughout the entire State.  Section 35 is aimed at conservation of stocks of sea fish and should clearly apply in the Moville Area. Section 29 deals with fishing for salmon at sea and it was my intention, under subsection (3), to except the Moville Area from its scope.  However, in deference to the views of the House, I am moving an amendment to add a new subsection making it clear that Section 29 will not apply in the Moville Area.  This amendment is included in the revised section which is being substituted for Section 30 and the opportunity is taken to improve the drafting of the remainder of that section.</P>
    <P>The intentions expressed by the original subsection can in fact be dealt with by way of regulation under the Foyle Fisheries Act.  Both Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cunningham expressed the view on Committee Stage that the more appropriate way to deal with the matter would be to ensure that regulations under the Foyle Fisheries Act would apply to the Moville Area and to the area in the Six Counties.  Therefore, in deference to that point of view, we are making it clear that Section 29 does not in fact apply to the Moville Area and that the intention of Section 29 in regard to drifting at sea for salmon can, in effect, be carried out by way of regulation under the Foyle Fisheries Act.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="48" /> Agreed to take remaining Stage today.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary now for a short statement on what the position under the new fisheries code will be, when this Bill passes, in respect of one specific problem.  The consolidated Act consists, I think, of five Parts.  I think the fifth Part of that Act provides for the compulsory acquisition of fisheries in this country, if it is put into operation by the Minister by Order.  I do not think it ever has been put into operation by Order for reasons that we debated on the Second Stage of the Bill.  I want to know now if, without undertaking the whole burden of implementing Part V of the Act, under the existing code, when this Bill has been enacted, we have any powers to deal with a specific problem which presents itself in connection with the development of inland fisheries.  There are scattered about the country, in various places, small lakes, the fishing rights of which are vested in old estates.  These estates have in many places been sold either to local people or to the Land Commission, without any conveyance of the fishing rights. These fishing rights are vested in God-knows-who&mdash;the heirs to these old estates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In several areas, particularly in my own constituency of Monaghan, people want to carry out, in collaboration with the Inland Fisheries Trust, works of improvement on these lakes, but they are deterred from doing so by the knowledge that if they take an abandoned lake, now swarming with pike and perch, and convert it into a good trout fishing water, it immediately becomes quite valuable and there is no reason why the heir to the old fishing title, which has long been abandoned, should not revive it, once the lake has acquired an amenity value.  You may have some person turning up in England, Scotland or God-knows-where pointing out that the fishing rights in this lake were never alienated, that they belong to him and that he now proposes to preserve the lake on which <Col N="49" /> the local angling association and the Inland Fisheries Trust have invested money with the intention of using it themselves or providing it as an amenity for their neighbours.</P>
    <P>In cases of that kind, where the title to the fishing rights has in fact been abandoned for ten, 20 or 30 years, have we any powers in any of the codes to extinguish the rights or to publish an advertisement notifying all and sundry that, unless a right is established, these waters are no longer vested in any individual and thereafter will be vested in the Inland Fisheries Trust?  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary if we have not that power, we ought seriously to consider taking steps to acquire it.  I fully appreciate that if we have such an intention, or if we have the power, it is a power that will have to be used with discretion.  You will have to fix a minimum period of abandonment before determining that the title has in fact been abandoned. But unless and until we do something of that kind, there is a good deal of development work which ought to be carried out, which people are anxious to carry out but which cannot be carried out because, if it is carried out, strangers may revive an ancient claim and effectively take over the fruits of the Inland Fisheries Trust's and the local angling organisations' labours.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to be in a position to give me a categorical answer now.  Although I am fairly familiar with the fisheries code, I do not know the answer to the question I am asking&mdash;whether we have any power under the existing code to deal with this problem.  If we have not, I suggest it is a matter which we might reasonably look to, because it is at present obstructing the performance of valuable work which many angling associations and the Inland Fisheries Trust are anxious to put in hand, but which they are not putting in hand until this ambiguity has been clarified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Dillon, I am not quite certain as to whether we have the power in the particular circumstances he mentioned.  I would venture to say we have not, because Part V of the 1939 Act, enabling us to <Col N="50" /> acquire fishery rights on a compensation basis, only envisages a situation where there are ascertained owners. The Deputy raises the case of abandoned fishery rights with unascertained owners or owners who cannot easily be ascertained.  Certainly, if that situation could arise, it would create a very undesirable situation, especially as the Inland Fisheries Trust are doing very useful development work.  It would be undesirable that a situation should arise where an unascertained owner might reappear and proceed to establish his legal rights.</P>
      <P>It is a question of making provision for arrangements whereby after a certain prescribed period these rights will cease to exist.  If the Deputy suggests that could be done without detriment or prejudice to existing rights by advertisement or notice of that nature, it is a matter worthy of investigation. I shall take it up with the Inland Fisheries Trust, with a view to finding out if there are in fact cases where they have been held up in any way or have refrained from going ahead with development work by reason of such fears as the Deputy expressed.  I guarantee to take that up with the Trust with a view to clarifying the position.  If there are specific instances where they have not gone ahead with desirable development work for the reason the Deputy suggests, I shall certainly give very real consideration to adopting some such provision.</P>

    <Title>Trade Marks Bill, 1962&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the existing law relating to trade marks in certain respects, so that it will amongst other things, become better adapted to fulfil the needs of traders, in respect of trade mark protection, <Col N="51" /> under modern commercial conditions. In so far as the Bill modifies or introduces new features into the law, regard has been paid to the revision of the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property which was effected in 1958, to the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry set up by my predecessor in 1935, to current responsible opinion in industrial and professional circles in this country, and to modifications to similar effect which have been introduced into the legislation of other countries in recent times.  For the sake of greater convenience in its interpretation and working, it has been thought better to incorporate the law as amended in a single act, separate from the law relating to patents, industrial designs and copyright at present contained in the Act of 1927 and certain later amending Acts.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to remove certain restrictions which are contained, or are inherent, in the existing law, and which have been found in practice to hamper commercial arrangements which are commonplace under modern trading conditions or, in other words, to hamper trade development.  The first concerns the existing requirement of the law whereby the proprietor of a trade mark cannot validly assign it unless he also transfers, with the mark, the goodwill of the business concerned in the goods for which it is registered, which means, in effect, the whole of the goodwill of that business.  This requirement was based on the conception that the purpose of a trade mark was to identify the goods with the proprietor of the mark, whereas present-day experience goes to show that the public tend to identify a trade mark with a particular product, rather than with the maker of the product, of whose identity they are often unaware.  Under the existing law it is often difficult to make the industrial and commercial arrangements which related commercial or industrial concerns may wish to make to meet developing trade without endangering the validity of valuable trade marks. It is proposed by Section 29 of the Bill to permit trade marks to be validly <Col N="52" /> assigned without the goodwill of the business, and also in respect of some, only, of the goods for which they are registered.  At the same time, Section 29 provides safeguards designed to protect the interests of the public in respect of assignments of trade marks which are likely to lead to deception, and which would accordingly not be deemed to have been valid.</P>
    <P>A further restriction, inherent in the present law, lies in the fact that the proprietor of a registered trade mark cannot allow the mark to be used by other persons on his behalf without endangering the validity of its registration. This, again, has been found to hamper the development of trade in the State, because the proprietors of valuable trade marks are naturally reluctant to take the risk of entering upon trading arrangements which, for reasons of commercial convenience, involve the use of their trade marks by other firms manufacturing and distributing the goods on their behalf.  It is proposed by Section 35 of the Bill, in conjunction with the projected Statutory Rules, to provide for a system of registration of persons who are permitted by the proprietors of registered trade marks to use the marks.  Such users will be known as &ldquo;registered users&rdquo; and it is proposed that such cases shall be subjected to scrutiny to ensure that a registered user shall not be recorded unless it is clear that the public interest remains unaffected.</P>
    <P>Another important change is a proposal to abolish the existing requirement that a trade mark must have been in use for at least two years before it can be considered for entry in Part B of the Register.  This Part of the Register&mdash;Part B&mdash;provides for the protection of trade marks of a less distinctive character than those which qualify for registration in Part A. Section 17 of the Bill, which defines what may be registered in Part B, omits this condition of two years' prior use, and thus enables suitable new trade marks to be registered forthwith, a facility which should be of benefit to traders.</P>
    <P>The definition of a trade mark in Section 2 is different from that contained in the present law.  The substance <Col N="53" /> of this change is contained in the alteration of the words &ldquo;a mark used or proposed to be used upon or in connection with goods,&rdquo; as in the present law, to &ldquo;a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods,&rdquo; as in Section 2 of the Bill.  The former of these definitions is regarded as too restrictive, as it means that only use in physical connection with the goods constitutes use of a mark as a trade mark.  A new and broader concept of trade mark use is required.  It is necessary to bring in the use of trade marks in advertisements, in invoices, or in pamphlets and the like, where these relate to goods which are actually being offered for sale.  The new definition now proposed will include use of this kind.  It will also include use by a registered user, which is necessary because of the provision in Section 35.</P>
    <P>At present the law provides for the registration of marks which are used by their proprietors, in relation to goods for the purpose of denoting that they have certified the goods in question as to their origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy or other characteristic.  In Section 44 of the Bill before the House such marks, in future to be known as &ldquo;certification trade marks,&rdquo; are separately defined and clearly distinguished from ordinary marks.  A certification trade mark, in future, will not be registrable in the name of any person who carries on a trade in the goods in question. Applicants will be required to deposit the proposed regulations to govern the use of their mark.  A number of safeguards against misuse of these marks are introduced.</P>
    <P>Under existing law it is open to anyone, however unqualified he may be, to represent himself and to practise as a trade mark agent.  It is considered undesirable that this position should be allowed to continue.  Trade mark law can be very complex, and trade mark rights often represent valuable industrial property.  In order to ensure, in the interests of traders, that such matters are dealt with by properly qualified persons, it is proposed by Section 68 of the Bill to provide for the registration of trade mark agents, and that only persons or firms who are registered as agents shall be <Col N="54" /> entitled to practise or represent themselves as such.  The section sets out conditions of eligibility and defines the things that may be done by an agent.  Penalties are also provided for acts constituting offences under the section.</P>
    <P>The other changes proposed include a provision in Section 34 for wider protection of well-known trade marks consisting of invented words, the provisions in Section 36 to permit registration of a trade mark in circumstances where the mark is proposed to be used by a registered user or by a body corporate yet to be constituted, as well as the provision in Section 47 which will enable a trader, before filing an actual application for registration, to obtain an official opinion as to the suitability for registration of any trade mark which he proposes to adopt.</P>
    <P>I recommend the principle of the Bill for approval by the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is accompanied by an explanatory memorandum. Unlike the memorandum that accompanied the Companies Act, which was quite informative, I am afraid neither the quantity nor the substance of the information contained in it is very considerable.</P>
      <P>This is a matter which requires a good deal of study in order to understand fully the actual changes being made.  As the Minister said, the Bill represents a consolidation and codification of the law concerning trade marks, which formed part of the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act of 1927.  That Act also dealt with the law relating to patents, designs and copyright.  The 1927 Act, which was enacted at a less leisurely time than the present, has on the whole stood up reasonably well to the test of time.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has remarked, the purpose of this Bill is to widen the definition of a trade mark and also to enable it to be utilised in the future in order to assist and develop trade generally.  Allowing a trade mark to be assigned, without assigning the goodwill of a business, seems a desirable alteration and one which will prove of benefit to a number of persons with trade mark rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> There is another change in the Bill altering the existing law.  Under the law as it stands, a person who was refused registration had the right to appeal to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In practice, I think that right was not much exercised.  So far as I know, the general procedure was for the Minister to allow the person concerned to appeal directly to the Court. Whether it is desirable to do away with that proviso is a matter which might be considered further.</P>
    <P>One of the obvious disadvantages of direct appeal to the Court is that the person concerned has to bear the court costs, or certainly a portion of them.  It is, of course, a more costly procedure than appealing directly to the Minister.  On the other hand, the view may be taken that, because the Controller is a quasi-judicial person, it is undesirable that an appeal should lie from his decision to the Minister, and the more normal procedure would be to permit an appeal to the Court.</P>
    <P>Section 56 of the Bill provides for an appeal to the Court from any order or decision of the Controller, other than a decision of the Controller under Section 10 or subsection (7) of Section 68 of the Act.  Paragraph 19 of the memorandum refers to the fact that &ldquo;Section 56 of the Bill provides generally that all orders and decisions of the Controller shall be subject to appeal only to the Court, except those relating to classification of goods (Section 10) and to removals from the register of trade mark agents under Section 68 (2).&rdquo;  There must, I think, be a misprint in the case of subsection (2) because there is no such reference in Section 68 (2).  It seems to me it should refer to Section 68, subsection (7).</P>
    <P>I think a proviso should be included in Section 68, subsection (7), that where the Controller makes due inquiry, he should have the obligation to hear the person concerned.  As the section is drafted, there is no obligation on him to hear the person.  He is obliged to make due inquiry and after considering it, he can decide that the name of the person should be erased from the register.  He is obliged by <Col N="56" /> Section 68, subsection (7) (b) to send by post to the person a notice in writing stating the decision, the date and the reason.  However, it should be obligatory on the Controller in a matter of this sort to hear the person concerned.</P>
    <P>There is also a change concerning the position of trade mark agents. Although this matter affects a great number of businesses, nevertheless it is a comparatively specialised subject and as I understand the position, there are very few trade mark agents in this country practising entirely as such.  Of course, quite a few solicitors engage in the business, in conjunction with their own business as solicitors, but trade mark agents who act solely as trade mark agents, as distinct from any other occupation, are comparatively few.  I note that under the change proposed in Section 68, subsection (4), no person can be registered who has not been in continuous practice as a trade mark agent for a period of five years before the commencement of the Act and in order to be so registered, he must make application in the prescribed manner.  Whether that is unduly restrictive or not is a matter which would also require further consideration.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other sections which we can consider on the Committee Stage.  Leaving aside the terms of this measure, it might be useful to have an indication from the Minister as to whether there has been any change in policy recently in relation to trade mark applications.  I was examining the Controller's annual report and I noticed that the number of trade mark applications accepted has dropped considerably in recent years, while the figures show that the number of applications filed has increased considerably.  In 1961, the number filed was 1,413, whereas in 1957 the number was 1,045.  I suppose the growth of industrial companies and the general expansion in business have been responsible for that, but at the same time I find that the number of applications accepted is substantially below what it was some years earlier.</P>
    <P>If a comparison is made between the years 1954 and 1961 of the applications <Col N="57" /> filed, it shows that there has been a considerable drop.  In the early period which I mentioned 4,764 applications were filed, of which 4,622 were accepted, which is about 97 per cent. For the latter period, 5,737 applications were filed and 4,078 were accepted, which shows a drop to 71 per cent.  That appears to indicate that the percentage of applications refused has grown.  I presume the Minister is familiar with the dictum laid down in the Stanwell case, as reported in Patent Cases, Volume 35.  On page 58, it states that <i>prima facie</i> the register is created for the purpose of enabling trade marks to be put upon it and it would be very unfortunate if <i>bona fide</i> or honest applications for trade marks were to be refused on grounds which were fanciful or, in the business sense, unsubstantial.</P>
    <P>I imagine it is necessary to scrutinise most carefully trade mark applications in order to keep a proper, suitable and adequately high standard, but at the same time it does seem to show, on the figures I have given&mdash;I do not know whether it is possible to get more up-to-date figures&mdash;a drop in the number of trade mark applications registered in relation to the number of applications. As I said, there has been a substantial increase in the number of applications, but on the basis of these figures, it would seem that the tendency is to register fewer applications and admit fewer.  Whether that indicates a change in policy or outlook or whether there is any other reason that is not strictly apparent from the figures, I should be glad to know.</P>
    <P>Another matter which will require consideration in conjunction with certain other sections is the proposed change in the registration of trade marks covered by Section 17.  To some extent, this alters the procedure and qualifications laid down in the 1927 Act.  Section 17 of that Act dispenses with the arrangement that Part B concerns only trade marks which have been in use for at least two years prior to the filing of the application.  Under the new proposal, it is possible to file applications and the Controller has the right to require a disclaimer to be given, that is, as I say, an alteration in the procedure hitherto adopted and it <Col N="58" /> may be a matter which will require further consideration on Committee Stage.  Subject to those remarks, we agree to give the Bill a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is very good reason for the explanatory memorandum in this case being so much shorter than the one provided in connection with the Companies Bill.  Apart altogether from the fact that this Bill is only about one-seventh of the size of the Companies Bill, it embraces a certain number of main points and the explanatory memorandum was, in the main, confined to the main points. These were, as I have said, the power of assigning trade marks, the power of permitting a licence for the user of a trade mark, the shortening of the period of user for the purpose of registering under Part B, and the qualification of trade mark agents.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I misunderstood Deputy Cosgrave in his criticism of subsection (5) of Section 68, in which he said that the trade mark agent who has been in continuous practice in the State for five years may be eligible to register.  This is an automatic right but it is not the only qualification. Again, subject to my statement that I hope I did not misunderstand what the Deputy said, he will see that in the previous section, separate qualifications are set out and a person may qualify under a previous subsection without the five years qualification or practising period.  That will give him automatic entitlement to registration under subsection (4) of Section 68.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which the Deputy referred was that the right of appeal to the Minister was being taken away and made instead a right of appeal to the court.  There are very good reasons for that.  First of all, the Controller is an official of the Minister, to a very great extent.  Secondly, the Controller's office is subject to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and is provided for in the Vote for the Department of Industry and Commerce. So I think with the necessity for justice being done and appearing to be done, it is far better that the aggrieved person should have the right <Col N="59" /> of appeal to the High Court rather than to the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to the removal of an agent from the register, there are provisions whereby the person who is removed may appeal, but I agree that in the specific instance mentioned by the Deputy, there is no right of appeal. That is a matter which can be looked into on Committee Stage and adequate provision made for such appeal, if it appears to be necessary.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Order) (No. 2) Bill, 1962&mdash; Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm an Order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, relating to the operation of resale price maintenance in the supply and distribution of cookers and ranges.  The Commission's report of their inquiry into this matter has already been circulated to Deputies, but I propose to give here a summary of its contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry related to resale price arrangements by suppliers and distributors of cookers and ranges using electricity, bottled gas and solid fuel. Cookers utilising town gas are sold direct to consumers by the various town gas companies and no resale price is, therefore, involved in the case of such goods.  Home manufacturers supply the greater part of the market in electric cookers; supplies of these cookers are also imported, on payment of import duty of 37 per cent.  (25 per cent. preferential), by a number of firms.  Approximately three-quarters of sales to the public are through the Electricity Supply Board.  For that reason, and also because discount margins on these cookers are lower than on other electrical goods, they are not, in general, sold below specified <Col N="60" /> prices, and the enforcement of resale prices is not resorted to.</P>
    <P>Cookers using bottled gas are imported by two firms as an adjunct to their business of selling the gas, and are distributed to selected dealers who receive discounts, of 25 per cent. from one company and 20 per cent. from the other, off specified retail prices.  As with electric cookers, these specified prices are generally adhered to and the question of resale price maintenance does not arise.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the market for cookers and ranges using solid fuel is supplied by home manufacturers.  There is a duty of 40 per cent. on imports, which in 1960 reached only a small proportion of the total home production.  Of the five firms engaged in home production, by far the major share of the market is supplied by Waterford Ironfounders Ltd. and Hammond Lane Ironfounders Ltd., Waterford being the largest supplier in the country.  The evidence at the inquiry showed that, apart from Waterford Ironfounders, the suppliers of these goods allow traders freedom to charge whatever prices they wish.</P>
    <P>At the inquiry, it was learned that from 1952 onwards the policy of Waterford Ironfounders had been directed towards the achievement of resale price maintenance at all levels of distribution.  At that time the company reorganised its distribution system on the basis of a fixed retail price from which proportionate trade and cash discounts were allowed to the various categories of distributors.  At this time, also, a Joint Committee was formed by the company, composed of representatives of the distributors and the company.  In the implementation of its policy, the company consulted the distributors' group of the Committee and took its recommendations into consideration.  Price maintenance was one of the aims of the Committee, and was regularly discussed at its meetings.</P>
    <P>The evidence at the inquiry showed that efforts by the company and the Joint Committee to maintain prices were not successful, and complaints of price cutting by appointed distributors were frequent.  In 1958 Waterford <Col N="61" /> introduced a new agreement for distributors, which again provided for resale price maintenance at all levels of distribution, but with lower discounts from the fixed retail prices.  The list of scheduled products affected by the agreement was also substantially reduced.  Notwithstanding determined efforts to make this agreement effective, it was not observed in many places and by 1959 price cutting was widespread. In October, 1959, the company introduced the present form of agreement, which provides for the calculation of discount on a trade price instead of on a fixed retail price as heretofore, and substitutes a recommended retail price for a fixed retail price.</P>
    <P>This distribution system is based on written agreements with the company's wholesale agents and registered stockists.  The wholesale agent's agreement requires him to maintain and display a specified stock of the company's scheduled products; to purchase goods every year up to a stipulated value and to employ certain craftsmen, salesmen and travellers. The registered stockist's agreement requires him to display and stock a stated minimum number of cookers and ranges, and a stock of spare parts. Both classes are also bound to certain price arrangements involving (a) a recommended retail price, and (b) a trade price which is 12½ per cent less than (a).  In sales to the public, a wholesale agent is allowed, in order to meet competition, to reduce the recommended retail price by 5 per cent. The registered stockist is required to sell the products &ldquo;in accord with&rdquo; the recommended retail price; the company stated that this does not mean that he is expected to maintain the recommended price, and that he is, in fact, free to charge any price he wishes.</P>
    <P>It was stated on behalf of the company that the system introduced in 1959 abolished resale price maintenance at retail level while maintaining it at wholesale level.  Some witnesses claimed, however, that they had not been made aware of this, and, while there is some doubt as to the interpretation of the agreements, it appears that at least the company did not emphasise that retail price maintenance had been abandoned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> The company submitted that the present system of distribution, involving price maintenance at wholesale level, was the only alternative to the setting up of its own distribution system throughout the country.  It regarded the Wholesale Agent as an extension of the company who should distribute and service its products in exactly the same manner as if the company had set up its own area depots. It contended that, in these circumstances, a policy of resale price maintenance was justified.</P>
    <P>In the course of the inquiry, it emerged that of the 79 appointed wholesale agents, only three or four were engaged exclusively in the wholesale trade, and six of them appeared to conduct a purely retail business. Because of this fact, the wide disparity in discounts allowed to wholesale agents and other traders in the products created difficulties in the trade, as the wholesale agents used their larger discounts to compete for the available business.  Furthermore, the margins laid down by the company were wide enough to suit the less efficient distributors, and the more efficient felt that they were being forced into charging unjustifiable prices.  Much price cutting was concealed and could not be proved.</P>
    <P>The Commission reported that it was clear from the evidence that the pre&mdash;and after&mdash;sales services provided for in the agreement were not as important as the company suggested, and the relevant conditions were not being enforced.  In the Commission's view the company's claim that the wholesale agent is required to act, in effect, as an extension of the company itself is open to challenge.  The agents are independent merchants who purchase the products and might reasonably claim that they should be free to sell them in accordance with the requirements of their own business.</P>
    <P>The Commission felt that it should be possible for the company by means of a suitable discount structure and without resale price maintenance to ensure that its distributors displayed ample stocks and placed orders in sufficient quantities in accordance with the company's production programme.</P>
    <P>In the light of these considerations, <Col N="63" /> the Commission were of opinion that, having regard to the fact that distributors are virtually limited to home-manufactured cookers and ranges by reason of the high protective tariff on imported products, the operation of a policy of resale price maintenance by the dominant home manufacturer restricted the free play of economic forces.  They considered that this policy prevented the growth of a competitive price structure, thus increasing prices to the public and giving rise to discrimination between traders.  It was the Commission's opinion, therefore, that this policy was against the public interest and they recommended that, in regard to solid fuel cookers and ranges, resale price maintenance by a supplier and discrimination related to it should be prohibited.</P>
    <P>In regard to electric and bottled gas cookers, while the general absence of price cutting has so far obviated any necessity for enforcement of specified resale prices, the Commission considered that traders who wished to sell such products at less than suggested or recommended prices should be free to do so, and accordingly they recommended that the prohibition proposed in relation to solid fuel cookers should also be applied to electric and bottled gas cookers.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953 provides that an Order of this kind shall not have effect unless it is confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the Order concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of confirmation Bills, the arrangement is that the Order which it is proposed to confirm would not be capable of amendment by the House but would be accepted or rejected as it stands.  The matters with which the Order deals have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and their report sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the Order.  I can therefore recommend this Confirmation Bill to the House without reservation, and I am confident that its enactment <Col N="64" /> will prove an effective barrier to the growth of restrictive practices in the supply and distribution of cookers and ranges, and lead to more equitable arrangements for those engaged in the trade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one matter on which I should like to query the Minister, although it does not arise directly on the Order, but it is of some importance.  Can the Minister say if his Department exercises a right of inspection of the possible fire hazards from cookers and ranges and heaters?  This question probably arises more in relation to heaters than to cookers or ranges but there is also a likely fire hazard in the case of some of these.  Nowadays, most of them have the flame or fire more concealed than formerly but, from time to time, one hears of fires taking place, due to some of these heaters either spilling over or being blown over by a wind and causing damage. The danger is considerable and I should be interested to know now if the Minister exercises any supervision over their construction so as to avoid the hazard of fire.</P>
      <P>Subject to that query, we approve of the proposal in the Bill.  The Commission examined the matter fully and recommended the Order as set out in the Bill.  The Order seems to be warranted by the evidence furnished to the Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The only power I have in respect of fires is one to regulate the type of construction of oil fires, arising out of accidents in respect of which there was some public apprehension about three years ago. As a result of certain investigations and specifications made in Britain, there was a grave danger that there might be an overflow of these heaters to this country.  The Oireachtas enacted a Bill at that time which empowered me to make these regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not got similar power in respect of ranges and cookers which use solid fuel.  I do not think it has emerged that there is any grave danger to property or life arising out of the use of these cookers.  The type of danger usually concerns open grates <Col N="65" /> and these are not affected at all.  Open grates are being improved considerably so that even that danger does not arise as often as it used to.  Where the construction of the cookers and ranges we are now familiar with changes to modern specifications, I doubt that such a power will serve any purpose. If there does appear to be a necessity for taking such power, I would examine the matter carefully and would not hesitate to ask the House to give me the power it gave me in respect of oil heaters.</P>

      <P>During the discussion on this Estimate, the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Dillon, went off at a tangent in regard to the matter of rural water supplies.  He indicated that it seems to be the policy of my Department and the Government to bring water mains along every main road, that that was foolish, that it would leave a blister on the ratepayers of very formidable dimensions, and more or less took me to task for this policy or alleged policy of doing something in a daft way.  I had hoped at this stage that this question of confusion about the methods we hope to adopt to give water supplies to the people <Col N="66" /> of rural Ireland had been laid to rest, but whether it was laid to rest or not, it is being resurrected in no uncertain terms by the Leader of the main Opposition Party.</P>
      <P>I am rather afraid that the manner in which he raises it may be taken as an indication that he and his Party are against rural water supplies.  This has not been made very clear by them up to the moment and in fact if that is the intention of Deputy Dillon, I do not believe the majority of his Party are behind him.  I believe that all Parties in this House are now very definitely interested in providing piped water to the residents of rural Ireland, not only to improve their living conditions but also as an aid in improving their economics, to help them to increase production on their farms and farmyards, to assist them in producing better, healthier livestock through an adequate supply of pure water.</P>

No attempts to confuse the issue, as Deputy Dillon endeavoured to do here by making statements for which there is no basis, in fact, can stop the people of rural Ireland being supplied with decent water supplies.  If people demand services in democracies such as ours, so surely will they get these services in due course.</P>
      <P>There should not at this stage be any question or doubt in the mind of Deputy Dillon or in the mind of any other member of this House as to what the approach of the Government is in this matter.  It is threefold, a combination of regional schemes, group schemes and private installations. There is no over-emphasis on any one type as against another.  They all can play a very useful part in the overall supply of water in the years ahead and to go out on a limb and say that one particular type of scheme can solve the entire problem of rural water supplies is to talk a lot of nonsense, and those who said so must realise they are talking nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, to suggest that I as Minister for Local Government have put myself out on a limb and <Col N="67" /> that I am advocating, regardless of cost, the extension of regional schemes and piped lines along every road in the country, is utter nonsense.  I can only guess what the motives behind these statements are but I shall not weary the House giving my interpretation of what underlies such statements, which are only confusing the people in the country who desire the services, who need them and who ultimately will get them.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate that our approach is a three-pronged attack, in combination with the local authorities, in each region throughout the country.  It is therefore necessary, lest there still might remain any confusion in the minds of any persons concerned in this matter, that the local authorities are the unifying influence and in order to be in a position to give their assistance and direction where they will serve the best purpose, it has been necessary for them as a first step to make a complete survey of their functional areas to find out their sources of supply, where the population is located and in what numbers, how gravity-fed regional schemes would suit and whether they would be economical.  It is only when they have done that that they will be in a position to indicate to certain areas that a public scheme will not come their way and it is at that stage that our local authority members and other public spirited people can advocate and encourage alternative methods of providing water that would not otherwise be available to them because of costs or other technical reasons.  Even in cases where regional schemes or group schemes are not applicable, there will be, as instanced by a number of Deputies, individual cases where neither group nor regional scheme can economically serve and in those cases, there is provision for individual installations which are catered for jointly by grants from the Exchequer and supplementary local authority grants.</P>
    <P>That is our approach, the only sane approach to this very big problem, to a very necessary and desirable undertaking to provide piped water for the <Col N="68" /> greatest possible number of people in the shortest possible time.  It is estimated that from 1959, when I introduced the new and improved grants for water schemes of all types, about £24,000,000 will fall to be spent in the ten-year period.  If we compare that figure, all of which will be directed to serve people in county health districts who at the moment have no supplies available to them, public or private, with what was provided in the past from 1925 onwards, we will find that in money values of today, we would have a figure of £8,000,000 spread over these past 35 years which either has been paid or is now being paid by county health district ratepayers who themselves in most cases have derived no benefit whatsoever.</P>
    <P>We are asking that the people today, no matter where they may live, should, through some one or other of the three schemes in operation at present, be given the benefit of a piped water supply.  They will be asked to pay their share by way of rates but a lesser share than they have ever been called upon to pay in the past in respect of any schemes prior to 1959.  The vast majority of our county health district people have been paying substantial money in their rates during the years for schemes given to towns which were unincorporated&mdash;towns which were part of the county health district.  They have been getting water schemes over the years and quite a considerable amount of money has been spent on them and nobody has cried &ldquo;halt&rdquo; in that matter.  What we should recall is that the other residents in the rural parts of these county health districts in which these unincorporated towns are located have, in fact, been contributing towards a supply of water to these towns and getting no benefit themselves.</P>
    <P>It seems near-madness to me when I hear people saying that the ratepayers in rural Ireland should not be called upon to pay, and will not face up to paying, for water for themselves, when, in fact, they have been paying for water for others for generations.  There was never a word or a voice raised against that procedure.  We should all get on to this matter together and stop trying to confuse the issue and <Col N="69" /> recognise what I have already said, that piped water will come to rural Ireland, whether the members of this House will it or not.  It is not a matter that our people are going to do without forever.  They have done without it long enough and have paid for others at the same time.  The time has arrived when that position is changing and nothing that anybody can say to confuse the issue will stop the progress now being made.  They can, by their confusing talk, make it more difficult for proper schemes to be planned and inaugurated in these districts throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would ask for the co-operation of all the members of this House and of the local authorities who are already co-operating to get on with the very vital job of providing a piped water supply for our people, in whatever form may be best suited and most economic.  In those circumstances, let us lay to rest these confusing statements which can do no good but can only retard and slow down the progress that can be made in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>A number of small matters were raised in relation to this water supply programme by Deputy McQuillan and others.  One comes to my mind immediately. Deputy McQuillan referred to the lack of liaison between local authorities and individuals who are interested either in organised group schemes or, indeed, who know what is available to them by way of individual schemes.  I should like to point out that as long ago as March, 1961, I indicated by way of circular, which referred to many other matters on this whole question, to local authorities that they should then appoint special liaison officers&mdash;and many of them have done so since&mdash;to deal with this very matter.  If Deputy McQuillan's experience in his county is that such is not the case, then I suggest to him he should take the matter up with his local authority.  He has the backing of myself and the Department in our advocacy of this very system.  If we are to get the best and most economic use of whatever money we spend on these various schemes, I believe it is essential that we should have proper <Col N="70" /> liaison between the local authorities and the people in their areas.</P>
    <P>Then there was an argument put up by another Deputy&mdash;Deputy Hogan&mdash; that there will be certain people in the country who will never get a water supply.  Quite candidly, there may be some in the country who may never avail of a water supply but I cannot conceive of anyone in this country in such a position, due to the topography of the country, as never to get a supply.</P>
    <P>The Deputy went on to elaborate on that argument, using the argument as a fact, which I do not think it is, that such people then would be expected to pay for the water supply of the others who would get the supply.  He reckoned that the numbers of these people would run to about 15 per cent. of the rural population and that, therefore, it would be completely unfair that 15 per cent of the population, who he alleges cannot ever have the water supply, should continue to pay by way of rate charges and otherwise for the benefits accruing to the 85 per cent. who he agrees will get a water supply.  These people in these isolated areas can avail, and many of them have availed and are availing, of the private grants from my Department and the local authorities. What Deputy Hogan and others should take to heart is that the moneys have been supplied from the Exchequer and from the rates.  Therefore, if there are these individual isolated cases, as there must be, they are not, in fact, paying for a water supply for others and getting no benefit themselves.</P>
    <P>They have grants available to them. They are subscribed by the rates and the central Exchequer just as all the moneys which go to other schemes are supplied.  They are participating and will participate in the benefits on an individual basis made possible for them by grants from the central authority and the local rates, just as a regional scheme would be supplied by way of subsidy from the Government and contributions from the rates or a group scheme on the basis of a number coming together and getting in bulk the grants I mentioned.  It is quite a fallacy, therefore, to talk about this position arising, of 15 per cent. of our people being driven into that situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="71" /> Whilst on this subject, there is no harm in pointing out that there are other services, indeed, where it is true that people contribute substantially who cannot ever and will never get any benefit whatsoever from those schemes. Take, for instance, the case of the farming community&mdash;the over £50 valuation people.  They contribute, for instance, to the health charges in a county.  Yet they themselves must provide their own health services and pay for them.  Those same people and many others, not quite as well off, possibly, as the £50 valuation people, contribute towards the cost of providing houses for the less well-off in the community.  Yet those people, when they want a house, must build their own house.  Nobody objected to that. In fact, it is commonly and fully acknowledged by all that this is a principle which is good in itself and the end product is necessary to the general wellbeing of our community.</P>
    <P>Therefore if there should be any basis&mdash;even one per cent, never mind 15 per cent&mdash;for Deputy Hogan's argument, there are parallels right through our entire local services where this has been and is being done at the moment and nobody has really objected in principle.  So why make a song and dance about this alleged situation which may never happen?  It may happen but it need not happen. There will be facilities available for everybody to participate in these rural-water supplies, whether on an individual, a group or a regional basis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned a reduction in the size of pipes installed some years ago in his constituency.  The reduction in size, which, he says, was insisted upon by the Department of Local Government on the basis of saving £2,000 or £3,000, has now left a situation wherein, to improve that scheme and to bring it up to the size required for to-day's needs an additional cost of £33,000, is involved. I do not know about the actual figures but I do go so far as to say that I do not disagree that that may have happened in the past.</P>
    <P>In his further arguments.  Deputy <Col N="72" /> Esmonde advocated that our schemes in the future should be ambitious enough to provide for future needs and future extended needs.  With that, I fully agree.  In fact, that is the manner in which our technical people who examine plans and proposals to-day approach all schemes sent to the Department.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with Deputy Esmonde and with anybody else with a like view that a water scheme is not something you put in to-day, just for to-day's needs.  To satisfy only to-day's needs is not enough.  When we are laying down pipes at very considerable cost, it does not cost so very much more to have the pipes slightly bigger than what is immediately needed, with a view to expansion and a greater use of water in the future.  In that way, Deputy Esmonde and all members of the House may rest assured that if such were the case in the past, it will not be the case in the future.  We are taking note of the development and the expected growth in the use of water, no matter where it may be provided for, and, in making provision for it, we have regard to pipe sizes so that this type of development will not take place.</P>
    <P>Another matter quoted here by a couple of Deputies&mdash;again, Deputy Jones and Deputy Hogan from South Tipperary&mdash;was in reference to what I am alleged to have said about 2/-being the maximum amount that might fall to be met by rates in relation to water.  This figure of 2/- to which I referred was the estimated average ultimate increase on the rates.  Seventeen counties where programmes have been adopted to date bear out that the average of 2/- is not too far off the mark because that average on the programmes of the 17 counties submitted and adopted so far does work out at about 2/- in the £.</P>
    <P>It is true that Deputy Hogan's county&mdash;Tipperary&mdash;will prove to have the highest rate charge probably of all counties.  It will be higher, but I think nobody will appreciate more readily and more fully than the people of the rural parts of Tipperary that even though the impact may be high it will be well worth while because I <Col N="73" /> think no county of its size in the country has had the same difficulties about procuring water supplies as Tipperary.  It follows that no people in any county will more appreciate a water supply.  Therefore if the charge may be the highest in the country, I do not think it will be complained of quite as much as it might be in some other counties where water has not been so scarce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, as far as water supplies, anyhow, are concerned. It is a pity you have to pay for it but unfortunately where you do anything, it has to be paid for.</P>
      <P>We had quite a number of Deputies talking about swimming pools.  I was urged by Deputy P.J. Burke from County Dublin to avoid the hole-in-the-ground type of swimming pool&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be of much use to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which cannot properly be heated and which people cannot avail of every day in the year. Deputy P.J. Burke went on to say that unless the water can be heated, swimming pools are not of much use to us. I am inclined to agree strongly with the Deputy that the hole-in-the-ground job is not really of great value in this country where our climate is such that the unheated, uncovered pool&mdash;particularly if it uses fresh water&mdash;is not likely to attract many people for many days in the year altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are providing money and spending money in fairly substantial amounts, we should think twice before we provide an uncovered, unheated pool and rather give thought to providing a pool which, though much more costly, is in the long run likely to be of greater value to us in that it can be used, heated and covered all the year round.  This would be very true, I think, in relation to the larger built-up areas such as Dublin city.  In that regard, I should mention, despite many expressions of hope, sympathy and what-not on my behalf, to the people in Dublin and elsewhere in <Col N="74" /> these built-up areas, particularly Dublin, that not much progress is yet to be seen by way of the provision of pools. I would ask them to redouble their efforts to try to make some real headway in this matter.  Such headway is lacking in this city of Dublin where I think there is a large public demand that pools should be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to that large public demand, the council and the people responsible can be sure that if they tackle the problem, they will have the majority of the residents and citizens of Dublin behind them in the matter, even though, again, it will cost the people money to do so but it is worthwhile.  In so far as my Department is concerned, not only in relation to Dublin but in relation to all other towns and districts which wish to go ahead with the building of swimming pools, proposals will be very welcome.  The people concerned will be given every co-operation, not to mention fairly substantial help by way of subsidy from the Department and from the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask all to redouble their efforts and to give us greater progress than we have so far attained. At the same time, I think I should say, in fairness to those towns in the country which have proposals with us &mdash;and some have not only made the proposals but have now started the construction of swimming pools, or have converted them&mdash;that we appreciate their efforts in that regard.  The money they have spent on their swimming pools in these provincial towns is very well spent and in various ways will give a very good return in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which was talked about at some length was the provision of housing for the elderly.  A very impassioned plea was made by the Leader of the Opposition to do something about this.  First of all, what we have done may not yet be very evident. At least, I can say we have endeavoured to have something done about this matter in a very specific way.  In our last Housing Act, we incorporated new provisions making <Col N="75" /> available for the first time special grants, not only to local authorities but to any recognised or approved charitable or philanthropic organisation desiring to provide dwellings for elderly people.  In each case, those grants will run to approximately £300, which may be matched by another £300 from the local authority.  To obtain these grants, it is not necessary to build new dwellings for the elderly, but, as the Act says, merely to &ldquo;provide&rdquo; them.  This means that any suitable building can be taken over by, or even donated to, a local charitable organisation; and if dwellings can be provided for the elderly by the reconstruction or repair of such buildings, grants will be available from the Department and will, I am sure, be matched by grants from the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We are looking to the various organisations throughout the country to formulate proposals for either the acquisition of existing buildings or the provision of new buildings.  Such proposals will be welcomed wholeheartedly by my Department and, I am sure, by local authorities.  In fact, I avail of this opportunity to appeal to these organisations, which have done such good work over the years, to turn their minds to this problem, now that financial assistance is available to them by way of grant for the first time.  If they wish to approach my Department for clarification of what they can get and how they can get it, they will be met with open arms.</P>
    <P>This is a growing problem, a problem which will not lessen in the future. Life expectancy is lengthening and, as a result, this problem must grow.  Up to the present, we have not been doing a great deal about it.  In many of our local authority housing schemes, we have reserved a few houses for the elderly, but the number it has been possible to provide in this way has been too small.  If we could get the co-operation of these organisations, not only could they make a very great impression on the problem but, by their very nature, they would be the people best suited to provide for the needs of our elderly people.  Therefore, <Col N="76" /> I should like to see more of them coming along.  They can be assured of every assistance from both my Department and the local authorities.  It is true that houses for the elderly were recently built in this city and that grants were made available by my Department.  We are hoping that more houses will be built by the same people.  Good though the effort is, it is but a small part of the effort required to solve the problem of providing an increasing number of dwellings for our elderly people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jones mentioned the question of the fire survey.  He noted that I was awaiting the report of the Commission set up in 1960.  He said I informed him in March of this year that the report would not be available until later in the year.  He rightly assumed from my previous references in this debate that the report is not yet available.  My information is that it will be available early in the new year.  In other words, I hope to have it within the present financial year.</P>
    <P>Loughshinny was mentioned several times because of its lack of sanitation of any kind.  The question was also asked when the North Dublin regional water supply scheme would come into operation.  On the question of the availability of that water supply hinges the solution of the problem in Loughshinny and other adjoining areas.  Unfortunately, I cannot give the House any specific assurance in regard to it. The present forecast, based on the knowledge available to us, is that it is possible the scheme will be in operation within the next two and a half years.  That is as far as I can go and that is purely a forecast which I cannot stand over as a definite promise. It is true the county council at present are considering the possibility, purely as an emergency interim measure, of providing sea water for the time being for sanitary purposes.  If that comes about, it would be at least of some help during the interval between now and the coming into operation of the complete water supply scheme.</P>
    <P>Another matter referred to was this practice of ripping up streets and roadways to connect them with water and sewerage after they had been laid and <Col N="77" /> after the houses had been built.  The particular complaint was made that this was done even in the case of houses where water was available at the time of building and was installed in the houses but where no sewerage scheme was available in the area. Since the inauguration of our new subsidy arrangements in 1959, we have encouraged local authorities, where both services are ultimately to be provided, to try to provide the two simultaneously and thus avoid this double work and double disturbance brought about by laying streets one day and ripping them up again the next.  I hope that procedure will be adopted and that we will not have too much of that kind of complaint in the future.</P>
    <P>The question of the National Building Agency and its operations was also raised during the course of the debate. As the House is aware, the Agency has been in operation 15 months or thereabouts.  Its real purpose is to try to fill a gap which existed up to its establishment, a gap in the supply of houses here and there throughout the country.  It is a fact well known to members of the House that local authorities can only provide houses to fill the need that exists.  In order to facilitate our industrial drive, it was felt that a need existed for some method of providing houses in anticipation of an influx of workers into an area on the establishment there of a new industry.  The Agency fills that role.  It goes a little further in that it also builds for Government Departments. At the moment it is building for the Garda.  Quite a considerable number of houses are programmed over the next five years for the Department of Justice to house Gardaí in various parts of the country.  The number of houses provided so far for industrial workers is 39.  A further 50 are about to be commenced.  So far as the Garda are concerned, tenders have been accepted for some 90 houses.  The number is likely to grow.</P>
    <P>As everybody is aware, the earlier effort of the Agency was directed to the procuring of sites.  That problem has now been resolved and a steady flow of building by the Agency for the Garda will be possible from now on. <Col N="78" /> I have no doubt the Agency will fill an important role in providing houses for the Garda and for any other categories of workers throughout the country, if they are approached by the Departments concerned.  The Agency is available to any industrialist who wishes to avail of its services.  Subject to certain conditions, industrialists can be assured that the Agency will provide houses for their workers.  In that way, industry will be facilitated.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st March, 1963, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice including certain other services administered by that Office. </P>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and if it is agreeable to the House, to follow the practice of previous years and to deal with, as a group, the Votes for which the Minister for Justice is responsible, namely, Nos. 23 to 28, so that there may be one general discussion, without, of course, prejudicing the right of any Deputy to raise any particular point on a particular Vote.</P>
      <P>The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £7,461,400, an increase of £685,590 over the amount estimated for the year 1961-62, though it will be remembered that a Supplementary Estimate of £70,000 was necessary under the Garda Vote for that year.  The increase in the overall Estimate is due almost entirely to salary increases in the Garda Síochána and the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I go into detail on Vote 23 for the Office of the Minister for Justice, I should like to recall the fact that for the first half of the last financial year&mdash;from 1st April to October 11th&mdash;my predecessor, Mr. Oscar Traynor, was in charge of the <Col N="80" /> Department of Justice.  I know that I am expressing the opinion of all sides of the House in wishing him many years of happiness and prosperity in his retirement.</P>
    <P>The secretariat of the Office of the Minister for Justice is not a very large one, nor is the cost very substantial, but I hope to be able to persuade the House that during the year under review, the taxpayer was given good value for his money.</P>
    <P>My Department is responsible for the conditions under which the courts function and for providing the staff and other facilities necessary; the innumerable questions of pay, pension and conditions of service for our police force of about 6,500 members, the investigation of complaints and the issue of comprehensive instructions in relation to their functions.  There are administrative duties in connection with the functioning of the prisons, the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, and there is quite a lot to be done in connection with the interpretation and enforcement of a large number of Statutes connected with the control of aliens and the granting of citizenship, the control of firearms and explosives, the control of betting and gaming, censorship of books and films, adoption of children, the operation of the licensing laws and so on and so on.</P>
    <P>In the international field, my Department engages in the study of a multiplicity of international conventions and agreements such as, for example, the European Convention on Human Rights and a number of others dealing with consular rights, multiple nationality, inter-country adoption and the reciprocal treatment of nationals in countries which are Member states of the Council of Europe.  Then there are quite a number of documents of the United Nations Organisation with which we are concerned, such as, for example, the Draft Declaration on Freedom of Information, the Draft Declaration on the Right of Asylum, the Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons; and, of course, many Articles of the Treaty of Rome are of fundamental concern to us.</P>
    <P>When I first came to the Department, I came to the conclusion that it <Col N="81" /> was very much understaffed and I found that the secretariat was able to carry on the day-to-day administration only with great difficulty and by working long hours.  I found also that many worthwhile and desirable things could not be undertaken because of lack of resources.  I wanted to see, for example, a programme of law reform on a wide scale, a re-examination of our penal system with emphasis on the causes and possible cures of juvenile delinquency, an examination of our probation system, a greatly accelerated programme of building of new houses and stations for the Garda Síochána, the provision of legal aid for poor persons in criminal cases and whether the costs of litigation could be substantially reduced.</P>
    <P>It was obvious, therefore, that steps had to be taken to put the staff on a proper footing to do all that was required, that is, to keep the day-to-day administration functioning smoothly and, in addition, to initiate and systematically operate entirely new programmes in various fields.  I have mentioned, at random, some of the matters which explain why the strength of the secretariat has been increased &mdash;and is still being increased&mdash;to enable it to complete what I consider is an essential, long-term programme for the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the programme of law reform envisaged for the next few years was set out comprehensively in a White Paper published last January.  The aim of that programme is to provide our people with a suitable, adequate and modern system of law.  In particular, it is intended that all our Statute Law will be contained in Acts of the Oireachtas. The implementation of this programme is being pursued steadily and systematically.  The formulation of legislative proposals is proceeding apace and in other fields the ground is being cleared for future action by the establishment of various committees and commissions of inquiry.</P>
    <P>In the year under review, the following Statutes promoted by my Department were passed by the Oireachtas: the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961; the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, <Col N="82" /> 1961; the Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961; the Juries Act; the Charities Act; the Defamation Act; and the Civil Liability Act, all of 1961.</P>
    <P>During the year also, the following Bills, which have since been enacted, were promoted:</P>
    <P>The Short Titles Bill; the Coroners Consolidation Bill; the Legal Aid Bill; the Street Collections Bill; and the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  Work was continued on the following measures:</P>
    <P>Official Secrets Bill; Statute Law Revision Bill; Registration of Titles Bill; Hotel Proprietors Bill; Malicious Injuries Bill; Extradition Bill; the Guardianship of Infants Bill and the Pawnbrokers Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition, several Statutory Instruments were either made or were in the course of preparation.  A committee of inquiry, under the chairmanship of a judge of the Supreme Court, has been established to inquire into the operation of the courts with a view, <i>inter alia</i>, to seeing whether the costs of litigation can be reduced, whether the convenience of the public and the efficient despatch of civil and criminal business can be secured by amending the law in relation to the jurisdiction of the various courts.  This committee will examine whether the existing system of jury trials in civil actions and the system of taking depositions in the preliminary investigation of indictable offences should be abolished or modified.  The system of law reporting in the Supreme and High Courts as well as the question of supplying copies of the judgments of these courts at lower costs than at present, have been under review.</P>
    <P>A commission has been established to inquire into ground rents, as well as a committee to examine the law as to bankruptcy.  An interdepartmental committee appointed by my predecessor to examine the law relating to compensation for malicious injuries are now engaged in the preparation of their report which I expect to receive before the end of November.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Turning to what I might describe as the ordinary day-to-day administration of my Department, I think that the financial year 1961-62 under review has been fruitful.  The most important single achievement, from the point of view of law and order, was the ending of the futile, unlawful campaign of violence on the Border which had lasted since December 1956 and I would be very remiss if I did not say a very special word of thanks to the officers and men of the Garda Síochána in that connection.  They carried out their onerous and exacting duties throughout this very difficult situation in an efficient, responsible and objective manner befitting the best traditions of the Force.</P>
    <P>Last November, the Government took steps to have persons who were charged with offences against the State tried by a Special Criminal Court instead of by the ordinary criminal courts and in the next three months 31 persons were sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  Early in February, I offered an arms amnesty, with good results.  Later that month, the Border campaign terminated.  In March, the Government made an Order foregoing the powers of detention exercisable under the Offences against the State Act, 1940 and later that month all the prisoners in custody for offences against the State were released.  Furthermore, in regard to these prisoners the Government remitted all the forfeitures and disqualifications which they had incurred automatically on conviction.  Last month, the Government, being satisfied that the ordinary courts were adequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of peace and order, made a proclamation declaring that Part V of the Offences against the State Act, 1939 is no longer in force and, as a consequence, the Special Criminal Court ceased to exist.</P>
    <P>These decisions reflect the Government's hope and belief that we have, at long last, seen the end of this sorry chapter of our country's history.  I know that it is the wish of every right-thinking person that we are finished, finally, with this kind of unlawful <Col N="84" /> activity and that all those who have supported it will realise that they have been out of touch with the realities of our time.  At the same time, I think it well to stress that the Government are determined not to permit any sort of illegal activity of this nature and, should the need arise, would again take whatever measures are necessary for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board is continuing to handle a steady stream of applications for adoption orders.  The number of Orders made in 1961 was 547, of which 255 were in respect of boys and 292 in respect of girls.  Two hundred and sixty-eight orders were made in favour of adopters living in Dublin.  I cannot speak too highly of the voluntary services of the members of this Board who have to devote a great deal of time to their duties.  In order to facilitate adoption, the Board have made visits to Cork, Limerick, Sligo, Waterford and Wexford and, indeed, I am sure that they would be prepared to travel to any place where a group of adoption cases awaited hearing.  If I mention, in particular, the names of the outgoing Chairman, District Justice O'Donoghue and Mr. William Fallon, I do so because I regretfully received their resignations during the year, they having served on the Board from its inception nine years ago.  We are all greatly indebted to them for their public service.  In this connection, I should like to mention also the very fine work which is being done by the adoption societies.  Any member of the public who has any problem in regard to adoption should get in touch with one of these societies or directly with the Board.</P>
    <P>During the year, there were 3,140 aliens who resided in the country for periods of three months or more.  The corresponding figure for 1960 was 2,849.  The largest numbers came from Germany, Italy, Holland, America and Spain, in that order.  Over 43,000 aliens were allowed to land from abroad during the year as compared with slightly under 40,000 in the previous year. This figure does not include those who came through Britain who are estimated at another 20,000.  This country and Britain exercise an interlocking <Col N="85" /> system of control over aliens coming from abroad.  Following on the coming into operation of new British regulations last July, the Government made the necessary arrangements to preserve the existing arrangements for travel, without formality, between this country and Britain.  Fifty-six persons were naturalised as Irish citizens during the year.</P>
    <P>The Film Censor examined 1,362 films in 1961 of which, 1,117 were passed&mdash;one on appeal&mdash;and 206 were passed with cuts&mdash;two were appeals against rejection.  Thirty-nine films were rejected.  The total footage examined was over 3,700,000, which was about 7 per cent. less than in the previous year and about 2? per cent below the 1959 figure.</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board examined 631 books and 52 periodicals in 1961.  Of these, 37 books were examined as a result of formal complaints and 594 were examined on reference from the customs authorities. The Board made 408 Prohibition Orders in respect of books and 43 in respect of periodical publications. Nineteen of the books had been the subject of Prohibition Orders in earlier years but, for technical reasons, it was necessary to make repeat Orders in respect of them.  There were ten appeals in respect of books and two were allowed and there were six appeals in respect of periodical publications, one of which was allowed.</P>
    <P>Criticisms are made from time to time of our system of censorship, and the manner in which it is operated.  I do not think, however, that any responsible person, no matter how liberal-minded he may be, can deny that the world to-day is being inundated with a great tide of pornographic publications and indecent films.  No Irish Government could, in conscience, ignore the effects the dissemination of such material in a widespread way must have on the minds, morals and general welfare of our people.  The argument for some form of censorship is, in my opinion, unanswerable, though there may be some scope for honest disagreement on the form it should take.</P>
    <P>There are some aspects of the <Col N="86" /> present system which are often overlooked. To those who argue that the present system, on occasions, denies them the right of access to works of scientific or literary merit, I must point out that the Acts provide for the issue of permits by the Minister for Justice in appropriate cases.  On the other hand, it is suggested that the Censorship Board ought to make many more Prohibition Orders or, alternatively, that the present system should be abandoned for a policy of prosecution against persons selling, or exposing for sale or distribution, unsavoury publications.</P>
    <P>In this connection, it is relevant to point out that the Censorship Board have a statutory obligation to examine any complaint made to them in the prescribed manner in regard to any book or periodical.  Out of 631 books, however, examined by the Board in 1961, only 37 were submitted by members of the general public.  Furthermore, our common law provides that a charge can be brought for the publication&mdash;which includes sale&mdash;of an obscene book and the exercise of this right is not confined to the police. Any person may lay an information in the district court.  The offence, which is an indictable one, may be disposed of summarily if the accused pleads guilty and if the Attorney General does not object, or may be tried on indictment at the suit of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to this problem of obscene and indecent publications. Nothing is perfect in an imperfect world, but, generally speaking, it can be argued that the Censorship Acts provide an adequate instrument for dealing with indecent publications. I think the very existence of the Board is, in itself, a protection from the worst efforts of the entrepreneurs in pornography.  Parents and teachers can, of course, do a very great deal by supervising the reading of young people and developing in them a taste for good literature.  Librarians, and those engaged in the trade, can also help.  While there is no final solution, I think that if the legal safeguards provided by the State are backed by a full acceptance of their responsibilities by parents and others, we can <Col N="87" /> obviate a great part of the danger and do a great deal to preserve our traditional standards and values.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na Mire Gaile considered 33 cases during the year and awarded 41 certificates of bravery.  The Garda Síochána were not found wanting when the occasion demanded and I had the very great pleasure of presenting the Scott award to five members of the Force for acts of bravery during the year.</P>
    <P>The Public Record Office provides a very useful public service in making material of historical importance available to scholars and the general public.  The fifth and final volume of the new, and it is to be hoped, definitive edition of the early Irish Statutes is due to appear shortly and work is going on in the preparation, for publication, of the Justiciary Roll for the years 1312 and 1313.  I feel sure that it will please many of our medieval scholars to have this document available.  The question of providing an extension of the Office for long-term storage purposes is still under consideration.</P>
    <P>The Vote for the Office of the Minister for Justice has a new provision of £3,475 in Subhead D for the preparation and publication of legal text books.  This money will be used to subsidise the preparation and publication of text books under the auspices of the Incorporated Council for Law Reporting of Ireland, and repayments to the Exchequer will be made from the proceeds of sales.  The amount in this year's Estimate has been fixed in consultation with the Council by reference to some books which are already in preparation and which it is hoped will prove of real value to students and practitioners.  The need for text books of our own has been painfully evident for some time and I hope that this financial help which I am providing will go some distance towards meeting the immediate problem.</P>
    <P>I now pass on to the next Vote No. 24, that for the Garda Síochána. The estimated expenditure £6,459,290 is £478,970 up on the total Estimate for last year, that is, including a <Col N="88" /> Supplementary Estimate of £70,000 approved in March last.  By far the biggest increase is to be found in those subheads dealing with salaries and pensions.  The estimate in respect of these subheads for the current year is £326,000 more than the original estimate and the supplementary estimate for last year.  The main reason for the increase is that provision has to be made for the payment during the full 12 months period of the substantial increases operative from 1st November, 1961.  The only other increase of any significance is to be found in Subhead H and is due to the purchase of additional transport and the replacement of existing vehicles in the Garda transport fleet.</P>
    <P>I am glad to pay tribute to all ranks of the Force for the manner in which they worked to maintain peace and order throughout the country.  We can never be complacent about crime but I think that there can be no doubt that the position in this country is relatively better than in any country that we know of.  That is in great measure, due to the zeal and efficiency of the Force and I am glad to say that the Commissioner has assured me that the young men who are being recruited to-day are as keen in the performance of their duties as their more experienced colleagues who have given the country a reputation of having a police force second-to-none in the world.</P>
    <P>The events which took place last November were, as Deputies will recall, the subject of a number of Parliamentary Questions and I made a full statement on the matter in the House on 15th November, 1961.  I do not therefore propose to refer to it again at this stage, except in one particular respect.  It became clear that the principal cause of discontent was the manner in which the representational machinery available to members of the Force had functioned, or rather failed to function, over the years.  The Representative Body Regulations, made in 1926, were somewhat out-of-date, and some of the facilities provided in them had been allowed to fall into disuse, with the result that there was a serious lack of communication between members and those representing <Col N="89" /> them.  I arranged for the preparation of a new set of Representative Body Regulations, which would give individual members the greatest possible say in matters affecting their welfare, and I had personal consultations with representatives of the Gardaí before the making of the new Regulations.</P>
    <P>The Representative Body Regulations made last April provide for three separate bodies to represent (1) chief superintendents and superintendents, (2) inspectors, station sergeants and sergeants, and (3) Gardaí.  The regulations provide that, normally, each group will sit separately.  Provision is made, however, whereby the bodies may sit jointly for special purposes where arrangements in that regard have been made formally in advance. In addition to their Representative Bodies, the three groups I have mentioned have district committees, divisional committees and area committees to represent them at local level. Elections are by secret ballot.</P>
    <P>The Representative Bodies will hold office for three years, they will meet at least twice a year and at such other times as the Commissioner may request or approve.  In addition, the district committees, the divisional committees and the area committees will meet twice a year, and will be free, if they so wish, to admit ordinary members of the Force to all or portion of their meetings.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the election by the Representative Body for Guards of an executive committee to deal with the work of their Representative Body between meetings.  The Guards have the whole-time services of a Garda as their secretary.  There is also provision, subject to the Commissioner's approval, for the engagement by the Representative Bodies, of an outside consultant to advise them on such matters as pay claims.</P>
    <P>I should like to remove a misconception that has been widespread, apparently, throughout the Force in connection with the proceedings under the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme.  There is nothing to prevent any of the Representative Bodies from consulting, in advance, all their members, <Col N="90" /> if they so wish, as to the nature of a claim to be brought under the Scheme, that is as to the amount of salary to be claimed or as to the arguments to be advanced in support of a claim.  Similarly, there has been agreement since the first meeting of the Conciliation Council held in June, 1959, that the Garda Side is free to consult the Representative Body as to whether or not a particular offer should be accepted.  Meetings of the Conciliation Council can be adjourned for the purpose of such consultation subject, of course, to the preservation of the confidential nature of any offer made under the Scheme.</P>
    <P>The practice up to now has been for the Joint Representative Body to nominate a composite group to negotiate their claims but as far as the State is concerned there is no reason why, at conciliation and arbitration proceedings, the case for Guards cannot be argued entirely by Guards, the case for NCO's by NCO's and the case for officers by officers.  The provisions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme have been amended to make it clear that each body can negotiate its own case.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this matter, I should like to reiterate that if it should appear at any time that the new machinery can or should be improved in any way I shall not hesitate to do whatever may be required in this regard.  I should like also at this stage to pay a sincere tribute and to express my personal thanks to the members of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee, which I set up to assist and advise in the establishment of the new machinery, for the wonderful work they did.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies will, I am sure, have noticed that the Force has recently been making great efforts to revive sport and athletics in the ranks. This is something which I am very happy to see and I have told the Commissioner that the Force has my full support in these efforts.  A central committee, known as Coiste Siamsa, and comprising representatives of all the different sports, has been established under the chairmanship of a senior headquarters officer.  I think it would be a very good thing if every young Garda were to take part in <Col N="91" /> some sport.  This can have very beneficial results, not only for the individual Garda himself but also for the prestige and morale of the Force as a whole.  As I have said before, there is no better way for the members of the Force to win the respect and admiration of our young people than by excelling in sport.  In particular, it is highly desirable that each individual member of the Garda should become proficient in swimming and life-saving and very real progress is, I understand, being made in this regard.</P>
    <P>I am assured that the morale of the Force generally is very high, that discipline is excellent and that a very good spirit prevails at all levels.  It is only to be expected that in a Force of a about six and a half thousand men there will be a certain amount of dissatisfaction from time to time.  I regard it as my responsibility to see to it that there should not be any dissatisfaction on a large scale and that everything possible should be done to remove any reasonable grounds for dissatisfaction.  In this connection the low figures for resignations from the Force are reassuring.  In 1961, a total of 44 members resigned for reasons other than going out on pension, a very small figure indeed for a Force of that size.  To take similar figures for previous years at random: 64 members resigned in 1956 and 43 in 1955.</P>
    <P>The Force argued for years that pay should be settled through conciliation and arbitration machinery and this is now the position.  Through the conciliation and arbitration machinery, the Gardaí have negotiated three settlements: at arbitration in April, 1960, they received an increase of over £500,000 per annum; in December, 1960, at conciliation, they negotiated the conversion of rent allowance into pensionable pay with an increase of over £150,000 per annum; and in October, 1961, they negotiated a pay settlement with an increase of about £400,000 per annum. On the last occasion in October, 1961, the Garda side recorded &ldquo;their appreciation of the courteous and helpful manner in which their claims had been <Col N="92" /> dealt with by the official side&rdquo;.  I mention this matter to dispel any idea, that anyone may have, that the negotiations have not been conducted in a fair and just manner.</P>
    <P>In January, 1962, the Garda side lodged a new claim for pay which, if conceded, would cost the State a further sum of the order of £750,000 per annum in pay and pension.  The claim was discussed at conciliation level and was subsequently submitted by the Garda Side for reference to arbitration. Later the Representative Bodies requested the withdrawal of the claim and stated that they intended to submit separate claims.  The first of these claims&mdash;from the Officers Representative Body&mdash;was received towards the end of September last and is being dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>During 1961, the total wastage from the Force was 374, which included 269 retirements on pension and 40 deaths. In the same period, 400 recruits were taken on.  At the start of the present financial year, the total wastage was estimated at 373 and provision was made for an intake of 400 recruits, including 12 women.  Not all of these recruits are being taken on, however, as in the meanwhile Gardaí who had been doing special duty near the Border have been reassigned to their permanent stations.</P>
    <P>The policy of motorising the Force continues and it is proposed to acquire this year about 50 new motor cycles for use in country sub-districts.  The Garda Force will then be equipped for crime and road traffic duties with over 200 cars and 150 motor cycles. Simultaneously, the policy of closing down stations or reducing the station strengths in those cases where, by reason of the absence of crime, the sparsity of population, etc., such reductions can be made without detriment to police efficiency is being continued.  I am fully aware of the value of the man on the beat in the cities, and of the man on the bicycle in rural areas, but there is no point in locating members of the force in areas where they have practically nothing to do and where their living quarters may not be very good when their services are badly needed elsewhere.  Where I <Col N="93" /> am satisfied that economy and efficiency are served by closing or reducing a station, I feel that I have no option but to do so.  In the past financial year, three stations were closed and eight reduced to one-man units.</P>
    <P>With an increased use of the radio communications system, telephones and the use of motors and motorcycles, I anticipate that the policing of the State may be able to be carried out in a few years' time with some reduction in man-power without any reduction of efficiency.  The present strength of six and a half thousand police in over 700 stations does seem to leave a margin for compression but I propose to hasten slowly before making any radical changes.</P>
    <P>The provision of suitable, adequate accommodation is a matter which has a vitally important bearing on the welfare of the Force and I am glad to say that we are making very real progress in this regard.  At the moment work is in progress on the erection of 16 stations outside Dublin; work on a further 10 is expected to start before the end of the present financial year: in Dublin the reconstruction of the Bridewell has been completed and a new station at Cabra, which is in course of erection, is expected to be completed by next June.  In addition sites have been acquired at Rathmines, Crumlin and Raheny, and have either been acquired or are in course of negotiation for 60 or 70 country stations.  Each new country station will have attached one or two sets of married quarters and my target is about 230 such stations in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the erection of station units will go the building of houses for Gardaí and their families and the National Building Agency has begun to implement an ambitious programme of such building.  The Agency has inspected and has acquired&mdash;or is in course of acquiring&mdash;sites for 300 houses.  Tenders have been accepted for 76 houses and work on about 30 is in progress.  It is expected that by Christmas contracts will have been placed for over 100 houses.  Work on the erection of a new Garda training <Col N="94" /> depot at Templemore began in June, 1961, and it is hoped that the building will be ready for occupation before this time next year.  I should say here, by way of explanation, that the Estimate for the cost of the erection and repair of Garda stations is to be found in the Vote for the Office of Public Works, which, this year, has provision for the building of 29 new Garda station units.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say something on the general subject of crime.  The report of the Commissioner, Garda Síochána, on crime for the year ended September 30th, 1961, which, for convenience, I shall call 1961, shows that the overall figure for indictable or serious crime fell to 14,818, as compared with 15,375 in the previous year, and represents a drop of 17 per cent, on the very high figure of 17,865 for 1959.  On closer inspection of the report, however, it becomes clear that the drop was confined to the category of offences usually referred to as offences against property without violence, that is, larcenies, in the main, which fell from 11,470 to 10,623 and within that category, the decrease was attributable to a drop of almost 700 in larcenies of pedal cycles and over 200 in larcenies from unattended vehicles.</P>
    <P>There was, on the other hand, actually an increase in the number of crimes involving violence against persons and property.  Eight murders were committed during the year of which two still remain to be solved and the number of housebreakings of business premises rose by 300.  The overall detection rate was 66 per cent. and, at that was 6 per cent higher than the previous year and 16 per cent. higher than the rate in 1959.  In fact, it was the highest since 1937, and compares more than favourably with the figures for other countries.  It is interesting to note that the drop in the total number of crimes was confined to Dublin where the figure, 7,684, was 12 per cent. less than that for the previous year, which, in turn, was 22 per cent. down on the figure for 1959. The number of crimes committed in 1961 in other areas, 7,134, was actually 8 per cent. more than the figure for 1960.</P>
    <P>There is nothing disturbing in this <Col N="95" /> increase in areas outside Dublin.  The increase does not represent a crime wave in any particular area, and I have no reason to think that the increase is in any way connected either with a falling off in Garda activity or the number of Gardaí in any particular district.  In fact the number of Gardaí in Dublin city at 1,750 is a peak figure. Provisional figures for the year ended 30th September, 1962, indicate that the total of indictable crimes in that year was slightly higher than that for the previous year.  The increase is, again, confined to the areas outside Dublin where the number of known offences rose to 7,659.  The figures for Dublin rose very slightly to 7,702.</P>
    <P>I should like at this stage to refer, for purposes of allaying to some extent a certain amount of public uneasiness and disquiet which I know exists, to the manner in which some newspapers feature sensationally anything to do with crimes of violence.  In Dublin last year, the newspapers featured five cases of attacks on women and girls and four cases of assaults and robberies, none of which took place. These newspaper accounts were based on false stories by the alleged victims of incidents which when &ldquo;splashed&rdquo; by the newspapers, caused a certain amount of public alarm.  In some of these cases, the persons making the allegations were in a state of mental ill-health and in others, they were prosecuted subsequently on charges of creating a public mischief.  I know that newspapers have a very difficult problem in relation to cases of this sort and that they would not knowingly publish a misleading story.  I can only appeal to them, therefore, to treat this type of story with caution and to make every effort to check their authenticity before publication.</P>

      <P>I said on the last <Col N="96" /> occasion that I had no intention of speaking at all on this measure until I heard the Minister's statement.  I want to assure the Minister that any criticism I make will be constructive. I always like to be positive in these matters and not to adopt a negative attitude.  The Minister should bear that in mind.  The Minister said I was exaggerating and I would therefore refer to the report on Internal Transport by the Beddy Committee on page 44 of which there is a summary of the Committee's findings on CIE rail transport.  Paragraph (1) says:</P>
      <P>Since 1938 there has been a heavy fall in the number of passenger journeys but the fall has been almost entirely on the Dublin-Greystones suburban routes and has been due largely to CIE road services rather than to private car transport.</P>
      <P>That should be sufficient proof to the Minister that my statement was correct, to the effect that bus transport is in competition with rail transport.  The report says, at paragraph (4) on the same page:</P>
      <P>Relatively high rates were charged in 1925 when the railway had a virtual monopoly which is evidence that road transport competition has operated as a brake on rising rail charges.</P>
      <P>That also proves that road transport is in competition with rail services.  On the following page, the report says, at paragraph (11):</P>
      <P>Rail staffs whose remuneration accounts for the greater part of expenditure have been reduced in recent years and are now slightly below the 1938 level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we reduce the number of employed people in any area, whether it be a village or a rural area, we reduce to some extent the income from their wages to the local shopkeeper, to the church and, indirectly, to the Government through loss in direct and indirect taxation.  Men who smoke cigarettes or pipes or who drink a bottle or a pint of stout or a ball of malt pay indirect taxation to the Government.  If those people are not <Col N="97" /> employed here, it represents a loss because they emigrate and help to raise money for the Governments of other countries.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I submit that for the present, and until things improve, the railways should be regarded as a social service.  We have faith in this country.  We are a young country with only 40 years of self-government.  Even though the ancient enemy cut off our industrial potential lest we be in competition with them, we can hope to see a rising population.  The Government are bringing industries to rural areas and when they do this in more comprehensive form, our people will be able to afford a system of public transport that will pay its way.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that anything I say here is not to be taken as criticism of CIE or their Chairman.  They have a job of work to do.  I can quite understand their desire to make the railways pay before 1964.  If they find they cannot make the railways pay because of higher expenses, they have a duty to come to the Minister and to the House and inform them of the exact position before tearing up the lines, thereby injuring the country. That should be the attitude of the CIE Board.  Recently I heard a conversation between two of the plain people of Ireland.  They were discussing the railways and one said that CIE were killing the patient to cure the disease&mdash;in other words, to get rid of the losses, they were killing the railways.</P>
    <P>Mind you, quite a number of the plain people are sensible people with sensible ideas and when one hears such statements from these people, apparently there is something wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the uncongested condition of our roads and how much they were appreciated by tourists.  Naturally we want tourists, but the roads of Ireland are first for the Irish people.  We want our own people to be able to enjoy our roads. We should do anything in our power to keep our people at home, to keep them in employment, so that whatever Government are in power here will reap the benefit of their residence, through direct and indirect taxation. Accordingly, treatment of the railways as a social service is of great <Col N="98" /> importance because it will help to keep our people from emigrating.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that CIE restrict lorries as to weight and distance, if it is possible for them to do so.  I would suggest that they encourage the use of containers on railways and also that they use rail buses on sections of the railways where there is light or, perhaps, seasonal traffic.  They should also integrate the bus and railway services. If that were done, we could save a number of our railways.  The Minister referred to double handling.  I have no doubt that the Board of CIE could cut this down to a minimum.</P>
    <P>I suggest also that instead of tearing up the railways, if CIE close a line, they should leave it there for the day when it may be possible to use it again.  I would, therefore, ask that this activity be suspended for a short time. It is a very well-known fact that during the next 20 or 25 years, this part of the country will be industrialised and that will mean increased population. Therefore, I say that we ought not to tear up the railways.  It would not cost so much to keep them in an adequate state of repair, if they were not being used.  They cost millions of pounds.  Why should we destroy them? My suggestion is that the operation of the Act be suspended.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister that I am well acquainted with the Beddy Report and with the recommendations set out in paragraphs 389 to 391.  The Minister need not allege that I did not read it.  I noticed that there was to be no railway from Mallow to Waterford or from Portlaoise to Kilkenny.  I do not know so much about the latter line but it is not fair to close the railway line from Mallow to Waterford.  I suggest that this matter be left to a free vote of the House. As I said, I am not concerned because there is no railway in my area but there are quite a number of Deputies from counties where the local people do not want the railways to be done away with.  I think that in fairness to them and, indeed, to Deputies on all sides of the House, the Whip should be taken off and a free vote of the House permitted.</P>

      <P>As a Dublin Deputy who at one stage represented <Col N="99" /> Inchicore, which is a very important place so far as CIE are concerned, I feel that I should give some of the reasons why I am opposing this Bill. When I first contested a Dáil election in 1956, I made it quite clear that, in my view, the railway system was, always would be and always should be an integral part of our national transport system but I do remember that prior to that and subsequently I had been a member of the Dublin Corporation. The complaint I always heard from Dublin Deputies was, in effect, that the Dublin buses were subsidising the uneconomic rail lines.</P>
      <P>I felt quite sure that when these uneconomic and unsupported lines were being closed down&mdash;and there was no trade to justify keeping them open&mdash; all the Dublin Deputies would support this.  The terms of compensation and the efforts made to replace the men who became redundant as a result, to my mind, were adequate at least, if not generous.  We have been told that transport, being a public service, should not be a profit-making concern or even be compelled to pay its own way.  That argument has been advanced by the movers of the Bill. We hear this only, as far as I am concerned, about CIE.  It has never been very seriously argued in the case of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which is, in fact, the largest employer of all State or semi-State services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quoting. If the Deputy takes the view that CIE should pay, then there is no point in the Bill at all.  The State is responsible to a very large degree for providing national transport.  In fact, it is essential from the point of view of industry or from any other viewpoint that there should be efficient <Col N="100" /> transport services.  It is no excuse for us to say that this transport service may, if it likes, be inefficient. Any business that cannot pay its way is, to my mind, inefficient.</P>
      <P>I should like to mention one or two things which, if you like, are in conflict with some of the CIE policies but I think they will be of interest to the Minister concerned who is also interested in tourism.  I discovered this summer that there was an excursion fare from Skerries to Dublin on Thursday and Saturday at 4/8d. but if somebody, going from Dublin to Skerries on the same days, wanted to get a return ticket, it cost 6/- or 6/4d. I am not sure of the exact figure. That seems to me to be more an effort to bring the people from holiday resorts to the city rather than from the city to the holiday resort.  There was a train running from Dundalk to Dublin and another running directly from Skerries with only ten minutes between their times.  One of these trains was comparatively full and the other generally comparatively empty on the Dublin end of the journey.  If there is only to be ten minutes between them, to my mind, the train coming from Dundalk should run non-stop from the stop before Skerries and the other one should halt at all stations between Skerries and town.  We cannot discuss all these matters in detail here.  I am sure everybody has come across something like that which he might consider not to be quite right.</P>
      <P>On the general principle of CIE paying their way, I think it is an important principle that the Board should be committed to endeavour to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make just one other comment which has been put to me from outside.  It was suggested to me that opposition to this Bill might <Col N="101" /> mean that some of the pensioners who were retired at a lower rate would be less likely to get any increase.  I want to go on record as saying that these pensions, whether they are adequate or inadequate, were discussed by the trade unions representing not only the active workers but the pensioners as well. They were agreed to by the trade unions and agreed to by the employers. The Minister's function was simply to endorse that agreement.</P>
    <P>If people are dissatisfied with the rate of pension payable to them, it is a matter for them to take up, in the first instance, with their trade union. Subsequently, when agreement has been reached, it is up to the House, no doubt, to support the implementation of that agreement.  I wanted to say those few words because I felt that, as a Dublin Deputy, I should at least be consistent in the views which most Dublin representatives expressed until the debate on this Bill.</P>

      <P>Viewing the general standard of conduct of the Board of CIE in recent years, one is inclined to wonder whether they are operating from Kingsbridge or from Grangegorman because of the very high degree of lunacy associated with the general management of CIE and, further, in relation to the general standard of transport throughout the country in the matter of charges, efficiency and proper and thoroughly regulated management.  To add to the insanity, we have an admission from the Minister for Transport and Power. He has to confess to the House and to the country that he has no say in relation to the activities of the Board of CIE.  Other boards such as Board na Móna and the ESB are connected with the Minister's Department.  If the Minister has no responsibility in relation to the general Government policy which boards such as that of CIE should implement, then the money of the Irish taxpayer is being entirely wasted on the Office of the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

      <P>The Minister occupies the post of Minister for Transport and Power.  The fact is that he has no say, good, bad or indifferent, in transport policy.  One would imagine that when the Minister sits at the Cabinet table, some time, some date, there must be a discussion on the general mode of conduct of CIE and on general transport policy.  Is it the position that the Minister turns to his colleagues and says he has no function in the matter, that he leaves it all to a board of directors who have responsibility neither to this House nor to anybody else?  The activities of the Board cannot be questioned in this House.  If we address a question to the Minister about the Board we are told we cannot probe into the day-to-day administration of CIE.  That being so, the Minister must admit that he has neither the intention nor the authority to deal with the workings of CIE.</P>
      <P>This is an opportunity for the Minister to come to the House and to tell us what Government policy is in relation to transport, whether the Government mould the policy or whether it is a group occupying a room in Kingsbridge who mould transport policy and say: &ldquo;That is what the Government want: you put it into effect.&rdquo;  That point has not been made clear in this House on this debate or in any debate in relation to transport in recent years. It is time the House and, indeed, the country demanded a showdown in relation to transport policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the general taxpayers have no confidence in the present administration of CIE.  In addition, everybody knows that the people who have the least confidence in the board of CIE are the employees of CIE themselves who are in a position of non-security, who fear a loss of employment, who fear a curtailment of services.  Last, but not least, the general body of taxpayers know from experience that CIE have not been acting in a common sense manner and therefore they have no confidence in the board of CIE.  The farming community, the workers employed by CIE and the retired <Col N="103" /> pensioners of CIE have no confidence in the Board.  Then there are all those engaged in industrial development in the country who claim that CIE policy is directed entirely towards depriving rural Ireland of further industrial development.  We are all dead sick of listening to the Minister for Transport and Power and others saying that CIE are not paying their way.  How could CIE pay their way?</P>
    <P>A few moments ago a Deputy said, and very rightly so, that CIE are operating services in competition with themselves.  There is no private concern in this or any other country today and there is no group of businessmen who would tolerate for five minutes the antics and manoeuvres of the gentlemen in Kingsbridge who are laying down the general policy of CIE in relation to this country's transport. They are not businessmen.  They are far removed from business ideas and from efficiency.  They have no business training; they have no training in relation to transport.  I venture to say that if the Board of CIE were comprised of some of the brilliant and common sense old warriors of transport from the days of the GSR, and who have been connected with it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have made it absolutely clear that they are appointed by the Government, that I take full responsibility for not recommending to the Government that they be changed and for having confidence in them.  I should be obliged if Deputy O.J. Flanagan, in the interests of a tradition which has long been maintained in this House with regard to directors of State and semi-State companies, would address his abuse to me and to the Government and would refrain from attacking persons who are unable to reply for themselves here.  They are persons in whom I have confidence and whose removal could result only from a recommendation by me to the Government and which would have to relate, of course, to the statutory provisions of the Act under which they are <Col N="104" /> appointed.  I should like a specific direction from the Chair on that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may continue. The Minister has a responsibility now and the Minister's responsibility in relation to legislation and the moulding of policy is to appoint conscientiously and from his own knowledge the best types of men who can be found to manage CIE.  I want to charge the Minister that he has not done that, that he has not been moved by their ability as businessmen.  I am <Col N="105" /> accusing the Minister of being persuaded more by the political outlook of individuals than by their knowledge of transport, of business methods and the general management of an efficient transport company.</P>
      <P>On the Transport Act of 1954, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce made it clear that the birth of CIE would bring with it a period of cheap, efficient transport for our people.  He appointed the Board of CIE to give this country cheap, up-to-date and efficient transport.  He was mainly concerned in seeing that transport services were available for the public&mdash;at least, that is what we were led to believe from the speeches.  But now we have reached the stage where CIE, on the authority of the Minister for Transport and Power and with the full approval of the Government, are closing down, one might say, the entire rail system.  Having successfully abandoned the canals, sold the barges and sold the lock houses and keepers' houses, they are now concentrating their efforts on depriving the people of the services to which they are entitled &mdash;the cheap and efficient transport services promised them by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1944.</P>
      <P>We find the country is being completely stripped of its railways.  When we ask for an explanation of this, we are told it is because CIE have not paid their way.  Which is more important&mdash;a group of people presenting a favourable balance sheet or the general public enjoying the transport services to which they are entitled? Nobody is interested in figures and balance sheets because the public have been deceived by them too often.  The ordinary person is not concerned with an accumulation of figures on one side or the other.  His only concern is that he is paying taxes for the upkeep of a Minister for Transport and Power and for the upkeep of a transport company. In return, he expects efficient rail services and he expects the Government to honour the undertaking they gave in 1944.  This they have failed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stripping of the railways is an act of sabotage of national progress. It is a disgrace to strip the country <Col N="106" /> of its railways.  The Minister represents a constituency which a few years ago enjoyed first-class, efficient rail services. I challenge him to tell me in what part of Monaghan to-day there are 12 inches of railway left.</P>

      <P>If we ask for an explanation, we are told it is because CIE are not paying their way. How could CIE pay their way when we have been told, without any explanation from the Minister, that CIE were competing against themselves?  In many cases where branch lines are being closed down from 1st January next, CIE themselves are responsible for making it possible for the Minister to present a picture of a situation over which he alleges he can stand.  Here is an example.  There is a railway line between Portlaoise and Mountmellick. But CIE operated a road freight service from Portlaoise to Mountmellick in competition with it.  There is also a bus service operated by CIE between Portlaoise and Mountmellick.  You had rail, road freight and bus services, all in competition with the other.  Surely you cannot expect a railway to pay if the railway company itself is putting a lorry and a bus on the same route in order to take from the railway? Surely no sensible board of directors would suggest a branch railway is not paying when the company itself will not allow it to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a more serious matter.  CIE have refused to give to interested parties facts and figures in relation to the losses and gains on the various branch lines.  Since we have learned that the Minister for Transport and Power is responsible, I want to accuse him of endeavouring to hoodwink the people and to prevent them from having facts and figures. It is on his authority that CIE will not <Col N="107" /> release facts and figures to the public, and it is on his authority that CIE have given incorrect figures in cases in which they were asked for figures. What greater authority can we quote here than Deputy Corry, who said CIE deceived him and the people he represented and who made a charge that they had published false figures?  I did not hear the Minister get up in fury against that.</P>

      <P>CIE are alleged to have given figures, and when those figures were examined by an energetic committee with which Deputy Corry was associated, it transpired that they were false, misleading and incomplete. I have a recollection, both from reading the papers and listening to Deputy Corry, of having information similar to that of Deputy Corry.  Why did the Minister suggest to CIE they should send a circular to all their executives warning them to give no information to any committee connected with making protests against the closing of railways?  I doubt if the Board of CIE did this on their own.  I want to accuse the Minister of attempting to prevent the officials of CIE giving the facts to the public.  This was an effort to prevent the public from having the facts and figures to enable them, possibly, to put up a case as to why branch lines should not be closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency, the branch railway line from Clare to Banagher has always paid its way.  The traders, the business people, and the general public know that it is paying its way.  Perry's mill, and others in Belmont, know that it is paying its way.  Yet, it is alleged that the branch line is being closed down for want of business.  We have Bord na Móna and the ESB sending <Col N="108" /> down heavy machinery by rail to Tullamore for the power station at Cloghan.  The moment it arrives at Tullamore, it is transferred to lorries and it goes by road from Tullamore, not on the Ferbane-Banagher line. This is a State company under the authority of the Minister for Transport and Power, but the State company will not give their business to CIE. Because of that, the ratepayers in Offaly have to pay substantially increased rates to keep the roads in proper repair, roads that are being torn up because of the stupidity of those in authority in refusing to use the railway.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister ever ask the ESB why they do not use the railways? Why will he not insist that the ESB should use the railways?  Did he ever ask Bord na Móna why they do not use the railways?  Everyone who knows the geography of Offaly knows that the railways run through the bogs there.  Yet Bord na Móna send heavy transport by road and not by rail.  Are the Government not helping CIE to kill themselves?  The Minister is responsible for them.  If the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs came into this House and said his Department was not paying its way, that he would have to stop the delivery of mails forthwith, that telephones would have to be dismantled, and post offices closed down, I wonder what the reaction would be.</P>
    <P>There is a parallel.  CIE are not paying their way and, therefore, the public are to be deprived of essential services.  Can the same case not be made for one as for the other?  This House and the public would not tolerate Posts and Telegraphs coming to a standstill, if that Department were not paying its way.  There seems to be very little really serious consideration given to CIE not paying their way and the entire population outside of Dublin being deprived of services to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Nobody knows the position in relation to Tramore better than the Minister. If there was one branch line that was definitely paying its way, it was the Waterford-Tramore branch line. For some reason, the Minister decided to close it down.  He promised faithfully <Col N="109" /> the Waterford Corporation, the Waterford County Council, the Tramore Town Commissioners, and everybody concerned, that as good, as cheap and as efficient a service would be provided by bus.  What is the position? The train fare from Waterford to Tramore was 1/9d.; the bus fare, when people can get a bus, is 2/8d. So much for cheap transport.  Surely it is the height of lunacy to take from the people an efficient transport service with a fare of 1/9d. and replace it by an inadequate bus service with a fare of 2/8d.  The road over which that bus runs has to be maintained.  It is a road which had a bad record for accidents, even in the days when a train service was operating efficiently in that area.  I should like the Minister to inform us if the new bus service is paying its way.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us what was the idea in fooling the people of Waterford. If the present situation is supposed to represent a serious effort to cater for the general public, I, for one, cannot understand it, and I know that the general public are not satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now no method of carrying heavy transport from Portlaoise to Kilkenny except by road.  The road from Portlaoise to Kilkenny city, via Ballyragget and Durrow, is not, in my opinion, suitable for carrying heavy transport without a heavy expenditure to put it into proper condition, to have it properly fenced and to raise the level along the River Nore between Durrow and Ballyragget.  Here, a reasonably efficient rail service, for no reason except to satisfy the whim of half a dozen people, is closed down and the people of Portlaoise, Abbeyleix, Attanagh, Ballyragget and Kilkenny are to be deprived of a rail service that was in existence since the days of the old Great Southern Railways. I should like the Minister to tell us how it was this company could operate an efficient service over 4,000 miles of railway line when, today, CIE cannot operate a service over 2,000 miles of railway line, a mileage <Col N="110" /> which will be less by the time the Minister for Transport and Power has finished.</P>

      <P>It must be said, to the credit of the old Great Southern Railways, that they did not make a bad job of it, having regard to everything.

      <P>It is not possible actually to make a comparison between the standard of intelligence in their administrative capacity of the members of the old Great Southern Railways Board and the members of the Board of CIE.  I want to charge the Minister with failure to see that the proper type of person is put on these boards and to suggest that he should not be moved, as he has been, by political considerations.  There was no question of political considerations at the time of the old Great Southern Railways.  It was an independent, private concern which was doing a difficult job well.  One thing certain is that it was not influenced in any way by political considerations.  If, in 1944, when CIE came into being, the advice of some of the old transport veterans had been sought, CIE would not be in the deplorable mess in which they are today.  If CIE are in a mess, as they are, it is a mess of their own making with the help of their own Minister. Now after they have got themselves into this mess, they want to solicit public sympathy and take from the people something which they are enjoying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister&mdash;who, no matter on what astonishing note he speaks, never seems to blush&mdash; if he has any excuse for the fact that when railway lines have closed down and CIE have substituted a road service, steps have <Col N="111" /> not been taken to control freight charges.  The charges on the road services of CIE are unreal.  The charges for any type of goods travelling from Portlaoise to Mountmellick are almost twice, if not three times, as much by road as by rail.  What guarantees have I from the Minister that next year the farmers of such places as Durrow, Abbeyleix, Portlaoise, Clara, Ballycumber, Birr and Roscrea who use the local railway station for beet transport will, when they have not got these railway services, have road transport at the same rate?</P>
    <P>If there is to be a saving, as the Minister claims, why not pass it on to the user and provide efficient and cheaper services for beet transport than we have enjoyed in the past?  I make this prophecy and I venture to say that I will not be too far out when the position is examined this time 12 months, that road transport for beet will be much dearer than the rail transport from the various stations to the Tuam, Carlow or Thurles factories.  On behalf of the farmers in my constituency, I want to charge the Minister with negligence in not protecting their interests in relation to the efficient transport of beet from the loading depots to the factories.  I venture to say that the lorry services cannot be as efficient and experience has taught that they will not be as cheap.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if he is inclined to make any definite statement in relation to freight charges.  What will be the position in relation to the huge sums which must be spent from the Central Fund for the upkeep of main roads, due to the diversion of heavy transport from the railways?  Surely the Minister must know from the problems of his colleague, the Minister for Local Government, that the roads in many parts of rural Ireland were never made for very heavy traffic.  That is why I say it is a foolish policy because very large sums will be required to keep main roads and county roads in a good state of repair.  Increased traffic will mean a considerably increased demand on the ratepayers and the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>But there is a more important aspect <Col N="112" /> than that.  What steps are being taken to look after the requirements of the unfortunate workers who are losing their employment as a result of all this?  It is not possible to close down many miles of railway without displacing some workers from their employment.  The present policy of CIE is designed from start to finish to cut out manpower and give as little employment as possible.  We have seen that, with their policy of one-man lorries and one-man buses, and we will reach the stage when efforts will be made to dispense with the services of conductors on the buses, unless the trade unions dig in their heels and prevent it.</P>
    <P>I should like to know in what way workers employed by CIE, even those who gave good service in the Great Southern Railways, would be treated by the Board and the Minister, if it were not for the fact that they are afraid of the organised trade union movement today.  I hope we shall never see the day when the Minister and his directors in CIE will be able to talk the trade unions into agreeing to reduce the manpower employed by CIE.  I know, and other Deputies know, that drivers, mechanics, conductors, helpers, and station attendants who were employed by Great Southern Railways, and afterwards by CIE, are today, because of a pruning of staff on the railways and on the bus services and because of the general overhauling of CIE policy, employed by London Transport, the City of Manchester Transport Company and transport bodies in many other parts of Great Britain.  You have those men who had always been employed by CIE working in those places because CIE policy is to drive as many workers out of this country as possible.</P>
    <P>No State or semi-State concern is doing as little about their pensioners as the Board of CIE are doing about those men who have given good, loyal service in the past.  Men who gave their lives and who were devoted to the railways are today living on the smallest and most miserable pension that could possibly be given to any group of loyal workers.  Is the Minister <Col N="113" /> ashamed of the way the old railway workers are being treated?  I know what I am talking about in this regard because my own family have given life-long service to CIE and the old Great Southern Railways.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an idea sponsored by the Minister to dismantle the entire rail structure of this country that took very many years to build up.  If I were Minister for Transport and Power in such circumstances, I would hide my head and resign, but before I did that, I should endeavour to obtain the gratitude of some small section of the community by removing from office the people to whom he has entrusted the responsibility of managing this company.  The Minister himself agreed that his company are making certain that rural Ireland will be completely incapable of industrial development of any kind.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that, if a group of industrialists from any part of the world come to set up a heavy type of industry in any district, the first question they will ask the local committee sponsoring it is: &ldquo;What type of railway service have you got?  Is there a site convenient to a railway station so that we can have a suitable siding provided for our factory?&rdquo; How can these suitable sidings be provided, if there are not even railway lines there?  I put it to the Minister that his policy is designed not alone to strip rural Ireland of its railways but to deprive rural Ireland of industrial development.  There are at least as many Deputies on this side of the House concerned about industrial development as there are on the far side.  We feel that with our prospective entry into the Common Market, however dim the picture that may be painted by certain people, there may still be scope for industrial development in rural Ireland.  The greatest handicap we shall have in that regard will be the fact that there was in existence at one stage of Irish history a Minister for Transport and Power who rendered it impossible for that to take place.  That is why I say that not alone <Col N="114" /> has the Minister failed in his duty but, seeing and knowing what is going on, he is aiding and abetting national sabotage.  He is helping to promote further national sabotage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must be completely out of touch with the activities of this company or else he is turning the blind eye to these problems.  I shall ask the Minister one further question if I may.  He tells us that his transport company cannot pay its way.  Will he now tell us why this transport company which cannot pay its way has purchased so many high-powered luxury cars?  Furthermore, what did I see in the <i>Evening Press</i> of Wednesday, 21st November, last but this: &ldquo;CIE to build holiday cottages&rdquo;?  Now we find that CIE are taking on housing responsibilities. Having failed to provide people with efficient transport, they have entered into the hotel business.  There are many people in the hotel business and it should be left to those people who should be given whatever assistance is necessary to promote their interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of efficiency of CIE in their main obligation does not encourage people to have any faith in their activities as a housebuilding authority. When one sees the charges that operate in the CIE hotels and compares them with other charges and when one sees that CIE are about to enter into a scheme whereby holiday cottages by the sea will be built by the company, it is time to call a halt. CIE have also bought fleets of luxury cars for their staff to drive around in. It must have been very disheartening, during the last strike in the city of Dublin, for workers and business people who had to thumb lifts, to see the executives of CIE driving past in their high-powered luxury cars at the expense of the taxpayers.  The Ceann Comhairle will forgive me if I recall that one of these high-powered luxury cars they bought was the car the President used.  I cannot say whether they still have it or not but the Chairman of CIE, in order to get the Government out of a very difficult situation in relation to the purchase of <Col N="115" /> that car, decided that the taxpayers' money was to be used&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would allow me to speak without interruption, my argument might be clearer to him.  It is that I fail to understand why the railways are closed on grounds of economy, while one sees wild, unwarranted and extravagant expenditure.  I have seen that expenditure on high-powered staff cars which should be cut out and the railways should be run for the general public. That is my argument.</P>
      <P>I remember once when a very important conference regarding the closing of a branch line was being held in the Midlands, the former Deputy Davin asked the CIE representative who came to plead the Board's case how he had travelled, whether he had come by train or otherwise.  In fact, the CIE representative did not travel by the railway, although there was a train into the same district from Dublin that evening.  If the Minister were really concerned about the growth and development of rail transport, instead of taking up branch lines, we should be extending and expanding, doing the very opposite of what is being done. If the Minister were really interested in the proper development of our railways, he would review the whole situation and bring forward the Government's proposals in regard to this entire matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I want to wind up by saying that in this regard the patience of the ratepaying community is completely <Col N="117" /> exhausted.  They are quite satisfied that the Minister is making and has made, a bad job of it and they have confidence neither in him nor in the directors he has appointed to administer CIE affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have contributed to a number of discussions on the activities of CIE in the past year and I do not propose to repeat statements already made.  My main reason for intervening now is to bring home to the Minister the discussions which representatives of a number of public bodies in County Cork have had recently, discussions which took place at a joint committee meeting at which were present representatives of Cork County Council, Waterford County Council, Waterford Corporation and several urban councils in Waterford and north-east Cork, as well as representatives of development associations. These discussions arose from the announcement by CIE some time ago of the likelihood of railway lines which were serving these districts being closed.</P>
      <P>At such meetings, the presiding chairman was the chairman of Cork County Council, a colleague of the Minister and a long-standing member of this House, Deputy Corry.  It seems peculiar to me that the agenda of the meeting should have had as the main item the necessary for getting information on the receipts and expenditure of CIE in the different areas covered by the meeting.  I thought it was rather foolish that the representatives should be asked by the chairman and other members to compile statistics of CIE returns when that information should be obtained directly from the Board of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolutions were formulated and submitted to CIE who refused to give the information and later to the Minister for Transport and Power and the Taoiseach requesting their help in obtaining figures in respect of the lines concerned.  These requests were refused without explanation other than the acknowledgment, which came three or four weeks after the date of the meeting, that the letters were received. It seems peculiar that CIE, a body <Col N="118" /> costing the taxpayers this year more than £1 per head, according to the Minister's statement in the Dáil last week, should ignore representations from such a body as this railway committee which held meetings in Youghal.</P>
    <P>Not only is Deputy Corry chairman of that committee but an ex-Minister, Deputy Ormonde, is a member, as are several members of county councils as well as those of Waterford and Cork County Councils.  This is the manner in which they were treated by the Minister, with gross contempt.  I contradicted at that meeting the statements made by Deputy Corry because I felt that CIE, as I said to Deputy Corry, are a State-sponsored body and could not give us false returns and send us misleading information.  Deputy Corry maintained they could and he maintained it here.  Now, I am rather doubtful of the position, although at that time I had no doubt, because the Minister should have given the information we asked for, if it was in accordance with his statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>If the Minister and the Board of CIE had a good case for closing the railways on the basis of figures, why then did they not forward the figures?  Why did they send a direction to their employees, particularly stationmasters, not to disclose information to anyone outside the CIE Board?  I could well understand such a position arising if a private company were operating the railways&mdash;why should they give information to outsiders on any aspect of their affairs?&mdash;but the company we are dealing with is the company which, the Minister told us, is costing each citizen on average more than £1 per head.  The least we could expect from <Col N="119" /> a company so heavily subsidised is co-operation. What we sought were merely the returns from the areas and they were sought by a representative committee.  I am afraid the Minister's refusal to give the information is an indication that statements that had been made as to expenditure and receipts in the areas were incorrect.  That is the only conclusion any reasonable person could reach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Minister's two speeches and I do not like to summarise in a few words what I think of them.  I have read, not two speeches, but 22 speeches on CIE.  The Minister has asked me if I have read his two speeches.  I have.  Surely the Minister will agree with me that I am not supposed to take too much notice of the Minister's speeches?  Did the Minister ask me if I had read his speeches in 1960 or 1961 or if I had read the speeches made by the Chairman of CIE, in which he said, and the Minister agreed with him, that once the Tramore, West Cork and Clare lines were closed down, there would be no further closure of railways until 1964?  What happened?  This is only November, 1962 and here we are discussing further closures of railways, despite the Minister's statement and despite the statement of the Chairman of CIE, only last year, that once these lines were closed, no further closures would be necessary and that CIE were on their way to meeting their commitments without State subvention in the year 1964.</P>
      <P>I shall not hark back to the assurances given to the House by the present Taoiseach during the debates on the Transport Act but, having regard to the picture that is now developing, there is an obligation on members of the House to ask the Minister to hold an inquiry into the activities of CIE.  I doubt if it is the Minister who should be asked.  I suggest it is the Taoiseach who should be asked to hold such an inquiry because the Minister's activities should be inquired into also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="120" /> If a responsible body, supported by the Minister, made a statement in 1961 that no further lines would be closed before 1964 and, within 18 months of making that statement, had to retract, one could not say that they had much foresight.  Surely, they are lacking in foresight and not conversant with the business under their control?  A private board, established by private capital, which showed such lack of foresight in their business, would be removed from office.  Private shareholders would not stand behind a board which had shown such complete incompetence in the business they were dealing with.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister take any action against the Chairman or other members of the Board of CIE or against the Board in general when he found that firm statements made in 1961 had to be retracted in 1962?  Miracles are very rare.  Does the Minister expect that some miracle will happen in 1964 and, having regard to the present trend of activities in CIE, that the rail system, the main operation of CIE, will become economic, that, in other words, it will not require subvention?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister expect that by the action CIE are now taking the deficit of £1,696,000, apart from the subventions to meet past indebtedness, will be completely wiped out in 1964?  If he does, he is completely wrong and he, or whoever may be responsible, will have a different speech to make here next year.  I can see no possible hope of an undertaking such as CIE becoming an economic proposition in 1964.  There are only two possibilities.  One is to abolish CIE altogether&mdash;I will refer to that possibility later&mdash;and the other is the occurrence of a miracle.  It would take a miracle to make CIE pay their way in 1964 under the present type of management.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the statement I made a while ago relative to the figures in dispute between the Minister and his colleague of long standing, Deputy Corry.  The Minister should clear the air on that matter and send to the committee in question a detailed statement of the position, if he can do so.  By doing that, he will discount the arguments put up by <Col N="121" /> Deputy Corry.  The Minister should give that suggestion serious consideration because, to my amazement, Deputy Corry was able to make it quite clear to that committee at a subsequent meeting that the figures he quoted were factual and had been obtained from various traders and, in particular, from the Irish Sugar Company.</P>

      <P>The figures we were dealing with dealt mainly with traffic from Mallow to Youghal and the intermediate stations and it could be said that there was almost as much traffic coming into the area as there was going out, so that the apportionment of costs was not a very difficult matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another aspect I should like to refer to is whether we should review the whole transport business of this country, whether, having regard to present trends, CIE should maintain the monopoly they have or whether the time is at hand to dismantle CIE or, at least, to withdraw the protection they at present enjoy.  Everyone agreed that when CIE were operating in uneconomic as well as in economic areas, they were entitled to protection and that if they had not got the measure of protection extended to <Col N="122" /> them by the various Transport Acts, it would have been impossible for them to continue operating in uneconomic areas.  Now that it is the declared policy of the Board of CIE not to operate in uneconomic districts any longer, and to operate only in economic areas, the position has completely changed and the question must be asked why, in those circumstances, should CIE get protection?  The Minister states that they have no great protection, that there are so many plated lorries in the country.  Plated lorries are a great racket at the present time and have always been.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A disturbing feature of the crime report for 1961 is the large number of persons under 17 years of age charged with committing indictable offences who were convicted or against whom the charge was proved and who got the benefit of the Probation Act.  The figure, 3,333, is the highest figure for any year since the foundation of the State.  The problem of juvenile delinquency which we, of course, share with every other country, is a difficult and many-sided one and no country has so far come <Col N="123" /> to any satisfactory conclusions as to how it can be eradicated.  We have nothing like the problems that even our near neighbours have, but I think, and I have already expressed this opinion, that the problem is acute enough to warrant our tackling it as earnestly as possible and doing so now. now.</P>
      <P>I was heartened to hear of the remarks of an eminent police officer from another country who attended a convention in Dublin of the International Federation of Police Officers in May last.  Speaking of delinquency, he mentioned how lucky we in Ireland were to have problems of such small dimensions and within such narrow fields, a situation which he attributed to the stability of our home life and the strong religious atmosphere which appeared to him to be everywhere about.  These remarks, encouraging as they are, do not mean that we can view our situation with complacency. On the contrary.  As I have mentioned elsewhere, my Department is now entering into a fresh study of penal reform and I hope that on this occasion next year I shall be able to report definite progress.</P>
      <P>The House will be already aware that in September I set up an inter-Departmental Committee to inquire into the present methods for the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders and to recommend such changes in the law and practice as the Committee consider desirable and practicable.  The matters to which the Committee will give particular attention are: juvenile delinquency; the probation system; and the institutional treatment of offenders and their after-care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee have, I am glad to report, got down to their job in commendable fashion; at present three sub-committees are engaged in the investigation of matters affecting the medical care, general education and employment-on-discharge of persons committed to prisons and institutions. It is not the Committee's intention to delay making recommendations until they are in a position to present a comprehensive report but rather to <Col N="124" /> submit their proposals according as they reach their conclusions as to the particular steps which should be taken. In fact, I have already received from the Committee a number of recommendations involving changes in prison administration and procedure and having, in the main, as their aim the social rehabilitation of the offender. Some of the recommendations are already in course of implementation but others, which involve recruitment of personnel and structural alterations or require Departmental planning will naturally take some time to implement. Of course, these changes cannot be made without cost but I feel sure that when the time comes to look for the money I will have no difficulty in getting the full support of the House.</P>
    <P>I do not propose now to go into the Committee's recommendations in detail but I would like to mention some of the major recommendations.  One proposal calls for the intensification of treatment for offenders who are in need of psychiatric treatment and suggests the establishment in Mountjoy Prison Hospital of a special 20-bed unit for all adult prisoners requiring psychiatric hospitalisation.  Allied to this proposal are recommendations for the training of special staff to deal with mentally disordered prisoners and the provision of occupational therapy.  The establishment in Mountjoy of a corrective training centre which would cater for selected prisoners who through training and guidance could be fitted to take their place as normal members of society is also proposed.  The prisoners selected for corrective training would be completely segregated from other prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Committee have recommended strongly the appointment of two prison welfare officers.  In the Committee's opinion, these appointments are essential, if the full aims of social rehabilitation are to be achieved. Another proposal also strongly recommended is that serious consideration should be given to the question of securing alternative premises for St. Patrick's Institution.  It is the Committee's view that the essential facilities for providing worthwhile instruction in education, trades and physical <Col N="125" /> training cannot be provided in the present premises.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that I have no intention of making changes for change's sake, but once I am convinced that new methods or intensification of old methods or changes of direction would lead towards an appreciable diminution of crime, or greater rehabilitation of offenders, I will not hesitate to take the necessary steps.  I need hardly say also that I shall welcome any proposals that may be made to me by Deputies about any of these matters.</P>
    <P>Turning to non-indictable or summary offences, we find that the biggest single factor in the total of over 104,000 persons who were prosecuted in 1961 was, as usual, the number of persons proceeded against under the highway code&mdash;77,834 or almost 75 per cent.&mdash;an increase of 9,201 over the figure for the previous year.  The increase in the number of such prosecutions can be attributed in large measure to the ever increasing number of vehicles on the roads; 326,641 vehicles were registered at the end of 1961, as compared with 302,767 at the end of 1960.  To some extent, too, of course, the increase in such prosecutions reflects the constant vigilance of the Garda in seeking to make the roads safe.  But altogether too much of the time of the Garda has been taken up in the prosecution of trivial motoring offences and I am glad to say that a new system comes into operation shortly which permits a motorist who offends against the law in certain minor respects and who accepts his culpability, to pay a fine of 10/- in the local Garda station within a limited period.  If he wishes, of course, he can go to court.  I think that the new system will be welcome to the motoring public, to the police and to the courts.</P>
    <P>I am appalled that there are so many people who are careless, if not actually reckless, in their driving habits.  The number prosecuted for dangerous or careless driving, 3,772, was well up on the figures for previous years and no less than 651 persons were prosecuted in 1961, for driving while drunk, as compared with 535 in 1960, and 479 in 1959.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="126" /> Before leaving the Garda Vote, I think I should mention as I announced some time ago that I have become persuaded, on looking at the police reports and by the many representations made to my Department in recent years, that something must be done to control airguns firing leaden pellets.  The modern airgun is so powerful and so dangerous in the hands of young boys that its unrestricted use should not, in my opinino, continue to be permitted and I intend to introduce an appropriate amendment of the Firearms Act as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Vote No. 25 is the Vote for prisons. The Estimate, at £283,240, is £40,310 more than last year's.  The bulk of the increase is in respect of increases in pay agreed to at Conciliation Council and the allocation of 28 extra prison officers&mdash;of whom eight were recruited during the past year.  The main reason for this increase in staff, is that, in accordance with an agreement at conciliation proceedings, the working fortnight for prison officers has been reduced from 96 to 90 hours.</P>
    <P>Extensive alterations and improvements to the officers' quarters are planned and I think I can say that the staff in the prisons service are reasonably contented and are doing their jobs conscientiously.  I have visited the prisons and St. Patrick's Institution and have seen for myself how well the prisons are run.  But Deputies do not have to take my word alone for that: all they need do is to ask for permission to come and look for themselves &mdash;I will welcome their interest.  Alternatively, they can read the very worthwhile reports of the visiting committees which are published in the Annual Report on Prisons, copies of which are placed in the Library each year.  On one or two occasions during the year, complaints were made that the food was bad or that the prison discipline might be too severe, but on direct inquiry by the supervising staff in my Department and on reference to the visiting committee of the prison concerned, each complaint was proved to be groundless.</P>
    <P>Prison is not, and is not intended to be, a home from home and a prison will always be a place of punishment, <Col N="127" /> but it seems to me that our prisons nowadays must to an increasing extent become places of rehabilitation as well.  In so far as rehabilitation may save a person from the misery and degradation associated with a life of crime, it is entirely justifiable on humanitarian grounds alone.  In addition, however, it can be regarded as something which brings a positive benefit to the community as a whole. It can mean the difference between a former prisoner continuing as a burden on the community or becoming a useful member of society.</P>
    <P>All connected with the prisons service &mdash; particular members of my office staff, the governors, the chaplains, medical officers, the prison officers and the visiting committees are concerned to do what they can for the rehabilitation of prisoners. And in that connection I must make special reference to the Guild of St. Philip, a section of the St. Vincent de Paul Society which is devoted to the after-care of prisoners, with particular reference to young and first offenders.  There are over 700 branches of the society throughout the country which enables the guild to hold out a helping hand, no matter where a discharged prisoner goes.  During the year, the guild gave over 800 interviews to prisoners and ex-prisoners with a view to their after-care and disbursed the full £1,000 grant which they got from the State.</P>
    <P>I, myself, am of the opinion that, more than any other single element, the provision of suitable, permanent employment on discharge is the greatest safeguard against a relapse into crime and I should like to make a special appeal to all employers to do what they can when approached in this regard.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 was a most useful piece of legislation in the field of penal reform.  It enables the courts to commit young offenders direct to St. Patrick's Institution instead of to prison, and to remand them there whilst awaiting the trial of their cases.  It also enables the Minister to approve of remand institutions for boys and girls, with <Col N="128" /> the result that homeless girls, charged with offences, can now be sent to a convent instead of to prison whilst the cases are awaiting hearing.  One of the main provisions enables the Minister to grant temporary release to persons under sentence or to criminal lunatics who, in the opinion of those in charge of them, are not dangerous to themselves or others.</P>
    <P>I find that the exercise of my powers in this respect does a great deal of good.  It has never been abused.  It is invariably praised by the visiting committees, chaplains and governors of prisons and the medical superintendents of mental hospitals.  During the year under review, the power was exercised in respect of 27 prisoners and 30 mental patients.  So far, I have been feeling my way but I have received so many encouraging reports as to the good effect on the morale of prisoners and patients of being given periods of temporary release for special purposes that I contemplate a more extended exercise of my powers in this regard.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned elsewhere, I have in mind to examine closely the whole field of penal reform. I am aware, in a very general way, of the efforts at penal reform that are going on in Britain, in Denmark, in France and in other countries.  This year and last year, I attended conferences of European Ministers of Justice and I was impressed with the evident anxiety on all sides to establish a code of prisoners' rights and to find better methods of dealing with juvenile delinquency.  It is a problem of worldwide dimensions, in the solution of which, I hope, this country can play a part.  When I attended these conferences, it was brought home vividly to me, how small the incidence of crime is here in Ireland, both relatively and absolutely.  I was able to point out last year that the daily average number of male offenders over 16 years of age in custody was only 44 per 100,000, the figures for female offenders was only one per 100,000 and that the total number of offenders in custody was less than 500 at any one time.</P>
    <P>To go back for a moment to the figures in the Volume of Estimates, I <Col N="129" /> would refer to the provision of £4,200, an increase of £3,600, in Subhead L of Vote 25 which is necessitated by a recent amendment of the prison regulations in regard to the payment of gratuities to prisoners who are well conducted and industrious.  The new arrangement increases the gratuity from a penny a day to 3/6d. a week. Half the money may be spent on cigarettes, sweets and the like and half is put to the prisoner's credit for his use on discharge.</P>
    <P>I would mention, also, that before leaving office as Minister for Justice, Mr. Traynor's last official public act&mdash; on 8th October&mdash;was assisting the President, in the presence of next-of-kin, the Taoiseach, the Lord Mayor of Dublin and other public representatives, at the unveiling of a memorial to the patriot dead interred in Mountjoy Prison.  The cost of the memorial, which is in the form of a 12-foot granite cross on a prepared base, is borne on the Prisons Vote and the smallness of the expenditure was made possible by the voluntary, unpaid work of members of the prison staff and of the Office of Public Works.  It is my intention that the memorial may be visited on the first Sunday in November in each year.  I would ask all concerned to make arrangements for their commemoration visits on that one day.</P>
    <P>The total number of persons committed during the year 1961, whether on remand, for trial or under sentence, was 2,469&mdash;2,208 males and 261 females.  The daily average in prison was 447&mdash;as against 461 in 1960&mdash; which was inclusive of an average of 116 juveniles in St. Patrick's Institution. I am glad to say that the reports of the prison visiting committees make very encouraging reading.  In particular, the report of the visiting committee of St. Patrick's gives a great wealth of detail in relation to the way the boys are treated in the institution and about their after-care.  The 1961 Annual Report on Prisons has recently been published.  But, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, the report contains the same kind of encouraging views from the visiting committees as were published in the report for the previous year.</P>
    <P>The next Estimate, No. 26, is that <Col N="130" /> for the Courts of Justice and, at £412,660, is £50,390 more than last year's.  The increase is due almost entirely to the cost of grade awards and the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo; increases. There has been little change in the staff of the courts: the number of district court clerkships has been reduced slightly by the amalgamation of certain posts according as vacancies occur.  Provision has been made in Subhead A for allowances to members and officers of the Special Criminal Court, £3,145, and in Subhead B for the travelling expenses of members of that Court, £1,180&mdash;provision was made for these items in previous years in the Estimate for the Department of Defence.  As the Court is no longer in operation, expenditure in connection with it will be less than the sum provided.</P>
    <P>The Courts of Justice and Court Officers (Superannuation) Act, 1961 provides, in relation to members of the judiciary and certain court officers, that, in return for a reduction in the amount of pension, a death gratuity after five years' service or a lump sum on retirement will be payable.  Persons serving at the time of the coming into force of the Act were given the option of retaining their existing rights.  Provision was also made allowing of the surrender, at the time of retirement, subject to certain conditions, of portion of the pension payable in order to secure a pension for a wife or for one nominated dependant.  These provisions are in the general lines of other superannuation schemes and were formulated so that they will involve no greater burden on the Exchequer than the previous system.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for the increase of the remuneration of members of the judiciary by the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Act, 1962, by amounts corresponding to those already awarded to the Civil Service.  The salaries are, of course, payable from the Central Fund.</P>
    <P>With the publication in August of the new Rules of the Superior Courts, a task which has gone on, with interruptions, for some 25 years, has now been completed.  The Rules Committee <Col N="131" /> have gone to a great deal of trouble and expenditure of time in the past 12 months in bringing the Rules up-to-date.  We are indebted to them.</P>
    <P>During the year, three distinct sets of District Court Rules were made by the District Court Rules Committee. The District Court Rules (No. 1) 1961, provided for the revision of the practice and procedure of the district court in relation to the service of summonses and the service of documents outside the jurisdiction of the State.  They also have provisions in relation to the issue of notice to defendants in regard to fines.  The District Court Rules (No. 2) 1961, revoked the existing Rules relating to affiliation, maintenance and enforcement of court orders and made new provisions in regard to these matters. The District Court (Gaming and Lotteries Act) Rules (No. 3) 1961, provide for the regulation of the practice and procedure of the court for the purposes of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1960.  I am aware that the Rules Committee have also been working on a costs and fees order.  I should like to express my thanks to the Committee for the very excellent work done by them during the past year.</P>
    <P>When promoting the Courts Establishment and Constitution Act last year, my predecessor mentioned&mdash; Vol. 187, Col. 1062 &mdash; in connection with the provisions for the appointment of a President of the District Court that he would be charged with the duty of ensuring the prompt and efficient discharge of the business of the court.  One of the matters mentioned then was the necessity for securing as far as practicable general uniformity of practice and procedure in the administration of justice and the standards to be adopted in fixing the amount of penalties.  The Act authorities the President to convene meetings of justices periodically to discuss matters of this kind.  My predecessor made it perfectly clear that there was no question of interfering with the freedom of any individual justice to award the penalty he might think appropriate in a particular case <Col N="132" /> but the intention was that the individual justice could benefit in a general way by discussion with his judicial colleagues as to what would be the appropriate penalties in hypothetical circumstances.  In that way a general level of uniformity of penalties would be brought about.</P>
    <P>I was sorry to learn that the question of uniformity of penalties did not come up for discussion when the justices convened last December.  My experience, meanwhile, goes to show that there is a very real need for such a discussion as there is a wide disparity between the penalties imposed by some justices and the penalties imposed by the great bulk of their colleagues in relation to particular charges.  In particular, I would refer to the disparity of penalties on convictions of minor charges under the Road Traffic Act&mdash;offences such as illegal parking or failing to stop at a stop sign, etc.&mdash; which carry a monetary maximum penalty of a few pounds.  I am referring now to cases not having any aggravating circumstances.  One or two justices have been wont, in trivial cases, to disqualify the person concerned, for driving, for periods of weeks or a couple of months.  Such penalties are never imposed by the very great majority of justices.  It seems to me that they are disproportionate in their severity, threatening, in some instances, the loss of a defendant's livelihood and I have acceded to petitions for the restoration of licences in a number of such cases.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we have all, I am sure, been surprised from time to time to read of cases in which confirmed blackguards are treated with what seems to the outsider to be excessive leniency.  I do think, therefore, that there is a very real need for the justices to take steps amongst themselves to bring about uniformity or near-uniformity of penalties.  I understand that magistrates in other countries meet from time to time for such purposes and I can see every reason why the 35 justices in this country should come together occasionally for objective discussions as to their judicial functions.  I do not think that any person with an understanding of <Col N="133" /> the practicalities of the situation could see objection to such a discussion, and I do not think that the judicial discretion of individual justices could possibly be impaired.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the reorganisation of the district court has worked excellently since 1st April, 1961. Although the number of justices was reduced to eight metropolitan justices, 23 provincial justices and four movable justices, there has been no need to appoint temporary justices. Emphasis has been and will continue to be placed on the prompt discharge of district court work and on the elimination of delays.</P>
    <P>Vote No. 27 is the Estimate for the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds. At £143,960, the Estimate is £19,140 greater than last year's and again the rise is due almost entirely to salary increases.  Both offices continue to cope with a considerable volume of work.  While there have been complaints of delays in the Land Registry, I can assure the House that my Department have taken steps to eliminate these delays as far as possible.  Arrangements have been made for a bonus incentive scheme which, it is confidently estimated, will increase the staff output by 30 per cent. and it is hoped that all arrears in the Land Registry will have been cleared off by next January.  The scheme envisages that in each month arrears of dealings will be reduced by 275; copy maps by 150; searches by 60; Labourers Act cases by 940; and Land Commission cases by 125. According as the staff clear the arrears in one sector, they will go to others.</P>
    <P>During the year, the central office and the counter space have been enlarged and these improvements should facilitate the public in their dealings.  Arrangements have been made, furthermore, for a fairly substantial extension of the building, costing several thousands of pounds, for the proper storage of records.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to make more than a simple mention of the fact that a Registration of Title Bill has been drafted and should be ready for introduction in the next Dáil session.  It <Col N="134" /> will be a comprehensive measure, running into a great many sections and it will I am sure be carefully examined and fully debated by the many Deputies interested in this field when it comes before the House.</P>
    <P>The final Vote for which I am responsible, No. 28, is the Estimate for the Offices of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The net Estimate, £7,730, is £560 more than the Original Estimate for last year and the Supplementary Estimate of £400 and it is due to general increase in remuneration. There is no change in the staff structure.  I have already mentioned that the law in relation to charities has been amended and consolidated by the Charities Act, 1961, which introduced several substantial improvements and I should like to take this opportunity of thanking the Commissioners for their advice and assistance in the preparation of that Bill and for the invaluable skilled service they give to the community in charity matters.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I express my sincere thanks to all those members of voluntary committees and boards for which I have parliamentary responsibility, both present members and those who have retired during the past year? I should like to place on record how appreciative I am of the conscientious and able manner in which all concerned have carried out their tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all Deputies will be glad to join with the Minister in wishing his predecessor in office, Mr. Oscar Traynor, many years of happiness in his retirement.  It is no exaggeration to say that Deputies from all sides of the House found the former Minister for Justice a very easy man to deal with.  They found him to be a person who was prepared to listen to their views and to deal with the various points raised by Deputies in discussions such as this.  If I have any advice to give to the present Minister, it is that he would do well to follow the example of his predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister was referring to retirements, I felt rather sorry he did not advert to another retirement which took place during the year, that of the former Governor of Mountjoy Prison, <Col N="135" /> Mr. Seán Kavanagh, who had been in the prison service for very many years and gave very distinguished service to this country in that capacity and who earlier, before he entered the prison service, also gave excellent service.  I hasten to repair what I feel sure was an inadvertent omission by the Minister because I believe the former Governor of Mountjoy Prison was a person who did very great service in establishing the pattern, or portion of it, at any rate, of the administration of justice in this country.  Therefore I should like to wish him, also, many years of happiness and prosperity in his retirement.</P>
    <P>While it may be small in some respects, the Minister's Department is a large one from the point of view of the field it covers, and indeed, judging from the Minister's remarks, he will make every effort to see it is no longer a small Department, particularly numerically.  When listening to him, I could not help recalling the very vigorous election campaign carried on some years ago by members of the Minister's Party who on that occasion appeared to be determined to reduce the numbers in the Civil Service.  I wonder if that policy has been jettisoned elsewhere than in the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>There are a few general matters and a number of particular points I wish to refer to in relation to this Estimate. The fact that Estimates, even though this is only a token sum to enable discussion to take place, have to be introduced here and that such a wealth of detail of one sort or another was given by the Minister in his statement, shows it is well worth while that Ministers should have to come to the Dáil with their Estimates year after year and give an account of their stewardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a reorganisation in the district court and to the fact that now we have the district court pattern following on very much the same lines as that of the other courts where there is a president and a number of other judges.</P>
    <P>I am not quite sure that the matter to which I want to refer now very <Col N="136" /> briefly is under the direct authority of the Minister or whether it is one of the functions that have been transferred from him to the holder of the office of President of the District Court.  It is the question of the allocation of district justices to different posts and different work.  I do not want to be misunderstood in this and I do not want in any way to be recorded as personally criticising the present holder of the office of President of the District Court, a very eminent lawyer, but I do feel it is a pity that during the course of the year, it was necessary for a district justice of very long standing on the district court bench to announce publicly that he was being transferred from one office to another without his consent and, unless I am mistaken, also without consultation.  I may be mistaken in that.  It was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 28th April last. According to that report, the justice said:</P>
    <P>I have been a district justice for 38 years and have been in four districts. I was transferred on three previous occasions with my full will and consent.  On this occasion, no.</P>
    <P>Later, the report quotes him as saying:</P>
    <P>I was transferred on the three previous occasions with my full will and consent.  On the other three occasions, the transfers were in the hands of the Minister for Justice and I was never transferred against my will until now.  You might think that I wanted to get away from you but that is not so, and that is why I mention this matter.  I was quite happy here and I like being with you. </P>
    <P>He went on in this statement to say, according to this report, that:</P>
    <P>he was being transferred to the Children's Court in Dublin Castle and before his departure he would like to express to the solicitors' profession, the members of the Bar who had appeared in his court, the court staff, the probation officers and the Gardaí, his appreciation for the courtesy and help they had given him during his time there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" />&ldquo;As to myself, I am going to the Children's Court and I did not apply to be sent there.  I am being replaced by Justice Ó Riain and he did not apply and did not want to leave the Children's Court.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I recognise that once the House has set up machinery and given authority for these kinds of moves to be made, the authority is there and a person charged with the responsibility of that high office must act as he sees fit but I do think it is a matter which must be kept under review by the Minister, particularly in relation to the Children's Court.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred, with justifiable alarm, I think, to the increase in juvenile crime.  I think I am correct in saying that the former incumbent of the bench in the Children's Court was a man who had spent a considerable number of years in that court. He was a man who had experience in dealing with the particular type of problem which is met in the Children's Court.  I think I am correct in saying that he was abroad to study methods in other countries.  The point I want to make is that it is a court which requires a special type of knowledge and a special type of experience.  It does not seem on the face of it to be good enough that a change should be made, without the consent of the person who sat on the bench and that in his place should be sent another district justice, who, again, did not consent to the change.  The fact that such statements were made publicly in court in relation to this matter does not help from the point of view of the harmony which one would like to see in connection with the district court bench.  I do not propose to say anything more on that topic.  I suggest that the Minister, even though he may not now have the authority, should keep the matter under review.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year, I asked the Minister a question dealing with the compulsory oral Irish test for promotion in the Garda Síochána.  At that time, the matter was under consideration by the Minister.  I understand that representations were made to him by the Garda Representative <Col N="138" /> Body.  I should be glad to know from the Minister if that has since been solved.  The position was that the order was retrospective in relation to those who joined the Force since 1943. Very briefly, the case against it was that it was worsening the conditions of some&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been fixed?  I am very glad to hear it.  I should like to ask the Minister also what is the present position with regard to Garda pay.  The Minister referred to the fact that claims were received, I think, as recently as last month or the month before.  There have been a number of applications, I think, on behalf of the Garda over the past few years.  I have no doubt that the Minister is likely to remember the difficult position which obtained some time ago.</P>
      <P>As recently as September last, an article appeared in one of the Sunday papers from an ex-chief superintendent who was not very long out of the Force.  He had some very hard remarks to make with regard to conditions in the Garda and I should like to hear the Minister further with regard to them.  This article, which appeared in the <i>Sunday Review</i> of 9th September, was written by a retired chief superintendent who, up to a few months before, had been attached to the Dublin Metropolitan Division.  He is quoted in this article as saying:</P>
      <P>At present a guard cannot afford to get married.  He cannot even afford to fall in love&mdash;unless he falls in love with money!</P>
      <P>The system, whereby the men must pay for their station keep&mdash;whether they avail of it or not&mdash;is scandalous. By the time their laundry subscription, their income tax and their mess and attendance payments are taken from their wage packets, they take home labourers' wages.</P>
      <P>The young gardaí would not be blamed if they packed up and went to England, where the authorities are crying out for our stalwart young men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1954, when I was given the <Col N="139" /> task of administering the Dublin area, I sent in appeal after appeal to the Department to remedy conditions, but they were all ignored.</P>
    <P>For years the Gardaí at the Bridewell and Green Street had to sleep in worse conditions than their own prisoners.  That has been partially remedied. </P>
    <P>It is certainly disturbing to the public that a chief superintendent, a few months after his retirement, feels it necessary to make that kind of criticism of the pay and the conditions in the Force.  I should like to know from the Minister what steps are being taken to remedy the complaints that have been made.  I do know that in some of the stations in Dublin&mdash;I think the Bridewell is one of them&mdash;improvements have been made in the conditions.</P>
    <P>I should like to know also from the Minister whether any dissatisfaction has been expressed to him with regard to the new regulations made governing the representation on the Representative Body or Bodies of the Garda.  I understand the position now is that there are three different bodies.  There is a body catering for the officers, another catering for NCOs and a third catering for the guards.  Certainly, from the publicity which appeared in the newspapers, it would seem that the Minister has not, in fact, hit on the right solution to the problem.  I do not know whether the types of letters and articles that have appeared in the papers since the new system was adopted are representative or whether they are the views of an occasional crank.  I should like the Minister to tell the House quite frankly whether on the information which he has had as Minister, the new system is one which appears to be working satisfactorily and with the goodwill of the members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year, I drew the attention of the Minister, by way of Parliamentary Question, to the condition of index books in the Bankruptcy Office in the Four Courts.  I am glad that matter has been remedied. I do not know whether the Minister or other Deputies are aware of the <Col N="140" /> importance of these books from the point of view not merely of the legal practitioner but of the public.  It is necessary, on virtually every occasion on which a person purchases a house, to make a search to ascertain whether the person purporting to sell is entitled to do so or whether that person is under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Courts, in which event, his assets would be vested in the Official Assignee.</P>
    <P>Up to the point last year&mdash;whether it was a coincidence, I do not know&mdash; when I put down my Question to the Minister, the books in the Bankruptcy Office were in a scandalous condition. It is no exaggeration to say that you could not make out some of the letters on the index.  Solicitors would have been in a most unfortunate position if, through no fault of their own but simply due to the dilapidated state of these books, they slipped up and gave an incorrect return of their search.</P>
    <P>I am simply referring to the matter because it is one of importance.  It is a situation which should not have been allowed to occur.  It has been remedied now and I hope it will not be necessary to refer to it in the future.  If, through the very considerable use which is made of these books, they get into the same dilapidated condition, I trust that, on the first representation which is made to the Minister, he will have the matter remedied.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with censorship.  I want to refer very briefly to a matter which has been raised here on a number of occasions, namely, the possibility of introducing some system of grading for films.  I recognise that there may be a number of difficulties attached to it.  I understood, from a discussion which took place here some years ago, that this matter was being examined by the Department.  I should like the Minister to tell us what progress has been made in that examination. I know there are difficulties. There are pros and cons in introducing any system which would provide for the grading of films.  However, it is a matter which should actively be examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to general law reform.  Those of us who speak from <Col N="141" /> these benches are very glad to see the law reform programme going forward. Steps in that direction were initiated by the inter-Party Government.  I am glad the Minister has advanced that position.  It is certainly worth his while to consider some kind of standing advisory committee to deal with law reform.  I do not mean a committee merely of the Minister's Department but a committee which should have amongst its members officials of the Minister's Department, officials of the Office of the Attorney General and some legal practitioners.  There should be some such committee, which would remain in continual existence, to advise the Minister and the Minister's Department on questions of law reform.  It is particularly important that practising members of the legal proffession should be represented and that their views should be presented to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of what compensation, if any, is available for members of the public who may incur injury when they go to the assistance of the Garda Síochána.  I raised this matter some years ago.  I think I am correct in saying that the unfortunate position is that there is no fund out of which compensation is available to such persons.  The Minister should consider the matter so that people who may unfortunately incur bodily harm or other loss when acting out of civic spirit in that way may be able to turn to some fund for compensation.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in welcoming the fact that the Border outrages appear to have stopped.  I join with him also in expressing the hope that that state of affairs will continue.  I am sorry he did not deal with another matter which has been exercising the minds of a number of people recently, a matter which was publicised in the papers and which was publicised at the Árd Fheis of the Minister's Party.  I refer to communist activities in this country, in this city in particular, in relation to the youth of the country.</P>
    <P>There was a report in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 15th November, 1962, of a speech by the vice-president of the Saint John Bosco Society who stated that, during the summer, 120 boys from a Dublin area were taken to a <Col N="142" /> holiday camp in the Six Counties by Irish communists.  He mentioned also that three Irish communists attended a communist conference this year at which they were told to change their recruiting methods and were advised not to appear anti-clerical.  This matter was referred to later by a speaker at the Árd Fheis of the Minister's Party.  I do not want for a moment to be taken in any way as advocating witch-hunting or anything of that sort.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, certainly not.  However, I think the speaker at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis was relying on the report which appeared in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and which I would take to be reliable.  I do not want to advocate that the Minister or the authorities under him should indulge in any kind of witch-hunting.  I do not think that would be in any way helpful. However, a number of people in this country are seriously alarmed by the reports which appeared: the Minister will appreciate that.  He will appreciate also the fact that, from the experience which nearly any adult has nowadays of the manner in which communists work, no country, even this country, can afford to be complacent about reported activities of this sort.  It might not be fair to press the Minister for a statement on the steps he or the Garda authorities are taking in the matter, but I think it right to refer to it and to give him an opportunity of giving the House and, through the House, the country, an assurance that there is no complacency on his part or on the part of the Garda authorities in this connection.</P>
      <P>That is all I have to say with regard to this Vote.  There were a few other points, which I think would need legislation to deal with, if I were to urge them, and I understand that is not permitted in this discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with the Minister and the previous speaker in wishing the former Minister, Mr. Traynor, many <Col N="143" /> years of happiness in his retirement. I endorse the comments made by previous speakers in regard to the manner in which he discharged his duties.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to learn from the Minister's speech that he is concerned with a matter I have referred to many times, that is, the lack of uniformity in the penalties imposed by the courts. I am pleased that the Minister is dealing with this matter in as forcible a manner as he can and that he is perturbed by the disparity in sentences for similar offences obtaining in different parts of the country.  I agree entirely with the view he expressed that there should be a meeting of the justices and that some effort should be made to have uniformity of sentence for similar crimes.  It is well known that a particular justice may leave you off with a small fine for a particular offence, whereas you may be in danger of a prison sentence from another justice in another part of the country for the same offence.  That should not happen.  I am sure that, when the Minister has interested himself in this matter and when the meeting referred to has taken place, we will have more uniformity in the punishment meted out for offences.</P>
      <P>The Minister, as a young man starting out on an important career and in charge of an important Department of State, could also interest himself in recommending changes in the system of appointment of members of the judiciary.  Since the State was established, irrespective of what Government were in power, there has been a particular system.  The main qualification for appointment has been a political qualification.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>If Standing Orders were strictly enforced, the Minister was not in order in referring to it.  The Minister has no function at all in that matter.  The judiciary are an independent body, and it is within the rights of each justice to impose penalties within the regulations as he sees fit himself.  The Minister has no right to order them, or even to order such a conference as has been mentioned.  If Standing Orders were strictly enforced, he would have no right to refer to it in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Another matter I referred to here previously is the procedure in the courts.  It was also referred to by other Deputies, and Deputy Breen, in particular, was very strong on the point.  I refer to the wearing of wigs and gowns by counsel appearing in the courts.  This is handed down to us from the British authorities who used such symbols.  I believe they serve no purpose and that it is time to enact legislation for their removal. In the United States and a number of other countries, lawyers have not to wear either wigs or gowns, and I am sure justice is meted out there just as well as it is here.  I hope the Minister will address himself to this question, because I think the wearing of these wigs and gowns has an unnerving effect on people who rarely attend the courts except to appear as a witness in isolated cases.  I cannot see any justification for the requirement of wearing wigs and gowns in the higher courts and the Minister should do <Col N="145" /> away with the system.  I shall close on it now because I think something will come from the Chair very soon.</P>
      <P>Another matter I should like to refer to concerns the system we have for dealing with the moneys of wards of court, mentally defective people or people who cannot look after their own affairs.  My comments are mainly based on a case which came to my notice three years ago, a relatively small case which has not yet been determined.  If that is the system under which the moneys of wards of court are looked after here, this House should address itself to the question and do so very forcibly.</P>
      <P>This was a rather straightforward case.  The man concerned was a patient in a mental hospital for an extended period.  He had a very small estate at the time of his death which was under the jurisdiction of the solicitor for wards of court.  The estate was less than £30 and less than the cost of the burial expenses.  When the man died his relatives endeavoured to get payment of this sum.  They did not make very much headway and, amongst others, they solicited my help.  I had several discussions with the people concerned in the Four Courts and in the solicitor's office.  They were all agreed that the estate was in existence but there were some legal formalities to be dealt with and consequently payment of the £20 odd burial expenses could not be made.</P>
      <P>In February, 1961, after 12 months, or so, of negotiation I got an assurance that payment would be in order and the money would be forthcoming shortly.  Subsequently, I was told something was missing between the Four Courts and the solicitor's office and payment could not be made.  After a number of months had passed, I sought the Minister's help.  I put the case in the Minister's hands.  I have no doubt he gave it the greatest attention. I have received in all four letters from him; but payment cannot be made.  The Minister informed me, I have no doubt truthfully, that he has no function in the matter and the best he can do is to speak to these people and ask them to try to do something so that this £20 odd will be paid to the relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> It is mandatory for a person who is of unsound mind and deemed unable to look after his affairs to have some State office to look after his affairs for him.  That office should discharge its functions differently from the manner in which it appears to discharge them at the moment.  I am speaking now of the section in the Four Courts which deals with wards of court.  In fairness to the solicitor, it should be said that he told me he had completed his side of the job, and there was nothing more for him to do.  He told me, and he was probably correct in this, that he did give the case personal attention and it was cleared by him in May, 1961; there was nothing further that could be done except to address my remarks to the office in the Four Courts; there seemed to be no justifiable reason for withholding payment any longer.</P>
    <P>The solicitor for wards of court is appointed to look after the affairs of people who are not capable of looking after their affairs themselves. Surely there should be no difficulty in the solicitor paying over burial expenses without delay and any residue left in the estate?  If my case is typical, then all I can say is that I am surprised at the difficulties confronting people in getting payment of moneys entrusted to this section. I think power should be vested in the responsible Minister to ensure that all such transactions will be dealt with in a businesslike way.  I will not go beyond that.  I am hopeful the Minister will take that power.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to crime statistics.  We were all rather shocked to learn of the increase in juvenile delinquency.  The number of convictions in 1961 was 3,333 the highest figure since the foundation of the State.  This is a serious problem in a small country which, with few exceptions, has a sparsely scattered population throughout the country.  I have no doubt that everybody concerned&mdash; religious, the judiciary, the courts, the Minister's Department and the Garda Síochána&mdash;are making the utmost endeavours to wipe out juvenile delinquency altogether.  It would appear that their efforts are not meeting with the success they deserve.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="147" /> Here, I must pay tribute to the reformatories and industrial schools. I have known a few boys convicted of crimes and committed to such schools. I have met them subsequently and I now bear witness to the fact that they got an excellent training in these schools.  They had obviously benefited greatly by the education and training they got.  I think we can take it that those who go through these schools subsequently lead excellent lives.  That being the case, there should be sufficient accommodation to enable all who require training in such schools to get the benefit of it.  Possibly it would be a good idea to send youthful offenders to these schools early on rather than allow them to return home, with a warning, possibly to err again.  We all like to be as merciful as possible but juvenile delinquents must, I think, be dealt with more sternly now than they have been in the past.  Committal to schools would possibly be the best method of reducing the number of criminals. Youths stand to gain by schooling and training in these centres.  I know from experience that they are different people when they leave them.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an exceptionally high figure for non-indictable offences, 104,000 in all.  He states that 75 per cent. of the offences were against the highway code and taking into account the statement that we have over 326,000 vehicles in the country, an average of 23 per cent. of vehicle owners committed offences last year. The fact that 23 per cent. of the vehicle owners committed offences in a country where the volume of traffic is not too great is disturbing.  Whilst I am firmly behind every move to enforce law and order, and enforce it impartially and strictly, I believe a number of these offences need never have been dealt with by the courts. Trivial offences such as parking, say, 19 inches from the footpath when a person is waiting for a few minutes of has gone into a shop for a message when it is difficult to park in a recognised parking centre, and other trivial offences of first offenders should be dealt with by a warning.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear that I am <Col N="148" /> a firm believer in upholding the traffic regulations because I know the conditions that would obtain if there were laxity in this regard but a number of offences could be dealt with by way of warning.  The Minister should repeat, as I am sure he will, the statement made by his predecessor, the then Deputy Traynor, to recruits leaving the Garda Depot that they should leave their pencils aside as much as possible.  If they find an honest type of citizen, if I might use that phrase, who committed some small technical offence, then instead of bringing him before the court, they should give him a warning which I am sure would have the desired effect. I hope the Minister will have a further word about this matter with the responsible authorities because, as I say, there is no need in some instances for court proceedings.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to drunken driving as outlined by the Minister is not very rosy.  In 1959, we had 479 prosecutions; in 1960, we had 535; and in 1961, we had 551.  We all appreciate the menace of drunken driving and it is deplorable that, despite the many warnings issued by people such as the Minister, members of the judiciary, senior officials of the police force and religious authorities, instead of decreasing, the number of offences is on the increase.  Having regard to the unsatisfactory trend, I hope that in the course of the year the Minister will have some strong comments to make on suitable occasions and that he will again appeal to vehicle drivers to respect not only themselves and their own lives but the lives of others which are endangered when drunken drivers are let loose on the roadway.  We all like a drink occasionally and I am not one of those people who are anxious to comment adversely on a person taking a few drinks but there is an obligation on all of us when driving to be very careful to ensure that we are in full command of our senses and that we are not incapacitated, through over-indulgence in alcohol.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to address himself to this question.  A number of people convicted of such an offence are <Col N="149" /> well-meaning people and, in many instances, the most respectable people you could find.  They do not mean to get drunk but possibly they may have been attending a wedding or they may have met a few friends in a public house whom they did not expect to meet and have taken two or three drinks over and above what they should.  Irrespective of that, it is quite in order for the Minister to make it clear to all concerned that, no matter what the circumstances may be, people convicted of such offences cannot expect to be dealt with lightly.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which the Minister referred is the control of airguns, and in this matter I am entirely in agreement with him.  I do not see why young fellows should have airguns and endanger other people and possibly be the cause of depriving somebody of an eye.  Young fellows who have airguns should be brought before the courts and punished.  Another matter in this connection is that I cannot see the advantages of young fellows going around with knives in their belts.  I do not know why we should allow youngsters to go around with these daggers.  I have seen them even in the country districts, although some time ago it was mainly confined to the more populous centres.  Now you find these airguns and jack-knives, or whatever you term them, in the rural parts of the country as well.  The Minister will appreciate that if a difference of opinion should arise between young fellows, there is grave possibility that lives could be endangered.  It should, therefore, be made an offence to carry these knives.</P>
    <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty. The matter was referred to in the House on a previous occasion when members advocated punishment for carrying knives.  On that occasion, the Minister instanced the case of a man carrying a penknife in his pocket for cutting tobacco and asked how could the law be administered then.  I am sure commonsense could be used. There is a big difference between the man carrying a small penknife in his pocket for cutting tobacco and the person with a dagger attached to his belt.  The difference can easily be seen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> Another matter to which the Minister's Department could address itself is the question of newspaper advertisements giving false description of goods on offer.  People advertise goods or services and solicit support for them by false claims.  There are advertisements by people who tell you they can make you taller, that they can make you stronger or younger.  It is only a small number of foolish people who would accept such assertions but then again there are advertisements claiming wonderful cures through the use of certain medicines.  There should be an obligation on the State to examine whether these medicines have the potentialities claimed for them in the advertisements.  There are goods advertised for the cure of arthritis and other ailments and which may have no value.  These goods or services are offered with a view to getting money from people who suffer from such ailments and who will try anything to obtain relief.  They will pay 10/- or £1 and take the chance that it will cure them.  There is good business in that field of activity.  The State should examine all drugs and medicines on offer by public advertisement, in order to ascertain whether they are what they are supposed to be or whether it is some fraud in order to deceive gullible people and people not so gullible suffering from these ailments.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the statement by Deputy O'Higgins regarding an article by an ex-senior officer of the Garda Síochána relative to the conditions of the serving members.  I believe that such a statement should not come from a person in his position. I read that statement and indeed there was very little of value in it because the Garda have a representative body elected now in a most democratic fashion to put forward any justifiable claims or grievances they may have.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why a senior officer on retirement should make a charge which had no substance.  Such a statement, if read in some places outside the State, would lead people to believe that all was not well with our police force.  I hope the position will not arise here as it has arisen in other <Col N="151" /> countries where ex-members of the police force, particularly senior officers, on their retirement, write articles for newspapers disclosing information they received in the course of their duties and bringing before the public mind cases past and gone with the years.  I have no doubt that it will not happen here but if there is any trend in that direction, we should nip it in the bud.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the promotion system for members of the Garda Síochána.  I think it is the aim of the Minister and of the Commissioner to deal with all such matters on an impartial basis, to recognise merit where it exists and to promote the people they think are best fitted and most suitable for promotion.  Complaints are bound to arise, however, because when a person applies for promotion and his application is turned down, he feels he is better than the other fellow who got it.  We all do the same.  I should like the Minister to make a detailed statement on this promotion system, so as to make it clear to the public that promotions within the Garda are not due to pull of any kind and that it is the endeavour and the wish of the Minister, the Commissioner and senior officers, to see that promotions are made fairly, that it is desired to promote only the most suitable and that there is nothing wrong in the system.  If there is anything wrong in the system or if the Minister feels there is any justification for the complaints that are being made, he should inquire into the matter and remove the cause for complaint.</P>
    <P>The Minister has far more information than I have on this matter.  I recognise that a number of people may be disappointed because they were not promoted&mdash;possibly they did not deserve promotion&mdash;but the best way to deal with that, now that we have a large number of new members in the Force, is by the Minister making a statement making it clear to all such members that promotion is given to those who are most entitled to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister.  When he was appointed, it was said that he was <Col N="152" /> appointed merely because he was the Taoiseach's son-in-law.  However, he has proved his worth to me and, I am sure, to the House.  Compliments have been paid to the former Minister. I agree with those compliments although I thought he was very peevish when it came to criticism.  If you criticised his Department, he seemed to take it as a personal affront. The former Minister and I were in hot water a few times because I criticised his Department.  Ministers should accept as well as give criticism.  They should not be peevish or angry when criticism is offered.</P>
      <P>About a week ago, a question was asked of the Minister as to why the costs of Corporation tenants in court cases had increased of late and his answer was that the usual cost was about 10/- but that there were costs of £4 or £5 in one case because of about 30 adjournments.  I questioned the Minister and I said that it was not because of adjournments but that these were penal costs because they had been previously before the court. To prove my point, when tenants of a municipal authority are in court in relation to an order for possession, they are there by virtue of a section of the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851.  The 1931 Housing Act contained a provision in Section 34 incorporating this arbitrary section of the 1851 Act.</P>
      <P>It is the Summary Jurisdiction Act and right away it should convey to the Minister that justice is summary but there certainly is not very much summary action in a case in respect of which there are 30 or more adjournments. Actually, when that case comes before the court, it is opened and finished with very often in five minutes because the court has no power to refuse an order, no power to vary an order.  In all cases of a civil landlord, the court can refuse an order or vary an order but municipal tenants are subject to the Summary Jurisdiction Act, 1851 and, as a result, the local authority can say: &ldquo;This man had a cat and therefore he broke the letting regulations.&rdquo;  The court must give the order.  Even though the court thinks it ridiculous, it has no option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> On one occasion recently, a new district justice did refuse an order but when the case next came to court, he did not refuse because it was brought home to him in the meantime that he had no power to refuse.  There are no such things as 30 adjournments, or even two, except in the odd case where a district justice may err.  What happens in regard to costs is that if a tenant has been in trouble before, that fact is taken into consideration and whether the alleged cost is 12/- or £25 has nothing to do with adjournments.</P>
    <P>The objection to that practice is that a district justice has no power to refuse an order.  In a number of cases, in fact, tenants owe no rent but according to the cleverly-worded letting regulations, tenants must pay on gale day.  If gale day were Monday and the tenant does not pay until next morning, even though the rent was accepted and even though the tenant owes no money, the local authority can go to court and say that on gale day, which was such a date, this person did not pay the rent. On that alone, the justice must make the order.  That is the law.  I know it because I have studied it well.  The cost or penalty simply indicates whether a person has been in trouble on previous occasions&mdash;even though that is finished and dealt with.  It is not a matter of adjournments.  That is the point on which I want to correct the Minister.</P>
    <P>It is rather sad to think that at this day, half the citizens of Dublin have no protection in the courts.  It is contrary to the whole spirit of the Constitution that a justice cannot refuse or cannot vary an order.  If you owe one penny, the order will be given. If not, it will be given when the court next sits when it is brought home to the justice that he has no power.  That is the position in regard to local authority tenants and I ask the Minister to study it.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to self-service shops and super-markets.  I understand the Garda are kept busy arresting people for pilfering goods from self-service stores.  In my opinion, self-service stores encourage people to steal.  I am one who believes, thinking perhaps a little differently from others, that we <Col N="154" /> are not ail law-abiding deep down and that we behave ourselves simply because we are not tempted excessively or provoked too much, perhaps. Perhaps we do it through fear.  In these shops, there are no supervisors and it seems to me an obvious case of temptation to poor people going about in them to do what they would otherwise never do.  To ask people to behave as if they were saints is like asking them to keep the peace if there were no Gardaí on the streets.  It is the very appearance of the Garda, as we are told, that keeps order.  The uniform is the law; it is not the fact that the wearer is a Garda that gives authority or puts fear into people. With these shops displaying goods worth 5/- or more, is it not obvious that there will be pilfering?</P>
    <P>A short time ago, I went into court to hear a case in which I was interested.  I saw one very decent woman there.  She was crying all the time.  She had put a piece of meat into her bag in addition to the goods she declared.  I saw another well-known person there.  Deputies would be surprised to know who it was.  That was a similar case.  I believe the Garda are very much engaged in this type of job and I think the Minister should suggest to the President of the District Court that they should treat these offenders lightly and force the shops to provide supervision.  It is no use saying people should not do these things.  Only in tonight's paper, I read of 30 postmen in court because they were pretending they had been doing overtime.  These men are not criminals. If they are, we are all criminals because you could not get 30 men in one establishment all criminals.  The temptation was there.  Probably somebody in authority told them: &ldquo;I shall fix it; you give me half the proceeds.&rdquo; That goes to show that where there is too much temptation, any of us will fall.  Something should be done to discourage stealing and pilfering at the super-markets that seemingly expect the Guards to keep their wagons busy bringing the defaulters back and forward.</P>
    <P>Previously, on an Estimate, I referred to the Ban-Ghardaí and I was told off by the former Minister.  They <Col N="155" /> look well and we have their counterparts in every city in Europe but, in my opinion, they would give better service if they were in civvies half the time.  I am in O'Connell Street often 20 times a day and I am tired of seeing children begging and &ldquo;spunkers&rdquo; annoying the public.  Then one or two Ban-Ghardaí come along and the defaulters go around the corner and are back again annoying the people when the Ban-Ghardaí have passed. The young girls who are soliciting on the streets have eyes in their heads. If they see Ban-Ghardaí coming they go around the corner until they have passed.</P>
    <P>The Ban-Ghardaí would give better service if they spent most of the time in civvies.  Wholesale pilfering goes on around Christmas.  If a person coming out of a shop with something under his coat sees a Garda on the left, he will turn right.  If he sees a Garda or a Ban-Gharda on the right, he will turn left.  If the Ban-Ghardaí were in civilian clothes, they would secure more convictions.  I have not seen much about their getting convictions. I do not know if they do much more than just walk around.  It may not be very gallant to criticise women but the public expect value for the expenditure.  I think the Ban-Ghardaí should spend half their time in civvies watching out for &ldquo;spunkers&rdquo;, pilferers and street-walkers.  They will not succeed in uniform; it gives them away.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with the subject of prisons.  During the Civil War, I was in jail as a political prisoner. Because I was on a commandeering job, I spent 12 months in the criminal part of the prison.  Therefore, I have a little experience of mixing with persons of a criminal type.  To a large extent, prisons are schools for crime. One prisoner tells another how successful he was as a criminal and what a fool the other was in not taking greater precautions, and what to do the next time.  That sort of thing goes on all the time.</P>
    <P>The Minister should segregate prisoners.  First-timers, irrespective of age, should not be allowed to associate <Col N="156" /> with habitual criminals, especially in the case of women, because many female prisoners are street-walkers. The Minister should know that, in his capacity as Minister for Justice.  It is not right that that type of person should be allowed to associate with someone who made a mistake.  One thing leads to the other.  These people meet one another on the streets after they have served their sentences and things develop.  It is wrong that people who made an error should have to associate with habitual criminals.  We all make a mistake at times.  Some people who are out would be in jail but for the fact that they were not caught.  That is my opinion.  Give people a chance.  Keep prisoners segregated and hope that those who made an error will not make a second one.  I am putting it to the Minister that prisoners should be segregated in that way.  The Minister should endeavour to have one person per cell.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am thinking of the past.  I know there is a good deal of homosexual crime on the continent.  Crowding encourages that sort of thing.  I am glad that the Minister is to consider the association between crime and health and that something will be done about it.  The Minister should consider homosexuality as a case for treatment rather than punishment.  Edmund Burke, the great orator, once tried to make the case that the law should not be so savage on homosexuals.  He was hounded for putting up that sort of defence and the suggestion was even made that he must have been interested in the matter himself.  That happens when people try to make others understand that certain crimes are not deliberate but are the result of mental unbalance.  The Minister realises that, judging by his reference to the fact that psychiatric treatment will be available for certain types of persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the annual Kevin Barry commemoration in Mountjoy.  I was present at the last commemoration ceremony.  The Press were greatly annoyed that they were <Col N="157" /> not allowed in.  I do not know whether that is because of regulations.  The Press were outside, taking pictures, but were not allowed inside.  They thought they should have been allowed inside and I think it would be no harm.</P>

      <P>People have come to me from time to time with bills from solicitors.  I feel that solicitors overcharge people. Certain classes of people who are afraid of the law will pay these costs rather than challenge them.  I know of a person who had a bill for legal costs amounting to £20 and who disputed the amount.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a committee actually sitting.  One of its duties is to see if costs can be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I want to bring home is that people who have no defending counsel do not know the procedure in regard to costs.  They do not know that costs can be challenged. I know that solicitors overcharge.  I had experience once of getting a <Col N="158" /> demand for £40.  I went about it and had the bill reduced to £12.  Many people do not know how to go about it.  People ought to know how to deal with these matters.  I understand that the referee will not hear a costs appeal, unless the appellant is represented by a solicitor.  In one case that I know of, a woman who was disputing a solicitor's bill of costs could not get any other solicitor to take up her case.  The poor woman was nearly demented.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that a member of the public should know what to do when he gets a bill of costs and should be able to go about it himself if he does not wish to obtain legal advice.  Some solicitors are all right but there are many sharks among the profession.  A long time ago, I represented a group of people.  Dancing in Lent was banned.  I was in the dance game at the time and represented a society of dance hall proprietors.  The cost in the district court was only £1. I got a bill for £20.  I inquired about it and was told that there were 20 persons in the society and they were being charged £1 each.  I, as one person, represented the society.  That is the way they go about things.</P>
      <P>The only remaining matter to which I want to direct the Minister's attention is the question of books and films. Since the cinema industry has been challenged by television, cinemas are falling back on sex to a great extent to attract patrons.  It would seem that sex films are an attraction, if one is to judge by one film being shown in town this week and which many people are raving about.  Persons under 18 years of age are not allowed in to see it. The emphasis is on sex in order to attract people to cinemas.  The Minister should be more watchful than ever because whether such films are shown to people under or over 18 years of age, there is a lot more being shown than was formerly the case, if the Minister knows what I mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been shocked on a few occasions&mdash;and I am not easily shocked&mdash;by the obsession with sex that there was in books from libraries which I have read.  The Minister should give this matter serious thought. <Col N="159" /> I do not know how such books get into libraries.  I would be ashamed to think that my children were reading such books.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a Border county, the first thing I should like to do is to welcome the statement of the Minister&mdash;which we knew about&mdash;that violence on the Border has ceased.  At the moment we can look forward to an end to this great mistake which has affected many young people at certain stages over decades. The terrible results individually and for the nation as a whole which follow on that sort of activity will not arise again.</P>
      <P>I welcome also the fact that it has been found possible to abandon the Special Criminal Court.  I hope also that in the future, in his wisdom, the Minister may see his way to commute some of the sentences at present being served.  It is true to say that when you make a martyr, you make a hero.  When this thing has died down completely, as it has, and when the question of punishment has been dealt with by the courts, the Minister, if he has the power, might consider releasing any person now serving a sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are none left &mdash;that is excellent.  I did not know it but it is excellent because, as I say, when you make a martyr, you make a hero.  That is a mistake.  I am violently opposed to any expression of sympathy which can be construed as an expression of approbation by politicians and members of the House on occasions when young men made the mistake of perpetrating violence on the Border.  I was heavily criticised for refusing to be associated with a vote of sympathy on a local board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as members of the House have the responsibility&mdash;and the Minister has lived up to that responsibility&mdash; of not giving expression to any emotion, be it sympathy or otherwise, which would <i>de facto</i> be an expression of approbation or support for such actions.  The Minister carried out <Col N="160" /> his duty well during the last trouble we had.  The period of the past 12 months which we are now debating was marked by an awareness of the responsibility of the Oireachtas and I hope that will continue.  Some years ago, that awareness was not so evident and after Border forays and incidents, members of the Oireachtas appeared at the funeral of some unfortunate mother's son of a tender age who had made that mistake.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Sherwin, the Minister said that the Press were not allowed into Mountjoy because of the fact that photographs might be taken which might show ways of escape to persons outside the prison who might want to help convicts.  That is an aspect of the Press which we should have a look at.  I remember a series which was run in a national paper, at a time when there were attempts at violence on the Border, giving clear indications of escapes.  I would appeal to the Press not to incite violence in any way by giving any appearance of approbation such as I mentioned that we might give.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to go on to something the Minister did not mention at all.  I have begun to worry&mdash;as have other members of the House and other people in the country &mdash;about the question of whether solicitors should be insurance agents in workmen's compensation cases, accident cases or motor car cases. Solicitors find themselves in the position of acting for a client who is taking an action against an insurance company&mdash;perhaps it is against an individual but really against the insurance company with which the individual is insured&mdash;and while they are not acting for the insurance company in the particular case, they are agents for the company.  That situation is quite difficult for solicitors and very often satisfaction is not got by the client.</P>
    <P>There is in all those cases the fact in the background&mdash;and I think the district justices are pretty realistic about it&mdash;that the insurance companies work out at the end of 12 months what their costs were for motoring accidents, workmen's compensation and personal <Col N="161" /> accidents, and on that basis raise their premiums for the following 12 months to meet that cost, plus the profits they desire.  While all that is true, it results in individuals very often getting very high awards, in my opinion, to the detriment of those who have to pay the increased premiums the following year. The solicitor may also find himself, while not breaching at all professional etiquette or professional ethics, actively interested in a case and, at the same time, agent for the company in some other cases.  I know of individual instances in which this did not react favourably and it might be wise to look at that problem in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned an Bord Uchtála which he called the Adoption Board.  I should like to say that I join with him in thanking those people for the wonderful work they are doing.  I believe that we have the most wonderful adoption system in the world.  The reason that is so is, I suppose, that 99.9 per cent. of the people belong to either one religious denomination or another, and it was quite easy for us to create a legal situation in which an adoption society could recommend to the Adoption Board, parents who wished to adopt children.  That situation, I think, is unique in itself because it means that a member of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland or the Methodist Church or any religious denomination, who was a prospective parent of a child could be inspected by the society of his religious denomination and after a period of months, be recommended to the Adoption Board.  The Adoption Board has done wonderful work and I am glad the Minister mentioned it.  I sincerely believe we have what must surely be the best adoption system in the world, a system which gives a great deal of happiness to many people who would otherwise be deprived of the joy of children, if God did not give them any of their own.</P>
    <P>Mention of censorship of books and films has been pretty general throughout the debate.  Quite frankly, I do not think I am a prude, any more than the Minister is, and I think censorship of books, plays and films is good. Perhaps there may be criticism one <Col N="162" /> way or another at times.  Deputy Sherwin believes that certain films are allowed public showing which, in his opinion, should not be allowed, but, at the same time, we might find other Deputies or people in the country who would be very critical on the basis that the Censorship Board is too strict. By and large, I think it is fair enough. I believe those people do a good job and, of course, as they go along, they have to make decisions.  Quite obviously, occasionally they will make a decision that is perhaps too harsh or perhaps too lenient.  They are human, just as we are.  I am sure people will agree that they do not muzzle us but that they seek to exclude the sort of literature and films to which Deputy Sherwin referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister devoted a large proportion of his speech to remarks about the Garda.  Before I say anything about that, I should like to congratulate a townsman of mine on his appointment as Assistant Commissioner. Mr. Michael Weymes received that appointment.  The decision to appoint him was a good one and he is one of the most respected persons in the locality.</P>
    <P>The Garda, in the last few years, have reached a crossroads in their history.  That was inevitable because the great majority came in at the same time and arrived at retirement age at approximately the same time and, so, over the past few years, we have had a great influx of new members.  I am sure the younger members of the Force now represent a higher majority than ever before.  I think they have done very well.  All the changes that have come about in recent years have not been without their troubles.  Any change in personnel will make for difficulties, but any member of this House and of the general public will agree that the young Garda, arriving at a time of a colossal increase in traffic, some considerable increase in juvenile delinquency and the change in the pattern of national life, have given a very good account of themselves and that they will, with the guidance of the older officers, who are so much respected, continue to do so and become themselves leaders of the Force we admire so much.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" /> I disagree with the Minister in what he says on pages 16 and 17 of his statement regarding the mechanisation and motorisation of the Force and that the numbers would be reduced.  I do not think a squad car is any sort of substitute for a good sergeant and a couple of good Gardaí in a country station.  These men, particularly those who have reached the rank of sergeant without going any further, are excellent people and are pillars of the society in which they live.  They know everybody, the fathers and mothers, the families and their habits and for that reason, it is easy to be a good policeman in the country areas.</P>
    <P>You will never get the same sort of service by using a number of squad cars with a smaller number of Gardaí stationed in the larger centres.  I know it is not proposed to cut down all the country stations but I believe that the country Garda stations in each town and village are a necessary part of our set-up.  It is questionable whether you will save a lot by mechanisation, although you are going to require an increased degree of mechanisation in the control of traffic and crowds.  The Minister spoke of walkie-talkie apparatus.  That will all come in time but I should like to make the point that it is no substitute for a good Garda sergeant and a couple of good Gardaí in the country areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin mentioned the Ban-Ghardaí. I think it is a horrible job for a girl and I cannot make up my mind whether they are needed.  They came at the same time as we made up our mind to stop the export of horses. There was a certain number of other causes at that time.  You will always have these causes and people to support them but if you go from one of them to the other, you will generally find that it is the same people who support them all, the majority of them crackpots and still more of them retired crackpots.  It would be much better if, instead of having these Ban-Ghardaí, we had a half dozen trained nurses employed by the Minister in the big centres of population.</P>
    <P>You might need a few plain clothes <Col N="164" /> girls who would walk through these self-service stores.  There is not the slightest doubt that this type of store will increase, not only where groceries and goods of that type are concerned, but also with regard to hosiery and other such goods.  There is little doubt that you will have self-service in establishments like Marks and Spencer's and people going in there and taking nylons and other goods.  There you will have the need of plainclothes girls to watch these shops but the sight of two girls in uniform coming down the street, as I see them here in Dublin, no matter how nice the uniform looks, only gives the impression that they have big feet. I think it is a horrible job and it is a mistake that we have inflicted it on them.  Judging by the type of girl and the education they have, they would have got jobs anywhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right to be worried about juvenile delinquency.  This is not an Irish problem only; it is a world problem which has come with modern living.  The vast majority of parents cannot now go home, sit down and say that they will have the Rosary at 9 o'clock.  That set-up has gone with modern living.  You have shift work, overtime, travelling to work and all the other devices that have come about to make people work harder.  People have not the time to exercise the same amount of parental control as formerly and there is no use in blaming the parents for it. They are living in a modern whirligig and they have not the opportunity to give their children the training our fathers had.</P>
    <P>There is some substitute so that the idle time of juveniles may be employed. In Drogheda, we have two boys' clubs which are run by a curate who was a famous athlete and footballer. These clubs, one in an old housing estate and another in a new housing estate, are a wonderful success.  The one in the new estate serves about 1,000 houses.  The boys have their own club and their own governing body.  If a boy does something he should not do, such as using bad language, he is sent away and told not to come back for a month.  The boys govern themselves and, as a result, we <Col N="165" /> have had a great improvement in the behaviour of the boys in the town and I feel that this training is fitting them for after-life in a wonderful way.</P>
    <P>In Drogheda, we gave a grant for the setting up of these clubs and I think the Minister might consider whether the Government could give some help towards the setting up of these institutions.  There should also be girls' clubs because there is delinquency amongst girls also.  Where you have a third of the people working in the daytime, a third of them at night time and another third working in the day and doing overtime afterwards, you have a state of affairs in which the young people are left very much to themselves.  The clubs are a substitute for home life and it is much better to have a boys' club, with table tennis, billiards, suitable films and meetings for debates, than to have a situation where the husband is away half the time on shift work and does not know the whereabouts of his boys of 14 and 15 years of age.  It is modern life and we have to face up to this question and see what we can do about it.  I suggest to the Minister that what is being done in my constituency to combat juvenile delinqueny is about the best thing he could do throughout the country for the benefit of both boys and girls.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to motoring offences and to the 10/- fine.  That seems a good idea but it bypasses such things as the irritating problem of travelling behind the slow driver on the middle of the road.  This problem of the slow driver could be eradicated if traffic moved faster through cities and towns.  It would also make for less congestion on the roads.  Because of the cost, we cannot knock down rows of houses to make roads four times as wide as they are, but we should try to get at this motorist who drives slowly on the centre of the road and we could try as well to get traffic moving faster through towns and cities. The slow driver is much more dangerous sometimes than the road hog because he tries the temper of the man driving behind him and the driver's seat of a car is no place in which to lose one's temper.</P>
    <P>The prime necessity, then, is to try <Col N="166" /> to speed up the flow of traffic through the streets of cities and towns.  In that connection, I do not suppose I shall be very popular when I say that the standard of driving in this country is not very high.  I am hopeful that the initiation of the driving test under our new traffic legislation will promote better driving.  It may also improve the flow of traffic through cities and towns.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned recent legislation which enables justices to send young girls to convents and boys to institutions while awaiting trial, rather than send them to goals.  That is an excellent idea but it is a pity it had to be introduced because of incidents which provoked a considerable degree of publicity.  Now that it has come, however, I congratulate the Minister and his Department on it.  It must have been a horrible situation for a Garda superintendent to find himself in the position of having to take to prison a young girl due to be tried ten days later for some offence.  I hope this new legislation will be used to the full by the Garda.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the question of the use of police dogs, which received considerable publicity during the year.  I should not like to be quoted as saying I am on the side of the dogs but I nearly would say it. I saw a photograph of one incident in which dogs were involved, I studied it very closely and as I have been handling dogs all my life&mdash;at present, I have four&mdash;I can say that the police dog in question was under perfect control.  The dog was on a short lead and the Garda also had a little leather thing which he could use for banging the dog on the head, if he became obstreperous.  As I say, the dog appeared to be under complete control.</P>

      <P>Another good thing about my Party is that we can disagree on certain matters.  I set out canvassing during the last election and went to a housing area, taking with me on a lead the most amiable of dogs, a Labrador retriever who spends his time playing with my children and licking them.  After half a day, however, <Col N="167" /> I had to take him home because while I was talking to a housewife on her doorstep, one of her children came out, saw the dog and turned around to run screaming into the house.  A number of people in this country feel the same when they see either a dog or a horse.  They get frightened immediately.  Under similar circumstances in country areas, people feel no emotion because they are used to handling animals.</P>
      <P>I suppose it will come to the situation when we must agree that police dogs should not be used and that they will not be used in the future.  As I said earlier, I am nearly on the side of the dogs.  I do not think they bit anybody; I believe they were under perfect control on all occasions; and that the hullabaloo was caused largely by hysteria which eventually became mass hysteria brought about because so many of our people are becoming urban-minded and have grown unused to handling animals.  The use of police horses has become accepted widely in Britain but I feel they would get the same reception here as did the dogs for the reason I have stated.  You will get half a dozen people to say the horse walked on their toes, when a horse will go to the ends of the earth to avoid walking on anybody.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not make any mention of a matter which happened at the end of the year and which should be discussed because I do not think there is any point in cloaking it any longer since it is not <i>sub judice.</i> The Singer case was a terrible reflection on the prosecuting machinery of this country.  It is true to say that a large number of people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I was about to say that as a result of the outcome of that case a large number of people lost considerable amounts of money and that very few of them could afford it because they were old people who needed a greater return for their investments and who, by advertisements which some newspapers printed and <Col N="168" /> others did not, were gulled into thinking they would make more money.  In my opinion, the Minister and the Government did not face up to their responsibility in their dealing with this ghastly failure to bring to justice those who succeeded in perpetrating this common fraud.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt the Minister and the Department worked hard during the year.  The Minister introduced his law reform programme.  He had the duty of steering it through the House and we had the duty of examining it as it went through.  I presume that when this programme has been completed, another will follow it immediately afterwards, rendered necessary by the changing pattern of modern living. When it does, I hope that Deputy M. J. O'Higgins will be doing the Minister's job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>A week ago, the Minister found it necessary to take the unprecedented and unusual course of making a public appearance on television, urging the public to give greater co-operation to the police.  He did so in regard to a murder investigation in the Midlands.  There is no doubt that the circumstances warranted such intervention by the Minister.  We can only hope that it will be fruitful. Nonetheless, it is, perhaps, true to say that there is a lack of public co-operation with the police, not only in this particular case but in other matters as well.  I think the Minister should explain the state of his mind to us on this matter and he should tell us whether or not he has, for example, consulted with the Minister for Education as to what basic fundamental steps can be taken, if necessary, in our schools, to rid our people of a very deep-seated tradition, of lack of co-operation with the police by reason of the fact that 50 or 60 years ago the police in this country were agents of an alien oppressor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Old traditions die hard.  We, unfortunately, <Col N="169" /> find ourselves in the position that there is not always that full co-operation with the police authorities we would all like to see. I believe it is a serious matter which should be very fully investigated at the educational level because I believe that the place in which the matter can be rectified is in our schools.  Has the Minister consulted the Minister for Education about this?  There is a great need for teaching civics in our schools which would be one of the steps which might achieve results in this respect.</P>
    <P>I am very apprehensive of a policy which appears to me to have been enunciated by the Minister in his speech here today, a policy of cutting down the numbers of the police force in the future by reason of the mechanical aids, radio, police cars and such like, of which increasing use is being made.  Like the last speaker, I feel very strongly that a patrol car is no adequate substitute for the Garda on foot.  The psychological impact of seeing the Garda patrolling one's district at regular frequent intervals is very considerable.  It is something which inspires the law-abiding citizen with tremendous confidence.</P>
    <P>It is true that in many parts of Dublin nowadays one rarely sees a policeman on foot patrol.  You see them flashing by in patrol cars or going by on bicycles but the old-style patrol with which we were familiar in our childhood is something which appears to be dying out.  I regret that very much.  In Dublin in particular, in regard to the surveillance function of the police force, there is a particular problem.  In the blocks of Corporation flats which are frequently very large communities, as far as I know&mdash;and I say this subject to correction&mdash;the policeman on patrol will not normally enter the forecourt or the courtyard in order to keep his weather eye open for trouble.</P>
    <P>These closely in-bred communities, so to speak, are places where delinquency among children in particular can be quite contagious.  I am sure the Minister, as a Dublin Deputy, is familiar with a problem which all of us Dublin Deputies come up against <Col N="170" /> from time to time&mdash;the case of a tenant of a flat scheme who approaches a public representative terribly anxious and terribly concerned to get a transfer by reason of the fact that his children are being subjected to scandal and bad example.  We must have tremendous sympathy for parents in such a position.  The police should keep a closer watch on these areas, but, for some technical reason, I believe they stay out of the flat schemes.  If they kept a closer watch on them, much could be achieved.</P>
    <P>The same consideration applies to public parks and gardens.  I am not at present a member of the Corporation but I do recall, when I was a member of the Streets Committee of the Corporation, we were very concerned about serious misbehaviour in certain parks under Corporation control. It was not possible to obtain police action in the normal course of things in such places.  If there is some anachronism in the law or some technical consideration here, it is one which the Minister should take a look at.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that the Minister in his speech is able to report some measure of improvement in the living accommodation of the Garda. There are even in Dublin city too many cases in which members of the police force have to live in squalid conditions.  We have in the Garda at present a highly educated type of young man who is entitled to the best living conditions and who regards first-class living conditions, very rightly, as being of equal importance to him as his pay and promotion prospects.  I welcome the steps which the Minister is taking to improve police accommodation and I would urge him to intensify the pace of the development.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that, when we erect new housing areas, the provision of amenities is one of the points that is looked at last of all.  We first of all build the houses.  It is only at a very late stage in the day that we think of providing schools, churches and police stations.  Cabra, which is an area developed ten or 15 years ago, is only now being provided with a <Col N="171" /> police station.  I think I detect a change of policy in that a police station is to be built in Raheny, which is still in the development stage. Possibly that is because of the Minister's close interest in the particular area.  I hope I am not being uncharitable when I say that.  I would urge that the provision of police stations in new housing areas is something which should be regarded as urgent while the houses are being built and before the people are moved out in large numbers to these areas.</P>
    <P>Again, in regard to the question of Garda pay and conditions, the Minister has reported that arbitration proceedings are at present going on.  It is my personal hope that these proceedings will result in a pay improvement for the Force, putting them on a par with their colleagues across the border and in Great Britain, because the Garda for too long have been the Cinderellas of the public service.</P>
    <P>The Minister had nothing whatever to say about the appalling traffic conditions in Dublin city.  The traffic conditions in the capital city are so chaotic as to warrant particular mention by the Minister, without any apology in this House to those who come from other areas.  I think I have seen recently that further parking restrictions are about to be imposed either by the police or by the Dublin Corporation.  One of the odd things about traffic control in Dublin is that it is very hard to know who has the last word in the matter.  I urge upon the Minister that no further parking restrictions whatsoever should be imposed until Dublin Corporation or the police authorities see fit to provide motorists with alternative parking accommodation.  At present, one would think the average Dublin motorists is a criminal.  It is no solution whatever to the problem to tell him that he should park out in the suburbs and travel into town on the bus.  The inactivity of the public authority in Dublin in the matter of parking accommodation must be severely condemned by all reasonable people.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not believe there are <Col N="172" /> enough police in Dublin either for the patrol function to which I have referred or for traffic control.  I know of one traffic junction&mdash;the corner of Fitzwilliam Place and Leeson Street&mdash; which is attended to at tea time but is not attended to at lunch time.  At lunch time, when the traffic is almost as congested as it is at tea time, there is nobody on patrol duty there.  Yet, there is nearly as great a problem on this main artery going out of town at lunch time as there is at tea time. I can only assume that the reason is lack of manpower.</P>
    <P>Like all of us, the Minister is concerned about the growing problem of juvenile delinquency.  Deputy Donegan made a very worthwhile suggestion in regard to the splendid work done by youth clubs in combating delinquency, in keeping our young people occupied and in training them as useful citizens. I should like to support Deputy Donegan's plea for greater official interest in the work of these clubs. I think it is true to say that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of zealous voluntary workers engaged in youth work are thwarted at every hand's turn by lack of funds and that these people have to devote much of their time to petty fund-raising activities.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that, in these days of growing prosperity it should be necessary to depend on the sixpenny raffle and the 1/- pool for the advancement of work which is so much in the public interest.  This is a matter to which I referred on a previous occasion on the Vote for the Department of Education.  It is true that, to a very limited extent, that Department takes some part in youth work through Comhairle le Leas Oige.  There are many youth clubs outside the scope of Comhairle le Leas Oige.</P>
    <P>There is a great lack of resources and finance for this excellent voluntary work.  I believe that the Minister, a Dublin Deputy and more familiar with this problem of delinquency than the Minister for Education, should take a greater interest in this matter.  He might well find a partial solution to some of his problems in encouraging and fostering the voluntary activities of the hundreds of zealous persons who <Col N="173" /> are concerned with youth welfare in this city.</P>
    <P>The Minister has adverted to the initiation of the legal aid scheme during the past year.  I would press on him the viewpoint that the legal aid scheme which we have at present is only a start.  It is only a step in the right direction.  It is a scheme which as far as I know is confined to criminal cases.  Deputy Sherwin this evening referred very eloquently and very knowledgeably to certain types of legal proceedings in the Dublin District Court, proceedings for possession of Corporation houses and other tenancies. There is also the question of hire purchase cases.  Two years ago, we introduced a very comprehensive Hire-Purchase Act which is of little avail to poor people, to ill-informed people, if they are not aware of their rights.  For that reason, I would urge in the case of such ill-informed people, who invariably are ill-informed in these matters by reason of their lack of financial means, that there is great need to extend the helping hand of the legal aid scheme to them.</P>
    <P>In connection with law reform, the Minister has set out quite a lengthy list of measures which have been promoted in the past year and upon which he is working at present.  I notice amongst the list a Pawn-brokers Bill.  I urge the Minister to go a step further and to have a look at the present state of the law relating to moneylending which, in my view, needs reform.</P>
    <P>I must refer to a matter to which I did not intend to refer.  The last speaker mentioned the use of dogs by the police in Dublin some weeks ago. I do not propose to go into any detail on the matter because it is a problem that has been well threshed out here. I feel compelled to make my protest as an individual Deputy about the misuse of police dogs in Dublin. These tracker dogs should be confined to tracking down criminals, for which they are trained.  I believe the explanation of their use some weeks ago is that it was a mistake.  If that is so, the Minister should admit it was a mistake which he regrets and which will not recur.  He should give an assurance that for the future he will see to it that the use of these dogs is <Col N="174" /> confined to tracking down criminals and they will not be availed of to thwart the constitutional right of any citizen&mdash;no matter who he is and no matter how much we disagree with him&mdash;to make his legitimate protest.</P>
    <P>If it was a mistake, and I believe it was, I am appalled at the idea that there may exist in the police service persons who are capable of making such a mistake, who are not trained in such a way that they would recoil automatically and instinctively from any infringement of the liberty of the individual.  We cannot compare police dogs with the horses which have been referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all bitten with this canine question.  I do not desire to develop it further, but we see, from some of the interjections from the Deputies opposite, that the use of dogs is apparently justified in their eyes if the orders of the Garda are not carried out.  We must consider whether all orders of Garda in times of stress and strain are reasonable and are given by them in a reasonable manner, in such a manner as to encourage obedience. Any Deputy who is a motorist will probably have been questioned from time to time by members of the Garda in some small way in relation to traffic offences.  There is hardly a Deputy, I suppose, who could not relate some incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own experience comes readily to hand.  When lawfully and properly driving at Christchurch Place, I was stopped by a member of the Garda in the first few weeks of the year because my car did not bear a current tax disc, due to no fault of my own but due to the volume of work which the tax office had to overcome at that time.  I was treated as though I were a common criminal.  I was asked for an explanation, and the request for the explanation was given in a most <Col N="175" /> hostile manner.  When the explanation was given&mdash;I having counted up to ten before I gave it&mdash;I got the answer: &ldquo;Do you expect me to believe that story?&rdquo; I told him he could check it, and he said he knew that very well and that he would see me again.  He asked my occupation, but I did not recite my occupation as a public representative.  I suppose if I had, there might have been a change of tune on his part.  As soon as I got to my destination, I found that, at long last, my tax disc had been supplied along with my driving licence and other documents.  I posted them that evening by registered post to the station of the Garda in question, and that was the end of it.  That was an incident in the middle of the day when law-abiding citizens are entitled to be treated with respect by members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Are we to take it from the interjections of some Deputies opposite that a member of the Garda would be entitled to turn a dog on an unsuspecting motorist, or that the Garda should have a dog by his side lest some member of the public might properly take exception to being addressed in that manner?  We are trying to teach our young people kindness to animals.  What example is it when one hears of the use of animals deliberately for the purpose of attacking human beings&mdash;for the purpose of frightening human beings, if we confine it to that only?  A dog baring its teeth and growling fiercely can strike terror into the heart of a person, but at the same time we tell children to love dogs and be kind to animals.  It is simply a stupid fallacy. It is grossly unnecessary to use animals in that way.</P>
    <P>Since I have touched on this question of teaching children to be kind to animals, let me recite another recent incident of very bad relations, as far as the Garda are concerned.  In a Dublin suburb, there was a very popular dog, much loved by the local children.  The dog allowed the children to ride on its back and to pull it around.  Apparently, it was discovered it was annoying sheep on the <Col N="176" /> local mountains and, very properly I suppose, an order was made for its destruction.</P>
    <P>What did the Garda do?  Four of them arrived from the local station in a squad car.  The dog was concerned in the back garden of the house in which it lived.  It was tied to a pole holding up a clothes line, and in the sight of all the children in this crescent, it was shot by the Garda. This was in the middle of the day.  Is that not an appalling display on the part of the guardians of the peace and those who represent the State, those who should encourage people to have love for animals and to be kind to them?</P>
    <P>I would hope we will have an end, once and for all, to the use of dogs by the police when they want to break up political demonstrations.  If those Deputies on the opposite side, now howling for the use of dogs, would consider for a moment that the day might come when they would be out of office and that those dogs might be used against them, they might think twice about it.  If you give your blessing to the use of dogs now, you are opening the door for the use, and misuse, of these animals in the future.  I do not think this House should countenance that at all.</P>
    <P>Last year, I voiced a certain amount of criticism concerning the use of batons by the Garda on traffic duty in Dublin.  There were those who disagreed with me.  They thought it would assist in the control of traffic at the major junctions to have the Garda armed with batons.  As a result of allowing the use of these to continue, we have a new game called &ldquo;cop the cop&rdquo;.  What you are required to do is to cop what the &ldquo;cop&rdquo; is doing.  It is a very difficult game to play, because the waving of the stick behind the Garda's back, the twirling of it down at knee-level, the swinging of it under the other arm, all can mean the same thing.  The pointing of it at one or the twirling of it up in the air as though it were an umbrella can all mean the same thing.  But if you are unfortunate enough to mistake what it means, you may find yourself getting an abusive address in the middle of a <Col N="177" /> busy crossing while the rest of the traffic is left to find its own merry way home.</P>
    <P>There was a time when our point duty men were our pride and joy.  If they gave a signal, what it meant was quite clear.  Their arms were out-stretched to one side or the other and there could be no doubt as to what the signal meant.  That happy position disappeared the day the baton was introduced.  It need not have disappeared if the Garda had received proper training in the use of the baton. It may be that they did receive such training, but, if they did, they are certainly not putting it into operation and the performance of most of our men on duty in Dublin at the present time is quite scandalous.  I have seen many near collisions at many of our major traffic junctions because of the unfortunate signals now being given.</P>
    <P>It is grossly unfair to city motorists and pedestrians, but what the unfortunate people from the country are meant to understand by the gyrations of our point duty men with the baton, I certainly do not know, and I am certain the unfortunate people from the country do not know either.  I would appeal, therefore, for the immediate withdrawal of these batons, once and for all.  If the Minister has no will to go so far, then I suggest that definite steps should be taken to ensure that the batons are properly used and not used in substitution for the signals laid down in the regulations, signals which are clearly intelligible to everybody, but are used rather to assist people in interpreting these signals.  If that is not done, there will be very serious consequences and, if our district court justices are as observant as the rest of the motorists, I do not think they will be able to penalise anybody for misinterpreting most of the signals given at the present time in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is a maxim our courts try to apply, and which we all respect, that not only should justice be done but that justice should be seen to be done. It is regrettable that there are on the bench here a very small minority of judicial bullies who misuse their high office for the purpose of terrorising lawyers and lay people who appear <Col N="178" /> before them and justice may not seem to be done in their courts.  I could, I think, give on the fingers of one hand the number of such gentlemen, but, as they are there, and as they are misusing their high office, it is necessary that it should be pointed out here in this House that there lies in this Oireachtas of Dáil and Seanad Éireann the power to remove judges and justices from office.  Some of them are sailing pretty close to the wind and the day may not be too far distant when a resolution may be tabled here to remove from office some of those who are using what they apparently consider to be an impregnable position to abuse lawyers and lay people appearing before them.</P>
    <P>It is undesirable to mention names and you, Sir, might not perhaps allow me to mention names.  If, however, there is a continuance of this conduct in future, names will have to be mentioned here because it is grossly unfair that the judiciary in general should receive a bad name because of the misconduct of a few members.  There is one member of the High Court who is known for his opposition to the solicitors' profession and has been known on a number of occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sir, I have been particularly careful not to name anybody, but I still think it is undesirable that a member of the judiciary, who cannot be answered back in court, should frequently accuse solicitors, naming them, of professional negligence and <Col N="179" /> of contempt of court.  The only place in which members of the judiciary can be named or can be criticised is here in this House.  Were that done anywhere else, the person abusing his high office could hold the complainant in contempt of court.  It is necessary now that a warning go out, once and for all, that this situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.  It is contrary to justice since, not only is justice not being done but it is not seen to be done in that particular gentleman's court.  He has been known, perhaps, because he has a grudge against some members of the solicitor's profession who were not very generous with their briefs to him before he became a judge, to stop quite improperly costs being given to solicitors on the most fantastic grounds.  It should lie on that man's conscience forever that he has done so.  An appeal could lie to the Supreme Court but, if a solicitor is worth anything&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunately true that never in the history of this State has the morale of the Garda Síochána been so low. The reason for that lies directly and personally with the present Minister. For one thing, he allowed the Force to expect great things.  I think it was at the end of last year and in the beginning of this year a crisis situation <Col N="180" /> arose in the Garda.  Men who had very genuine grievances were agitating. A large section of the Force&mdash; the men who will man the Force in the years to come&mdash;were deprived of any share in a pay award.  When they took very proper steps to voice their grievance, they were threatened with disciplinary action.  A very dangerous situation was avoided only because of the intervention of a high Church dignitary.  If it had not been for that intervention, we should have found ourselves facing a very serious situation.</P>
    <P>We should, I suppose, be grateful that it has passed, but the cause of the difficulty has not yet been cured. The men who were denied a share in the pay award last year have not yet got it and the restiveness has permeated to all the Garda.  It is not just confined to the men with five years' service, or less&mdash;it has permeated the whole Force.</P>
    <P>However, this deterioration in morale is not confined to the Garda alone.  The Department of Justice is one of the few Departments that had not lost its head in the modern race to apply Parkinson's Law but it would seem that of late a very bad spirit has crept into the Department.  We have had the extraordinary situation of some officers of that Department actually reverting in rank because of the appalling spirit which now prevails in the Department.  That is not something which happened lightly. Civil servants do not lightly revert in rank and such a situation indicates that there is something very wrong.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
