      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach if in view of his statement of 27th April, 1962 that when this country joins the EEC there will be no drawing-out again he intends to make himself and the country fully aware of, and influence if need be, the political and defence commitments of membership before accepting such membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have stated here on earlier occasions, full information will be made available in due course as a basis for discussion by the Dáil of whatever decision may be proposed by the Government in relation to membership of the European Economic Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that, in the negotiations now being carried on in relation to the industrial and agricultural commitments involved in joining EEC, the discussions relative to those negotiations could be carried on in the context of the political and defence commitments also?  That would save the Government finding themselves presenting possibly unacceptable political and defence commitments&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is an argument, not a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that it is desirable to carry <Col N="456" /> on the negotiations in respect of the industrial, agricultural, political and defence commitments concurrently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an argument, not a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree it would be desirable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think I do.  The Deputy can be assured the Government will propose to the Dáil nothing that we believe would be unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the position previously indicated by the Taoiseach still stands, namely, that when we are told the conditions under which we may join, these conditions will be made available to the House, so that they may be studied and understood and, with full knowledge of what they are, the House will then take a decision as to whether or not we shall join the Common Market?  Is that still the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I have just said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from making these proposals available to the Dáil, does the Taoiseach intend that the people should be given an opportunity to voice their approval, or otherwise, of such a very important issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's proposals will be made to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only to the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach anticipate that, when the Dáil is asked to make a decision, this decision will include any proposals there may be in respect of defence policy and the political implications of our entry into the Common Market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be assured the Dáil will be given all information relative to the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>What I asked specifically was: does the Taoiseach believe that, when proposals are submitted, they will include political implications and defence commitments <Col N="457" /> into which we might be asked to enter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it not possible to answer it?  Is it because nobody knows?  Is it because not only the Taoiseach but the other countries involved do not know what the political or defence commitments are?  Is that the reason these are not discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, negotiations in that regard are going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody knows.  Does anybody know, as far as the Taoiseach is aware, what the political and defence commitments are in regard to the proposal for ourselves and, say, Britain joining EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy means that there is no document in which these matters are specifically defined, that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach the reasons why he believes it desirable that the Government should be aware of, and negotiate on, the industrial and agricultural implications of entering EEC, but undesirable that it should look for formal or informal consultations concerning the political and defence implications of such membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The general obligations in the economic field of membership of the European Economic Community are clear from the text of the Rome Treaty.  Article 237, however, prescribes that the conditions of admission and the consequential adaptations of the Treaty required on the entry of a new member are to be the subject of an agreement between the applicant and the existing members. Hence, a country wishing to become a member must undertake negotiations to that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The political implications of membership of the Community are in an entirely different category, as they are nowhere precisely defined and are, <Col N="458" /> indeed, still the subject of negotiations among the Six.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say broadly, from what he knows, does our joining EEC mean the abandonment of our neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could it happen that, having reached agreement on the economic, agricultural, social, and other matters of that kind, this country could then join EEC, without knowing what the political and defence commitments might be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This country is negotiating for membership of the European Economic Community, and that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that this country is negotiating only on the industrial and agricultural end?  Surely there are negotiations also going on on the defence commitments and the political implications?  Is that not the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are negotiating for accession to the Rome Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are not the political and defence commitments vitally important, apart altogether from the industrial and agricultural commitments? If it were found that there was a workable agreement in regard to the latter, could it happen that this country would then join EEC, without realising what the defence and political commitments were likely to be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy again to the terms of the Rome Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say which comes first&mdash;the political and defence commitments, or the industrial and agricultural commitments? Which is given priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that there is no obligation on us to enter into a military agreement as a condition of our entering the Common Market?  Is it not also a fact that we <Col N="459" /> ought not to insinuate a military agreement on ourselves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is certainly no commitment of that kind involved in acceptance of the Rome Treaty, but it is clear the Treaty envisages something more than a mere trading arrangement.  The aim is to establish a situation which will encourage the political integration of Western Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>A good deal of Europe belongs to us.  We ought to have an interest in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that we have, through the Taoiseach, subscribed to the political and defence implications of the Bonn Declaration, which must be taken in conjunction with the Rome Treaty?  In these circumstances, is it a fact that the Taoiseach has not found out what exactly the Bonn Declaration means by any political or defence commitments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bonn Declaration provided for the instruction of a committee to draw up a convention for the consideration of the different Governments.  That committee has not drawn up a convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the negotiations taking place now with regard to economic matters meet with approval as far as the Government are concerned does that mean that the Government will accept any political or defence commitments that may be arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will accept nothing that it does not know all about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already said that he accepted the political and defence objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already said that he will accept the political and defence commitments in the Common Market.  How will he get out of that now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>

    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b><Col N="460" /> asked the Taoiseach whether this country's delegation to Brussels concerned with Ireland's application to join the EEC has been asked by the EEC powers to discuss, or may themselves initiate discussions on, the political or defence implications or commitments arising out of Ireland's proposed membership of the EEC and this country's acceptance of the provisions of the Bonn Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is in the negative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the approximate total population which would be supported by all the food produced in the country, basing the calculation on present agricultural output and standards of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to give the particulars requested by the Deputy since the pattern of food exports differs fundamentally from the pattern of food items retained for domestic consumption and because domestic consumption also includes various imported foodstuffs. An estimate of the proportion of agricultural output which is exported can however be made.  For the year 1960, the latest period for which detailed particulars are available, it is estimated that the value at agricultural prices of the principal exports of food items (including the estimated agricultural content of processed foodstuffs) was 37.5 per cent. of the value at agricultural prices of the total output of food items produced in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary not give me even a rough figure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to the statement made on 3rd May by Col. T. J. McKinney, at Pelican House, in which he said that the charge for blood for transfusion purposes would have to be increased in the <Col N="461" /> near future; whether he will consider taking steps to avoid the necessity for such an increase by granting further assistance to the National Blood Transfusion Association; and if he will give an account of the means whereby the blood transfusion service is at present financed, with an account of the sources from which it receives such finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the statement made by Col. T.J. McKinney, Chairman of the National Blood Transfusion Association, in the course of his annual report to the effect that consideration would have to be given to the revision of the service charges for blood and blood products.  Any change in such charges proposed by the Association would require my approval.  If such proposals should be made by the Association the Deputy may be assured that I will consider them very carefully having regard to the undesirability of increasing the charges unless this is shown to be unavoidable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the financing of the work of the Association, substantial grants amounting to a total of £86,385 were made available from the Exchequer in the period up to the end of 1954, during the early stages of the development of the service.  Since then the Association has met its outgoings through the service charges levied for blood and blood products, and laboratory services.  Depending on the circumstances, these charges fall to be <Col N="462" /> met by health authorities, voluntary hospitals or private individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) (for the Minister for Transport and Power)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fixing of charges for electricity and for services rendered is, subject to the provisions of Section 21 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, the sole responsibility of the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>I am, however, informed by the Board that where a seasonal consumer insists on disconnection during the winter the reconnection fee to be charged in future will be 30/- instead of 10/- as heretofore, and that the bimensal fixed charge will as heretofore continue to be charged even when the premises are not occupied, as long as these premises remain connected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question of a duplicate charge being made.  Either the premises remain connected and the <Col N="468" /> bimensal fixed charge is payable or the premises are disconnected, in which case this charge is not payable, but a charge of 30/- is made for reconnection.</P>
    <P>The Board state that the former arrangement, whereby a fee of only 10/- was charged for disconnection and reconnection, had become uneconomic and, because of the high peaks of activity at the beginning and end of each season, was dislocating normal district work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister tell me that the ESB cannot, without disrupting their normal work, connect and disconnect the few dozen houses at seaside resorts which have to be connected every year at the beginning of the season and disconnected at the end of the season?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a 300 per cent. increase in charges for work which takes not more than five minutes in each house.  In most seaside resorts, there are 20 or 30 houses&mdash;sometimes more &mdash;that have to be disconnected at the end of a season, for example.  All that work could be done in one day.  Does the Minister not agree that it is exorbitant to increase the charge to 30/-?  Does he further agree that it is reasonable that the ESB should now be allowed to charge people for houses that are disconnected because, no matter what they have told him, I have a letter in my possession saying they will continue the charge whether or not the house is disconnected? I shall supply it to the Minister for his information later.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether his Department has had any consultations with the British National Coal Board with regard to the proposed increase in the price of British coal in Ireland; whether he has any reason to think that such an increase might be followed by increases in the price of other coal in this country; and whether he will take steps to endeavour to prevent a rise in the price of coal generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the price of coal in Britain is being increased by varying amounts according to type and grade and that these increases will apply also to exports to this country.  The matter has not been the subject of consultation between my Department and the National Coal Board but there have been discussions at commercial level between the Coal Board and the Irish Coal Importers' Association.</P>
      <P>Supplies of coal, other than British coal, continue to be freely available at cheaper prices and the Deputy has, no doubt, seen the statement by the Coal Importers' Association that no increase in selling price will be necessary in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>In the long term the price of imported coal must, of course, depend on world market prices which are beyond our control.  I cannot say how these prices may fluctuate in the future.</P>

      <P>It is not normal to require payments in advance of the order indicated in the Deputy's question before installing a telephone.  The Department reserves the right, however, <Col N="479" /> to require payment in advance in any case where it considers that course to be justified, for example, where the capital cost of installation is abnormally high and where there is, in addition, more than normal risk that the service will not be retained for the full initial period of contract. Even in such cases the payment in advance is usually only a fraction of the capital cost involved.  Since there is no installation charge, the requirement is not at all unreasonable.</P>

It is possible they may be able to clear up certain doubts which exist in my mind about their propositions because it is always open to reasoned arguments and it is possible they have reasoned arguments as to why they believe in a certain line concerning the organisation of the health services.</P>
      <P>My uncertainty arises in respect to the means test to which I have referred and to the insurance principle.  It appears that there are two broad propositions put forward by members of the Opposition.  One is for a scheme based on the insurance principle with a means test and another, put forward by my friends in the Labour Party, for an insurance scheme without a means test.  I should like to know, first of all, from the main Opposition Party how they come to their particular computation of the permissible income level which they would fix for their means test.  Some figure like £800 a year, or £50 valuation, was mentioned by Deputy Hogan.</P>
      <P>I should like to know on what grounds this £800 a year or the £50 valuation is fixed.  It seems to me a very crude method of assessing a person's ability to pay for health services. A person may be a bachelor and may have £800 a year, while another may be a married man with eight or ten children on the same income.  Similarly there may be any amount of variation within those figures.  Why not, say, £801, £805, £809 or £810? Why not £700?  This is the fixing of some mystical figure which seems to me not to relate to anything that has any rational basis.  It is something which I have never understood in respect to this apportionment of a service based on a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand it and nobody has ever tried to explain to me what is the necessity for a means test.  Why should there have to be a means test? I have given my objections to means tests&mdash;the obvious one that as far as my own experience is concerned a means test in medicine means dividing <Col N="488" /> the service into two kinds, one, a first class superlative service made available subject to a means test and, two, one on a lesser standard, even if it is not bad.  Sometimes, in fact, the second one may be quite good.  I never can see the occasion for insisting on the retention of a means test.  There is a medical reason, I suppose.  I think there are two standards of medicine usually in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another objection is based simply on administration.  It leads to the creation of an unnecessary bureaucracy; it is clumsy and it tends to appear unjust.  It may be just and reasonable but it appears unjust in certain cases.  It tends to provoke people into possibly mild dishonesty of one kind or another.  It adds to the possibility of evasions and the return of not completely honest facts in relation to personal or family incomes. The whole thing is cumbersome and costly and, above all, it appears to be unnecessary.  I have never heard anyone really state a case for the retention of the means test.</P>
    <P>I can see the Fine Gael approach to the necessity for an insurance contribution. They are a conservative Party.  They have never made any pretence of being anything else and, so far as I know, they are thoroughly honest in that respect.  Their attitude is that the beneficiary of the social service should make a contribution and in that way effectively lighten the burden on the wealthy taxpayer.  I imagine it is a rationale of their sponsoring an insurance scheme with a means test.</P>
    <P>I have never heard it clearly put by the members of the Labour Party why they believe in an insurance scheme.  On many occasions, Deputy Corish has, very rightly, criticised the recent trend by both major Parties to a fiscal policy which tends to shift the burden of taxation from direct to indirect taxation.  The worker carries a tax burden in his tax contribution on beer, cigarettes, tobacco, bus fares, postage, and other things.  He bears that burden to a much greater extent in recent years than in the old days when the wealthy were taxed to help the not so wealthy, and when there <Col N="489" /> were super taxes, capital gains taxes and various other types of taxes by which it was intended, broadly speaking, to soak, as I suppose it could be called, the rich in order to pay for the people who could not afford to pay themselves.</P>
    <P>Those are the two broad approaches.  I have heard Deputy Corish criticise the Government for this trend.  Indeed, it is logical criticism for him to offer as Leader of the Labour Party but I do not understand how they can rationalise the necessity for the introduction of an insurance principle in relation to the health services.  In the first place, it has been the trend on the part of the major Parties on both sides of the House to increase indirect taxation, so far as the worker is concerned. That is a fact&mdash;it is there.  I do not like it but it happens to be there. Consequently, what is happening is that the worker is paying already.</P>
    <P>There is also the woolly-headed thesis that the worker must not get something for nothing.  I have heard the thesis put forward from time to time that he must pay, and consequently some people believe he must pay by insurance.  The facts of the matter are that he already pays in indirect taxation to a very great extent. He pays in indirect taxation every time he takes a drink, smokes a cigarette or in the one hundred and one ways we all know indirect taxation is collected.  He also pays direct taxation under PAYE and most of the workers pay taxes in the form of rates.</P>
    <P>I want to know why it is necessary to introduce yet another tax.  I should like speakers from the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party to tell me why they think it desirable or necessary to introduce yet another tax&mdash;a health insurance tax&mdash;because this, of course, will be a weekly tax or a monthly tax, just the same as PAYE.  If they is to be a tax in respect of health, why not have an insurance principle introduced in relation to various other things like primary education or children's allowances, from which everyone can get benefits?  The non-contributory old age pension is, of course, <Col N="490" /> being made contributory.  Why is it necessary to increase indirect taxation yet again by means of this insurance contribution?</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael scheme is reasonably clear.  There is a means test and an insurance contribution and a person pays an insurance contribution up to, say, £800 a year as is suggested.  I should like a discussion on the proposal put forward by the Labour Party speakers for an insurance scheme without a means test.  If there were no means test, presumably everyone would pay an insurance contribution.  Under the Fine Gael scheme, people under a certain income level would not pay a contribution.  That is fair enough, but if we have an insurance scheme with no means test, does that mean that the people who are now getting a free service, the old age pensioners, unemployed persons, self-employed persons, casual workers and small farmers, will have to pay for the services they get?  Surely that would be a retrograde step.  I want enlightenment on that matter.</P>
    <P>If that is so, how are the unemployed persons, or the other categories I have mentioned, to make their contributions? It is conceivable, I suppose, that the old age pensioner will not have to pay but even the old age pensioners are themselves subject to a means test. It seems to me that it is nearly inescapable that in some way or other in our type of society the worker will have to pay both directly and indirectly if these people have their way.  I could understand an insurance principle in an industrial society where there are a lot of weekly wage earners working in industries and factories.  I could understand that it might be permissive in such a society, but we are living in a society in which the fiscal policy is directed to spreading the burden evenly over everyone.  Everyone is made to pay in one form or another by direct or indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>You could make an insurance scheme work in a highly industrialised society but in a country like ours, where there is a high percentage of rural workers, farm workers, casual workers and self-employed persons, I do not know how it would be possible <Col N="491" /> to make it effective and, above all, I do not know why it should be necessary to introduce such a scheme. I do not know what justification there is for it.  I should like to see some justification.  There may be some justification and there may be a special case in Ireland that I do not know anything about which does not operate in other countries.  There may be advantages in other schemes that other people know about but I have not seen a good case made for the insurance principle and, above all, I have not seen a good case made against the existing so-called free services which we get under the Infectious Diseases Regulations in regard to our fever hospitals and T.B. sanatoria generally.</P>
    <P>Why does somebody not say: &ldquo;These are the weaknesses we have exposed and because of these weaknesses, we propose to adopt a different scheme, an insurance scheme, because it will not have the weaknesses of our present scheme?&rdquo; Why does somebody not justify this demand for insurance?  It seems to me to be unreasonable that people should have a doctrinaire and unjustified, and apparently unjustifiable, belief in a particular idea and should not make any attempt to try to persuade us here why they believe in one particular scheme as against another.  I do not know how the main Opposition Party can, in the light of their experience, put forward the proposal that a means test should be retained. Anybody with experience as politicians or doctors must know the big difficulty.  Possibly the only real difficulty in existing health services is the means test and it is the people who do not get the services who are most annoyed about it.</P>
    <P>I think the proposition was put forward by Deputy Kyne that there should be variations in the contributions made by persons in the very low income groups, if there was an insurance scheme.  That proposal would appear to me to be more likely to lead to greater bedlam than exists already and there would be consequential means <Col N="492" /> tests within the means test and it could stultify many of the hopes which I believe the Labour Party and other Parties have for the provision of proper health services.  I hope, therefore, that some speaker will try to justify the approach to this idea of insurance schemes in relation to the health services, because, as I said before, fortunately we all believe the present idea is coming to an end. Everybody will be relieved and I hope we shall get good health services which will please the people and which we can all afford.  My own view is that there should be an extension of the existing infectious diseases type of services.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss for a while the question of the Minister's approach to the Report of the College of Physicians on smoking in relation to cancer of the lung and other diseases and his very offhand treatment of this very serious matter.  I know well that this is a very difficult problem for a Government.  It is a very difficult problem for individuals. It is a difficult problem in many ways because when a Government in a country as small as ours takes in something between £25,000,000 and £30,000,000 in revenue from a particular service, one cannot readily or easily expect the Government to wipe out that income, or take steps which will, in effect, wipe out that income, without giving the matter very serious thought, particularly where there is no readily obvious alternative source of income.</P>
    <P>There are great personal problems involved also in this question of the consumption of tobacco in so far as there are very many people who have shares in this business.  They used to be gilt-edged securities but they are now not quite as good currency as they formally were.  That creates problems for people, I am quite sure.  Also there is the very difficult individual problem involved for the person who smokes and simply does not feel he can give it up, or cannot give it up.  I am afraid from my own experience I found that there are a number of people who cannot give up smoking.  It was not an easy problem which can be solved simply.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="493" /> The College of Physicians came out unequivocally on the general principle that they believe the two things were related, that there was a relation between smoking and cancer of the lung.  At the same time, there is a certain element of doubt as to the exact causation, the cause and the effect.  However, I think we can accept that one is related to the other and consequently some steps should be taken by the Government to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>The report is a remarkably well detailed one in dealing with such a complex subject.  It certainly leaves no reasonable doubt that some steps should be taken by the Government. The record of cigarette smoking, as they have found it, is a very serious one, causing various not so serious illnesses, gravely serious illnesses and, finally, worst of all, lung cancer.  It also causes bronchitis which is not so serious at the beginning, but ultimately is a great source of distress to many people and indeed causes the loss of many man working hours in winter. Coronary thrombosis obviously appears in many people also.  The cause of all these serious diseases can be attributed to cigarette smoking and yet the facts are that all the media of communication in our society are used continuously and full blast to encourage people to continue to smoke, when we now know without any doubt that it shortens our lives, causes crippling bronchitis, encourages coronary thrombosis, delays the healing of gastric ulcers and in a number of cases, causes cancer of the lung.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister should continue to allow the case to go by default, as he virtually has allowed the case against cigarette smoking to go up to the present.  He must take more energetic steps to deal with it. Precisely what steps he should take is a matter which only he, with all the knowledge and information available to a Cabinet Minister, could be certain would be the wisest to take. He gave the impression in his opening speech that those of us who wanted some action taken, or some authoritative or autocratic type of dictatorial prohibition brought in would immediately <Col N="494" /> lay down that cigarette smoking was forbidden in our society henceforward and must be stopped without any further delay or consideration. This is the Minister's usual misrepresentation of my whole attitude in politics as a socialist: that I believe in authoritarianism.  Nothing could be further from the truth, which can be borne out quite easily by reference to a few of the things I was permitted to do while in office. On the contrary, it is the Minister who has been authoritarian in his time and has attempted to take very dictatorial powers, when he felt he should do so.</P>
    <P>As far as I can recollect, far from believing in authoritarianism, my attitude has always been the true socialist one of believing in the good sense of the mass of the people and believing that, if the case is fairly and honestly presented to the mass of the people, they can be depended upon to act in the way that any of us would act in the same set of circumstances. As far as I can recollect, it was I who stopped compulsory vaccination for smallpox.  I do not know whether that was right or wrong; but, as far as I can recollect, it was I who did it.  I remember also at that time diphtheria was rather dangerous.  It was suggested we should have compulsory diphtheria vaccination. I opposed that idea because I felt that if the majority of conscientious mothers were told it was desirable to have diphtheria vaccination, there are very few of them who would not go and do it in the interest of their children's health.  On the whole, I think that the voluntary approach &mdash;we did introduce certain plans for education by way of posters and newspaper propaganda&mdash;is reasonably effective.  I remember also that I opposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not deal with it at any great length.  The Minister did deal at some considerable length with the approach and the immoderate <Col N="495" /> suggestions that have been made or implied by persons like myself in favour of stopping cigarette smoking or causing people to cease cigarette smoking.  However, I shall not deal with it at any great length, beyond just reminding briefly the Minister of his own 1946 Health Act, which was probably the most authoritarian piece of health legislation ever brought into a democratic parliament and which, of course, was ultimately thrown out.</P>
      <P>In relation to encouraging people to stop smoking, one point has been made in this Report: that advertising is not the sole reason for people smoking.  I accept that.  There are other factors involved, apparently.  But it makes the point that you cannot ignore the likelihood that advertising has an influence or does help people to start smoking and, having started, keeps them at it. Even if they have not made that point, anybody who knows the hardheaded businessmen who run the big tobacco corporations must know they are not going to spend £11,000,000&mdash;that was the figure spent in Britain last year on advertising&mdash;merely because they have not anything better to do with their money.  They must have their own market research methods.  They must have their own investigations which establish for them whether it is a good thing or not to advertise, whether it is desirable or not, whether it helps to sell the article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally accepted in our type of society that advertising is desirable and necessary and, above all, that it is effective in selling the particular product.  I think we could accept that. The fact is that the State radio is used, the television service is used widely and the newspapers are used very widely by the top corporations to encourage people to smoke cigarettes, which we know now cause lung cancer. Surely the Minister must take some counter action?  The obvious counter action is a simple prohibition.  I see Italy has imposed that prohibition. They have said there shall not be tobacco advertising, that it shall not be accepted.  I do not know whether that is the best way to go about it. I think it probably would be the <Col N="496" /> cheapest way.  The alternative, it seems to me, would be very costly for the Minister&mdash;I suppose he would have to think about it&mdash;and that is to counter the advertisements of the corporations, that he himself would take radio and television time and take newspaper advertisements.  It would be very costly for him.  He would be up against the finest brains in the business&mdash;the smoking advertisements are certainly extremely clever&mdash;and he would have to try to pit his wits against the tremendous organisation which has been built up over the years.  As I said, the figure for Britain last year was £11,000,000&mdash;I have not got the figures for this country&mdash;and I certainly cannot see the Minister finding money on a comparable level with that being made available by the tobacco companies for their campaigns.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed in this matter.  There are various Ministries which could take action.  The only one who has taken action&mdash;and I suspect that action, even though I welcome it and supported it in the Budget&mdash; is the Minister for Finance.  He gave us to believe he was worried.  The surprising thing is that, while he is worried, his colleague, the Minister for Health, seems to be relatively unworried.  The Minister for Justice would not take any steps to see that children and juveniles could not have access to the slot machine type of cigarettes.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs refused to intervene in relation to television advertising.</P>
    <P>There is no good in the Minister trying to create the impression that he is the great liberal, that he feels society should be an unregulated jungle in which everything would eventually work out in the best of all possible ways.  We have regulations in practically every aspect of our lives.  Every Ministerial Department introduces regulations at some time or other&mdash;in relation to the children going to cinemas, censorship of books, traffic. Even in the Department of Agriculture there are certain regulations in relation to T.B. eradication.  There is the Official Secrets Act.  The age at which children attend and leave school is the subject <Col N="497" /> of regulations and so is the care of old people.  Obviously, practically the main function of every Ministerial Department is to devise regulations arising out of the legislation passed here.  It is absurd for the Minister to suggest he does not think it would be compatible with his general approach and the general approach of his Government that he should introduce prohibition of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>The Minister is the very person who recently, on the advice of some committee or other, quite rightly refused to allow the bakers to continue to include agene in bread because it was injurious to the health of our people. That was not an important or authoritative committee but I have no quarrel with their findings or the Minister's decision.  Why did the Minister not act on this very authoritative report whose findings are very much more serious for the population?  Very recently, there was opposition by the Opposition &mdash;I did not share their opposition to it&mdash;to the introduction of fluorine into drinking water, a proposal which was not getting support in many quarters. It was the Minister who brought in legislation to give us the power to regulate in respect of the introduction of fluorine into the water supply as a health measure.  He has acted in these two cases but refuses to act in relation to this problem of advertising.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us to understand that he provided the health authorities with literature or that he has literature which is available for anybody who wants it.  He says that is adequate. He has made a few speeches, a few references to this danger of cancer from cigarette smoking, and says that everybody had an opportunity of reading this report of the British College of Physicians.  I do not think the Minister honestly believes that it is enough for him to make half a dozen speeches, to refer to this report that was produced and suggest that that could be an effective counter to the powerful and very clever advertising campaign of the tobacco corporations.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister really believe that, in the face of the truth that consumption of tobacco has continued to rise along with the continued rise in the <Col N="498" /> incidence of lung cancer?  If the Minister were right, surely the results would show in a reduction in cigarette smoking and ultimately&mdash;I know it would take a long time&mdash;a reduction in the amount of lung cancer.</P>
    <P>There is the suggestion that adults should tell the children not to smoke. That is not a particularly valuable suggestion.  Any grown-up, a teacher or a parent, with a cigarette in his hand, a complete victim to the habit himself giving such advice could not possibly impress the children.  The imitative quality in children tends to make them do whatever they see adults doing.  That is one powerful factor in their starting to smoke.</P>
    <P>Many people suggested that it was useless to concentrate on adults, that it would be more beneficial to concentrate on the children.  In concentrating on the children and leaving out the adults, you are leaving out probably the most important factor, the person who initiates the habit.  If any success is to be achieved, the adult must be encouraged to stop smoking so that the young person will not start to smoke.  Therefore the Minister's campaign, however he would pursue it, should be directed not only towards encouraging young people not to smoke but towards helping the person who is already addicted to stop smoking.</P>
    <P>If you issued an edict tomorrow telling people they must not smoke any more, it would not be worth the paper it was written on.  I know a number of people who are trying very hard to give up smoking and they simply cannot do it.  It is a very difficult medical problem as well as a financial problem.  I would prefer if the Minister would say, even though there is a precedent against it in the other cases I mentioned: &ldquo;I do not think we should suppress advertisements. I believe advertisers should be allowed to encourage people to smoke&rdquo; rather than suggest that what he has said on the subject is sufficient to counter the advertisements.</P>
    <P>The Minister does say in relation to opium, morphia or cocaine: &ldquo;You may not smoke these, even if you <Col N="499" /> want to.&rdquo;  He does not allow these drugs to be advertised in the national press, on television or on the radio.  I do not want to be misrepresented in relation to that; I accept that they must be suppressed but we know there is an element in cigarettes which comes into the dangerous drug category.  I do not want him to rush into desperate action. It is a matter which will need very careful thought and I can merely put forward points of view to him which could possibly be of assistance to him. However, some positive action is badly needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister feels he has discharged his responsibility in making literature available to health authorities or in having a few lectures given in schools.  I do not think he has discharged his responsibility.  As an illustration of his failure, I give him the fact that there has been an increase in tobacco consumption while that type of campaign has been carried out.  I do not honestly believe, and I ask the Minister does he seriously hope, that his negligible type of campaign has been satisfactory or that it can adequately counteract the colossally clever, very expensive, very seductive newspaper, television and radio campaign carried on for the purpose of inducing people to continue smoking?  I do not think the Minister seriously believes that it will.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows quite well that if he, as a politician, were faced tomorrow with a choice of contesting his constituency, the only contribution to his campaign being merely an announcement that he intended to stand in that constituency, that he had a great deal of literature at home and, if one wanted it, one could apply for it and one would gladly be given it, while his opponents had access to all the main means of communication&mdash; radio, telephone, newspapers, television, and any other vehicle available for the dissemination of propaganda &mdash; he would not choose inactivity.  Does the Minister seriously believe he would be quite satisfied fighting an election campaign in such circumstances?  Does he not know that he could not possibly <Col N="500" /> agree to any such proposition because it would be grossly unfair?  It would leave him in the position in which he could legitimately plead that he was not getting a fair chance to put his point of view or his candidature properly before the public.  There is, I think, a reasonable comparison between that and my suggestion that the Minister is not conducting his campaign against the possibility of an increasing incidence in lung cancer, as a result of cigarette smoking, really effectively.</P>
    <P>To reverse the analogy: what does the Minister think the tobacco corporations would say if he went calling on them to tell them that, in the beginning of each year, they could draw up a leaflet inscribed &ldquo;Players Please&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gold Flake Satisfy&rdquo;, make an announcement in the Press, deliver a speech about their products, and, for the rest of the year, do absolutely nothing in the line of newspaper, radio or television propaganda or advertising? Does he honestly believe that would satisfy the tobacco barons?  I am certain it would not.</P>
    <P>I naturally want the Minister to indulge in a serious campaign to try to reduce the incidence of lung cancer. Above all, I should like him to be clear in relation to his facts.  I should like him to know what he is doing.  I should like him to be honest about why he is doing it or, on the other hand, why he is not doing it.  I should like him not to mislead.  It is possible he has actually misled himself in this matter, but he must not be allowed to mislead the Dáil that he is, in effect, carrying out a serious campaign in relation to this very grave health problem of fairly recent origin.</P>
    <P>When I read the report and appreciated the seriousness and significance of it, and when various Ministers made it quite clear that they did not intend to take any action in regard to it, or virtually no action in regard to it, my immediate response was one of indignation and surprise, particularly with regard to the Minister for Health, because this is his responsibility.  The Ministers for Justice and Posts and Telegraphs may be forgiven because health is not their particular problem. <Col N="501" /> It is unforgivable on the part of the Minister for Health that he will not take some effective steps to deal with this problem because it comes within the ambit of his responsibilities.  Since my first reaction of indignation and surprise, it has struck me that it is conceivable the Minister for Health simply does not fully appreciate the significance; he is, after all, a layman and, like most other laymen, he does not appreciate the significance of these cold facts.</P>
    <P>One of the things that helped me to confirm that impression in my own mind is the fact disclosed in this report that since 1958, when the idea was first mooted that cigarette smoking might be a cause of lung cancer, there has been a remarkable drop in the number of doctors who smoke.  Half the number smoking then smoke now; only one-third of all doctors smoking, when this survey was made, smoke cigarettes.  In the light of this very significant fact, it struck me that it might possibly be that the average layman is simply unable to grasp the significance of lung cancer.  To him, it is just a certain number of letters on a piece of paper.  As far as personal experience goes, it is not, perhaps fortunately, translated into actuality.  That is true, too, of course of the Minister for Health, in so far as he is a layman, and he simply does not appreciate the very serious wrong he is perpetrating by his inaction, or by his wholly ineffective action, in this regard.</P>
    <P>He has never seen anybody, as most doctors have, dying of lung cancer or of cancer of the throat, in the throes of asphyxiation and gradual death. He has not had that, in some ways, valuable experience.  It is far more impressive than a book, or a report, irrespective of who makes the report. It would certainly stop most people smoking cigarettes.  I think it is this experience on the part of doctors which has led to a decrease in the number of doctors who smoke.  It is just as difficult for a doctor to give up smoking as it is for anybody else, but anybody who has had the experience of seeing a fellow human going <Col N="502" /> through the frightful ordeal of finding out he has cancer of the lung, and then sweating it out until he finally dies&mdash;remember, it is virtually imoperable&mdash;has an experience which is denied to the layman; it is very difficult then, perhaps, for the layman to visualise the agony, the physical pain which follows.  Knowing the indifference of the inexperienced average layman, and coming up against the apparent indifference of the Minister in his very responsible position, it is easy at first to be indignant.  But, then, one comes to feel that this indifference is probably due to ignorance of the real position.  One can only hope that the Minister will give the matter rather more serious thought henceforth than he has given it up to the present.  I hope he will think over the whole matter again.  He has a very grave responsibility.</P>
    <P>When the report first issued, the campaign in favour of smoking stopped momentarily.  That was noticeable.  The newspapers, television and radio were emptied of advertisements for a few weeks.  Now they are on again in full flood and the people for whom the Minister has responsibility have at the moment nobody acting on their behalf. I shall say no more on the subject. I sincerely hope the Minister will do something.  I believe he has a conscience, and I think that eventually he probably will do something.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The time has come when we must face up to the fact that the health services throughout the country are not overall as good as we would like them to be.  Furthermore, the time has come to make a concerted effort to find practical solutions to the multiple problems that have arisen under the Health Act, problems ranging from the question of entitlement to blue cards to the problem, dwelt on at such length by Deputy Dr. Browne, of the effect of cigarette smoking in relation to the incidence of lung cancer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have to do is to consider the method of improvement, particularly on the basis of making available to all sections of our people, in the <Col N="503" /> quickest possible way, every development in medical science that can be put at their disposal for healing or arresting progressive disease.  I saw, in my early days in the Dáil, the initiation of our health legislation and I said then, and I still say, that we got off to a wrong start and that we have never been able to recover from that because subsequent legislation has been either a matter of expediency or patchwork to seal breaches that have become apparent in the system.</P>
    <P>I may at times be inclined to say very harsh things about the Minister for Health but I believe he has come to the realisation that it is necessary to get a considered and constructive opinion from all sides of this House as to what form future legislation should take and as to the type of development which should be laid down as a basis for progress to the day we want to see when everybody in this State, irrespective of his income group, will have equal approach to all specialist treatment, operative treatment and every type of treatment necessary to deal with his complaints.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dr. Browne was asking hypothetical questions about the means test, it struck me that he was being a little more naive than usual, because he knows that the type of health service subscribed to by this Party is one in which anybody in this State who is unable to pay for health services, who is unable to pay for medicine or for any form of operative or specialist treatment, would not be denied it because of that inability to pay.  We have always contended, and proudly asserted, that it is our responsibility to ensure that the least fortunate classes of our people, the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans, the unemployed and the unfortunate small farmers are entitled, absolutely free, to every benefit that can be made available to the wealthiest person in the country.</P>
    <P>When one comes to consider any scheme which is to be a contributory scheme, one must arrive at a figure. Deputy Dr. Browne says that the £800 a year man may be a bachelor <Col N="504" /> or he may be a man with ten children. Every scheme that is on a contributory basis must envisage the contribution that such people would make. We favour the contributory scheme for a number of reasons the most effective one of which is that when people make some contribution for the service, they are able to preserve their self-respect and to ensure that they get their rights.  There is enough mendicity in this country already without encouraging any more.  When we in the Fine Gael Party talk of a contributory scheme, we talk of one which the people can afford and one under which the people will no longer have to go to the homes of their county councillors or their Deputy in order to get their rights. We talk of a scheme under which it will be the <i>de facto</i> right of all our people to obtain what they are entitled to and what every one of us is hopeful to be able to give them, a first-class really worthwhile health service.</P>
    <P>As this matter has gone to a Select Committee of the House, it is futile at this stage to argue what the health services should be.  It might be better to leave that to the time when we will be debating the findings of that Committee but there are a few facets of health policy I want to refer to.  In regard to some of these, commendation must go to the Minister for the manner in which he recently sought to enlighten the public.  I am dealing in particular with the desire I have to see the Irish people educated to a proper psychological approach to the question of the mentally ill or the mentally defective.  I was appalled on recent visits to large mental institutions at the amazing number of people who are allowed to languish and die in these institutions because of the fact that we have not been able to educate people to the knowledge that mental disease, properly treated, can be cured as rapidly and as completely as any other ailment from which the body may suffer.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to see more virility put into the effort to show the Irish people, as we once had to show them about tuberculosis, that there are many factors that impinge on the nervous <Col N="505" /> system so as to lead ultimately to a mental breakdown that can, with the proper approach, be cared for and cured as effectively as we have dealt with the one-time rampant TB among our people.</P>
    <P>In the most deliberate way, I say to the Minister that I, for one, would urge upon him and welcome a greater effort to teach our people that there is nothing <i>per se</i> sinister or nothing <i>per se</i> of ill-repute in the person who, by reason of circumstances, may be overstrained, over-worked, or, by some vicissitude of fortune, may suffer from some temporary mental upset.  There is no reason why they, in co-operation with the psychiatrist, should not be able to aid and help in the rehabilitation of that person back to normal circumstances again.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a development in this country towards more psychiatric clinics.  Having visited some of these institutions and met some of the people in them, I have got the impression, maybe erroneously, that some of them are far more qualified to be outside than some of us who are outside. It is an immense problem, particularly on the south-west and western sea-boards, that you have people who, because of their wrong psychological approach, will not have relatives back again or will avoid taking responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>As well as that, you have a number of cases in these institutions who have virtually become lost and forgotten souls.  I think that, with the recent impetus we have seen being given to the effort to deal with mentally retarded children or mentally defective children, we should, side by side, build up a campaign to teach our people what is being learned generally in the world, that, in so far as the brain and the mind are concerned, causes of troubles and disease can arise as they can in any of the other parts of the anatomy, that they can be dealt with in an effective manner and that rehabilitation in that respect can be, on the percentage basis, as high in its full recovery as any other type of the more dreaded diseases we talk about in the body.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="506" /> We should unite on all sides of this House with the Minister and with my colleague, Deputy D. Costello, in the publicising and the sustaining of the effort to get more and more done for our mentally retarded or mentally defective children.  I know it is not easy, within the wall of soaring health charges, within the difficulties we have of the impact of health services on the rates as well as on general taxation, to make available all the funds that might be necessary for the campaigns I envisage. However, I say in a very positive way to the Minister that in so far as that impetus needs the support and the help of this Party, we shall be with him all the way.</P>
    <P>We feel that where the health services are concerned, where any one of our adult mental cases can be properly cured, where any assistance or any help can be given to the unfortunate retarded child, every £ spent by this State in giving that better lot to that person is not only well spent but is a fulfilment of a duty that we can never shed, namely, to be reasonable and fair within our constitutional concept of freedom to all members of the State.  There are none who need our sustained support and our sustained help more than the classes to whom I refer.  All I want to see is a quickening and a greater quickening of the conscience of our people in relation to these problems and what contribution they can, in their goodwill and in their support to these cases, make to the rehabilitation of so many people.</P>
    <P>I shall not join in Deputy Dr. Browne's castigation of the Minister for not rushing into a series of prohibitive Orders to prevent tobacco companies from advertising or from the normal exercise of business acumen in relation to the sale of their products.  Strangely, I still believe that if the Minister really wanted to put smoking on an upper spiral, he would only have to try prohibition.</P>

      <P>The question of dealing with lung cancer, in so far as <Col N="507" /> it is germane to the problem of smoking, is a difficult one.  It must be. We had only to listen to Deputy Dr. Browne for the past threequarters of an hour rambling around, in ever decreasing circles, saying the same thing forty times, to know that he had not a clue as to what the answer was.  I do not intend to suggest that we can give the complete answer but I do know that an awful lot of people, despite what reports are published, are yet far from convinced that there is a direct connection between smoking and lung cancer.  Whether it is some subsequent breaking-down within the cell tissue of the body that ultimately leads to it, that may be an adjunct rather than a reality in the tobacco, is not yet known.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister for Health might be well served in his effort to do something about this matter in having the tobacco barons, as they were described by Deputy Dr. Browne, divert some of their moneys now being spent on advertising to research funds in order to find out exactly what constituent of the tobacco might be the irritant that ultimately sets up bronchial catarrh or lung cancer.  The Minister is in a very difficult position because everybody has his right under the Constitution.  Legitimate traders have their rights in relation to the manner in which they will run their business or advertise.  The general public have the right to decide whether they should smoke or not and the right to choose for themselves the brand of cigarette they smoke.  I say in fairness to the Minister that if he started to make regulations to prohibit that, there would be howls on all sides of this House about interference with the liberty of the citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings the question of smoking and lung cancer into the field again, and the question of letting the people assess the facts and letting it be known throughout the schools and homes of Ireland that there is the belief in certain quarters that there is an intrinsic danger in tobacco smoking&mdash;one that can lead to the consequences described so vividly by Deputy Dr. Browne. <Col N="508" /> Deputy Dr. Browne should stop fooling himself that it is not within the power of a layman like the Minister or myself to experience an appalling sense of frustration on seeing a person die of cancer, particularly lung or gullet cancer.  Many of us have had the misfortune of seeing relatives, friends and dear ones die as a result of cancer.  To try to heap some kind of a threat on the Minister's head because he has not got some mad impulse to rush out and ban advertisements or disrupt established trading methods is, to my mind, unfair.</P>
    <P>This is a problem in relation to which the adroitness of the Minister will be tested to the nth degree.  There is no use fooling ourselves by denying that the tobacco industry has grown into an immense and powerful vested interest to say nothing of the fact that it has grown into one of the most freely accessible tax sources in the State.</P>
    <P>When one looks back on the long history of smoking, it seems amazing that it was only in 1958 that the apparent connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was fathomed.  It was only in the very recent past that the College of Physicians brought out their report in the matter.  Unfortunately, the development of cancer research and the effective treatment of the disease have not made anything like the progress that every one of us would like to have seen made.  We have not been fortunate enough yet to see developed some vaccine or antidote to the disease which could give us the hope that we would see in our own lifetime an end to this scourage.  If the Minister has funds available it is into research and development against lung cancer that I should like to see those funds diverted rather than used in a counter campaign of advertising.</P>
    <P>What is the Minister's responsibility in the matter?  Deputy Dr. Browne seems to hand it all on a plate to the Minister and, for once, I do not feel that is justified.  Each and every one of us, in so far as we believe tobacco smoking is likely to increase the incidence of cancer, has a duty to spread that knowledge among our people and our constituents.  We have a duty to <Col N="509" /> help the local authority in the dissemination of the information available from the Department of Health but whether we would be justified in introducing sanctions and prohibitions as a result of the report of the College of Physicians is another question.  I would urge on the Minister that prohibition and sanctions should be the last approach to this big problem he should envisage.</P>
    <P>We have seen in a short period an immense improvement in the methods and techniques of treating diseases.  We have seen the development within this State during the last decade of some of the finest hospitals in Europe.  We have been fortunate in that period to have been able to procure the very latest equipment and to build hospitals, the design of which is in advance of the times.  We have been fortunate to have them staffed by surgeons of immense skill, physicians of tremendous capacity and, generally speaking, first-class specialists.</P>
    <P>It is because we were able to do so much that possibly we are impatient to see that type of service made available to everybody in the country.  Even though we can readily appreciate the fact that hospitals cannot grow overnight, that distinguished and competent personnel cannot be provided overnight, we still find our patience tested and strained by the fact that we see so many people for whom so much could be done if the advance in our health services had commenced a little earlier.</P>
    <P>It is in the true spirit of wanting to see a worthwhile job done in providing the best possible health services for all of our people that we sometimes become impatient and intolerant of the administrative methods of the Department of Health and the local authorities when they come to deal with the health services.  There is no doubt that a much better service could be given, if administrative anomalies and queer twists in regulations were smoothed out.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt it is possible, within our present system, to give to all the Irish people an excellent general service, a superlative hospital and <Col N="510" /> specialist service and a very good drug treatment scheme.  They could be given free to the sections of our community who cannot pay for them, but a contribution could be sought from the income groups of, say, 1s. or 1s. 6d. per family per week.  I am thinking of a service which would help the lowest and the highest&mdash;the small farmer in West Cork taking home his lock of turf on his donkey and butt, or the unemployed man in the city or in the country, or the old age pensioner, or the widow.  I want every one of these to get the same medical care as the man capable of earning £5,000, £10,000 or £20,000 a year and who could afford to pay for top level services at home or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>That is the standard I set for the Department of Health.  Deputy Dr. Browne accused the Fine Gael Party of advocating a conservative and arbitrary insurance system with a means test.  The only means test on which we base health is that those who cannot afford a full medical service should have it free and that others should make a reasonable contribution. Our problem is that we cannot quickly enough provide for everybody every possible method of pain alleviation so that nobody in this country, rich or poor, should suffer unnecessary pain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only a little to say and the first point I would make is that the health services should be on a contributory basis with no ceiling.  When you fix a ceiling, you will always have hardship in borderline cases.  Everyone should contribute, except those in the social welfare classes or those who own land of low valuation.  Under the existing system, people with over £800 a year are outside the scope of any assistance and must pay the full cost of hospitalisation. This creates grave hardships in many cases.  I am speaking from personal experience in this matter because I happen to be a case in point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy, I am supposed to have £20 a week.  That is less £1 which they take from me for pension purposes. But I also must deduct the cost of the last three elections.  Do not forget that though I have been in the <Col N="511" /> House for four and a half years, I had, in the meantime, to fight a byelection, a municipal election and a general election.  All that expense must come out of my £20.  All my telephone expenses and my postage costs must come out.  Still, if you do not mind, I am classified as a fellow with an income of over £800 a year.  One of my family, a child of ten, had to go to hospital and I got a bill for £7 for the child's two days three.  I went to the hospital and to the local authority and they accepted it for the joke it was.  They never pressed me and I was told by the secretary of the health authority that he had hundreds of cases like it&mdash;people who have £800 a year but who, in order to get that amount, must spend £300 or £400.</P>
    <P>That is why I say there should be no such thing as a ceiling.  It is a joke, unless certain allowances are made. In income tax, allowances are made. Members of the Dáil are not charged income tax on their whole salary&mdash;I think it is charged on half.  I am not sure because I do not pay it.  That is fair enough, but if there is to be a ceiling, certain matters must be taken into account before a person's means are assessed for the purpose of health charges.  A person may have the name of having something but what counts is what he really has.  You cannot get blood from a stone.  When we are dealing with this matter at a later stage, I hope the Minister will consider a general contribution without any ceiling, and that he will make sure that certain charges that are out of the ordinary are taken into account before a person's means are assessed for the purpose of health charges.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to people who are in receipt of allowances because they have infectious diseases or because they are disabled.  We all know, although little mention has been made of it, that persons in receipt of a disablement pension or allowance got an extra 2/6d. in the Budget.  In my opinion, those cases are the worst cases of all.  They are the most pitiful cases. In 1954, an allowance of £1 was granted to chronically disabled persons. <Col N="512" /> Perhaps that was not bad in 1954, but for some reason or other, this House then forgot all about them. They were the forgotten people, perhaps because the money does not come under the welfare account.</P>
    <P>Every year, there is lobbying for the old age pensioners and the unemployed, but the disabled persons are completely forgotten.  The proof of that is that the first increase they got was in 1960.  In other words, their allowance was fixed in 1954 and for six years those unfortunate people got nothing more.  They got an extra 2/6d. for the first time in 1960.  I am thankful to the Minister for it.  I know it was because Deputy Desmond and I pressed this matter that the Minister softened.</P>
    <P>So far as I can see, anyone who wants to get anything in this world must kick up a row.  Other classes got certain increases because there was a row.  If the farmers had accepted the increased rates lying down and not opened their mouths about them, they would not have got the £2½ million. The fact that the disabled persons were forgotten is no reason why they are not entitled to the same benefits as recipients of contributory or non-contributory allowances.</P>
    <P>A blind man gets 30/- a week and an additional 2/6d. now.  A non-contributory old age pensioner gets 32/6d. There is no reason why disabled persons should not get 32/6d. a week, except that they have been forgotten. When they did get an increase, it was the usual 2/6d.  I can understand that and I am greatful to the Minister for that 2/6d.  I am satisfied on this occasion but I want the Minister to bear those people in mind.  I think I am morally entitled to make the case that they should get the same allowance as an old age pensioner.  In many cases, they are crippled from birth and are bedridden.  It is not as if they had had a job and had got some small pension.</P>
    <P>A non-contributory pensioner can earn £1 a week and still get the full pension.  His pension is not reduced, unless he earns more than £1, but obviously those who were born crippled have no additional money. They are a terrible nuisance to their <Col N="513" /> families and themselves.  We have to admit that, but for that reason, it is a shame that they do not get at least the same treatment as the non-contributory old pensioners.  I am satisfied that they were not forgotten again this year, but I am asking the Minister next year at least seriously to consider bridging the gap and making their allowance similar to other allowances. The reason that has not been done is that they did not kick up a big enough row.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words on smoking and drinking because other speakers have dealt with those subjects. I do not drink or smoke, although I did at one time, but I certainly would not favour any ban. If people want to drink beer they will drink it; and if they want to smoke, they will smoke.  They will go to the black market if there is a ban on beer or cigarettes and the Minister will lose revenue.  I do not know to what extent smoking causes lung cancer.  In my opinion, people who have lung cancer should not smoke but it is up to themselves.  Normally healthy people can smoke without any ill effects, perhaps.  I know that from my own experience.  I have a touch of bronchitis and when I smoked, I had a severe cough at night and I was subject to colds.  Since I stopped smoking, I rarely get a cold and I never cough. That is proof that anyone who has anything wrong with his chest should not smoke or he will aggravate the condition.</P>
    <P>Drinking was banned in the United States and we all know what happened. The State got no revenue but the racketeers did.  People drink to forget themselves.  They have not all got the life of Reilly.  Politicians may be able to make politics their full life, but the man in the street likes to drink beer in a pub.  I would not stop anyone from having a beer.</P>
    <P>We hear talk about the evil effects of drink.  Drink is a curse but I would not ban it.  Practically all evil occurrences are due to drink.  Half the robberies are committed by people under the influence of drink and half the accidents in cars are due to drink. Some cases of venereal disease can <Col N="514" /> be attributed to drink because decent people do not have dealings with the type of person from whom they are likely to contract that disease, unless they are under the influence of drink. Drink causes all sorts of evil but I would not ban it because worse evil might eventuate.  We should try to educate people and get them to give up these things of their own volition.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to remember the points I have made: no ceiling so far as health in the way of hospitalisation is concerned and an allowance for certain costings outside the normal, and next year would the Minister remember to bring disabled persons' allowances into line with other allowances?</P>

      <P>After the rather colourful contribution we have had from Deputy Sherwin, I am afraid my contribution will not be quite so attractive. There are one or two points which I should like to discuss.  The Deputies who have contributed to this debate have, between them, covered the main points of the administration of the Department.  I do not propose to go over that ground again but I should like to reinforce a plea made by Deputy Kyne that the House should not agree with the argument made in many parts of the country that health charges should be transferred to the Central Fund.  I should like to support that plea, perhaps not entirely for the same reasons as Deputy Kyne.  My main reason for doing so is that it seems to me that any effort to transfer the cost of the health services to the Central Fund would be merely a method whereby the cost of the health services would in the main be paid for by the city and town dweller.  Already the State is contributing more to the cost of the health services than the local contribution and I think that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If you take into account other subventions referred to by the Minister for Finance, Dr. Ryan, the State is contributing more than the local authority.  We should be careful <Col N="515" /> about allowing that situation to develop any further.</P>
      <P>The only aspect of the health services or the administration of the Department that I want to discuss, apart from that, is one on which the Minister has heard me before and I hope he will bear with me again.  It is the subject of alcoholism.  Deputy Sherwin referred to drink as being the root of all evil in this country. I do not know whether he is right or not but the subject I want to discuss is not drunkenness but alcoholism, which is a very different thing. Alcoholism is a disease.  The alcoholic cannot help himself.  He will keep on drinking although more than anything else he wants to stop drinking. It is not a question of exercising his will or pulling himself together.  It is a disease and he needs treatment.</P>
      <P>I want to put it to the House that this disease is a very serious one from the point of view of public health and that most of us do not realise the extent to which it affects the country. There are no official figures available to the Minister or anybody else to show the extent of the incidence of alcoholism in this country.  There are certain figures but they are incomplete. Consequently, the suggestion I am going to make as to the incidence is merely an estimate based on experience in other countries.  The first step I take in arriving at this figure is to consider some studies made by the World Health Organisation which seem to show that in those countries in which a study has been made the incidence of alcoholism ranges between three per cent. and seven per cent. of those who take a drink.  In the United States of America certain studies were made amongst immigrant groups from various countries and they showed that alcoholism was more widespread amongst those from Ireland than amongst those from many other countries.  Taking those two items together I calculate it is reasonable to say that five per cent. of the people who take a drink in this country suffer from alcoholism. I do not know the number of people who drink but I think the figure of 1,000,000 is not excessive.</P>

      <P>Consider the number of your friends and acquaintances who drink.  Remember these are not people who drink heavily but those who just take a drink.  It includes all those men and women.  If you work on that basis, that they amount to 1,000,000, then at five per cent. you get a figure of 50,000.  I am trying to make it clear that this, if you like, is merely a guess and I have given the basis on which I make my estimate.  It is the best we can do in the circumstances because we have not got any official figures.  The trouble with this is that not alone does it seem to imply that we have something like 50,000 alcoholics but for every one alcoholic there are many people greatly affected in their lives and have their lives made miserable by the alcoholism of others. These include parents, husbands, wives and children.  In addition, sometimes employers and fellow employees can all be deeply affected by one alcoholic. If you work that out the number of people affected by alcoholism in this country is, on that basis, not far off half a million people.  At that stage we are reaching a problem which certainly needs to be looked into.  I might say, as some slight confirmation of some of the arguments I have been advancing, that two well-known Irish psychiatrists have stated that amongst the cases they have treated of anxiety neurosis by far the largest proportion was caused by alcoholism in the parents of the patients.  They are Irish doctors speaking of conditions in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another interesting fact that emerged from the study conducted by the World Health Organisation was that in every case the Government concerned, or the <Col N="517" /> authorities concerned, had grossly under-estimated the incidence of alcoholism in their own country.  I mention that in case the Minister thinks that I am laying it on a bit.  When scientific studies were made these people found that they were grossly under-estimating the incidence of alcoholism.  All of this is designed to suggest to the House that we have this problem and that it is on a very large scale.  To anybody who knows anything about this problem the amount of misery, hardship, degradation and, indeed, ill-health caused is absolutely appalling.  I think it would not be unreasonable to say the number of man-hours lost in productive work easily exceeds the number of manhours lost through industrial disputes. All of this adds up to the fact that we must take action to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>As to what action we should take, I suggest there are certain lines along which we can proceed.  Before I suggest what those are, I am aware from the Minister that the Commission on Mental Health, which is sitting at present, is considering this problem.  The difficulty is that this Commission is dealing with it because a section of the Mental Treatment Act says that, where a person by reason of addiction to drugs or alcohol is a danger to himself or others, he may be committed to an institution. This whole concept of alcoholism as a mental disease is one of the causes of our failure to deal with the problem.  If you have an alcoholic in your family, you will not advertise it.  Apart from the ordinary disgrace involved in it, if it is officially treated as a mental disease, you want to avoid that stigma, if at all possible.  The result is that there are many doctors who, for the sake of the patient or the patient's family, certify people as suffering from bronchitis and all sorts of diseases but never mention alcoholism, which they know is the real trouble.</P>
    <P>My contention is that this disease should not, unless in certain exceptional cases, be treated as a mental disease.  The Minister might consider embarking on a very intensive educational campaign.  If you think back to <Col N="518" /> a few years ago and remember the situation which obtained in regard to T.B., you will get some idea of what I mean.  At that time T.B. was regarded as a terrible social stigma.  The result was that people suffering from T.B. were allowed to go on suffering without treatment because they would not admit what was wrong.  I suggest the same problem arises here and that to overcome it you need, first, this extensive educational campaign.</P>
    <P>This will make people realise, firstly, that this is a disease which requires treatment and, secondly, that it is a disease which is not a mental disease.  If that is done, it will succeed in getting treatment for a number of alcoholics who will not get it otherwise. It will also promote the idea I am trying to propagate and will give a good deal of information to people who are alcoholics, as well as those who are not, as to the symptoms of alcoholism and, what is more important, of incipient alcoholism.  As a result, people who are about to become alcoholics may be saved from this fate.</P>
    <P>I would suggest it would be a very sound idea to provide units in the general hospitals for the treatment of alcoholism.  I see two reasons for such a service.  First, to overcome this stigma of treatment in a mental hospital and, secondly, to provide treatment throughout the country, for alcoholism is not confined to Dublin or Cork. You will find it throughout the country. Unless units can be provided to give treatment throughout the country, few people will come and get treatment.</P>
    <P>The actual treatment itself&mdash;the &ldquo;dry-out&rdquo; as it is called&mdash;takes, I understand, only a few weeks but the problem arises afterwards when the patient is released.  I have seen this myself.  I know of a case where a patient, having got this treatment and having been released, was very depressed. Doctors will understand that the patient would be naturally depressed on coming out after treatment like this.  The best thing the friends and relations of this patient could think of to cheer him up was another <Col N="519" /> few drinks.  I saw that happen and, of course, that patient was back on the same old road of degradation in a short time.</P>
    <P>It is vital that some system of education be embarked on by the Department of Health so that this kind of thing cannot happen and to make people aware of the grave injustice they are doing if they administer drink to people who have been alcoholics and who have come out after treatment. The Minister might consider having out-patient departments set up in various hospitals to deal with people when they have got treatment.  He could do a lot worse than model the treatment by the out-patient departments on the organisation, Alcoholics Anonymous.  That organisation has done tremendously good work.  Where medical science and religion have failed, Alcoholics Anonymous have succeeded.  There is a tremendous debt due to that organisation and a good deal to be learned from its activities. If anybody thinks I am exaggerating the effects of alcoholism, I should like to mention that a Convention of Alcoholics Anonymous took place in Galway not so long ago at which two alcoholics spoke.  One of them was a priest and he described his situation.</P>
    <P>He said that alcoholism in his case had resulted in spiritual, mental and physical loss to himself, disgrace for his family and acute embarrassment for his co-religionists.  Both his father and his grandfather had been rabid teetotallers, and he started drinking in order to prove that he could drink and do without it if he liked.  But, before he knew where he was, he could not stop drinking.  He was an alcoholic, and from then on he crashed cars, was convicted of drunkenness, stole money and went through a complete degradation, spiritually, morally and physically. This man came along to this association of Alcoholics Anonymous, testified this himself and testified what happened to him when he went in for treatment.  He was 10 months in a mental institution before he finally admitted to himself he was an alcoholic. That, of course, is the first step in the cure.  The person must realise <Col N="520" /> himself that he is an alcoholic.  This is one of the things that could be put across in an educational campaign. The actual technical details of the treatment are a matter for the doctors dealing with the problem.  I would suggest to the Minister that some kind of programme on the lines I have mentioned&mdash;or perhaps on better lines if the Minister can provide it&mdash;is essential if we are to overcome this grave social evil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to express my appreciation of the Minister's extremely comprehensive survey of the medical situation here.  It is always an advantage when a Minister comes into the House and covers the whole picture from end to end.  I do not think anyone can accuse the Minister of having left anything out.  In his survey he referred to the fact that once again heart disease is the Captain of Death in this country. He said there are more cases of death from heart disease than from any other cause.  He specifically mentioned the fact that coronary thrombosis is an ailment that is considerably on the increase.  It must give us all cause to try to ascertain the reasons for it and see if there is any means by which it can be overcome.</P>
      <P>Apart from the number of deaths it causes, which is as high as over 4,000, it is very disabling.  People who get this disease are a long time out of work and very often, unless they are entirely freed from anxiety in any way, do not become fully functional again.  The Minister gave us reasons in two of which I fully concur.  He said higher standards in diet, richer foods, and the opportunities for acquiring such things were one cause, and the lack of exercise was the other.  One cannot stress sufficiently lack of exercise.  We have grown up in a soft age in which the majority of the people have given up walking altogether.  In the City of Dublin nobody ever seems to think of walking anywhere.  People take their cars everywhere they go.  Lack of daily exercise ultimately means increasing weight and that, in turn, brings on the attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another very definite cause of coronary thrombosis to which the Minister <Col N="521" /> did not refer is anxiety neurosis.  This disease is very prevalent among white collar workers, salaried people.  It is due to the stress of modern times and trying to make ends meet.  The high cost of everything and the high level of taxation which does not permit people to save are a constant worry to the breadwinner who feels that if anything happens to him his wife and family will be without provision.  Such worry very often induces this illness.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister can do anything about that except, perhaps, to ask his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to be more liberal to the white collar workers than he is already in regard to remission of taxation. Remission of taxation in respect of the payment of medical fees, for instance, might help to some extent to allay anxiety neurosis and result in fewer cases of coronary thrombosis.</P>
    <P>The question of lung cancer has been very extensively dealt with by other speakers.  It certainly must give us cause for reflection, that of 4,759 deaths from cancer registered in the last twelve months, 680 were from lung cancer or connected in some way with malignancy of the lung.  I am inclined to agree with other speakers that the Minister cannot brush this matter aside without taking definite action, but I do not think all the speakers were fair to the Minister in suggesting he is doing nothing at all.  He is doing something. He has set up the Cancer Commission and I am sure one of the terms of reference of that Commission is to enquire particularly into the position in regard to lung cancer.</P>
    <P>As to whether the Minister can do more or not, I think he can.  In the Report of the Royal College of Physicians issued in the United Kingdom recently it has been stated that tobacco smoking, particularly cigarette smoking, is a predisposing cause of cancer.  They have not categorically stated it is the cause of cancer&mdash;that is the mistake most of the speakers have made so far&mdash;but that it is a predisposing cause and that is a very different thing from being a direct cause.  It is also stated in this Report that cigarette smoking over and above anything else is a predisposing cause of lung cancer. <Col N="522" /> It was further stated that the hot end of the cigarette produces the collection of nicotine poisoning which is this predisposing cause.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that he cannot stop people smoking, that he cannot say: &ldquo;You may not smoke.&rdquo; It is a free country and people are entitled to smoke if they want to.  I may say in passing that I do not smoke at all.  Although the Minister cannot compel people to stop smoking, certain steps have been taken and certain suggestions have been made in other countries to deal with the situation.  In fact, I read the other day that tobacco merchants&mdash;I think it is in England and in Italy&mdash;are considering the introduction of a cigarette with a trap or cache which would prevent the nicotine being absorbed into the system.  This, of course, is only in the embryonic stages but the Minister could consider the steps they have taken, how far they have gone in dealing with this problem both in the United Kingdom and in Italy, and if it would be possible to have a consultation with the tobacco manufacturers here to see if they would be prepared to engage in the same type of manufacture so that the danger might be offset to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>I do not consider tobacco smoking is the sole predisposing cause of cancer.  In recent years methods of diagnosis have been very much better than before and whereas cancer has probably always been with us it may not have been diagnosed.  With modern methods of diagnosis all cases of cancer can be diagnosed, which gives us a greater figure than before. There are, however, other predisposing causes of lung cancer, one of them being diesel oil fumes.  There has been greater use of diesel oil within the last few years than before and there are statistics to show that cancer is induced by diesel oil fumes. Furthermore, it is in the built-up areas, in the cities, that the greatest incidence of cancer is found, that is where the diesel oil fumes from buses and other vehicles are to be found. The statistics of the British Navy, which are very carefully kept, in regard to the incidence of the disease, <Col N="523" /> show that the rate of incidence of cancer of the lung is higher among stokers in the Royal Navy, who are dealing with diesel fumes in the engine room, than among any other section of that service.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Dr. Browne's wishes were adhered to and the Minister were, in an arbitrary fashion, to issue a decree tomorrow to abolish smoking altogether&mdash;which of course he would have great difficulty in enforcing&mdash;it would be no guarantee of the abolition of the contributory causes of cancer.  The Minister certainly has taken some steps in setting up this Commission.  I hope the Commission will read the speeches of the Deputies of Dáil Éireann on the subject during the debate on this Health Estimate. Perhaps they could pool all our ideas and derive some benefit from them.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to smallpox. That is another disease that must give cause for acute anxiety.  I wonder if we are not a little too complacent about smallpox here.  If there were a case in Liverpool, I doubt if we would feel happy about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We certainly would not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Or if there were a case within the vicinity of the London Docks, Fishguard, or anywhere that has frequent contact with this country, I wonder if we would feel very happy. There have been several outbreaks of smallpox in the United Kingdom and we have been exceedingly fortunate that it has not spread here.  Today there is wide travel.  Our people are travelling all over the world.  People from other countries are coming in here.  Some come from countries in which there are no proper medical facilities, no proper sanitary arrangements, no proper medical statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outbreak of the disease in England was brought about through immigration from Pakistan.  The type of disease brought in from Pakistan was very virulent.  The disease could quite easily be introduced again. <Col N="524" /> There could be an outbreak of smallpox in Liverpool.  That would light up anxiety here and activate the medical authorities considerably more than are activated at the moment.  The scare has died down, but it could flare up again.  The type of smallpox in the recent outbreak is the most virulent type imaginable.  Many years ago, I practised in Durham and it was not unusual to see as many as three or four smallpox cases a day.  It was endemic in this industrial town of roughly 200,000 people in the North of England.  It was not a very dangerous type of the disease because it had been there for quite some time and had expended itself.  There was no compulsory vaccination.  There were many so-called conscientious objectors to vaccination.  There are always cranks here and there, but I think the highest percentage of cranks is in the north of England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Except Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the people in Wexford are very conscientious. I have been vaccinated myself. Eventually in the north of England something had to be done.  There was certain propaganda.  The medical authorities put up placards and posters in prominent places showing what the ravages of the disease could do.  It is, of course, very disfiguring.  Women were frightened out of their lives and, when women take the initiative in something, the men very quickly follow suit.  I suggest the Minister should have some kind of propaganda about the risk of the disease and also about the effects of the disease.  In that way, people would be made aware of the risks and the dangers. Practically 90 per cent. of those infected in England recently died.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would it be advisable, I wonder, to introduce compulsory vaccination for children?  We had it up to about 20 years ago, but, by a free vote of this House, it was decided to remove compulsion.  Circumstances are radically different today as compared with 20 years ago and serious consideration should be given to the question of reintroducing compulsory vaccination <Col N="525" /> for children.  If people are vaccinated in childhood, there is far less discomfort than there is if people are vaccinated for the first time in adult life.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that domiciliary maternity is largely disappearing. Most women are now going into hospital to have their confinements. That is the present trend.  It is putting a great strain on the accommodation available in both local and private institutions.  I am told a long-established Dublin nursing home is closing down because of difficulty in carrying on.  It is often difficult for people to secure private accommodation.  Possibly this nursing home has to close down because of the expense and because patients are not prepared to pay increased fees.</P>
    <P>That brings me to domiciliary maternity. What can the Minister do?  I have unhesitatingly opposed the Health Act of 1953 here and elsewhere, but I acknowledge that the maternity services under that Act are a definite step forward.  Those in the income groups concerned could go to any doctor for ante-natal treatment.  The doctor was paid a fee.  He did not necessarily have to take charge of the actual confinement, if a patient went to hospital, but he still got the same fee.  That fee is well earned, but, in order to encourage domiciliary treatment and confinement, I think the Minister should increase the fee, provided the doctor attends the patient in her own home.  That would relieve the health services of a certain burden because there would be a saving in maintenance.  I suggest the fee should be increased from seven guineas to ten guineas.  Patients would then be encouraged to stay in their own homes.  Public expenditure would be saved.  There would be an easement in the pressure on beds.  The Minister might consider that suggestion.  I think he could do what I suggest by ministerial direction.</P>
    <P>There are three maternity hospitals which have been pressing the Minister for funds to enable them to extend their private accommodation.  One of the things which have prevented the Minister acceding to this request for <Col N="526" /> funds to extend private accommodation was the fact that he felt he might be injuring private enterprise, in other words, nursing homes.  I do not think that problem arises now when one of the biggest private nursing homes in Dublin is to close down in the next few weeks or few months and be turned into a block of offices.  The Minister should seriously consider the question of giving the hospitals the opportunity of doing the extensions they want to do and of taking in private patients.  That would relieve some of his problems with regard to maternity treatment.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of mental health, on which quite a few Deputies have spoken.  It is one of the greatest problems we have to face in this country.  There is the problem of the mentally retarded child and there is the problem of mental patients.  The question of the mentally retarded child is much more acute. Modern methods of treatment are now being used to a considerable extent in our mental hospitals and people are getting a better understanding of the whole matter.  In some instances the walls are being taken down and people do not feel as if they were going into a jail.  They appreciate the fact that they are going in for treatment.  Sufferers from mental illness used to languish in mental hospitals for years whereas now they can be discharged in many cases after a short period of treatment, particularly where electric therapy is concerned.</P>
    <P>Our problem with regard to the mentally defective child is that there is an enormous waiting list.  I am not attributing any particular blame to the Minister for that.  It is just a state of affairs that exists.  We were, perhaps, a bit slow of the mark in dealing with the problem.  It is not only a question of hospital accommodation; it is also a question of staffing and the training of nurses.  Even if we had facilities for housing the patients and were able to relieve the anxiety of parents by taking the children off their hands and getting them into institutions we would not have the staff to deal with them.  That is <Col N="527" /> the greatest problem that faces the Minister.</P>
    <P>The first approach towards dealing with that problem is to have some scheme whereby people would be encouraged to undergo psychiatric training so that they would be able to deal with mentally defective children.  The Saint John of God Brothers and several orders of nuns have given most devoted service in that respect.  They work at it for the glory of God and there is no question of trade union hours or trade union rates of wages.  We are all proud of the work they are doing here but even they are unable to get postulants and they find themselves restricted in the number of patients they can take by the fact that they cannot get staff.  The Minister should, if necessary, send people away to be trained in psychiatric nursing so that staff may be available to man the institutions when they are ready.</P>
    <P>The second trouble is that in these institutions of the Saint John of God Brothers and the nuns there is not an outflow of patients equivalent to the inflow.  They take them in and they have to keep them.  There are many children who, after a certain period, do not need any further active treatment although they may need supervision. They are still not well enough to be sent back to their parents and they remain a liability of the devoted religious who have taken them over. The same position obtains in the Protestant homes.  They, also, give very devoted service and I should like to pay a tribute to them for the work they are doing.</P>
    <P>The Minister should think along the line of having some institution where cases of this sort could be kept.  Some big estate could be bought in the country where these people could be usefully employed at farming work. One person would be able to look after quite a number of them.  They would still be in charge of the experts but they would be able to lead happy and useful lives.  In that way we would be freeing beds so that there could be a further inflow of new and younger patients.  It is a difficult problem but the Minister may be <Col N="528" /> assisted by the suggestion I have made on that point.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me by people concerned with the blind.  There is, apart from the blind pension, a certain allowance made to blind people.  Most of these social service benefits are usually paid from the date of the application.  These blind people tell me that when an application is granted it is not paid as from the date of the application but only from the date on which it is granted.  I think that is a matter for the Minister for Health and perhaps he would look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir A. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I shall not go any further with it.  Now I come to the vexed question of health cards. I think everybody knows that I have no time for this Health Act.  I have always felt that there must be cut and dried regulations in regard to State medicine.  It is the duty of the county manager to give out medical cards and I felt, when the Bill was going through the House, that it was an unfair imposition on the county manager that he should have to take sole responsibility for the issue of medical cards. He is bound by certain regulations. If a person has £9 or £10 a week he is not entitled to a medical card but if such a person has ten children, or even five children, I cannot see how he will be able to pay for a doctor, which he will have to do if he has not a medical card.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not so difficult to pay for the ordinary medical practitioner but there is always anxiety on the part of these people if they have to go into hospital. It is the duty of the county manager to decide whether they get the medical card or not and the county manager has no means of finding out what a person's circumstances are except through the home assistance officer. The home assistance officer sends a report back to the county manager and it is on that report that the county manager makes his decision.  That may seem a beautiful system on paper but it is not.  There are in rural Ireland <Col N="529" /> and in the cities also certain idiosyncrasies of which we are all aware.</P>
    <P>There are many cases of hardship. Managers may refuse cards in certain cases when they do not know the full facts.  A very simple solution of that difficulty is the method of appeal.  The Minister could establish the appeal board within his Department.  Then, if anybody feels aggrieved in respect of a health card, there is the appeal board to go to.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy is persecuted by people who come about health cards. I am continually being asked about that point.  We may be told that certain people are not entitled to a health card because of their financial circumstances.  The ordinary domiciliary circumstances do not seem to be taken into consideration in every case. The matter should not be one for the Minister as it would put an unfair burden on him.  There are people in his Department who can look after the matter.  The Minister may reply that if people in any constituency or in any county feel aggrieved with regard to health cards, an officer from the Department can be sent down to investigate the matter.  I do not think that is as satisfactory as my suggestion of an appeal board.  I appeal to the Minister to give it his serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Health has succeeded in making great advances in equipping our various hospitals and in ensuring as far as possible that sick persons will get the very best treatment.  I want to deal with the subject just mentioned by the last speaker, the blue card.  Each case is considered on its merits by the Dublin Health Authority.  I have yet to find a case brought to my notice about which I could say there was a direct hardship on the individual. Recently I asked the Dublin Health Authority to give me the number of people who had received treatment free of charge in the city and county of Dublin and it amounted to something like 66,000.  The number of ordinary insured workers who had to pay 10/- a day was very small.  I am as close to the people as any other Deputy.  If a man becomes ill <Col N="530" /> and if no salary is coming into the house and if there is no other income, then invariably the charge is 2/- or 3/- a day, and possibly nothing at all in quite a number of cases.</P>
      <P>The discretionary clause in the Health Act is very good.  I know of a man who was earning over £1,000 a year and who lived up to it.  He became ill for about six months.  He was a commercial traveller and was paid on commission and while he was ill, he had no salary.  If we have a hard and fast yardstick, such a man would be debarred, because of his salary, from benefit.</P>
      <P>No matter what progress is made and even if we were able to do a good deal better and were able to do all the things which some members of the Opposition desire us to do&mdash;although they had six years themselves during which they could have implemented many of the promises they made to the people&mdash;the Opposition would still find fault with us.  We are doing our very best.  I would never like to see that discretionary clause deleted from the Act. It has been responsible for the elimination of a lot of hardship when people were not able to pay for hospital treatment.</P>
      <P>Great advances have been made in our health services since I first came to this House.  Much credit is due to the present Minister when he was Minister for Local Government and again as Minister for Health and to the present Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Health.</P>

      <P>We are big enough to concede credit where any worthwhile contribution was made. <Col N="531" /> Deputy Donegan has given me inspiration. It is nice of him to interrupt me.  We have heard much talk recently from the Fine Gael Party about taxation. The health services are responsible for quite an amount of money. Large numbers of people claim reliefs and will try to have hospital bills reduced.  Hardly a week goes by that I am not engaged on such work.  We hear the Fine Gael Party say that the health charges are too high and that the rates are too high.  They never tell the people that the Exchequer pays 50 per cent. of the charges.</P>
      <P>It would be possible to make our health services a complete national charge by increasing the cost of certain consumer and other goods but the first people to vote against that proposition would be the Opposition.  We cannot blow hot today and blow cold tomorrow. We hear talk about the free health services in England.  There is no such thing as free health services in any country.  While England has possibly more generous health services than we have, the people there, as a whole, contribute more to them.  The Government in England are giving no such thing as free health services.  If we were to ask our people to contribute towards the health services, how could we collect money from people who are self-employed?  I will not mention any particular section. Who will ask them to contribute? That is the only way it can be done but it would be a huge job to do it.  It would mean that the insured worker would have to pay a good deal more. I do not intend to deal with something which a Select Committee of the House has been set up to consider.  These are the problems as we find them in the city and county of Dublin.  We are all very anxious to relieve the burden of health charges but we have to be sensible as to how to approach the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me now deal with the voluntary health insurance.  That service has done a very good job of work and I should like to see it go even further, if that were possible.  In regard to the voluntary health service, if you have a medical history, they are not too <Col N="532" /> anxious to take you on at all.  Of course, it is an independent board and they have to view the contributions they receive and see what can be done, but if there is any medical history in a family, they are not so anxious to take on that family.  There are certain sections of our people who are nobody's children, and it is with that section of the community I am concerned. They have to be catered for. I should like to see that section of our people put into a particular category, if it is possible to do so.  These people drawing a good salary are not possibly able to continue paying high hospital charges.  However, we shall leave that aspect of the matter to the Select Committee and see what they will report to us on the matter.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is no such thing as free health services except for the very poor and destitute who are not in a position to contribute anything.  In the city and county of Dublin, we have done very well in regard to the weaker sections of our people.  To say that in England they have a completely free health service is to state what is not a fact.  They contribute generously towards that service.  The workers have to contribute a good deal more than our people here have to contribute.</P>
    <P>We have made wonderful advances in regard to hospitalisation and the treatment of T.B. patients.  The CEO of the Dublin Health Authority, who is chairman of the National Mass Radiography Association, made a statement at a meeting of the Dublin Health Authority which perturbed many of us.  He referred to the small percentage of people who avail themselves of the mass radiography service.  From this House, I appeal to our people to avail themselves of this service.  In certain counties, the number availing themselves of the services is as low as three per cent; in other counties, the percentage is seven; and in still other counties, it is 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>When we are told of the number of cases of T.B. contracted by people of 40 years, 50 years and even 60 years, it is most essential for the wellbeing and good of our people that, <Col N="533" /> every person should avail of the service, especially when it is made available in a particular area.  A stitch in time saves nine.  There are too many of our people who contract T.B. who do not know about it until it is too far advanced for successful treatment.  Notwithstanding modern treatment, a number of them die.  No person need stay at home now&mdash;all can be treated immediately and there are plenty of beds available.  Our people should avail of the service for their own good and the good of their homes and families.</P>
    <P>In regard to mental hospitals, the Minister has made a very big contribution during the past four or five years in the matter of rehabilitation and in the reconstruction of a number of wards in the mental hospitals throughout the country.  We have too much overcrowding.  There is no chance of treating people who are confined.  They have got to be in congenial surroundings in order to encourage them to get better.  As I say, great advances have been made in regard to mental treatment in recent years.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Minister on the special interest he has taken in that particular side of our hospitalisation service.  I know he is fully aware of the conditions that exist in mental hospitals.  He is trying to do everything he can to modernise them and bring them up to date and thus effect the cure of patients.  Hundreds of patients are now discharged from mental hospitals.  That was not the case some years ago.  I am referring to one place in particular&mdash;Ballyowen. I might say that the Minister fathered that institution more than any other person.  It is really a rest hotel for people suffering from mental diseases, so much so that the number of patients discharged, the number who have come back voluntarily for treatment and the number who have come back for consultation with the doctors is really edifying.  These wonderful advances have taken place in our time.</P>
    <P>If the Minister&mdash;I hope he will be with us for a long while yet&mdash;looks after the people who suffer from <Col N="534" /> mental illness, which is as natural as physical illness, he will have the gratitude and blessings of many of our people.  It will take a good deal of money.  Any money that can be spent on such places to bring about complete segregation and give more room, is money well spent.  In 1947, there was introduced the domiciliary service for people suffering from T.B. Prior to that, a man suffering from tuberculosis had to go to the sanatorium knowing that his wife and family had nothing to exist on.  That was one of the greatest social advances in recent times and it has contributed more than anything else to curing men suffering from this disease, since it eased their minds to know that their wives and families were getting an allowance while they were in hospital.</P>
    <P>A lot more might be done in relation to the demolition of old wings in mental hospitals and the building of new wings.  The job would cost a great deal but it would be worth it.  While on the subject of mental hospitals, I should like to deal briefly with the problem of retarded children.  I recently attended with the Tánaiste the opening of a school for this type of child and I was amazed at the amount of work being done through voluntary effort for retarded children.  This voluntary effort is more necessary now than ever, since the treatment of these children requires a very intelligent approach.  Heretofore, such children were kept away from society, sometimes sent to mental hospitals by their parents, there to become as bad as the other inmates.  That deprived them of the educational facilities which are now being made available in these special schools for mentally retarded children.  I know the Minister has this problem in hands but I hope he will treat the matter of grants to such institutions as one of urgency.</P>
    <P>Another group of people deserving of attention are those condemned to wheelchairs, the victims of polio or some other such paralysing disease. We have in Dún Laoghaire the Wheelchair Rehabilitation Centre which caters for a number of those people. The Wheelchair Association is an entirely voluntary body who do a tremendous amount of good work and <Col N="535" /> they deserve the congratulations of this House.  I hope they will get more support from the public.</P>

      <P>I do not want to say very much more, but I would point out the problem of people in respect of disability grants.  We have quite a number of people suffering from chronic rheumatism, arthritis and other disabling ailments.  They can be classed as invalids.  They are treated very well in hospitals but they could be looked after at home if the disability grants were sufficient.  I am not satisfied with the way city and county managers deal with applications for these allowances. They go too deeply into the means of applicants.</P>

      <P>I shall change it to disablement allowances, if that phrase allows me to get in.  I find there is a very niggardly approach to this matter by the local authorities. Sufferers from rheumatism and arthritis, if they are over 21 years of age and living in their own homes, are a severe burden on their parents and brothers and sisters.  If they were forced to stay in hospital, it would cost the Exchequer £7 or £8 a week. They would be far happier at home but the allowances should be sufficient to relieve their families of the cost of maintaining and looking after them.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I would say the Minister is doing a good job in the Department of Health and I hope he will be left there to finish it.</P>

      <P>I note that the Minister stepped into the breach to help Deputy Burke and made it clear that he was responsible for disablement allowances.  It is well to remember that in future, because in the past, when county medical officers of health decided against an application for such an allowance, the unsuccessful applicant had no appeal.  In the future, we shall be able to take advantage of the Minister's acceptance of responsibility in the matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not say that, so we can argue that point again.  Deputy Burke has now gone off, convinced that the Minister is the father and mother of it all.  In any event, I would draw the Minister's attention to the very unsatisfactory system in Cork at the present time in connection with general hospitalisation. The Minister is well aware of it, but a red herring has been drawn across the trail.  It is a disgrace to see that the efforts made over the years in St. Finbarr's are now being nullified by lack of decision.  I do not want to go into any great detail because the Minister is aware of the whole position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fantastic, nonsensical suggestion which emanated from the Department in connection with the transfer of patients to Sarsfield Court is, in my opinion, nothing less than an abuse on the people.  By now, the Minister must know that medical opinion is completely against it.  The authorities of the University in Cork must themselves consider it a wildcat scheme. While the Minister can truthfully say when he is winding up the debate that he is awaiting recommendations or a decision from the Cork authority, he is equally in a position to know that hospitalisation is being held up and that the improvements so vitally necessary in St. Finbarr's to help to complete the good work carried out there over the years are being held up because of the latest red herring. That is unfair to the people there and unfair to all concerned.  The sooner we get a decision that the <Col N="537" /> famous, or now infamous, regional hospital proposal is a wildcat scheme, and the sooner we get the green light for the improvement of that hospital, the better.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will admit, as is admitted, by most critical people in the south of Ireland, that St. Finbarr's is one of the most up-to-date hospitals having regard to the amount of money available to it.  The sooner the Minister's Department clears the path for us, and the sooner the work is finished, the better pleased the members of the health authority will be.</P>
    <P>I should like to touch briefly on the question of dispensaries.  I know that many people, members of the House and outside it, may be inclined to disregard the amount of work that can be carried out in dispensaries in rural Ireland.  We seem to have moved into an era where we consider that nothing will do but the most elaborate hospitals in every part of the country. Some people in this Chamber come from rural areas and they should know that if we have properly situated, properly constructed, properly equipped dispensaries in the rural areas, the local people will be able to avail of the services there which will automatically mean less hospitalisation ultimately.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that a few years ago the Minister considered it suitable to wind up the grant which had been made available for the erection of dispensaries. Even at this late stage, I again appeal to the Minister to offer to the local health authorities the advantage of financial assistance for the erection of dispensaries.  I know, of course, that in Cork, in Dublin and in other centres, medical men can avail of fashionable plates on doors in fashionable centres in the cities and towns, but very often we can point to the dispensary doctors as being every bit as good in their attention to the patients in rural areas as many of the noisy people in other centres.</P>
    <P>I wish to see our dispensary system improved, and I believe it could be improved.  I would point out that in 1952, roughly, a deputation went to <Col N="538" /> the then Minister for Health and it was finally agreed that in the Cork area, where possible, a nurse with midwifery qualifications would be appointed to each dispensary district. For years, that system proved to be a boon to the people in those areas and it was a help to the dispensary doctor who was interested in his work. Between the two of them, they were good to the people and gave a good service.  Unfortunately, the weak link in the chain in certain centres was the lack of suitable dispensaries and lack of suitable equipment in some dispensaries. Therefore, I ask the Minister to reconsider his attitude towards dispensaries in rural Ireland and I hope that the proposals from Cork county which are in his Department in connection with the proposed erection of new dispensaries will receive the speedy consideration which we would all wish for them.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into any detail regarding the matter of medical cards. Deputy Esmonde covered it in great detail, but, like many other speakers, I cannot say I am satisfied with the system now in operation.  That system was meant to be fair and just, and unfortunately it is hard to pin it down. Even the manager of a health authority or a superintendent may be caught, because of the fact that there is so much discretion in the hands of the local assistance officers.  On many occasions, because they favour certain families, they give advantages to those families and on many other occasions, because of some dislike or other they have of another family, they give no advantage but find out the last penny that is coming into the home. The result is that at present the system is undoubtedly working in many respects against itself, and against what was intended when the Health Act was introduced&mdash;a fair and just system.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may say that the purpose of the medical card is to give a service to the person who is unable to provide for himself or his family, and while the manager of the health authority may say that each case is dealt with individually, we cannot forget that in any health authority <Col N="539" /> area where a large number of medical card holders are involved, it is impossible to deal with them individually. I am not blaming the manager of the health authority for that.  It is impossible for the superintendent at times to deal with all the cases and, therefore, they go back to the man who originally deals with the application, the local assistance officer.</P>
    <P>If this situation is remedied and if the manager of the health authority, in consultation with the Minister and the Department, is brought to realise the difference in money values, and the necessity for uplifting the means test in connection with the issue of medical cards in general, then perhaps we in the Labour Party will again be able to say that we are satisfied with the improvement in the system we originally supported and never regretted having supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I was referring to the fact that in the past three years or so, there has been a very definite increase or expansion in the tax revenue available to the Minister for Finance.  It is interesting to refer to the manner in which the moneys available to the Minister have been distributed over the past few years.  In the financial <Col N="540" /> year 1960-61, the tax revenue available to the Minister amounted to £115,000,000.  Out of that, he expended on the less well-off sections of the community, on social welfare payments of one kind or another, a total of £26,000,000, or just 23 per cent. of the total sum.</P>
      <P>The Minister now has a further £20,000,000 in tax revenue amounting to £132,000,000 or £133,000,000 and the expenditure on social welfare payments amounts to in or around the same sum but the percentage is down to something around 19 per cent.  That means that this year with the moneys available to the Government, with an expansion in tax revenue, less of the total sum in proportion is being devoted to social welfare and to bettering the lot of the poor, the sick and the needy.</P>
      <P>That illustrates very clearly the approach of the Government, of which we are critical.  As I said last night, it has always been an expression of opinion by Ministers for Finance that as soon as the revenue will permit and within the limits of the increase in revenue available to them, they would first try to rectify and improve the lot of the less well-off sections.  It is clear that this time it has not been done. To-day, compared with three years ago, we are spending a smaller proportion of the money available to the Government on the poorer sections of the community.  It is in the light of that idea behind the Budget that we on this side of the House have had regard to what the Minister has done.</P>
      <P>As I said last night, he had the claims of the poor; he had the hands of the poor held out for some relief, some measure of socal justice; he also had the demands of the farmers who were able to organise and march.  He also had the demands and claims of the dancehall proprietors and the cinema owners throughout the country. In what way has he decided to dispense the extra £20,000,000 available to him? Of course we know what he has done. He decided to give half-a-crown to the old age pensioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half-a-crown is an interesting figure.  A month ago, I was led to believe, by strong-voiced Deputies, <Col N="541" /> that they would never support the Government, unless the increase in the old age pension was 5/-.  But it is half-a-crown now, take it or leave it, and it is half-a-crown that will be paid not now but next August, because, by deferring it to next August, the Government and the Minister for Finance will save £450,000 or £500,000.  That is the relief&mdash;half-a crown to the old age pensioners.  The unfortunate man who has to face an increase in the cost of fuel, of rent, of food, of clothing&mdash;if he has enough money to buy a new pair of trousers or a second-hand pair of trousers, or a coat&mdash;is to get 2/6d. but it is deferred until next August.  That is the only provision of any significance in this Budget in relation to increased social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Of course, the farmer is to get an increase in rate allowance totalling £2,500,000, and I am sure it will be very welcome, but it is significant that the benefit is not to be widely distributed. It is not to be enjoyed by the small farmers in the midlands, or the west, or any other part of the country.  The benefit of this expenditure of £2,500,000, or something like three times the amount being expended this year on increases in old age pensions, is to go to the well-off farmer in any county or rural community and that is to take place straight away.</P>
    <P>The third measure of relief is the abolition of entertainments duty.  It is interesting that if the Minister had decided not to give this relief in respect of entertainments duty, he could have paid the 2/6d. to the old age pensioners from the first day of this financial year.  But no&mdash;in order to provide cheap ballroom dancing for the people of Dublin city, the old age pensioner cannot be paid his 2/6d. until next August.</P>
    <P>Is it surprising then that we talk about this Budget as being a Budget which has cloudy and faulty thinking behind it, a Budget which is obviously the result of the stresses and strains on a Government composed as the present Government is?  They are pulling in a variety of directions and they are anxious to placate, even temporarily, as many influential people <Col N="542" /> as they possibly can.  The old age pensioner is not influential and the sick and needy and poor are not organised.  Half a crown promised might fob them off.  But the farmers may be organised; we know the dancehall owners to be organised, and in the case of groups like that, who are in a position to exercise influence on the Government and on the Minister, they are met, not by declaring a moratorium, but by payment in full and on the nail.</P>
    <P>Therefore, this Budget is introduced. The available money to the Minister is being dispensed in directions which may be perfectly justified.  There may be sound cases to be made for these reliefs, but certainly they do not represent the most urgent reliefs, so far as the community are concerned. It might have been a better investment in the future if the Minister had done this&mdash;and certainly social justice would demand he should do it in a year in which there is a surplus in tax revenue compared with other years. He might have increased the level of home assistance throughout the country to those barely surviving on the margin between nutrition and starvation.  If he had made more available for those purposes, if he had invested a little more in improving our health services, if he had devoted a little more to raising the standard of our education, if he had done things of that kind&mdash;not a lot because the money available to him would not permit a great deal&mdash;certainly it might have been a step in the right direction. But all that has been forfeited in the interest of expediency and in order to get, not a better country in the next 12 months, but to get this Government over the vote they had to face three or four weeks ago.  That is the object of the Budget we are debating this evening.</P>
    <P>In relation to the debate, we have had the Taoiseach coming in making, not a very convincing speech on behalf of his Government's Budget, but rather saying: &ldquo;Well, it is not too bad a Budget, but remember there may be temporary difficulties at the moment and things are going to be much better next year.  Wait until the Budget next year.&rdquo;  But when we <Col N="543" /> compare his speech with the speech of the Minister for Transport and Power when he was talking about the great things Fianna Fáil did in the past, about all the social welfare benefits they conferred on the people, one cannot help feeling that it is very much a case of jam yesterday and jam tomorrow, but they are not going to have any jam today.</P>
    <P>I was interested in some of the speeches from the more junior members of the Government or associated with the Government, particularly the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, who spoke yesterday. In defence of this Budget, he proceeded to emphasise how wonderful everything now was in the country.  I thought he was going to use the phrase made famous by reason of its present illfame, which was coined some years ago by the present Prime Minister of Great Britain when he told the people, &ldquo;You have never had it so good.&rdquo;  Certainly if the Parliamentary Secretary's speech was to be given an adjective, that would be the adjective in the way of a phrase that could be ascribed to it.  The people apparently are to be told that, whether they know it or not, they have never had it so good as they now have it under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I wonder is that bromide going to quieten the shattered nerves of some of Deputy Sherwin's constituents? Do they feel their lot is much improved or made very much easier because dancing is to be cheaper or because the owners of the local cinema are to make a little more money or because the large farmers of Cork or elsewhere will have a remission on their rates?  These people may never have had it so good, but I would be concerned to know whether the unfortunate people who queue up at the dispensaries in Deputy Sherwin's constituency and who live in the tenements around the place, trying to balance a few shillings or a few six-pences to buy a Fianna Fáil loaf of bread or a half pound of margarine, are the people the Parliamentary Secretary or any other member of the Government is addressing when he <Col N="544" /> tries to convince them that things have never been so good in this country?</P>
    <P>I should like to recommend to the Government that it is a worthwhile thing, even if they are long on the road and stale in their tracks, to keep an ear to the ground and to realise that the ordinary people at present are far from satisfied with the manner in which the country is being governed. This Budget contains nothing.  It is an improvisation to tide the Government over their political difficulties.  It is a Budget brought in to buy time. Time for what?  Do the Government think that, politically, things will be better for them next year?  Is that the reason the Taoiseach says in his speech: &ldquo;Next year's Budget will be better&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We are not going to wait.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I mean the ordinary people in the country.  We are not going to be fobbed off by promises to be paid on Tibb's Eve.  The people will remember that the Government were elected and sent into office five years ago on certain specific promises &mdash;promises not to be carried out sometime, somehow by some contrivance&mdash; but to provide 100,000 new jobs for the people.  These jobs were to be provided at the rate of 20,000 a year. That was five years ago.  If that promise had been carried out, today in this country, there should be close on 1,000,000 people in insurable employment. We know it has not been carried out.  We know now that the best that can be promised is that things may be better, perhaps not this year, but maybe next year.</P>
    <P>The facts are that at the time that promise was made five years ago, when Fianna Fáil were eager for office and concerned to get there, no matter what the cost might be in blighted hopes for the ordinary people, the time they made a promise of 100,000 new jobs, there were in insurable employment close on 800,000 people. Today, five years later, instead of the figure for those in insurable employment approaching the million mark, there are 62,000 fewer people working in this country.  That is not bad for five years.  The only trouble is that instead of going forward we are going <Col N="545" /> backwards.  The story would be complete if instead of 62,000, we had 100,000 fewer working today than five years ago, but the fact is 62,000 fewer people are employed than when this promise was first made.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to discuss emigration. When you discuss emigration in this House it is like the old patient going to the doctor and discussing his old complaint.  Everybody is bored with it.  We are bored with it because it is a chronic complaint.  Over the last five years, we have lost a quarter of a million people.  That has happened during that wonderful period we were to have when Fianna Fáil were elected to office in 1957.</P>

      <P>A quarter of a million people, enough to represent the entire county of Cavan.  This is the Party which put up one of their junior Ministers yesterday to try to tell the people they never had it so good. The census returns last August certainly were an indication to any responsible Party or group of people in this country that there would have to be a radical change in outlook, a jettisoning of old ideas and a firm decision to have some serious re-thinking of what has to be done.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence in this Budget that that re-thinking is taking place. All we are told now is: &ldquo;If you hold on, if you make sure you do not starve, if you make sure you do not die, if you make sure you do not become bankrupt, you will get another half-crown, you will get better health services or you will get some way of living in farming.  Hold on until next year or the year after and things will be better&rdquo;.  That approach will not solve anything and it will certainly not cod the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were criticised yesterday and other days during this debate by Deputies on the other side that we were rather trenchant in our remarks from this side of the House.  A Fianna Fáil Deputy, who claimed last night that he had never made a political speech in his life either in his constituency <Col N="546" /> or in this House, complained that on this side of the House and particularly on the Fine Gael side, we were inclined to be too political.  We are political.  That is why we are here, not to pull punches, not to say sweet things and not to keep Ministerial complacency as complacent as it has been.  Our concern as the Opposition in this House is to point out as strenuously as we can the manner in which this Government are not measuring up to their commitments to the people, and that we shall continue to do.  We feel all the stronger in our position when we find there are complaints from Fianna Fáil that what we are saying is needling them into criticism.</P>
    <P>I believe this Government are a fraud.  They are incapable of carrying out their policy or their programme. They do not know what to do or how to do it and they are only concerned with sticking together, hoping that in some magical way things will get better so far as the country is concerned. That is not the kind of Government this country can afford at the moment.  We should have in office a Government with ideas, that are able to give the country leadership, that are able to face the challenge of the Common Market with minds and ideas of their own, instead of having to put up with this bungling sort of performance we have experienced in the last 12 months or so about the Common Market.</P>
    <P>This is the month of May of 1962. Twelve months ago if any Deputy said during the last Budget debate that this country was going into the Common Market there would have been cries of &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; from Fianna Fáil.  Twelve months ago the Common Market was just so much &ldquo;cod&rdquo; so far as the Fianna Fáil Party were concerned, despite the fact that in 1957 the Fine Gael Party had put down a motion here directing the attention of Dáil Éireann to the coming Common Market in Europe and asking the Government to take the necessary steps to prepare this country for entry into that market and measuring up to whatever might be involved in that new coming together in Europe.  Of <Col N="547" /> course, we were told that our motion and what we were saying was irresponsible, that it did not matter, that Fianna Fáil had all the sense. Therefore, they wasted the first year, a second year, a third year, a fourth year, a fifth year, and then just ten months ago they all pulled up their socks, hitched up the old trousers and out they went having discovered at least that there was going to be a Common Market in Europe.</P>
    <P>What have they been doing ever since?  They have been foostering around the country, one Minister pulling out the sword with one hand and waving a gun in the other hand and saying: &ldquo;Get ready, boys.  We are all going to join NATO&rdquo;; then another Minister saying: &ldquo;That is not so.&rdquo; One Minister saying: &ldquo;That means the end of our political independence,&rdquo; and another Minister saying: &ldquo;You are going too far, Mick.&rdquo;  What is the result of that?  The country is in complete bewilderment and confusion, and is anybody surprised if that confusion should be there?</P>

      <P>I am going to make it relevant.  I want to know from the Minister for Finance why a Deputy of his Party has been permitted to circulate throughout the United States of America, swapping bases in this country for industries, and all the rest of it?  Why has somebody not stopped him?  Why has somebody not brought him back here, where he should be representing the city whose chain he wears, and representing the constituency that sent him here, instead of peregrinating throughout the United States, causing embarrassment to the country and embarrassment to his own colleagues?  Of course, that is symptomatic of the fact that, in relation to the big issues which now face the country&mdash;there is a good deal of talk about the Common Market, the Seven, and the Six&mdash;this Government are at sixes and sevens.  They do not know where they are going.  They do not know what will happen.  They do not know what the future is likely to be.</P>

      <P>I said this Government are in a not very happy position, but it is a position of their own choosing.  They are facing the Common Market negotiations.  I shall not discuss the problems they have to face, but they have to face problems. In relation to what is involved in our entry into the Common Market, in relation to allied problems, the Government have not taken the people into their confidence.  They are a dependent Government, not an independent Government.  They have failed to give the country the leadership it requires so urgently at the moment, and will require increasingly urgently in the future.</P>
      <P>I do not know how long the Government will last.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands said yesterday the Government would last for the normal duration.  If they do, so be it.  If the Government last for the normal period of this Dáil, I can only hope that sooner or later the Government will distil some clear policy.  What we have witnessed in the last twelve months is a going back on all the things that were promised.  The programme for economic expansion has now been scrapped.  It no longer represents anything. Every directive in it has been abandoned because it was politically expedient to abandon them.  If this Budget adumbrates Government policy for the future, it is obvious that we will have in the future a series of temporising measures introduced here in order to get over particular difficulties and particular Votes.  I do not believe that is good policy for the country.  So far as we in Fine Gael are concerned we will continue to do our duty here, conscious of the fact that we have a clear policy and a clear programme.</P>

      <P>I went forward in the last election as an Independent.  I am still an Independent.  After the last election, I had to face up to my responsibilities.  I was faced with the position that, if I did not support Deputy Lemass as Taoiseach, there would be no Government in the country.  I had a moral obligation to the country to ensure that a Government would function.  For that, and for no other reason, I supported Deputy Lemass.  I might have supported Deputy Dillon if he had had a few more men returned to this House and if it were possible for him to form a Government.  It was not possible, and I did the obvious thing.  I knew, in doing that, that I would be black-balled by a number of people, but I decided it was up to me to act responsibly, rather than run with the crowd, which is what the average fellow does in order to be on the safe side.  I accepted that responsibility because I was confident that what I was doing was the right thing.  Time will prove that I did the right thing.  I am not a man who depends on gimmicks or running with the crowd; I depend on hard work.  I am quite satisfied I still have the confidence of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with the Budget proper, I should like to give a short quotation.  There has been a good deal of reference to fraud in this debate.  The quotation is from President Kennedy.  He mentioned a syndicated columnist, who had millions of &ldquo;ears&rdquo;.  That columnist said that <Col N="552" /> people do not give a damn what the average senator or congressman says. The reason they do not give a damn is that what they hear is 99 per cent. tripe, ignorance and demagogy and cannot be replied on.  I accept that largely.</P>
    <P>Apart from what President Kennedy says, I have my own experience of politicians.  I am an Independent Deputy and I am in a position to know about politics and politicians and I took considerable care to study men and politics.  I am satisfied from my experience of this House that at least 90 per cent of what is said by the Opposition is tripe especially when a controversial Budget is being discussed. A Budget is something the impact of which hits almost everybody. Everyone who smokes has felt the impact of this Budget; everyone who takes a beer has been hit; all the people who wanted something have been hit.  The Budget presented an excellent opportunity for the Opposition to go to town and they took full advantage of it.  A Budget is an election in the abstract.</P>
    <P>I realise that the Opposition are bound to talk tripe 90 per cent of the time because they want to bring down the Government.  If they do not adopt that attitude, if they do not put the Government in the worst possible position, they will not succeed in bringing it down.  Politicians accept that lying and codding are all part of the game.  They feel it is fully justified. They feel that is the only way to keep their end up and the only way to get the best of their opponents.  I am not saying that the present Opposition are 90 per cent cod.  When the inter-Party Government were in office, Fianna Fáil were as much cods as the present Opposition.  If an Opposition hope to get the Government down, they must misrepresent and tell lies.</P>
    <P>Nothing said in this House is intended for the people in this House; it is all intended for the simpleminded people outside.  Politicians accept that half the people are simpleminded, that they never have an overall outlook and that therefore they will swallow anything said to them. Deputy Dillon is supposed to have <Col N="553" /> said that if you say a thing often enough, the people will finally believe it.  That is politics.  That sort of tactic is carried on by every Opposition and that is why I pay no attention to what the Opposition say.  I am prepared to admit that they are as decent a crowd as the people in power but they have to go on codding.  When they cease to cod, they will cease their efforts to dislodge the Government, but I pity the people outside who will have to make up their minds as between one side and the other.</P>
    <P>During this debate, reference was made by four Deputies to the housing position in Dublin.  Deputy Costello made reference to it on column 63 of the Dáil Debates of 2nd May and Deputy Ryan made reference to it at column 117 of 2nd May.  He said that the ultimate authority lies not with the local authority but with the Government. Deputy Ryan is a councillor of the Dublin Corporation.  Deputy Sweetman also mentioned my name and referred to the housing position in Dublin.  Here is the truth with regard to that matter.  In the summer of 1958, the first year of the Fianna Fáil Government, the then Housing Committee responsible for housing policy consisted of five Fianna Fáil members and ten anti-Fianna Fáil members.  It was that committee of 15 that decided not to build any more.</P>
    <P>The reason that committee of 15, ten of whom were anti-Fianna Fáil, decided not to build any more was the large vacancy rate in corporation dwellings.  Here are the figures which I got from Mr. Molloy only yesterday. In 1954-55, there were 605 vacancies; in the next year, 1955-56, there were 763 vacancies; and in the year 1956-57, there were 986 vacancies.  In the three years, there was a total of 2,300 vacancies, due to people leaving and going to Britain.  In the following three years when the present Government were in office, the vacancy rate for the first year, 1957-58, was 1,294.  In 1958-59, it was 1,393 and in 1959-60, it was 1,605.  In the three years the Coalition Government were in office, the number of vacancies was 2,300 and in the following three years the number was 4,300.  That is the reason the Housing <Col N="554" /> Committee decided, in the interests of the ratepayers, not to build any more houses because there was no need for them, because people were going away in droves.  Nevertheless, four Deputies, two of whom are members of the Corporation, lied here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was worse to say it is a fraud than to say it is a lie.  It does not matter.  I am proving my point.</P>
      <P>It was a committee of 15, of which the Government Party have only five members, who decided they would not build any more because of the huge number of vacancies and because 60 per cent. of those who were being offered vacancies refused to take them.  I hope we shall hear no more about who was responsible.  It is very simple for the Opposition to come along here with figures&mdash;lies&mdash;it is the easiest thing in the world.  They say: &ldquo;We spent £5 million: they spent only £2 million.&rdquo;  That proves nothing. When you spent the £5 million houses were needed and when £2 million was spent they were not needed&mdash;and it was the Housing Committee that decided not to build any more.  It was only in 1961 that we decided again on a five-year programme&mdash;because then the situation began to change. People stopped going away and started to come back from Britain.  It was only with that experience that we decided to re-start the housing on the perimeter.  That is why thousands of dwellings are now being built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just before I finish with housing, I <Col N="555" /> want to remark that much has been said about the housing problem in Dublin.  A figure of 7,000 has been mentioned.  Actually, the problem is only 4,000 because 3,000 cases who have applied, according to the medical authority, do not require housing accommodation.  Therefore, the actual figure is only 4,000.  One thousand houses are being built.  We hope to hand the whole one thousand over by January and we hope to build 1,500 next year.  The important point is that it was the policy-making committee that decided to build.  It has nothing to do with the Government.</P>
    <P>Another little matter has been bashed around the House&mdash;the favours done to the ballroom proprietors.  I am not here to defend the Fianna Fáil Budget but I am here to speak about things that I do know about. No matter who would be the Government, I would speak on certain things that I would know about and that I would know were wrong or distorted or untrue.  Here is the position about the concessions to the ballroom proprietors.</P>
    <P>I happen to have been in the dance game&mdash;not now.  Let it not be assumed that I am in it now in case it might be said it was done for Sherwin.  I gave up my dance business when I became a member of this House and I sacrificed £12 a week in doing so. I know all about the dance business. I know the problem that the tax on dancing was to the Revenue Commissioners. It was a nightmare to the Revenue Commissioners, and it always was, for the simple reason that half of the people who ran dances were only straw men, had no stake, had not a bob, were chancing their arm and never gave out tax tickets.  The Revenue Commissioners knew that. They had to have a large staff on night duty and they had to go back half a dozen times.  In other words, they actually had to stand at the door because of the sorts of people who ran dances.  Some of them are big noises but most of them are little fellows, clubs, and so on.  They give a tax ticket to maybe half a dozen; anyone they would know would get none.  The Revenue people told me, <Col N="556" /> time out of number, that they wished to God the tax was done away with; that their hearts were broken; that it was not worth it; that the cost of administration was prohibitive.  It was not worth a candle; the men were driven crazy.</P>
    <P>You cannot compare the dance halls with picture houses because picture houses are owned by people of means and if they do anything wrong they can be nailed and fined £1,000.  A fellow who has nothing cannot be fined £1,000.  Try to picture the dance hall.  In the average dance hall, the clients are known personally to the doorman, to the fellow running it.  He knows them all by name.  It was the easiest thing in the world&mdash;no tax tickets, none.  The Revenue man asks for it and he is told: &ldquo;I threw it away.&rdquo;  You cannot do that in a picture house because there would be a stranger in the box and everyone would get a ticket.  Everything was on the up and up and there was no trouble.  The Revenue people came along now and again and got their dough and were satisfied.</P>
    <P>I know that the dance business was a nightmare.  I can understand the Minister's desire to get rid of it.  It was got rid of twice and it was reimposed twice.  It was a nightmare and the law was evaded nine times out of ten, regularly every year since the day it was put on.  It is better that something be abolished than that there should be wholesale contempt for it. That is the position regarding the dance halls.  Again, I am proving that some of the Opposition are talking through their hats.</P>
    <P>Let us deal with the judges.  I am dealing with the matter only because I voted for the increase for the judges. This question was bashed around, too, very nicely.  There are only twelve judges.  Do not forget that no objection was made to the district justices&mdash; only to the senior judges.  There are only twelve of them and the total amount they get is about £6,000 which, less tax, is about £3,000.  Of course, the Opposition went to town. They knew what the reaction would be to the increase given to the judges and to the 2/6d.  &ldquo;Look at that fellow <Col N="557" /> who is getting an increase of £50.&rdquo; They never said that there are only 12 judges while there are 50,000 of the others.</P>
    <P>What about all the officials of the local authorities and the Civil Service? Only two days ago, there was a list of the senior members of the Corporation and county council who are receiving from £35 to £50 a week and who are getting from £200 to £300 extra. Every local authority official in Ireland is getting the same and all the senior officers in the Civil Service are getting increases.  About 1,000 officials with from £35 to £50 a week are getting a substantial increase because of the eighth round but no reference was made to them.</P>
    <P>The Opposition knew that the increase to the judges was unpopular but the other fellows&mdash;1,000 of them&mdash; have pals everywhere.  Is it not dishonest to keep harping on the 12 judges without saying anything about the 1,000 persons who got increases even though they already enjoy substantial salaries?  Furthermore, there is no comparison between the judges and other people.  You cannot compare a judge with an official.  An official can walk into a public house any day and nobody will pay the slightest attention to him but a judge cannot do that.  He has to live a different type of life from that of an official.  If you do not pay them you get dud judges.  Then maybe you would get judges who would get back handers. You might just as well say that the Labour Party would compare the money received by Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Princess Margaret with what the unemployed get.  Of course, they would not do it.  I do not want to hear that nonsense.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, no matter what Government were in power, they would do the same thing.  The only case you could make is if you could show and prove you would not do it. Of course, you would do it.  You have to give those people, according to their standing in life, a proportionate increase as in the case of all the senior officials of the municipal authority and the Civil Service.  I know it is a good gimmick to go to a lot of poor simpleminded <Col N="558" /> people and to say that one person has received an increase of £50 a week whereas others are receiving an increase of only 2/6d. a week.  That is dishonest.</P>
    <P>Let us get back to the much-mentioned half a crown.  Deputy O'Higgins's statement was a lie.  I will say a lie this time.  I never said that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All right.  I shall withdraw the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo;.  May I explain?  I never said I would vote against the Government if they did not give 5/-.  If I cannot use the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo;, then I submit the Chair could have protected me by asking the Deputy to quote.  I have the quotations here.  Let me quote from the Dáil Reports of March 13th, 1962, when I spoke on the motion by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Mr. Sherwin: I will not accept a bob or two.</P>
      <P>Here is an extract from the Dáil Reports of 21st March, 1962, on the motion relating to a review of pensions:</P>
      <P>Mr. Sherwin: I want a fair increase not a bob or ?&mdash;that will be no use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later in the same debate, I said I would not now accept a bob or two. The only reference I made to 5/- was to give an opinion, which is a different thing altogether.  I never said I would vote against the Government.  When that was reported in the newspapers, I challenged the newspaper and the excuse I got from the reporter was that he gave the report to someone else to jazz it up and make it a bit controversial. A lie was put in the newspaper to make the thing more controversial so that a lot of riff-raff could challenge and abuse me.  I submit that you should have asked Deputy <Col N="559" /> O'Higgins to quote.  He could not quote.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan speaking here on May 2nd at column 170 of the Dáil Reports described something I was supposed to have said in the<i>Evening Mail</i>.  He described an interview I was supposed to have had with the Taoiseach; the bargain I made; what the Taoiseach said and what I did. That was a lie.  That was mentioned when he was asked by the Chair to quote.  There was nothing in it.</P>

      <P>Will Deputy Sherwin please understand that the word &ldquo;lie&rdquo; is a disorderly word and may not be used?  The Deputy might use the word untrue for a change, which would be in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the same thing but I will put it your way, Sir.  I have all the copies of the <i>Evening Mail</i> here.  There is no reference in the <i>Evening Mail</i> to any interview or any discussion.  Nevertheless, the Deputy, in answer to you, Sir, or, perhaps, it was the Ceann Comhairle, is supposed to have read it out.  There is nothing about it in the <i>Evening Mail</i>.  I never had any discussion whatsoever with any member of the Government since the day it was formed&mdash;never, not before the vote for the Taoiseach and not before the Budget.  To my knowledge, no other Independent, who voted for the Government, had any interviews one way or another with the Government. In fact, on each occasion, I did not know who was going this way or who was going that way.  On the day we voted for the Taoiseach, I did not know where Deputy Carroll was going until he went to this side of the House. That is the position today.  The Government do not know what way I shall vote.</P>
      <P>I made a statement that because I believed there ought to be a Government, I was going to support the Government to a certain extent so that a Government would function.  I gave no guarantees and I have not yet given any guarantees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the halfcrown, I could do no more than agitate.  I could not <Col N="560" /> dictate to the Government.  No Government would take dictation from an individual just for the sake of office. No self-respecting individual or Government would do that.</P>
    <P>To suggest that I could have made: them give more is nonsense.  I agitated; I did the best I could in the form of agitation.  The agitation had some results.  What the results were, I am not certain, but agitation always has results.</P>
    <P>I was not satisfied with the halfcrown. I had made up my mind and I told Deputy Dunne before that it was the least I would vote for.  I was not terribly anxious to vote against the Government.  There is such a thing as responsibility here.  I had to consider what the effect would be on the country.  Hundreds of thousands of pounds would be lost by the State and by the ratepayers.  There would have to be a campaign in the winter and the Opposition would be driven to the point of distraction with worry, not having paid half their election debts.  To be candid, I have not paid half of them myself.  I had to weigh up a number of things.</P>
    <P>Suppose another Government came back and a similar state of affairs existed, what would the country think? I could have played to the gallery.  I could have gone where the three cheers were.  Rather than do that, I decided to do the responsible thing. It cost something to vote for that increase.  I had to do an awful lot of explaining and had to have a campaign in the newspapers.  I had to face abuse of every description but I do not care.  I did the best for those people and I could do no more.  It was not a question of being satisfied.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to the halfcrown, there is no evidence that the Opposition would have given any more.  I do not want to fight the case for Fianna Fáil.  I have studied this whole business and have gone back over Budgets for the past 15 years.  In 1948, an increase of 2/6d. was granted by the Coalition.  Nothing was given in 1949 or 1950.  What is all the talk about? In 1955, there was 2/6d. given, but nothing was given in 1960.  In 1948, too, £750,000 was put on beer and in <Col N="561" /> 1955, there was 6d. put on the 20-packet of cigarettes.  It is just a case of the kettle calling the pot black.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this campaign is honest at all.  I do not know why the Government could not give more. One thing the Opposition at least ought to admit, independent of that altogether, is that they did give 2/6d. to the unemployed, extra money for the children and 2/6d. for the disable and the blind, but no mention was made of those things.  That makes the case dishonest on the part of the Opposition.  When you pin-point only one thing and keep back and ignore a lot of other things, that is not an honest approach to the people outside.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Opposition would have given any more.  Their past does not prove it and the only way you can judge anything is by the past.  If the Opposition won an election and came back, they might have played safe and given 6d. or a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; extra but then there is the possibility that they would give nothing.  In the circumstances, I would prefer Fianna Fáil having given the 2/6d.  There is too much being made of the 2/6d.  It is not that the Opposition think it was miserable; it is the one weak chink in the whole armour of the Budget. They have played it up.  They played it up against the judges and then played it back again in this debate but kept quiet about everything else.  That is dishonest.  It is, of course, a pity my vote did not succeed in getting more, but I cannot dictate to the Government, even if I do know that by putting pressure on the Government I might get a little more.  I am always satisfied with a little.</P>
    <P>How could the Government allow any Independent Deputy to dictate to them?  The Government obviously had their own overall view on this. They said they would do better than the other crowd, and maybe they did, too.  All I can do is my best.  Having got so much for the old age pensioners, I was not delighted but I said it was acceptable to me for the time being.  If anything less had been given, I would have been morally bound to vote against the Government. My attitude in relation to the <Col N="562" /> Government is simply this: I believe I am doing the right thing, the responsible thing.  I am doing one of the things that President Kennedy would have done.  He quotes people of courage, people against whom the crowd turned but who were later proved to have been in the right.</P>
    <P>Going with the crowd is never the right thing.  It is the cheap thing, the thing that does not cost anything.  For ten years, people have been going with the crowd in Dublin promising to rectify the differential rent system. They have not done it.  They could not do it because they had no power to do it.  But I, in a small way, had the differential rents system amended three times, with the result that people in the social welfare classes have benefited to the extent of 2/- a week.  It is a small amount but it is better than the £10,000 promises that never materialised.</P>
    <P>I have said my piece.  I shall support the Budget and support the Government for a reasonable time in the country's interest and I do not care what the Opposition says.  I am quite prepared to give the Opposition credit for being an honest crowd, but of course there are rogues everywhere as well as honest people.  Politics is a game in which there may be fraud, but I am an Independent Deputy and I do not have to defraud anybody.</P>

The waggly tail of the Government subsided just now when Deputy Sherwin sat down.  He seems to take it amiss that people might have misunderstood his views with regard to a 5/- increase for old age pensioners, <Col N="563" /> and were it not for his well-known respect for the rules of order, he might have characterised some of the references to him as being lies.  But I think Deputy Sherwin should at least judge in a charitable light the Deputies who may have misunderstood his intentions, because it is quite clear from the newspapers that it was not only Deputies on this side of the House who misunderstood Deputy Sherwin's attitude.  Representatives of the Press must have misunderstood him also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, I am not really concerned with Deputy Sherwin, expect that he is the waggly tail of the Fianna Fáil Party.  As far as this Budget goes, I think it is fair, and I do not think the Minister will resent it, if I describe it as being dull and disappointing.  In fact, the imaginative heights to which the Minister has succeeded in rising in this Budget is to the extent of bumming off the beer drinkers of the country in order to balance his Budget.  That is the most novel form of finance he can think of in this year of 1962 when we were told we were to have in government a dynamic team of men, the type necessary to face the challenge of the Common Market.  All they could think of in order to give a halfcrown to the old age pensioners next August and reliefs to the bigger farmers was to <Col N="565" /> bum off the beer drinkers of the country to raise the finance.</P>
      <P>This year, we have the biggest ever Book of Estimates, exceeding, in total, £148,000,000, an increase on the face of the Book of Estimates of more than £39,500,000 on the Estimates for the year ended 31st March, 1957.  That is the actual increase on the face of the Book of Estimates, but, in fact, it goes, of course, much further than that.  One of the first things the Fianna Fáil Government did in 1957, when they were elected to office, was to abolish the food subsidies and save the Exchequer a sum of £9,000,000.  So it is perfectly fair in comparing the Estimate for 1957 with the Estimate for the present year, to add to the Estimate for the present year a sum of £9,000,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, we are entitled to take into consideration the fact mentioned by Deputy Sweetman in his statement following the Minister's Financial Statement that the ordinary buoyancy&mdash;I do not care whether or not we call it buoyancy&mdash;of the revenue would enable the Minister to take in an additional £8,000,000 revenue last year.  So the true comparison as between 1957, when Fianna Fáil got back into office, and the present year is an increase of Government expenditure, as reflected in the Book of Estimates, of £56¼ million. That is an increase of £56¼ million by the Party which went around the country preaching economy and criticising extravagance in Government administration in 1955, 1956 and up to 1957. It is an increase of £56¼ million introduced by the same Minister who in his Budget statement of 1957 held out all sorts of hopes to this House and to the country of a drastic reduction in the Civil Service and drastic economies in Government administration.  After a few years in office the best they can do is to increase the burden on the people, as reflected in the Book of Estimates, by £56¼ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not always easy, particularly talking late in a Budget debate, to decide exactly how one should tackle the job.  Deputies on the opposite benches will, I am sure, be glad to know that in deciding how I should approach the Budget I went to a mentor of whom I am sure they would <Col N="566" /> approve.  I looked up what the Taoiseach said in relation to the Budget of 1956.  Just for a minute or two I should like to try to parallel my remarks and my line of reasoning with the lines laid down by the Taoiseach when he spoke from these benches in 1956.  At Column 45 of the Official Report of 8th May, 1956, he said:</P>
    <P>The Budget which the Minister for Finance has just announced will, I think, come as a great shock and a great disappointment to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>He continued:</P>
    <P>The heavy increases in taxation which are to be imposed will provide the shock; the disappointment will arise from the evidence that this Government appears to have no conception of policy or plan for dealing with the very serious national problems which, in their incompetence, they have allowed to develop.</P>
    <P>Will any Deputy in this House fault me if I adopt each and every one of those words of the Taoiseach in relation to the present year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If they were true then why are they not true now? The next quotation will be of interest to the Deputies opposite, and particularly to the newer Deputies such as the Parliamentary Secretary, who may not be aware of the Parliamentary record and records of the Fianna Fáil Party, and who may not be aware of certain decisions which the Fianna Fáil Party took, and announced bluntly in this House, with regard to taxation.  At column 49 of the Official Report of 8th May, 1956, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1953, the Fianna Fáil Government, of which I was a member, took a decision that taxation in this country had reached the danger limit.  We announced that we had made up our minds on the fact and that, so far as we were concerned, <Col N="567" /> there would be no increase in tax rates above the 1953 level.  We made it clear that, if any Budget difficulty arose, that difficulty would be met by a reduction of expenditure and not by increasing the burdens on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The man who uttered a statement, and formally placed it on the records of the House, that that decision was taken by his Party in 1953, is now the leader of the Party of which the Minister for Finance is the financial wizard who brings about a situation where after three or four years of their administration the Book of Estimates shows an increase, in fact, of more than £56¼ million, and an increase on its face of something like £39¼ million.  That is the Party that took this decision which is on the records of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is long enough at the game to know the difference between an increase in income and an increase in the rates of taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is long enough at the game to know what an increase in Government expenditure of £56¼ million means.  In that context another remark by the Taoiseach on the same occasion would be very relevant.  At column 47 this is what he had to say:</P>
      <P>Have the Government any sense of responsibility?  Have they any knowledge of the tasks that are facing them?  Did it occur to them that this Budget deficit of theirs should be rectified by reducing the cost of Government?  At one time they said that was possible.  At one time they professed to believe that that was such an easy task that they had no difficulty in putting a figure upon the reduction that they could bring about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why does not the Taoiseach nudge his financial wizard in the side this year and remind him of that, and remind him that when he was on these benches he had committed his Party to reducing the cost of Government, and reducing Government expenditure? <Col N="568" /> I could give plenty more of these quotations, and I could give plenty of quotations from the Tánaiste as well as the Taoiseach, and if I am tempted I will.  That is the line the Taoiseach took when he was dealing with the Budget in 1956.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was in 1956, also, that a Deputy who has since become a junior member of the Government tendered some advice to the Government.  I am referring to the Deputy who holds the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Malley Speaking on 14th March, 1956, some couple of months before that speech of the Taoiseach's which I have quoted, at column 536 of the Official Report, Deputy O'Malley had this advice to give the Government of that day:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities&mdash;the people &mdash;cannot pay any more in rates.  The only solution of a constructive nature, as far as I can see, is that the Government should give the example.  How could the Government do that?  In my humble opinion the Government should give the example at the top.  Take one example&mdash;the Department of Justice.  Does everybody not know that the Department of Justice, instead of costing the taxpayers some £100,000, could be equally competently carried on by the Minister for Defence?  Everyone knows <Col N="569" /> the Minister for Defence could be Minister for Justice as well and carry on both Departments.</P>
    <P>Then he said:</P>
    <P>I am simply showing the Parliamentary Secretary how the cost of Government can be reduced.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Deputy on my right who made some remarks was in the last Dáil.  If he had been, he would know that as soon as Fianna Fáil got back into office, instead of amalgamating the Department of Defence and the Department of Justice, they increased the staff of the Department of Justice and in addition to having a Minister, they gave him a Parliamentary Secretary as well.  In this Dáil, the heir-apparent, or I should call him the heir-presumptive, has taken office and has become Minister for Justice.  What have they done? Instead of a new Parliamentary Secretary whom they had put into the Department which in those days Deputy O'Malley wanted abolished, they created a new Ministry.  If any Deputy opposite asks for my views as to how there can be economies by the Government, the first thought I would give them a present of is that they should do away completely with a particularly useless Ministry and I intend no reflection at all on the occupant of that position who, I am quite sure, is an able and energetic Deputy.  There seems to me to be no sense in creating the Department, or at any rate, the Ministry, of Transport and Power.  It should be abolished and the people should be saved the expense involved to that office.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the expense is because it is not very easy to make it out from the way the Book of Estimates is compiled.  However, for the year 1959-60, which was the first year in which that particular post was established, the Minister and the secretariat cost this country £7,624.  The following year they cost the country&mdash;I presume it was for a full year&mdash;£11,694. After that, it is not possible to make it out from the Book of Estimates because a number of other items have been bulked in together with what was formerly shown separately in respect <Col N="570" /> of the Minister and the secretariat.  I think that post should be abolished.</P>

      <P>That was the year which followed the publication of the Fianna Fáil plan for 100,000 new jobs.  I am sorry&mdash;I understand they are sensitive about calling it a plan; they tell us it was not really a plan, that it was only a set of proposals for discussion. I do not care whether you call it a plan or proposals, or regard it simply as an exercise in debating. The fact is, and every Deputy opposite knows it, the people were given the impression that Fianna Fáil had a plan, that if Fianna Fáil were elected, that plan would be put into operation, and that the result of that plan would be 100,000 new jobs for the people.  In advertisements, in speeches, in propaganda, in literature and by convassing from house to house, that was drummed into the ears of every elector. You had that kind of advertisement: &ldquo;Unemployment Is The Test&rdquo;.  We had this kind of speech made by the Taoiseach who is reported in the Fianna Fáil bible, the <i>Irish Press,</i> on 23rd of February, 1957 as saying:</P>
      <P>The policy of any Government should be judged by its effect on employment&mdash;</P>

      <P>The <i>Sunday Press</i> of 15th January, 1956, was induced by a speech of the Taoiseach to set up these headlines: &ldquo;Living Costs Never Ceased to Rise.&rdquo;  We had, in by-elections and in general elections, this type of propaganda being issued by the Fianna Fáil Party, illustrated <Col N="573" /> pamphlets to show the various commodities which had increased in price.</P>
      <P>During the course of this debate, one of the Ministers&mdash;I think it was the Minister for Transport and Power &mdash;had the audacity to complain about criticism levelled against Fianna Fáil based on the increases in the cost of living.  This was the kind of thing issued by Fianna Fáil to Deputies-the various things that had gone up in price.  I should like if some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who may have preserved copies of these would examine them this evening.  We see here &ldquo;Beer and Whiskey&mdash;You pay more.&rdquo;  You can say ditto to that today.</P>

      <P>You see here &ldquo;Gas and Electricity&mdash;You pay more.&rdquo; You can say ditto to that today.  They found that this idea was so very successful at a by-election which was held at Cork city, where this first appeared, that they brought it out for the general election and put it in full on their front page and put on the back page &ldquo;Full Employment.&rdquo;  There we had the twin barrels being fired against the Government-full employment would be given by Fianna Fáil and there was all the propaganda about the cost of living. In regard to both of those aspects there is no Party in this country or in any other country that could ever have failed so miserably as the present Government Party have failed since the year 1957.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was referring to the increase in the Book of Estimates since Fianna Fáil again became responsible for the <Col N="574" /> affairs of this country in 1957, I mentioned the fact that to get an accurate and proper view of the picture we were entitled to take into account not only the additional revenue last year but the £9 million a year which the Government saved the Exchequer by abolishing the food subsidies in 1957. There is another thing we are entitled to take into account, that is, the fact that the Government which went before them bequeathed to them the Prize Bond Scheme, which had been established by Deputy Sweetman as Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I was not here during the portion of the discussion yesterday but I understand that the Minister for Finance disagreed when Deputy McGilligan said that the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach had referred to that scheme as a raffle.  I want to repeat that.  I have since taken the occasion of consulting the records to see how the Party opposite reacted when that scheme was introduced.  Of course, they know now that the Minister for Finance&mdash;and I give him credit for it&mdash;has time and again since then gone on record as expressing his thanks and gratitude to Deputy Sweetman for establishing the Prize Bond Scheme.</P>
    <P>When it was first introduced on 28th November, 1956, the present Taoiseach set what ultimately became the keynote of the attack on it.  At column 1630 of the Dáil Debates of that day he said:</P>
    <P>I shall not comment at this stage upon the proposal in relation to prize bonds.  I do not know what amount of money the Government thinks is likely to be raised by that device.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Device&rdquo; was the word he used, giving the impression&mdash;whether deliberately or intentionally I am not going to say at the moment&mdash;that there was something shady about the idea of such a scheme being established. It was further discussed on the Committee Stage, but before I come to that perhaps it would be better chronologically to see what the present Tánaiste had to say on the Second Stage of the Bill which set up the Prize Bond Scheme.</P>
    <P>On the following day, 29th Novemlished <Col N="575" /> ber, 1956, at column 1715 of the Official Report for that day, we have these remarks made by Deputy MacEntee as he then was:</P>
    <P>There are a few other things one could say about the premium bond issue.  There we have another instance where within six months a person can secure capital appreciation to the extent of a fraction over two per cent. free of tax.  The Minister will, perhaps, be in office when he issues the bonds but if he is not, think of what his successor will be up against.  One could jeer and sneer at these things.  One could talk about the Minister and the Government running a poolroom or making a book.  One could say that the Taoiseach would be going around the fairground with a band around his hat, saying: &ldquo;Costello cannot cheat&rdquo; or perhaps that the Minister for Agriculture might have another band around his, saying &ldquo;Dillon does not diddle&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We can make jokes about it but it is a serious problem not merely for the Minister for Finance but for everyone in this House.</P>
    <P>I am skipping a bit.  I shall read it if the Deputies want, but I do not want to be too boring.  I shall finish up at column 1716, where he says:</P>
    <P>I do not want to say any more about this situation.  I think it is a bad thing and a poor thing that this State, which was founded not merely on the sacrifices of our generation but on those of previous generations, should, after a little over 30 years of self-government, be reduced to raising money on these terms.</P>
    <P>Is there any support for the scheme in that speech by the Tánaiste?  Will the present Minister for Finance portray that speech by the Tánaiste as thumping the drums in favour of the Prize Bond Scheme?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Prize Bond Scheme.  I have already given the Minister credit for the acknowledgment he gave to Deputy Sweetman for establishing it. I am showing his colleagues opposed it, and opposed it vigorously.  I mentioned what the present Taoiseach said about it and what the present Tánaiste said about it.  When the Committee Stage of that Bill was being considered on 5th December, 1956, the Tánaiste came back to give the House more about the prize bonds.  At column 1934 of the Official Report for that day, he had this to say:</P>
      <P>To my mind, this is a very objectionable provision.  I assume the Minister is committed to this project of the prize bonds.  As I said on the Second Reading, it is a very unfortunate thing for the country that we have been reduced to these straits.  One cannot discuss the proposal in terms of ethics.  I do not think there is any harm in any person having a gamble or speculation if he so wishes.</P>
      <P>He finishes up his contribution on this occasion at column 1937 by saying:</P>
      <P>It is very difficult, having regard to my general attitude towards betting and games of chance and things of that sort, to formulate the precise way in which one feels this is not the sort of thing we ought to do, that it is not the sort of thing we are justified in doing.  It invokes in me at any rate a very strong feeling of dislike and distaste.</P>
      <P>That was the Tánaiste who has been there for four or five years since operating this scheme.  Deputy J. Brennan, the Parliamentary Secretary, had this to say at column 1937 of the same debate:</P>
      <P>I want to endorse what Deputy MacEntee has said in regard to the distaste which this section of the Bill has caused in the minds of the people.</P>
      <P>He went on to say somewhat later:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the word &ldquo;gamble&rdquo; into State finance does not make for confidence and, goodness <Col N="577" /> knows, confidence at the present time is a minus quantity.</P>
    <P>When the Minister flattered his counterpart in England by introducing this measure-imitation is the sincerest form of flattery&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We can say &ldquo;ditto&rdquo; to that, because despite the views expressed by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and by this Government, they flattered Deputy Sweetman by imitating what he did and continuing it.  This had been described as a raffle by the Parliamentary Secretary.  In the same column he said:</P>
    <P>I do not know what the people in the cities think about it but in the country we have known a system whereby, when you wanted to raise the wind for any project that was in a shaky form, you resorted to what was known as a raffle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, at column 1938, he said:</P>
      <P>I have not yet heard the Minister making any statement in defence of the introduction of these prize bonds.  Perhaps there is something in it that does not meet the eye but it certainly would need to have a lot if it is to counteract the feeling of distrust that has been aroused by resorting to what in the minds of the country folk is the last resort, the raffle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true enough. It was the last resort then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way in which that project was received by the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was an innovation, of course, and Fianna Fáil are essentially the Colonel Blimps of Irish politics.  They are afraid of any innovation.  They want to blunder along in the same old way and, as I said before, to bum off the beer drinkers in order to get their accounts balanced.  They were afraid of that innovation.  They thought there was something to be distrusted in it, <Col N="578" /> that there was something distasteful about it.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil set themselves up as being the know-alls in regard to the Common Market.  Before the last election, they campaigned as the only people who knew anything about the Common Market or the European Economic Community.  They made an appeal for funds which was sent out over the signature of the Taoiseach&mdash; let me make it clear I am not suggesting he signed it as Taoiseach; he signed as President of Fianna Fáil. We see in paragraph 3 of this document:</P>
      <P>Because of the emergence of the European Economic Community and Ireland's application for membership, these next few years will be a time during which capacity to apply a consistent policy by reason of a clear Dáil majority will be vital for the future of the nation.</P>
      <P>They had the hardihood to put that into their appeal for funds during the general election, notwithstanding the fact that they dithered along for four years without taking any steps at all in relation to the Common Market, notwithstanding the fact that they had been urged to do that by a formal motion from this side of the House. They did not do anything about it, until they woke up one morning and found that England was applying for membership and then they got into a panic about it.  These were the people who then and now set themselves up as the experts in regard to the Common Market.</P>
      <P>While I am on this document, it is worth refreshing the minds of Deputies in relation to some of its contents.  The Taoiseach, as President of Fianna Fáil, went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the Fianna Fáil organisation throughout the country to make sure, by means of a vigorous and intensive election campaign, that the electorate is fully aware of all that is at stake and that the maximum possible support for the Government is mobilised on election day.  For this purpose an adequate election fund is required.  The cost of fighting <Col N="579" /> elections has increased considerably in recent years&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Even that had increased under Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;and in appealing to you for a subscription I would ask you to make it as generous as possible. You can rightly regard it as an investment in good Government and political stability.</P>

In any event, there were 100,000 fewer people who decided to invest in Fianna Fáil at the last general election.

I should like to remind the Minister for Finance that despite all the propaganda made by his Party in relation to the action of Mr. Costello's Government in repealing that Act, a number of Deputies of his Party, including himself, went on record very specifically in regard to it.  Speaking <Col N="580" /> in Enniscorthy on 31st July, 1948, the Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>If the Government should now desire to dispense with the King of England, they can do so, because the Constitution makes that possible. If the Government take action now, they will have our full support against any diehard opposition here or abroad.</P>

After Mr. de Valera's recent declarations concerning that Act the Government has had no choice.  Factors which had delayed that change had ended.  The changed conditions since the war made its amendment desirable now....  They told Mr. Costello that the External Relations Act was to go because it no longer served an Irish interest.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Rathfarnham on 20th October, 1948, as reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 21st October, 1948, he had this to say:</P>
      <P>The consequences of the repeal of the External Relations Act on Irish-British Relations, whether in regard to trade or other matters, were of less importance than would be the consequences of a reversal or postponement of the decision to repeal the Act because of British pressure.</P>
      <P>Support for its repeal now had already been announced by Mr. de-Valera in the Dáil and elsewhere. Fianna Fáil welcomed the Government's decision to proceed with it.</P>
      <P>...the majority of the Irish people were agreed that the Act should be repealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="581" /> ...members of Fianna Fáil did not conceal their disappointment that a step which their work had made practicable was not being taken under the guidance of a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I want to put these quotations on record simply because I am sick and tired of the attitude which we meet in this country&mdash;Fianna Fáil sitting back and taking for granted what was being done, while doing their best to stir up trouble after it was done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no easy matter to deal with the discussion on the Budget, <Col N="582" /> a discussion which has lasted for almost three weeks, because most of the speeches, including the last, were misrepresentations of fact, wrong figures, and so on.  Having given wrong figures in support of an argument, the speakers went on then to condemn the Government and I am afraid that most of my time now will go on correcting the figures quoted by Opposition Deputies in this debate.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the figures, I want to deal with a few points that were made.  On the day the Budget was introduced, Deputy Sweetman said there was no proper incentive in the Budget.  Deputy Corish said there was no real incentive to industry with a view to creating new employment or maintaining existing employment. From the point of view of incentive in relation to industry, we must have regard to the fact that any expansion in industry must be organised with a view to export.  The home market is largely supplied with the industries we have.  Bearing that in mind, I do not know what better incentive could be given than the 100 per cent. tax relief. We cannot give more than 100 per cent.  We have given all we can, as far as that is concerned.</P>
      <P>We have also adopted the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Industrial Taxation in full.  That Committee made many recommendations and it took three or four years to implement them all.  But they have all been implemented.  I announced in the Budget also that we were accepting the recommendations of the Committee on Industrial Organisation. As Deputies are aware, that committee was set up specifically to help industries to equip themselves for competition in the Common Market.</P>
      <P>Apart from the relief of export tax, income tax has been lowered generally in the past four or five years, and lowered substantially.  It is lower now than it was at any time in the past 20 years, and it compares very favourably with international standards.  If Deputy Sweetman and Deputy Corish were concerned about incentives for the development of industry, we have gone along way already to encourage industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as agriculture is concerned, <Col N="583" /> we have provided £2,500,000 in the Budget for the relief of agriculture. That means that, in the present financial year, £32,500,000 have been provided; in other words, over five per cent. of the national income.  I do not want to go into the matter again as to why this relief of rates was given.  I explained that very fully in the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates will show many other instances of relief for and encouragement of industry.  In the non-voted capital services, apart from the Estimates, about £6,000,000 will be spent this year on industrial and agricultural credit.  Deputy Sweetman referred to the £100,000 incentives for industry to fit them for the Common Market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Incentives for retooling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For equipping them for the Common Market.  Deputy Sweetman knows that any relief in income tax falls very lightly in the first year.  If I gave an estimate that it will cost £100,000 this year, that means that it will cost more in the second and third years.  The estimate of the Revenue Commissioners is that, when it comes into full operation, it will cost about £530,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister is doing what the Taoiseach called mortgaging the future.  Is that it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Taoiseach said about mortgaging the future.  I am dealing with the point made by Deputy Sweetman.  Deputy Sweetman knows very well that the sum of £100,000 this year will grow into a very much bigger sum in two or three years' time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also stated that out of the £10,000,000 increase in taxation this year only £1,000,000 was given to social welfare.  I read a report of a public meeting at which Deputy Mullen was present.  The same statement was made there and Deputy Mullen did not correct it or explain the figures.  They put a very different complexion on the position.  The £10,000,000 is fairly correct.  The <Col N="584" /> buoyancy in tax rates was calculated to bring in £6.1 millions more.  Additional taxes introduced will bring in £3.8 millions.  That is £9.9 millions, which is near enough to £10,000,000. Again, there were certain tax reliefs on entertainments generally&mdash;I shall deal with these later on&mdash;amounting to £.6 million.</P>
    <P>We had, as Deputies are aware, an estimate of £1.08 millions for social welfare and Public Service pensions £.45 million and we had £2.5 millions for the farmers.  These are the new reliefs that were mentioned in the Budget and they amount to £4,000,000 or a little more.  The balance of £5.3 millions is more than offset by various figures that are higher than last year. The service of public debt is £3½ million higher than it was last year and the educational group of Estimates are £2½ million higher.  Social Welfare and Health, apart from the new proposals, will cost another £1½ million so that that additional taxation is more than absorbed without mentioning the £5½ million increases in pay for public servants generally.</P>
    <P>Another charge that has increased very much in the last three or four years is the sinking fund of the national debt.  I do not want to go back over the last 20 years individually but if you will take five-year periods you will get an idea of the increases in this regard.  For the five years ended 31st March, the amount effectively allocated as sinking fund for national debt was only £100,000.  For the next five years the total was £700,000. From 1952 to 1957 it was £18,000,000 for the five years and for the last five years it was £40.7 million.  The amount now provided annually for sinking fund in addition to the interest paid on national loans and national debt is about £10 million a year.  That is the very appreciable sum that has to be provided.</P>
    <P>The general criticism that was made against this Budget, and indeed it was made by the last speaker, Deputy O'Higgins, was that it was a humdrum or unimaginative Budget.  Deputy Norton was the first to make that point.  I do not know if he set a headline but many members of the Labour <Col N="585" /> Party and of Fine Gael made the same point.  It is a vague sort of criticism which is not easy to deal with.  Deputy Norton did not think we should expect him to give an explanation of what he meant by that.  It has no particular meaning but it does impress the uninitiated and that suits Deputy Norton's style.</P>
    <P>When did Ministers for Finance show imagination in Budgets?  I do not think there was much imagination shown by Deputy McGilligan or Deputy Sweetman in the Budgets they brought in.  We could easily have said that these were unimaginative if we did not say worse about them but it would have been a mild criticism.  If you take it as meaning want of imagination then Deputy Sweetman certainly showed some lack of imagination in the 1956 Budget when he provided for what he thought were all the increases that were required and all the money that was necessary to cover the expenditure for that year and still fell short of his estimate by almost £6 million.  In 1957 I showed the same lack of imagination. I had imagination enough to see that the position was very bad, that the Coalition had left this country in such a state that it required drastic measures to get a balanced Budget.  I had to find £11,000,000, and I found it by cutting out the food subsidies and by putting on extra taxation.  By doing that I thought I would meet the gap that the Coalition had left behind, but my imagination was not good enough to fully assess the state to which this country had sunk under Coalition.  I was actually £5.9 million short.  That was lack of imagination on my part.</P>

      <P>It may have been stupidity but Deputy Sweetman made the same mistake in 1956.  He did not realise the depths to which the country had sunk and when he was bringing in his estimate he was £5.9 million short.  I found £11,000,000 extra the following year to fill the gap but I was still £5.9 million out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not see any merit in having a deficit in the Budget and at the same time putting the special import levies aside into a capital fund. I said that we should put the import levies into ordinary revenue and balance the Budget and that is what we did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to that again.  Some Deputies, and amongst them Deputy John Costello with whose speech I have no fault to find because he always seems fair, argued that we had enough without additional taxation to meet the expenditure for this coming year.  If they believe that they are more optimistic than I am about this coming year.  I did base my estimates on a combination of the economic growth of the last three or four years.  As I explained in my Budget Statement that economic growth has been phenomenal over the last three or four years.  I estimated that it would continue for another year and it was on that estimate that I put so much on the revenue side and so much on the expenditure side and found that extra taxation was needed.</P>
      <P>If I am wrong and if Deputy Costello and the others are right I will be very glad.  The Government will receive that news with the joy and pride to which they are entitled if we are able to have increased revenue without increases in taxation because that is what the Deputies on the other side have inferred.  If there is a surplus it will go to the extinguishing of the national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, on 3rd May, said that he would have liked to have heard what the anticipations were in relation <Col N="587" /> to the year ahead.  I dealt with that fairly fully in my Budget speech in columns 1563 to 1565 and I dealt with it to a much larger extent in the Seanad during the debate on the Central Fund Bill.  I do not intend, therefore, to go into the matter fully again.  I did refer there to the eighth round of increases.  I said that, in my opinion, the eighth round was somewhat premature.  I said I expected that productivity would catch up with the wage increase and that, if so, everything would be all right and there would be no increase in costs.  There has been a certain small increase in costs so far but it might stay at that.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any hope that costs will be reduced.  If productivity, on the other hand, does not catch up, then the only result can be increasing costs.  I do not want to go into the question fully again because I dealt with it very fully in that Seanad debate.</P>
    <P>On 3rd May, Deputy Sweetman also referred to savings.  He referred to the need for further incentives to savings, investments and the attraction of foreign capital.  He mentioned the £25 small savings allowance and comments by the Capital Investment Advisory Committee.  That report was signed in June, 1958.  In November, 1958, the Government presented their <i>Programme for Economic Expansion</i> to the Oireachtas.  Deputy T.F. O'Higgins spoke about running away from that programme: I do not know in what respect.  I am not aware when we ran away from it.  I think we followed it faithfully and successfully.</P>
    <P>The importance of encouraging enterprise and savings is stressed in the White Paper.  The lines of Government policy in the matter are clearly laid down in the very first chapter, paragraphs 10 and 11, special mention being made of the aim of reducing direct taxation as a tonic to the economy, a stimulus to personal and corporate saving and an encouragement both to native and foreign enterprise to undertake new projects.</P>
    <P>At that particular time, or around that time, when I expressed the view <Col N="588" /> here in the Dáil that we should try to reduce direct taxation as far as possible, I had the support of Deputy Sweetman.  Since that time, further reliefs have been given in taxation such as the Shannon Free Airport tax relief, 1958.  A relief was given on industrial buildings, including hotels&mdash;depreciation allowances&mdash;and extension of exports tax reliefs in 1959 and again in 1960; tax relief in respect of recruitment and training of staffs, 1959; extension of mining reliefs, 1961, and extension of reliefs under Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1932, in 1960.</P>
    <P>Therefore, no Budget has been introduced since 1957 in which some relief has not been given in that direction. General incentives to enterprise and savings would, I think, be covered by a reduction in the standard rate of income tax in 1959 and 1961.  There was an extention of earned income relief in 1959 and also in 1961.  There was a reduction in surtax in 1959 and 1961.  Reliefs were given in death duties in 1960 and 1961 and savings deposit relief was extended in 1960.</P>
    <P>Every Finance Act since 1958 has contained new incentive measures or extensions of existing ones.  Over the past four years, the reliefs which have been given in direct taxation are costing the Exchequer £5½ million a year. I might perhaps digress now at that particular point.  Deputy M. J. O'Higgins made a long speech just before I got up to reply.  He quoted extracts from speeches made by this Party, when in Opposition, to the effect that the taxes imposed by the Government were as large as should be imposed and that there should be no further imposition of taxation.</P>
    <P>I produced figures here some time ago, and I think I could produce them again, to show that if all the taxes were taken that were imposed since 1957 and all the reliefs of taxation were put against them, it would be seen that there was no increase of any magnitude.  This year may have made a difference.</P>
    <P>The money that was not taken from people by way of income tax remained in their hands.  It enabled manufacturers, traders and the public at large <Col N="589" /> to make further investments.  It is note-worthy that monetary savings, after adjustments of stocks, and so on, increased by £11.9 million in 1960 and by a further £16 million in 1961.  The figures would show that there is a gradual increase every year in the amount that is put aside as public savings in State investments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said that it is interesting to note that £20 million per annum is paid as interest on the national debt which, as a matter of fact, is, I think, a bit small.  However, in this particular context, the amount does not matter.  I want to deal with what he said about it.  He said we are prepared to pay that sort of money to banks and to people who dabble in money while all we can afford for social welfare benefits is £27 million. That is a type of demagogic approach to a matter of this kind.</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised that a leader of a Party should make such an irresponsible statement as to refer to the interest that is paid on our borrowings as money paid to banks and people who dabble in money.  A considerable portion of the money is paid to small investors.  There is the Post Office Savings Bank.  There are Savings Certificates.  Even in the national loans, a very large number of people make small subscriptions.  I think the figures are published in answer to questions here in the Dáil.  After every national loan is completed, it will be found that a very large proportion of the national loan comes in in small subscriptions.  Deputy Corish infers that we should not bother about those people; that we should take their money and give them no interest.  That would be a very unfair thing to do whether it is a bank or a small person.</P>
    <P>We have to keep up the reputation of the State that we will pay our way. If we make a contract to take money from a person at a certain rate of interest we must pay that rate of interest.  There is no use in complaining that we are wasting a lot of money by paying interest to banks and to people who dabble in money.  We have made the contract with the people and we must stick to it.  If we did not do that we would not get the money&mdash;that is <Col N="590" /> all and who would suffer by it? Those who would suffer would be people in receipt of social welfare benefits, the working population, and so on.  They would suffer because there would be no development in this country.  There would be no chance of developing the country in any way&mdash; by way of helping industries, by way of helping agriculture, by way of the development of forestry, fisheries, turf development and all these other matters where money is used up. Neither would there be any money for housing, for sanitary services, for water supplies for schools, for hospitals or for anything else.</P>
    <P>It is all very well for Deputy Corish to try to make a smart point against the Government to the effect that they are quite prepared to throw money into the banks and into the hands of people who dabble in money but that they will not give any towards social welfare.  Deputy Corish should have some regard for the good name and for the future of this country, if we are to make any progress at all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman on 3rd May also said that I, in reply to him on 29th March, acknowledged that in 1962 central taxation had taken a greater proportion of the gross national product than in any year since 1953. That answer, by the way, was given by the Taoiseach but I am not finding fault with the Deputy for that mistake. That answer did not deal with Budgetary taxation.  It was an international figure as far as I can remember but it included such things as social insurance contributions, surplus on Post Office operations, for instance, wireless licence and it even included levies paid under the Dairy Produce Act and motor vehicle duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>It included them all the years down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They were all included but if the Budgetary taxation is taken, then the figure would remain almost constant back as far as eight or ten years.  In the last year that Deputy Sweetman was in control it was 16.8 per cent. In 1961-62 it was 16.9 per cent.  In the meantime it went down until it was at its lowest at 16 per cent. <Col N="591" /> Now it is up to 16.9 per cent.  It must be remembered that the amount of taxes that it is estimated came in in 1961-1962 came in because of the buoyancy of the revenue.  It came in because conditions were better in this country.  People were able to pay more income tax.  They were able to pay more tobacco tax, more beer and petrol tax.  It was a criterion of the advance in the economy that the amount had gone up.</P>
      <P>I pointed out in my Financial Statement that the proportion of gross national product at market prices absorbed by all taxation, central and local, is about 22 per cent., which is not high by international standards. Deputy Corish at column 1636 of the Official Report of 10th April said:</P>
      <P>National production, we are told, has increased to a considerable extent.  I think we are entitled to ask the Government to devote to social welfare a reasonable percentage of the tax revenue.  They have not done that since they came into power in 1957.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke on much the same lines on 11th April.  Expenditure on social welfare, in the five years up to and including 1961-62, was £128.2 million.  That is 23.1 per cent, of the tax revenue.  One year may vary with another.  For one thing tax revenue has been increasing substantially in the past few years.  We may not in every year catch up on the percentage devoted to social welfare.  For that reason I am taking that five years.  In the previous five years it was 22.8 per cent.  Tax revenue was up in the last five years.  It was 23.1 per cent. against 22.8 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Labour Office issued a publication in relation to the cost of social security.  This publication shows that the central Government here contributes 71.9 per cent, of all social welfare payments.  We are by far the highest in that respect in Europe. Denmark is next with 58.7 per cent., a long way behind us.  The next one is Sweden with 54.9 per cent. Great Britain is 26.6 per cent, and the Common Market countries put together have 13.4 per cent., so that <Col N="592" /> on that basis we have nothing to be ashamed of.  According to this publication, the percentage of social welfare expenditure as a proportion of the national income in Ireland in 1959 was very high, 6.6 per cent.  It was 5.4 per cent. in the United Kingdom.  If you take health as well as social welfare, then the British figure would be higher than ours.  It would be 12.1 per cent. and we would be 11.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputies referred to the amount we are providing for social welfare as £1 million but, like another figure referred to before, £1 million in the first year means a good deal more in the second year.  As a matter of fact, it will be £2.1 million in the second year.  As a matter of fact, as compared with the net additional taxation this year, £2.45 million in a full year, it will be seen that the extra taxes were almost all necessary to provide for the social welfare expenditure if not this year at least next year.</P>
    <P>That does take the argument from the Labour Deputies who made the point that if half of this money had been for social welfare they would have voted for it.  Of course, we know they had no notion of voting for it but they made that excuse.  Deputy Corish defended his action when he was Minister for Social Welfare for three years in providing a lone 2/6 for the old age pensioners as compared with the 6/- provided by this Government up to now and the 2/6 added which will make it 8/6.  He defended that because of the cost of living.  An analysis of that would be a very useful and instructive lesson for Deputy Corish and the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1954 to 1957 the cost of living went up by 11 points. I am taking February in each case because it was around February that each Government came in.  That is 9 per cent.  Deputy Corish gave them 2/6 in the three years, which is 11.5 per cent.  He barely covered the three years he was there, which proved he was quite satisfied with how the old age pensioners were treated by Fianna Fáil before he came in.  Even if he could not have done something better for them, he should have tried to do something better but, of course, he had Fine Gael to deal with and we know the reputation of Fine Gael in regard to the old age pensioners.  The only thing they ever did was to take 1/- off them.</P>

      <P>As I say, Deputy Corish gave them 2/6 during the whole of that three years.  We came along and the cost of living went up from February, 1957, to March, 1962, by 19 points, which is 14 per cent.  We gave the pensioners 6/- so far which is <Col N="594" /> 25 per cent., and we are giving them 2/6 now raising the pensions by 35 per: cent. in all.  Deputy Corish referred to this half crown as miserable.  What should we call Deputy Corish's performance over three years when he gave a total of 2/6?</P>

Neither did Deputy Norton.  What grudge had the two Labour Ministers against the unemployment assistance people?  Deputy Corish is talking about the miserable half crown but what about his fourpence halfpenny?  How does he describe nothing for unemployment assistance?

      <P>Some Deputies said we gave too much to the farmers.  Some said we should not have taken the duty off the cinemas and the dancehalls while others said they would have done the same if they were here. Deputy Corish said we voted against the increased taxation in 1956 when he provided something extra for social welfare, Deputy Sweetman at that time put 5d. a packet on cigarettes.  I reckon I will get £1,700,000 on the twopence extra I put on cigarettes. Accordingly he must have expected £3,500,000.  Of that, Deputy Corish took only £300,000 for social welfare, I think we had much more reason to vote against that Budget then than the Labour Party have to vote against us now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The dancehalls then. The tax on the cinemas amounted to £800,000 and on the dancehalls £80,000.  I had a deputation from a labour union who represented cinema employees.  They said these employees were people who had worked in the cinemas all their lives and whose parents had worked there before them. They said they were not fitted for other work and consequently were facing unemployment.  They made, a strong appeal to have the tax taken off the cinemas.  The proprietors also came and I agreed first of all to halve the tax.  They said: &ldquo;Could you not do anything better,&rdquo; to which I replied: &ldquo;Very well.  I shall take it off entirely at the end of six months.&rdquo; I realised, of course, that it was finality for them.  I listened to them very sympathetically but I notice I do not get very much support here from the Labour Party.  Not a single <Col N="597" /> member of that Party said I was right to take that tax off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I got an appeal from the dancehall people too.  It was not from a union, but, the people who came to me pointed out that several people in the catering business and in the musician business would suffer because the dancehalls were doing, very badly.  I know that to be so because the tax receipts from dancehalls have been going down very rapidly.  I think there was something in what those concerned told me because several people in the catering business and in the musician business depend on the success of the dancehalls.  That apparently does not appeal to the Labour Party who said I should not have taken that tax off. I disagree with that.  Apart from that, if, we take the tax off the cinemas, as we intend to, it would; be entirely uneconomic to have a staff going around to the dances.  They would have no other duties because there would be no other entertainments tax left.  Everyone knows that dances are held at night and the staff would have to go around collecting the tax.  Deputy Sherwin gave a very good description&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If Deputy Dillon wants the old age pensioner to use that money on the increased beer tax, he must drink 30 pints per week which would cost 52/6.  How can he do that?  We are told that this will be a big impost on the beer drinker and that it will reduce the consumption of beer.  Perhaps it will, but I want to say that since the last increase in the beer tax, the trade have put 5d. on the pint. We are putting Id. on now.  It is time for us to step in.  They got 5d.  Let us take spirits.  Since the last increase on spirits, the trade has put 10d. a glass on spirits.  We put 2d. on it and it cannot be said we are taking too big a share.</P>
      <P>Let us come now to the Common Market which may be less controversial. The Government are attacked by Fine Gael and Labour because we have not said enough about the Common Market.  I do not know what all this talk is that we are not giving enough information about the Common Market.  We are being put in a position as if we are trying to conceal something.  What is the game? Surely to goodness, the Taoiseach has given assurance after assurance that nothing is being concealed.  Why should there be?  Of course if any Deputy wants to take the sure line about the Common Market, if anything goes wrong, he can say afterwards that he knew it and asked questions, but if it goes right, he will say nothing more about it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tully said that 25 per cent. of our labour force will be out of work, if we loin the Common Market.  He said that Ministers should tell the people that.  We are not telling them&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many industries will have to reorganise and try to be ready so far as they can to compete.  I am sure that if they take steps to equip themselves, they will be able to compete. We are prepared to help them in every way to equip themselves for the Common Market.  I know we can face it.  I have always said, about agriculture on one side, that the farmers of this country are both industrious and intelligent.  When I was Minister for Agriculture, I spent many a holiday on the Continent, in the rural areas of six or seven countries.  I never saw farmers working any harder than the farmers work here, and I did not see any more intelligence than I saw here.</P>
      <P>I believe the Common Market will be a big market and a fairly constant market.  Perhaps prices will not be a whole lot better for some commodities but at least it will be a constant market for all we produce.  So I think that on the agricultural side we will be better off than we are at the moment.</P>

      <P>On the industrial side, since 1932, we adopted what Fine Gael sneeringly referred to as self-sufficiency and industries have been built up and now they are in the export market.  The same industries were built up on the home market first where they got experience, had their men trained and eventually they were in a position to go into the foreign market.  If, for instance, you take the <Col N="602" /> textile, clothing and footwear groups, they increased their exports in the past four years from £7.2 million to £14.3 million.  These are practically all industries built up since 1932.  There were some textiles factories before that but practically all of them have been built up since 1932.  They have exported mostly to England, competing against established English factories successfully.  In some cases, they went into other countries where they have to get over a tariff barrier, pay a tariff as well as compete.  They have done that successfully and why should they not carry on and compete also in the Common Market?</P>
      <P>Our industrial exports have increased by 73 per cent. in the past four or five years and why not have faith in the country that they can go on?  Deputy Rooney painted a very gloomy picture here.  He said we were going to be completely in the hands of foreigners in a few years' time.  I do not think that is going to happen.</P>

      <P>If we take the whole period, including 1957, with the big number that went out in that year, the average is 41,000, which is much lower than the Coalition's average.  On the employment figures, Deputy M. J. O'Higgins said that 60,000 went out of employment since 1957.  I said &ldquo;Not so much.&rdquo;  He said &ldquo;About 50,000,&rdquo; but there are 17,000 fewer in employment.  If you take the two tables, Table 7 and Table 16&mdash;the agricultural table and the non-agricultural table&mdash;you will find that from 1954 to 1957, it went down by 49,000 and from 1957 to 1961 by 17,000, a much more favourable figure.</P>
      <P>I should like to analyse this a little further.  From 1960 to 1961, the number in employment in industry and so on went up by 10,000.  The number of members of farmers' families went up by 5,000.  It was the first time this went up.  Anybody not too prejudiced will agree that that is a very good trend.  I hope it is a trend.  Maybe it is only for a year.  I may be wrong and it may go down again next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the hire of agricultural workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. Permanent employees went down by 2,600 and temporary employees by 5,000.  My own experience about temporary employees is that they are leaving because it is not possible for a man to live unless he has a full-time job.  A man cannot live on a few days' work a year.  I have been telling farmers that for a long time.  You cannot expect to have labour available when you want them and let them go when you are done with them.  They must employ their men full-time or they will not have them.  The net position is that there is a reduction of 4,000 in those employed in agriculture, forestry and fisheries against an increase of 10,000 on the industrial side.  That is an increase in employment of 6,000.  There has not been an increase since 1954.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We left office in 1954 and the Coalition came in.  When the Census <Col N="609" /> was taken in that April, employment had gone up by 3,000, between agricultural and non-agricultural.  As I said, for the three years the Coalition were there, the figure went down by 49,000 and in our three years by 17,000. Deputy Rooney called this 50,000. Deputy Rooney likes round figures.  I have rarely met a man who can murder figures as well as Deputy Rooney.  Somebody said that employment in industry is no higher now than it was in 1955. It is higher.  It is very interesting to look at the figures for employment in industry in 1953 and down along to 1961.  It was improving from 1953 to 1955&mdash;155, 156 and 158; there was a big drop in 1956, 150; it remained static at that until 1958, and then it began to move upwards again.  Now it is at 167.5. The fact is that there was an increase in employment at the beginning of 1954 and it took us eight years to get back to that state again.  This year again, we have an increase.  It gives you an idea of the destruction done by the Coalition Government in this country during three years of office.</P>

      <P>At an earlier stage I used the word &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; in relation to the Minister for Finance.  That was a perfectly incorrect word and I wish to withdraw it.  He is far too politically astute to be stupid.  The correct words <Col N="610" /> would have been &ldquo;politically dishonest&rdquo;.</P>
