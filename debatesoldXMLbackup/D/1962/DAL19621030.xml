    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>During my recent visits to member countries of the European Economic Community, I had discussions with certain Heads of State and Heads of Government as well as with members of each of the Six Governments and with the Chairman of the Commission of the EEC.  These meetings afforded me an opportunity of informing myself of the situation in the Community and of ensuring a full understanding of Ireland's position as an applicant for membership.  I am happy to be able to record my appreciation of the goodwill towards Ireland, and towards our application, which was shown by everyone with whom I came in contact.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Council of the Community last week agreed to the opening of negotiations on our application for membership of the Community under Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome.  These negotiations will begin on a date to be fixed by agreement between our Government and the Governments of the member States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may mention in this connection that, having regard, on the one hand, to the intrinsic importance and the complexities of the British application, and, on the other, to the heavy programme of work devolving on the services of the Community, the member States have decided to give absolute <Col N="4" /> priority to that application.  It is thus unlikely that substantive negotiations with us will begin for some months.</P>
    <P>As regards the relationship between our application and that of Britain, it is quite clear that failure of the British application for any reason would create an entirely new situation for all concerned and one about which it would be impossible to make any useful conjecture at the present stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to say to us, as a result of these discussions or from any other source, whether there is any reasonable estimate available of when the negotiations between the European Economic Community and Great Britain will have concluded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No. There is, I gather, a hope that an outline agreement may be completed early next year but when the subsequent completion of that outline and of all the details of the agreement may take place is still uncertain.  I found in Europe a general hope that it might be possible to complete negotiations with a view to Britain's accession to membership of the EEC by the 1st of January, 1964.  Some of those to whom I talked regarded that estimate as pessimistic and others as optimistic but it seemed to be the date that most people had in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we to assume from that that the Taoiseach does not contemplate any detailed discussion of Ireland's application until a date subsequent to 1964 or might we assume that after the skeleton settlement had been arrived at agreeing in principle to the adhesion of Great Britain to the Common Market the negotiations on Ireland's application might be forthwith undertaken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The expectation is that negotiations with other applicant states will begin when the outline agreement has been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Taoiseach's statement today and the many statements that have been made <Col N="5" /> since the House last sat, may I take it that we still have an assurance that the terms upon which Ireland may be admitted to membership of the European Community will be submitted to this House and the House given an opportunity of pronouncing on these details before we, in fact, become members of the Community?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be correct to assume that if for some reason or another Britain's application is either withdrawn or refused, our application will not be proceeded with and that we will withdraw?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation that could arise in that eventuality would be so uncertain that it would be quite impossible, and unwise at this stage, to attempt to reach any decision as to what our action might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not be straight about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a fact that the Taoiseach is reported as stating to a group of European journalists early this year that in the event of Britain's application not being accepted, the Irish application for full membership would still be pursued?  Did the Taoiseach make that statement or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that in the event of the British application not proceeding, we would wish to proceed with our application, if it were economically possible for us to do so.  That, as I pointed out, would depend on the relations which might then exist between Britain and the Community and would also, of course, depend upon the policy of the Community with regard to the admission of new members in the event of Britain not being a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Taoiseach reconcile that statement now with his statement to this House in July, 1961 and the White Paper issued in July, 1961 that it would not be in the national interest to join if the United Kingdom were not a member, or words to that effect?  Why has the Taoiseach <Col N="6" /> changed his attitude in the past 12 months on that very vital issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that statement before Britain applied for membership, in relation to the question of our application.  If their application should fail, that would be a situation in which it would be wise for us to look again at the whole position and I am sure other countries of Europe would want to do the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach taking into consideration, when he talks about pursuing our application in the event of Britain not joining, the position as regards the Six Counties when it would appear that if Britain stays out, the border between the Six Counties and the Twenty-six counties is widening on political grounds?  In view of the Taoiseach's original statement that membership of the Common Market would help to bring about the end of Partition, how does he consider or see that Partition would be solved if we continue with our application for full membership if Britain is refused or withdraws?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In that hypothetical event, it is quite obvious that before we make up our minds as to our own policy, we must take all considerations into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when the Taoiseach made a statement to visiting journalists, who might not have as much knowledge of the position as those of us who live here, he was trying to create the impression that Ireland had an independent, viable economy&mdash;independent of Britain&mdash;and that it would be possible for us to go forward with our application for membership if Britain had to withdraw, when in fact he knew that to be complete rubbish?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspaper report which the Deputies evidently have in mind mistranslated, from the German text, the statement of the Minister for External Affairs to which the Deputies refer.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of a reported statement on to-day's paper, attributed to the Taoiseach last night, that he believes 99 per cent. of the people of this country are behind him in giving up our neutrality, would he not agree that the position is that 99 per cent. of the people are not aware of the implications involved in what the Taoiseach is doing or has been doing in Germany in the past week?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that it <Col N="8" /> is possible for Ireland to pursue a non-commital policy as 45 other nations in the world have done; and is it not further a fact that the Taoiseach has advocated in the United Nations that there should not be an extension of the cold war and that he is now proposing to extend that cold war by bringing in Ireland and involving Ireland?  Is it not completely hypocritical?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied <Col N="9" /> that it would be possible for Ireland to accept the full implications of tariff removal in the EEC within the specified period; and if he can now form an estimate of the total number of persons likely to be redundant as a result of the removal of tariffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government consider that it is in the country's interest to join the European Economic Community.  We recognise, however, that the removal of tariffs within the Community will create some difficulties in the industrial sector, and, accordingly, we have proposed to the Community that, in our case, a special rhythm of tariff reductions should operate which will be different from the rhythm which has been applied among the present members and that, in addition, provision should be made for dealing with cases of basically-sound industries which might find it too difficult to comply with the general rhythm of tariff reductions.  The Government, in co-operation with industry, chiefly through the Committee on Industrial Organisation, are taking all necessary steps to encourage and assist industry to adapt and reorganise itself so as to be prepared for freer trading conditions.  The extent to which redundancy will occur will depend on the success of these adaptation measures.  It would not be possible, at this stage, to give a reliable estimate of the size of the redundancy problem. The extent to which this would be offset by the expansion of other industries, which is now taking place and which is expected to accelerate when the uncertainty about our membership of the Community is ended, is a relevant consideration.  There is no reason to believe, having regard to experience in other countries, that the problem will be of other than manageable proportions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the situation, according to to-day's paper, that it is decided that between the members of the EEC all tariff barriers will be removed by 1967, does the Taoiseach contemplate in his statement put forward to the European Commission that Ireland will get a substantial extension of time beyond the 1967 date?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from statements made outside this House, may I ask the Taoiseach to make the statements in this House?  Is he in a position to state that there will be given to Ireland exceptional treatment in the matter of tariff barrier removal beyond the date of 1967 set for those countries which are already members of the European Economic Community; and can he tell us now whether the extended period will be sufficient to enable the Government to make alternative arrangements to absorb into employment numbers who are about to lose it between now and 1967?</P>

      <P>In view of the statement made by him, I think since the House adjourned, that it might be desirable to commence the dismantling of some tariffs in advance of our actual admission to the European Common Market, would the Taoiseach now indicate whether he proposes to introduce a process of that kind before we are actually admitted to the Common Market or whether he intends instead to wait until such time as we are admitted before considering any reduction in existing tariffs?</P>

      <P>One of the proposals put forward within the Community for handling a similar problem where it arose within the Community countries, involved the maintenance of income for workers during a period in which they were being retrained for other occupations.  As I said, we would naturally wish to do something along those lines but the extent to which we can be assisted in so doing from the funds of the Community is still somewhat uncertain.</P>

    <P>A clear indication of the principles guiding our foreign policy in relation to our application for membership of the European Economic Community was given in my statement to the Ministers of the Governments of the <Col N="15" /> Member States of the EEC on the 18th January, 1962, in the course of which I said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is thus natural that we in Ireland should regard with keen and sympathetic interest every genuine effort to bring the peoples of Europe closer together, so as to strengthen the foundations of our common civilisation.  We were happy at the development in the years following the last war of a strong movement towards closer European union; and we have participated actively from the outset in the two organisations established to promote co-operation between European States, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation and the Council of Europe.  While Ireland did not accede to the North Atlantic Treaty, we have always agreed with the general aim of that Treaty.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;The fact that we did not accede to it was due to special circumstances and does not qualify in any way our acceptance of the ideal of European unity and of the conception, embodied in the Treaty of Rome and the Bonn declaration of 18 July last, of the duties, obligations and responsibilities which European unity would impose.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the Dáil, on the 15th November, 1961, I made a statement, in reply to questions, on the political aims of the European Community and said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There is no doubt, however, that the member countries of the Community regard it as essential that all applicants for membership should be willing to cooperate with them without qualification for the attainment of these wider objectives.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is clear that the statements which I made at Bonn were in full accord with these earlier statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My speech to the Dáil on the 5th July, 1961, to which the Deputy refers, did not purport to be a comprehensive statement about the European Economic Community.</P>
      <P>In reply to a question in Bonn on the 23rd October, 1962, about our application to join the European Economic Community, I said that our reason was primarily political but that, backing up that political decision, was the recognition that there would be no economic future of any kind for Ireland in the circumstances in which the other countries of Western Europe would be combined in the Common Market.  I added that we hoped to be able to participate in the effort which was being made to build up the unity of Western Europe and to ensure, by common action, its future progress in the economic and every other sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, quite obvious that a decision involving acceptance of the aims and obligations of the European <Col N="20" /> Economic Community must be primarily political, having regard to the very wide scope and depth of the provisions of the Rome Treaty.  It was for that reason that the opening section of my statement in Brussels on the 18th January, 1962, was devoted to the political aspects of membership of the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question is obviously based on a misconception of the context in which the statement to which he refers was made at Bonn.  The statement was made in reply to a specific question about a proposal put forward some years ago by our delegation at the United Nations concerning the creation of an area of law in Central Europe.  We have not since pursued this proposal for the reasons I stated at Bonn.  No change of policy was involved.  This country will, of course, continue to support, in the United Nations, efforts to reduce international tension and to achieve the greatest possible degree of disarmament subject to adequate international control and inspection; and we will, in this regard, take any initiative which appears likely to be useful.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of his statement in Bonn on 23rd October that Ireland had <Col N="21" /> promised that she would never let her territory be used for an aggression against Britain, this country is bound by any treaty obligation of this nature; if so, what treaty obligation; when such treaty was made; and by whom it was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no treaty obligation in this connection.  I would, however, direct the Deputy's attention to the statement made in this House by the then Head of the Government on the 29th May, 1935.  That statement was to the effect that &ldquo; we are not going ... to allow our territory, under any conditions whatever, to be made use of by some foreign power as the base of attack against Britain&rdquo;.  This undertaking was frequently renewed in the Dáil and elsewhere.  It has been accepted as national policy by successive Governments, and I have no doubt that it has the support of the overwhelming majority of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>If Britain believes the Taoiseach's word on that, surely there is no reason at this stage for the British to hold a bridgehead in the Six Counties?  In view of the Taoiseach's new friendship with West Germany, is it not quite clear that the West Germans and the former members of the Fianna Fáil Party are now ganging up to open the back door to Britain?</P>

Apart from grants from the Department's Vote to voluntary agencies providing services in connection with the welfare of mothers and children, I have power to sanction proposals from health authorities to give grants to bodies providing services similar or ancillary to a service which a health authority may provide and, in fact, the Dublin Health Authority, with my consent, pays grants to a number of such bodies.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the maltsters extended the moisture assessment in malting barley from 21 per cent. to 24 per cent. to allow the farmers to obtain the fixed price at this higher moisture rate on account of the exceptionally wet season and, if he will fix the prices for feeding barley accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the normal upper moisture limit for malting barley bought under contract has been extended this season.  No upper moisture limit applies in the case of feeding barley and it is not proposed to alter the prices at which the crop was bought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>For the reason I have given, that there is no upper limit in the case of feeding barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely when Guinness, or those responsible for malting barley, were prepared to give this concession in the wet season, there is no reason why the Government should not do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a limit in regard to malting barley; there is no limit in regard to feeding barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is different.  I have said that, while Guinness have raised the figure in regard to malting barley from 23 to 25, there is no limit of any kind in regard to feeding barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if, in raising the moisture limit from 21 to 24 in respect of malting barley, there was any corresponding reduction in the contract price for malting barley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot tell the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest there was not. While there was no ceiling on the moisture content of feeding barley, the guaranteed price payable for feeding <Col N="47" /> barley was related to the moisture content, and there was no corresponding relaxation of the moisture content level in respect of feeding barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a movement of only two per cent.&mdash;23 per cent. to 25 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not right.  The Deputy's figure is not accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>It was 21 per cent. for feeding and malting barley and Guinness raised it to 24 per cent. for malting barley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about malting barley.  The figure was raised from 23 per cent. to 25 per cent.  in the case of malting barley.  If the moisture content of feeding barley is under 20 per cent., there is an increase in price and, if it is over 20 per cent., there is a reduction; but there is no limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that if there was, in fact, a relaxation of three points in the top level of moisture content for feeding barley, there ought to be the same relaxation of the price reductions applicable in the guaranteed price for feeding barley, if the moisture content exceeds 21 per cent.?</P>

      <P>The Advisory Committee on the Marketing of Agricultural Produce expressed the opinion that participation in fairs and exhibitions was only of limited value as a means of promoting Irish agricultural exports, and that their impact is considerably less than television and press advertising.  In the case of commodities for which there are marketing boards, it is a matter for the boards to decide in what fairs or exhibitions they may wish to participate.  As the Deputies will be aware, extensive publicity on behalf of our cattle trade was recently undertaken by my Department. No approach was made to my Department by food exporters regarding participation in the Olympia Food Fair.</P>

      <P>On the occasion to which the Deputy refers, Saturday, 6th October, 70 horses were presented for export at Dublin Port and 67 of these were passed for shipment by my Department's portal veterinary officers on being found to be under seven years of age and fit to travel.  The veterinary officers were not themselves <Col N="49" /> acquainted with the circumstances in which one of these horses was stated to have been removed later from the port to a factory and slaughtered there outside official hours on the Saturday afternoon, nor was there any subsequent veterinary examination and identification of the animal which would substantiate the allegations made.  Indeed, two statements made in connection with the allegations were later admitted to be incorrect, namely, as regards the time of delivery and slaughter of the horse at the factory and the filing of its teeth to make it look younger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that they are two separate motions and that we are entitled to speak on both.  With regard to the motion to amend Standing Orders, I am amazed at the audacity of the Government in producing a motion of this nature, for the simple reason that already in Standing Orders there is provision for Private Members' time of three hours per week.  That Standing Order has been there for years but the Government have blatantly ignored it.  In my experience of the past eight years in this House, there was never any attempt made by the Government to provide the three hours per week Private Members' time which according to Standing Orders should be and must be made available to private Deputies or back benchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this motion before the House, there is an attempt made to change Standing Orders in order <i>moryah</i> to <Col N="88" /> provide three hours per week for Private Members.  Is there any Deputy foolish enough to believe that a Government which has flouted Standing Orders for the last eight years and failed to give the three hours per week which the Standing Orders provide for Private Members is changing its tune and is introducing this motion so as to ensure that three hours per week is given for Private Members' motions?</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, I have not the slightest doubt, will tell us there are other attractive aspects in this motion, namely, that it is one that protects the ordinary Deputy in so far as the Adjournment Debate is concerned. I do not for a moment dispute that in recent times an occasion did arise&mdash;and I think that occasion was when Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan raised some matter on the Adjournment here &mdash;when the Government Party, Fianna Fáil, in order to prevent his speaking on the Adjournment, all trooped out of this House so that there would be no quorum available.  That is the first time that it has happened over the years, in any records I have searched of Dáil proceedings, that for lack of a quorum a Deputy was not allowed to proceed on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>If it is essential to remedy that situation I have no objection to this House putting in black and white that a Private Member, no matter what side of the House he is on, is entitled either on the Adjournment or in the course of a discussion of a Private Member's motion to proceed, irrespective of whether there is a quorum in the House.  We know how difficult it would have been in the past 12 months to obtain a quorum even for Government business.  If Deputies showed such a lack of interest, had so much contempt for the House that they failed to supply a quorum during Government business, there is little likelihood of their supplying a quorum in the course of a discussion on a Private Member's motion or on the Adjournment.</P>
    <P>This motion is not necessary and it does nothing whatever to help Private Members.  The time is already allowed in Standing Orders and as far as I can see there is nothing to prevent the <Col N="89" /> Government giving the time which should be made available.  This motion is the thin end of the wedge.  It is the sugar on the pill which is coming in the next motion and I propose to deal with that in the course of the discussion on the next motion.</P>

      <P>I think I should say now what I intended to reserve, in order to clarify any misunderstanding in the mind of the public.  As far as the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is concerned, the Taoiseach is on record here three months ago as stating in reply to me that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges made these recommendations and that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges represented all groups of this House. When I pointed out somewhat vehemently to the Taoiseach that was not so, he did a little bit of backpedalling in the very same manner as he is backpedalling on the Common Market, so that we do not know where he stands. There is no use in the Taoiseach making a blunt statement in this House to the effect that all groups were represented on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because that is absolutely incorrect.</P>

      <P>That the following be adopted as an additional Standing Order of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business&mdash;</P>
      <P>82A (1) For the purpose of this Standing Order a group shall mean&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Any Party which had not less than seven members elected to the Dáil at the previous General Election, or</P>
      <P>(b)  all members of the Dáil who are not members of any such Party.</P>
      <P>(2)  Each group shall have the right in rotation to nominate a private member of the group to move a motion standing in his name.  The order in which the right may be exercised by the various groups shall be determined on the basis of the numbers of members in the groups, a larger group having precedence over a smaller one.  In the case of an equality of numbers precedence shall be determined by lot.</P>
      <P>(3)  At least ten days prior to the date on which the motion is moved the member nominated shall indicate to the Ceann Comhairle the motion which he proposes to move and the Ceann Comhairle will give this motion appropriate precedence in the Private Members' Business on the Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Standing Order has been recommended to the Dáil by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The present practice by which motions are debated in the order in which notice is given of them gives rise to dissatisfaction. A Member may by getting a number of his motions on to the Order Paper in consecutive order monopolise Private Members' time for a considerable period.  The Standing Order which the Committee have recommended distributes the time in a manner which has regard to the various divisions of Members in the House. There is no doubt that this, while not <Col N="92" /> a perfect arrangement, is far more equitable than the present one.  On that basis, I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>I do not know about that, but another Deputy made the statement about what the motion meant and it did not mean that at all. The suggestion was made, and taken up by one section of the Press, that the motion intended that no individual Deputy could ever put down a private motion again.  Of course, that is nonsense. The new Standing Order provides, as heretofore, complete and absolute safeguards for any individual Deputy to put a motion on the Order Paper in accordance with his rights as a Deputy to do so.</P>

      <P>It is true, but it does provide that no one Deputy, or no two Deputies, can unfairly hog the time of the House against their colleagues. The motion provides that the time of the House allotted for Private Members' Business will be divided amongst the various Deputies who have been elected, in a manner not strictly arithmetical, because quite frankly it is against the larger Parties. In fact, under this scheme, the Labour Party will get slightly more than is their fair arithmetical proportion, as their representative agreed in the Committee on Procedure, because in fact the Fine Gael Party and the Government Party are giving up more than their arithmetical share of the time available.  What it means is that certain individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, Khrushchev could be one.  Certain individuals can, immediately after a general election, put down all the motions that they want to put down without consulting their colleagues and the more responsible Parties can, in fact, under the existing arrangements, be prevented for a long period from getting any share at all of Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>The effect of this arrangement is quite clear.  It divides the time of the House according, roughly, to the number of Deputies representing each interest, each Party in the House.  I cannot see how anyone who seriously wants to do anything other than make publicity for himself could object&mdash;and I do not deny individuals the right to make publicity for themselves because it is on publicity that individuals rely, not on a policy&mdash;but I do not see why their publicity should interfere with the orderly and proper discussion of motions in this House set up by the Deputies who have been elected by a large body rather than one particular interest.

      <P>I do know that certain people quite deliberately, as part of their own publicity stunts, wanted to prevent the ordinary procedure that has operated in this House from carrying on in the future.  I want to see that everyone gets a fair share and that anyone who wants to have a motion discussed can do so in his own fair, orderly time, but I do not see why anyone in this House should take up more of his share or take up the share that belongs to others.  There are motions on this Order Paper that have been put down by our Party for a very considerable time.  On the Order Paper as it is at present, they could not be <Col N="94" /> discussed until financial business comes again and in the ordinary course of arrangements, Private Members' time will go.</P>
      <P>I do not see why it is proper that because we have 47 members and because, when we want to put down a motion, we naturally enough discuss it amongst ourselves, first of all, others who have not got to discuss it with anyone should get the prior right continually, and again and again, to prevent us as the Opposition Party from bringing in a motion on a serious subject for discussion in this House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to express our agreement with this motion.  We do that with no intention of endeavouring to stifle either groups of individuals or individual members of this House, irrespective of what side they belong to. We agree with this motion because we reserve the right to be permitted to have our fair share of time allocated to us.  It is not quite correct to say that three hours a week were allocated by the Standing Orders.  Three hours a week were allocated for Private Members' time, provided the House sat on Fridays.  The Dáil decided not to sit on Fridays as it was not convenient for members and this is to restore the position by changing it from Friday to a day the Dáil sits. I forecast that anyone who wants time for a motion will have more than ample time.  As I say, we have no wish and no intention to stifle anybody and we do not believe that anybody will be stifled or prevented from talking in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is a deliberate, calculated attempt to deprive private Deputies of their constitutional right.  I wonder has it occurred to the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges what are the functions, privileges and responsibilities of Deputies?  I wonder are they aware that Parties as such are not recognised by the Constitution? I wonder are they aware of the fact that by trying to impose Party rule on this Dáil they are in contempt of the Constitution?  Deputies are elected to represent their constituents.  If, thereafter, they combine in groups, <Col N="95" /> calling themselves Parties for convenience or policy or any of these things, that does not take from their primary duty, which is to advocate as best they can the best possible deal they can get for those whom they represent.  Here we have this Committee&mdash;I agree with Deputy McQuillan; to say &ldquo;utterly&rdquo; would perhaps be wrong, but this relatively unrepresentative body, certainly not representative of the whole House&mdash;bringing in this motion to limit the rights of private Deputies, and finally I have no doubt knowing the mentality of some of the members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to extinguish the rights of private Deputies, if they can possibly do so.  However, some of us will fight against that as best we can.</P>
      <P>This motion was based on deliberate malice and nothing else.  For the past 40 years, every Deputy has had the right to put down on the Order Paper any motion which came within the terms of the duties and responsibilities of members.  There have been many troubled times in this House.  There have been times when group antagonisms and Party divisions and enmities were far more intense than they are now.  At no time was an effort made to limit the rights of Deputies in this regard.  I recall in my own relatively short membership of this Chamber over the last ten years or so, we have had up to two dozen or perhaps 15 Independent Deputies.  At no time was it suggested that these Deputies' rights and privileges should be curtailed as is proposed here.</P>
      <P>I am quite willing to accept that this motion did not in fact emanate from the Government side.  The Government have no problem in regard to time for the discussion of motions.  I am certain this motion emanated from some individuals who were not sufficiently quick to take advantage of what is open to everybody here: to put down as many motions as they wish, just as we did and were entitled to do.  What we have here is the end result of the secret discussions of chagrined political malcontents and nothing more.</P>

      <P>It is true and the Taoiseach knows it is true.  We have Deputy Sweetman talking about his Party having had consultations with the people and others putting down motions without having had consultations with anybody.  There are individuals in this House with far greater contacts with the common, ordinary people than Deputy Sweetman ever had or ever will have.  Some of these take advantage of this device of bringing the problems of their people before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Take one example of how this will spancel and corral the ordinary Deputy if it goes through, as apparently it will because you are all agreed on it.  We often have occasion to put down Dáil Questions on matters of vital interest to us such as, for instance, the manner in which CIE are robbing my constituents in Ballyfermot.  We inevitably get the answer&mdash;I have had five of them within the past week&mdash;that the Minister has no responsibility.  What recourse have I in regard to this important issue for the people who sent me here other than that of bringing in a Private Members' Motion?</P>
      <P>I am not a member of a Party or a group; I am an Independent Labour representative.  There are five other Independents.  It is suggested these should meet, form a group and determine between themselves who is to get the opportunity when their turn comes.  If an emergency situation should arise and I find I must take some steps in the form of putting down an urgent motion to gain relief for some of my constituents in Ballyfermot or County Dublin, if the Dáil is not in session, how am I to contact Deputy Leneghan in the Belmullet peninsula, Deputy Sheridan in Longford-Westmeath or my friend, the elusive Deputy Sherwin, who is so active all the time on behalf of the citizens of this city?  Where will he be located, or any of the others who are Independent Deputies?  How can they be located and made to operate this proposal which, apart from being unjust, is totally unworkable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Supposing this mysterious Committee on Procedure and Privileges were in earnest and really wanted to get some kind of system under which <Col N="97" /> everybody would have a fair chance. Surely if they wanted to change what has existed for the past 40 years, they would have suggested something along the lines of what happens in the British House of Commons, whereby members' requests for Private Time are put into a hat and the lucky ones come out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for these groups and for yourselves.  Deputy Sweetman made a point about his Party.  Is it not true&mdash;I have seen it many times myself&mdash;that the Government almost invariably are amenable to suggestions from the Opposition when a request comes for time to discuss a particular motion?  We had an example recently in connection with pensioners.  It is no problem for the larger Parties.  In fact, the same could be said as far as the Labour Party are concerned.  I am sure that if the Labour Party wanted time for the discussion of a motion, they would not meet with undue unreasonableness from the Taoiseach.  This business of Private Time was undoubtedly designed to afford to the Private Deputy the opportunity of raising in this House matters he considered of urgency and importance to the public.</P>
      <P>This is a limitation of existing rights, to be followed, without doubt, by an attempt at the final elimination of the rights of individual Deputies.  I am glad Deputy Dillon is here.  I have heard him many times inveighing against any suggested incursions upon the rights of private Deputies.  Yet he is a party to this.  I wonder if he were in the position he was in some dozen years ago, when he was an Independent, would he have accepted this proposal so lightly?  I doubt it very much.  Since it now makes things more comfortable for the larger Parties, we hear no more from Deputy Dillon, who was indeed one of the great tribunes of the rights of individual Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this goes through, I can see that soon the Committee on Procedure and <Col N="98" /> Privileges will be taking into account the undue amount of space taken up on the Order Paper by the Questions of Private Deputies and a limit will have to be put on that.  Then there will be complaints emanating from the smoke-filled rooms about the amount of time being taken up by Deputies in the course of ordinary debates, and something will have to be done about that.  The fact is that everybody here is no more than a private Deputy and any arrangement which you make between yourselves for the convenience of, or the conduct of your own collective affairs, to which I apply the term &ldquo;Party politics&rdquo;, has no recognition in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The main function and purpose of the Deputy is to look after his constituency. An attempt is being made here to prevent us doing that, an attempt to drive the Independents to form a Party or group.  The Independents went before the electorate as individuals with their own policies or lack of policies&mdash;call it what you like &mdash;but they were elected and have rights equal to those of any other person in the House.  The attempt is being made to drive them into a group so that they can be cowed by the larger groups.  It is a scandalous and disgraceful thing that this Parliament should be endeavouring to limit the rights of individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>I repeat that this is a piece of political ganging-up on the part of the organised groups against individuals. It is remarkable for the fact that the two major parties and the Labour Party have found unanimity for the first time against a small group because that small group is the burr under the saddle of the Party wheelhorse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of some consequence and one in respect of which I feel a special responsibility as the Leader of the principal Opposition. If the gravamen of Deputy Dunne's speech were valid, I should feel quite unfit for the position I occupy.  I make no apology to the House or the country for my profound conviction that the safest citadel of individual liberty is a parliamentary democracy and I am concerned to go <Col N="99" /> to the extremest length to ensure that Parliament should effectively function in our society in the profound conviction that if it does not, the alternative is authoritarian rule, either from the Left or the Right, both of which are equally obnoxious to me.  I want to state quite categorically that I do not believe Parliament can effectively function, unless each individual Deputy in it is protected in the exercise of all his rights and that in this House under Standing Orders the rights of the most isolated Deputy are quite as sacrosanct as those of the Taoiseach or leader of any Party, large or small.</P>
      <P>It is for that reason that an amendment of the Standing Orders has already been adopted by the House today.  It is all part of the pattern which is now in the process of adoption to ensure that if Deputy Dunne or any other Independent Deputy feels deeply in respect of any matter affecting his own constituents, or any other matter relevant to the proceedings of the House, he shall have the right to bring any Minister of the Government to render an account of his stewardship here to this House and if, in the course of question and answer and supplementary question and supplementary answer, he fails to get satisfaction from that Minister he shall have sacrosanct the right&mdash;and we have today established it for the first time&mdash;to call the Minister back to the House when the House adjourns at half-past ten and even if the Deputy is the only one in Dáil Éireann interested in the matter which he wishes to ventilate he can force the Minister to sit here and listen to him for 20 minutes in public and he can constrain the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Now, to my mind, that is a great and invaluable guarantee of the fundamental rights of the Independent Deputies in this House but it is even more effective than I am suggesting because in our knowledge of Parliamentary <Col N="105" /> practice Private Deputies' Motions are rarely, if ever, put down by the Government Party and what this Standing Order really means is that every third motion called in this House must be called from the benches in which Deputy Dunne, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan sit.</P>

      <P>If we put down 100 motions on the Order Paper and the Labour Party put down 100 motions, and Deputy McQuillan has three motions on the Order Paper, then the motions must be called in the following order: one from Fine Gael, one from Labour, one from Deputy McQuillan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <P>One from Fine Gael, one from Labour, one from the main independent benches.  I have intervened in this matter because I love parliament.  I love its institutions.  I am deeply convinced that it is vital to the survival of this country as a free country and vital to the individual liberty of us all.  I am deeply conscious of the fact that, because Deputy Dr. Browne's activities are very frequently grossly obnoxious to me, I have an exceptional duty cast upon me to ensure that his rights in this House are held sacrosanct and must be most carefully protected.  I am deeply conscious of the temptation under which I myself labour to recoil with violence from many of the things he and Deputy McQuillan do and advocate.</P>

      <P>I agree.  Some of the things the Deputy does almost choke me.  Some of them almost make me sick.  That puts me under an even greater compulsion, and I acknowledge it, to consent to the Deputy being treated fairly.  I am honestly trying to resist temptation and to recognise that I have an exceptional obligation in respect of these two Deputies, and even the Deputy behind them, Deputy Leneghan.  The more offensive they are to me personally, the more I believe my obligation to be to see that their rights are as strictly protected as are my own.  That exposes me to ridicule from certain quarters. But those are the facts and it is because they are the facts that I have intervened in this debate and exposed myself to the kind of front that habitually comes from that part of the House.  There are certain jobs which require one to sustain that treatment in public life and, if one is not prepared to take it and hand it out, then one ought not to be in public life at all.  It is because my mind is quite clear that this Standing Order effectively protects Deputy Dr. Browne, Deputy McQuillan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Never, so long as we can keep this House functioning under the Standing Orders we have laboriously devised.  They are designed to provide that neither the Taoiseach, nor I, as Leader of this Party, nor Deputy Corish as Leader of the Labour Party, will ever be able to take from Deputy McQuillan, or Deputy Dr. Browne, or Deputy Dunne. the right to speak and say what he wants to say here so long as he can get a quota of electors to send him here.  It is that right I stand for.  That right is concerned to protect us.  It is that right I am concerned to vindicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am entitled to believe when I say I <Col N="110" /> pledge my word unequivocally to all Deputies that the purpose of this Standing Order is to provide that when the Chair calls Private Motions, he must call a motion from Fine Gael, a motion from Labour and then always a motion from the benches in which the Independents sit and, until he has called that motion, he cannot return to call another motion from either Fine Gael or Labour.  That is the purpose of this amendment.  Combined with the amendment of Standing Orders and the Standing Orders themselves, these two together guarantee to the most isolated Deputy a far greater security than he has ever enjoyed in this Parliament since this State was founded.  That is the way I want it to be.  So long as I am in the position in which I at present am, Deputy Dunne, Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan may rest assured that, much as I detest many of their activities, I shall continue to fight resolutely for the protection of their rights to say in this House what they want to say, within the Standing Orders, so long as they can find a quota of voters silly enough to send them here.</P>

He tells us this is a motion which will achieve that object.  We have waited for the best part of 40 years to get this from Deputy Dillon.</P>

What happened that he should decide <Col N="111" /> at this particular juncture to introduce this motion in the interests of the Private Deputy?  I do not know whether one can be a conscious humbug or whether one is always an unconscious humbug, but I have no doubt in my mind at all that this exercise in hypocrisy by Deputy Dillon today has never been excelled by the same Deputy in all the years I have sat here listening to him.  He has attempted to show that we are improving the position for the Private Deputy.  He must know very well that the decision of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in relation to this motion is all part of a pattern.  It is part of a pattern which has evolved naturally from the disappearance of the old inter-Party differences which so naturally divided this country, so that we are gradually moving here, regrettably, to the creation of the one Party society in so far as there is nothing at all now dividing them on ideological, political or any other grounds whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our job to try to put forward a point of view.  I think both sides of the House will agree that we have used Private Members' Time usefully on many occasions to put forward social and economic ideas based on a socialist background, a James Connolly background, for the benefit of other Deputies in order to try to persuade them to take our point <Col N="112" /> of view.  We do happen to be living in a Parliamentary democracy.  It does not come very well from either side of the House to lecture our generation on the merits of Parliamentary democracy because as I pointed out&mdash;I do not like to go back any more than anybody else&mdash;we have shown a very much higher regard for the procedure of Parliament than either of you people have shown in your own time. We have only got to remember the march of the Blueshirts on this House at one stage in the 1930s.  You have only to remember the present President's attitude to this Parliamentary democracy before you start being sanctimonious in your old age, thinking over the wild oats you once sowed and the complete contempt you showed for the decision of individuals to decide to establish a Parliament to debate, discuss and try to convince one another by dint of argument and not by the use of the gun.  We have not been guilty of that, which is more than you can say.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this is part of a pattern which has developed over the past three years in Ireland.  I regret to see it.  There is no doubt that the first incursion on the right of private Deputies, the first assault, was made by the former Taoiseach, with the consent of the present Taoiseach, when it was decided that they would try, by removing proportional representation, to get rid of the Independent Deputy altogether out of the Dáil.  That was the purpose.  You were coming very close to it.  Both major Parties had established a nice sort of city club for country Deputies, a sort of quiet, somnolent mausoleum, a St. Michan's in the city of Dublin, to which you could come, spit at one another in a quiet sort of way in your old age and then go back and pretend you were doing the job of public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the first attempt made to get rid of the Independent voice in Irish politics, the nonconformist voice in Irish politics, the Deputy who could not and would not toe the line merely because somebody said this was sacred and was the irrefutable truth handed down by some individual and because it was handed down, it must be the truth, the Deputy who <Col N="113" /> insisted on his right to come to his own conclusions on current social and economic problems.  They would not toe the Party line on either side.  Consequently, they must be brutally forced into the acceptance of the Party line.</P>
    <P>This is the tendency in the countries which Deputy Dillon so frequently criticises, the insistence on adherence to the Party line by countries which they call Communist countries.  They are criticised and abused for insisting upon one-Party Government, absolute conformity and acceptance of the <i>diktat</i> of the higher-ups.  That is exactly what you are trying to establish here.  So they went to the country and tried to get rid of the Independents. Not one of us would have come back if they had changed proportional representation.  In passing, I think it is important to the Labour Party to bear in mind the assault which was made on them at that time in order to get rid of them.  These two great Parties are not the friends of democracy. They would as much see the end of the Labour Party as they would of the Independent Deputies and our tiny group.  It is rather significant that 144 of you should combine together to take away the rights of two Deputies who have attempted to bring a new point of view into this old mausoleum over the years.  The next attempt so far as I was concerned, certainly as an Independent Deputy, was made by gerrymandering my constituency in the most absurd and outrageous way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not going to discuss it, either.  I mention it in passing as indicating a pattern which has evolved and is ending up here today when they are depriving us of having motions debated in our names, a practice which has gone on for the past 35 or 40 years.  Having failed to get rid of us by altering proportional representation and gerrymandering our constituencies, they now bring us in here to alter the whole pattern of behaviour in regard to the putting down of motions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> No case was made here at all that we were in any way irresponsible in regard to the time we took up in discussing motions we put down on the Order Paper from time to time. Many of the motions are there on the record to be seen.  The debate on them is there to be read.  The conclusions arrived at in relation to them were of great value and in some cases they resulted in the betterment of the general social and economic conditions in the country.</P>
    <P>It was arising out of a motion put down by us that a Commission was established in order to consider the position of the Irish language.  On a number of occasions, with Deputy McQuillan, I put down a motion concerning the provision of better health services.  I put such motions down again and again.  Finally, the main Opposition Party put down a similar motion.  A Select Committee of the House has now been established to consider the improvement of our health services.</P>
    <P>We put down a motion concerning the electoral system to the Seanad.  As a result, under the former Taoiseach, a commission was established.  It did not make any far-reaching changes&mdash; certainly it did not make the ones we suggested&mdash;but it was quite clear that we made a good case for some form of inquiry into the system of election to the Seanad that then pertained.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions, we put down motions concerning the appalling state of our educational system.  We gave facts for the consideration of the House and we made a case for the improvement of our educational system.  That was done long before people who are now professing an interest in education made their voices heard.  We welcome their interest now.  Presumably the motions which we put down were part of their education.</P>
    <P>However, long before these Deputies showed an interest in education, we were debating it in the Dáil and showing up the grave defects which then existed and which still exist in our educational system.  We have now reached the stage that there is general unanimity that grave defects exist in our educational system and we think <Col N="115" /> some changes will be made.  Those were valuable contributions by a tiny group of two in this House.</P>
    <P>We also had the satisfaction of putting down a motion concerning the price of flour and bread and the desirability of bringing the flour milling industry into public ownership.  We got the support of, I think, the whole House&mdash;certainly of the Opposition&mdash; on the desirability of considering the matter seriously.</P>
    <P>Private Members' Time, for the discussion of motions, was invaluable to us.  On another occasion, which I shall not develop, we had what might be termed the <i>Irish Press</i> affair.  I could not pursue that in the ordinary course of business by means of Parliamentary Question.  However, I was able to pursue it&mdash;in my view, to a satisfactory conclusion&mdash;by putting down a motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell the Deputy in a moment.  The Taoiseach certainly said: &ldquo;Put down a motion&rdquo; on some other issue.  He knows, quite rightly, that it was a wonderful facility that one could put down a motion.  It was a facility of great value.  There is obviously a deterioration in the situation as far as Deputy McQuillan and myself are concerned in our small Party.  I do not think there is any controverting that truth.</P>
      <P>We have seen a gradual attempt to restrict the right of small groups in this Parliament.  Deputy Dillon has many times suggested that he is a great believer in the idea of: &ldquo;I do not agree with your political views but I will go to the wall in defence of your right to express them.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me completely unfair that, in a Parliament <Col N="116" /> which operates under the system of proportional representation, small Parties should be put into this position. The system of proportional representation inevitably brings in a high proportion of Independent Deputies.  It permits the presence in the Dáil of small groups, such as our group, of two, three, four, or whatever it may be. That is the decision of the people. Within recent years, the people have given their decision that they desire to maintain the system of proportional representation.</P>
      <P>It may be very inconvenient to have people like us who do not toe the Party line, who do not accept the <i>diktat</i> of the Taoiseach or Deputy Dillon on any particular issue.  You are doing that within this House: you could not do it outside.  You are undermining the things you profess to believe in.  You are undermining the whole conception of Parliamentary democracy.  It is a particularly difficult system to operate: there is no doubt about that.  However, I do not know if anybody has yet discovered a more desirable one.  Admittedly, they have found more effective ones.</P>
      <P>We see, then, here in the House, the suppression of the minority point of view.  In the newspapers, in television and on the radio, the strictest censorship possible is maintained in regard to the expression of the nonconformist political point of view in this country. That censorship is operated right from the cradle to the grave.  It is operated right through the schools and, when they leave the schools, it is operated in the newspapers.  Now, it is most rigidly operated through the media of television and radio.</P>
      <P>You are closing the last peep hole that did exist&mdash;the political possibilities we put forward from time to time, which exist in other countries and which the Government and the main Opposition Party have so frequently attempted to suppress.  It is flattering to think that this is the only strategy left open to them.  I find it very comforting that you have no answer to the social, political and ideological views which I am prepared to put forward here in regard to the organisation of education or health services or the economy of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> If you had an easy answer, if you had a ready answer, if you could refute what I have to say&mdash;my charges, my conclusions&mdash;surely you would take every opportunity of getting up and doing so and in that way of silencing me?  It is a comfort to know that the things in which I believe cannot be refuted by anybody in this House in general terms.  Because of that, you have now taken this course.</P>
    <P>I come now to the decision about the seven members.  I have not discussed this with Deputy McQuillan but if it were altered to allow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;Fine Gael, Labour, ourselves, Independents in any group they desire, in rotation, I can see a lot could be said for it.  It is not our fault that we happen to be a small group. It has its drawbacks.  It is no great pleasure.  If one tries, as a small group, to cover the number of subjects contained in motions, it is obvious that, for two people, it is a very formidable job.  Consequently, it would be very pleasant to have 19 or 20 people in our group.  We do happen to have given a lot of thought over the years to these various subjects and because of that, we are clear in our minds what we should like to see done in relation to any one of them.</P>
      <P>Because of that, we do not need to debate this among ourselves as the big Parties presumably have to do. We cannot be blamed for that.  We believe therefore we have this right to use the facility of Private Members' Time.  It is only a very tiny part of all our Parliamentary time.  As Deputy Dunne said, the Government naturally have all the time they want and the major Opposition Party have clearly the right at any time to ask the Government for public time to debate something about which they are greatly concerned.  They are naturally unconcerned from our point of view with the division of Private Members' Time which was the only tiny part of Parliamentary time left to us in which to put forward our views.</P>

One of the points of proportional representation is that it does facilitate the emergence of Independents or small groups.  That is what the people want, and good luck to them.

Most Parties could have accepted them and I do not see why they did not put down motions such as these.  There was every opportunity and every right for them to do so. There must be some other way rather than wiping us out&mdash;that is what you are doing&mdash;as a political Party.  The right to put down motions has been taken away from us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I, as an Independent, look on this motion very differently from Dr. Browne.  I listened to Deputy Dunne who does not seem to understand what Deputies Browne and McQuillan are driving at.  Otherwise, I feel sure he would not support them. If the two Deputies were to get equal footing with the big Parties and if the seven Independent Deputies were to be treated, not as seven Parties but as one, then Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan could speak every three months, whereas Deputy Dunne would speak only every two years.  It amounts to that, so he would not agree at all.</P>
      <P>Here is the way it would work out. Fianna Fáil usually do not put down motions or, at least, the Party in power usually do not.  Fine Gael would put down a motion; the Labour Party would table a motion; and the two Deputies behind me would table a motion.  I would table a motion, but I could not table another motion for three years because the turn of the other six Independents would have come then, but all the time the two Deputies behind me could continue to table motions.  They could speak seven times more than the other Independents.  That would not suit Deputy Dunne.  We would oppose that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get it straight.  We did not initiate this proposal.  In fact, I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and, in that committee, I opposed it because I was asked to oppose it.  I opposed it only because I was asked to oppose it.  Personally, I agree with the proposal before the House.  I support it because I think it is fair.  I do not think the Deputies who are complaining have anything to complain about.  I do not think they will lose a lot of time.  Only two or three Independents put down motions <Col N="122" /> anyway.  There are four motions in the name of Deputy Dunne on the Order Paper and there is one motion in my name.  That is all, apart from the motions in the names of Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan. I am not fond of putting down motions.  I think many of them are nonsensical and only serve as a sort of publicity gimmick and when they appear on the Order Paper, they are forgotten about.</P>
    <P>I have a motion on the Order Paper &mdash;I think it is important&mdash;dealing with people who, I believe, should automatically get a proportionate increase when everyone else gets an increase in income.  That is important.  Several members of the Labour Party have supported the principle underlying that motion.  There are 11 motions on the Order Paper in front of me in the names of Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan.  I have been kept waiting a year and it looks as if I shall have to wait another year or 18 months, all because two people are hogging the agenda.</P>
    <P>Although I am making that statement, I did not initiate this proposal, nor did any other Independent.  If the two Deputies were to have their own way and be treated as a Party, each of us Independents could talk only about once every two years.  We will not agree with that.  As the proposal stands now, as I see it, the two Deputies will be able to speak every couple of months and the position will be that there will be a Fine Gael motion, a Labour Party motion, a motion probably put down by the two Deputies behind me, and then perhaps Deputy Dunne will put down a motion, and then the same thing again.  So, as I see it, every fifth motion will be put down by Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan.  As double time is being granted now, our turns will come up every two months while the House is sitting and we are in a position to discuss Private Members' Business.</P>
    <P>I think this proposal is fair to the other Independents.  I am not supporting it because I happen to vote for the Government.  That has nothing to do with it.  I am, I hope, orderly-minded, although some persons seem to <Col N="123" /> think I am not.  There was a situation on Dublin City Council two years ago &mdash;long before there was any question of voting for the Government&mdash;in which a member put down 15 motions.  The rest of us realised it would be six months or a year before we could talk. We immediately demanded an amendment of the Standing Orders and we have just completed it.  We have actually decided on something like what the House is now deciding on, because we believe it is fair.</P>
    <P>The proposal of Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan is dangerous to the rest of the Independents and I, as one, would not agree, nor would the others.  If Deputy Dunne were here, he would know what I am driving at because if these two Deputies got away with it, Deputy Dunne could speak only once every 12 months or two years.  He would not like that. For that reason, I think this proposal is fair.  I again want to emphasise the fact that I at no time objected to the time given to Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan.  Even if it was wasted time, I have never commented in any way.  I am now speaking my mind on this motion.  I support it.  I would not support Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan being treated as a Party unless each individual member of the Independents got the same rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not very often I agree with Deputy Dillon.  I think this is about the first time and it may, for all I know, be the last.  I must agree with him on this motion because it is a shocking state of affairs that any two Independents who take a dislike to everyone in the House should form a mixum-gatherum two-man Party and monopolise the time of the House.  That is the position at which we would actually have arrived unless some amendment, like this, were made to Standing Orders.  There is no use in codding.  I do not know what type of people in Irish life this alleged Party represent.  Certainly they do not represent any of the type of good. decent Christian people who live in the west of Ireland.  I do not think they are really representative of one-tenth <Col N="124" /> of one per cent. of the people of this country at all.</P>
      <P>Surely any fair-minded and sane-minded man must realise that the bigger the Party in the House, the more backing they have amongst the people because of the type of elections we have, and consequently the more time that Party should have in the House.  It would be just as easy for Deputy Sherwin and me to come together and start the same type of nonsense as has been carried on here since we came in today, if we formed a two-man Party.  There is nothing to stop, say, Deputy Barron and Deputy Dunne from forming the same type of Party.  I should like to know what advantage that type of system would be to the country.  It would be no advantage in the world.  There is no reason in the world why any two men in the House who are disgruntled should try to monopolise the time of the House.  I want to congratulate both the Government and the Opposition on making a concerted effort to put an end once and for all to the type of nonsense which I have seen going on here for the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>I know there is not much use in appealing to Deputies at this stage to hold their hand on this motion, but, even so, while the opportunity is available to me, I think it is only right that I should clarify one or two points made by the Leader of the Fine Gael Party before I deal with the wider issues involved in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon states specifically that this motion is not intended to prevent the N.P.D. utilising the Order <Col N="125" /> Paper and Private Members' Time during the period laid down.  I want to say quite categorically that it is the intention behind the motion.  This was planned outside this House and it was planned by a member of the Fine Gael Party who associated very closely with a very high opposite number in the Fianna Fáil Party, and they introduced the subject for discussion in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is an innocent in regard to thinking up this situation. He was presented with a <i>fait accompli</i> and I suppose it is up to him to be loyal to those under him who planned this political gagging of a minority in this House.  However, it has shattered once and for all any little confidence I had that Deputy Dillon was prepared, in his own words, &ldquo;to go to the wall&rdquo; in regard to defending the rights of what he described as the humblest Deputy.  I think that statement of Deputy Dillon's can no longer be quoted with any confidence by any member of his Party who may at any time in the future run foul of Deputy Dillon.</P>
    <P>This motion was introduced to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, a body which I have maintained was illegally constituted.  I was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for a number of years and while I was a member, I never forgot the occasion when the former Chief Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Ó Briain, introduced a motion for discussion by the Committee which would, if brought before this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a sinister build-up behind the whole idea of limiting the freedom of Deputies in this House.  As far as the motion is concerned, the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, the Taoiseach, did his utmost to have a Standing Order prepared for this House that would prevent a Deputy from raising in Private Members' Time a subject matter which could relate to CIE, the ESB, Bord na Móna or any other State or semi-State concern.  The argument put forward at the time was that the Minister has no responsibility for these Sate bodies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall pursue another line.  Deputy Dr. Browne gave one portion of the background to this. Deputies' memories are not so short that they cannot cast them back to an occasion during the last session of the House when a disciplinary motion was introduced increasing drastically the penalties for alleged transgressions of rulings by the Chair.  Now, the day that motion was brought in, it was intended that this motion was to be discussed as well.  The aim at the time was to prevent, in so far as it was possible, Independent Deputies and Deputies in small groups like the one to which Deputy Dr. Browne and I belong, from asking awkward or embarrassing supplementary questions at Question Time.  By restricting the rights of Deputies at Question Time, one avenue of criticism on behalf of the public was closed in this House.</P>
      <P>The second prong, shall we say, of the attack launched on this group was in connection with the motions. It has been suggested by some speakers that the Standing Orders which are in operation were good enough for the past 35 to 40 years as far as Private Members' Time was concerned. Suddenly this decision was taken by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges at the instigation of the Fine Gael representatives on that Committee, ardently backed by the Fianna Fáil representatives, because nothing suited them better than to have Fine Gael on this occasion doing the dirty work.  The idea was: &ldquo;We can gang up on this issue and close the mouths of these two.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was it done?  Because over a number of years, in a series of very important motions, we forced both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael into the one Division Lobby.  They hated the <Col N="129" /> idea of being shown up.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have played the old Party politics in this House so long that they felt that the motions which were introduced were likely to show the general public that there was no difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael; that the difference was that between Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  When on a number of motions both Parties had to come together and go into the same division lobby against a smaller group of Independents or Labour, it was significant that they were disturbed as far as their political safety was concerned and they felt that the public might say: &ldquo;There is very little difference between them.  Why do they not get into the one group once and for all?&rdquo; Motions put down by our small group were a definite political danger as far as the major Parties were concerned. Not that it made much difference in this House because the motions would not be carried, but when the public read that the views of both major Parties were similar, then it was a different matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to instance some of the situations in which the two major Parties decided in their own interests and in the interests of the country that they should come together.  There was a discussion here on the question of the United Nations sending representatives to the Six Counties to observe the situation there and to observe whether there was any great case to be made that the minority in the North were getting anything but a fair crack of the whip with regard to appointments and conditions generally. What happened that?  Both major Parties combined to oppose it and it was defeated by an overwhelming majority.  When it came to the abolition of that notorious Act of Parliament, the Offences Against the State Act, or even of getting a portion of it amended, there was again a line up by the two major Parties against the idea of any changes.  There was no difference whatever between them.</P>
    <P>When it came to a motion which a number of back benchers in both Parties agreed with&mdash;or should I say, supported &mdash; namely that in light of <Col N="130" /> modern developments in welfare, the present expenditure on defence equipment could be considered wasteful in large measure and that Dáil Éireann was of the opinion that a Select Committee of the House should be set up to examine into the question of national expenditure on defence generally, that motion was defeated by a combination of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  They did not want any stir or any thought, any new approach, in a matter of that nature.  When they were put together on a number of these issues, they were, as I said, embarrassed and wanted to make sure that this embarrassment would not occur as frequently in the future.</P>
    <P>That is only one point.  Over the years, rural Deputies will recall that the motions discussed in this House in connection with rural Ireland, moved by Deputy Browne and myself, were responsible for forcing the Government to change their policy to a considerable extent.  I want to bring home quite clearly the occasions when that happened.  Deputies on both sides will recall that the Local Authorities (Works) Act was suspended and Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party will recall that at their own county councils strong pressure was brought to bear on them to get the Government to restore the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  As far as rural Ireland was concerned, that Act brought untold benefit in the form of reclaimed land for small farmers.</P>

      <P>I will not deal with any of them in detail.  I will simply refer to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  When it came to a question of a division in the House the Minister intervened immediately in the debate and said that the Government's intention was to bring in an intermediate drainage scheme.  That came about because of the motion which had just been under discussion.  That was useful and I congratulate the Government on so doing.  There is no doubt that the intermediate drainage scheme &mdash;it has not yet come to my constituency&mdash;has done quite an amount of work in the constituency of the Parliamentary Secretary who sits so smugly opposite me.  He can thank that motion for helping his constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is even worse, because the Minister said that the first scheme of two rivers would be in Donegal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are both from Donegal.  The Parliamentary Secretary should switch over to the Minister's <Col N="132" /> constituency at that rate.  However, I will not pursue the idea of dealing with the motions concerned but I will get down to the motion on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>For the first time, we are getting in Standing Orders recognition of political Parties, although, as Deputy Dunne pointed out, there is no mention of political Parties in the Constitution. There may be in this House, for the purposes of prestige, some kind of arrangement that a Party with seven or more members is entitled to a Parliamentary allowance, but there is no recognition of political Parties either in Standing Orders or in the Constitution.  But, because the Parties found the figure of seven Deputies good enough in order to ensure they would have a good Parliamentary allowance for their own organisational work, they felt it would be desirable in determining what constituted a political Party to suggest there must be seven members in any Party to entitle it to put down a motion in Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour members on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided that a political Party must consist of seven before it can put down motions for discussion in Private Members' Time.  That is the decision that is to be forced through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us understand the arrogance of the Deputies of the two major Parties who have spoken. Let us examine this proposed Standing Order.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of this Standing Order a group shall mean any Party which had not less than seven <Col N="133" /> Members elected to the Dáil at the previous General Election.</P>
    <P>Let us decide X Party had seven Deputies at the previous general election, that two by-elections came, as they did in 1948, and took two seats from that group and gave them to another which already had six, giving them a total of eight.  They are still prevented by this Standing Order from putting down on the Order Paper a motion for discussion in the priority to which they are entitled.  Did these smart gentlemen who thought up this proposed Standing Order see the implications of the wishes of the public?  There is nothing to suggest that inside the next four years our small group of two could not get five more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more likely they would lose one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a subject for laughter.  I agree it is not likely, judging by the present situation; but it could happen.  I shall put it in a more reasonable way.  Suppose we had five or six Deputies in the NPD at present.  We are restricted under this motion from acting as a political Party, despite the fact we might win a seat or two seats in a by-election.  That is the arrogance shown by Deputy Dillon, who pretends he is interested in the rights of the humblest Deputy.  They were not even able to draft in a proper technical manner a motion to make it clear that the balance in regard to the number in Parties could be changed as a result of by-elections.  There has never been a session in the life of the Dáil in which, unfortunately, we did not lose members.  That never dawned on the gentlemen who sat down to prepare this.  They were too greedy in trying to get us out to see the implications of what they were doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think this proposed Standing Order should be considered by the House in any circumstances.  It flouts the wishes of the general public.  I want to ask you, Sir, as Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and also as Ceann Comhairle, what will be the position if a group of Deputies with six seats win a seat in a by-election from a group that already has seven?  Is this House <Col N="134" /> entitled to prevent the new group of seven of their rights, even though the public feel they are entitled to have them and have given them a new member?  Do we consider that the decision of the public is to be flouted without any excuse whatever?</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition was very anxious to suggest that time was a problem in relation to the Order Paper.  I have not forgotten, as Deputy Dillon conveniently forgets, that on two occasions during the last session, the major Opposition Party were given time for discussion of their motions.  Not alone is Deputy Dillon in a position to get Government time to discuss his motions, but he wants also to restrict the Order Paper so that his silent backbenchers can prevent us from getting our rights.  At no time has Deputy Dillon or the Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Corish, been refused by the Taoiseach, if they requested Government time for the discussion of their motions.  They can never say that Deputy Browne or Deputy McQuillan prevented their motions from being discussed.  Deputy Dillon had only to say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;On behalf of the biggest Opposition Party in this House, I suggest you make time available for the discussion of a motion in the name of Deputy So-and-So of my Party,&rdquo; and the Taoiseach replied that the Whips would consult, and two or three days later, possibly, a full day was given over to the discussion of that motion.  Having Government time at his disposal for the discussion of what he considers important motions, Deputy Dillon also wants to have Private Members' Time at the disposal of his backbenchers.  In so doing, he cuts off from us our rights to move motions on the Order Paper in our names.</P>
    <P>The list of motions I have before me ranges over a wide and varied field from flour distilling to the expansion of the whiskey industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What is &ldquo;flour distilling&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very sorry for a slip of the tongue&mdash;I meant the flour milling industry.  The other motion relates to the distilling industry. <Col N="135" /> There were two motions involved. I am very sorry for not making myself clearer to Deputy Dillon.  I want to make clear that all those motions now go off the Order Paper and there is not the slightest possibility that one of them can come up for discussion in our names in the lifetime of this Dáil which is entitled to run for another four years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision has been made by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and we are asked to support it, that a group of seven shall now constitute a political Party. Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Dillon and his comrades have decided that any group under the strength of seven cannot be described, or describe themselves, as a political Party.  I want to make it clear that in the last election I stood before the public, as did Deputy Dr. Browne, as a candidate for the National Progressive Democratic Party.  We are a small Party but we were elected as such, but we are now told here: &ldquo;You are not entitled to describe yourselves as a Party, even as a small minority Party, and this House is going to ensure that you will not be described as a Party.&rdquo;  Once we are not described as a Party, we are automatically precluded from getting our motions discussed as they should be discussed in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="136" /> That is the situation.  Deputy Dillon tries to suggest that we could join up with the Independents.  Deputy Dillon knows perfectly well that he went down the corridor and would not sit with the other Independents.  He was an Independent of Independents attached to Fine Gael.  He said: &ldquo;I would not sit in the same room as Deputy Cogan.&rdquo;  That is no reflection on the Deputy from Galway. Deputy Dillon at that stage would not consult with other Independents, unless they were under the same umbrella as himself.  How would Deputy Dillon feel if he had a motion for which he wanted Government time and if he had to consult Deputy Cogan or Deputy Jack Flynn?  I have no objection to Deputy Sherwin personally but he seems to have a strong political objection to me.  He is entitled to that but there is no possibility of Deputy Sherwin or what passes for a Deputy from Mayo behind me agreeing with me on a motion.  Is it not nonsensical to suggest that four or five Independents who represent policies or views poles apart are going to co-operate with Deputy Browne or myself in order to let our small group get motions on the Order Paper?</P>

They have thereby helped to remove from the Order Paper the motions which are in our name.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House except to appeal even at this late stage to Deputy Dillon to consider an alternative which I am going to put to him now and to the House.  We are prepared to take potluck with any other Deputy in respect of motions. When the House was set up, every Deputy had equal rights.  There was no consideration in the Constitution of major or minor political Parties. Deputies came in here to represent the views of certain people.  They may be terribly silly views, as Deputy Dillon suggests, but if he had any respect for democracy, he would say they were entitled to have their representatives in this House to express those views on their behalf.  That is what we are trying to keep going on in Private Members' Time.  That is what Deputy Dillon is trying to prevent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If the Deputy were genuine, he would accept my proposition, which is this, that every Deputy puts his motion into a drum from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Independents, Clann na Talmhan and NPD.  Specify the period inside the year in which Private Members' Time will be allowed and each Deputy who wants it, shall draw from that drum. If he is successful, the rights of that Deputy are protected.  I am prepared to do that, although as far as we are concerned it means that there will be <Col N="138" /> 40 Fine Gael fingers to dip in the drum.  Each Fine Gael Deputy has a right as an individual to a dip in the drum, whatever Deputy Dillon may say.  Deputy Dillon may feel that he has a maverick in the back benches with an awkward motion that may not suit him.  Fianna Fáil have had a few mavericks also putting down awkward motions here.  This would be a marvellous thing to stop Deputy Corry putting down a motion.  He can never again put down a motion on his own without the prior&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would urge at this stage that rather than have a decision taken immediately on the motion before us, the Parliamentary Secretary should request or urge the Taoiseach to postpone any further decision until my suggestion has been examined by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

On this Order Paper, the NPD, whatever they are &mdash;the people down the country do not know what they are&mdash;have eleven out of 29 motions, more than their share, if they think they are going to get away with it.  As far as I can see, they are a Party trying to create confusion in this House, as they are trying to do outside.  I do not know who the President of that Party is.  I do not know how they come to a decision, what their voting power is, who decides whether the Ceann Comhairle is brought into it or not.  I do not know.

Possibly they feel their launching pad is being taken away from them, like other launching pads have been taken away.</P>

At least two Deputies refuse to accept the proper interpretation of what the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is seeking to do here.  Under the Standing Orders of this House, there is the right of every Deputy to put down on the Order Paper as many motions as he likes.  That is in Standing Orders now.  There is no question whatever of changing that in the proposed new Standing Order.  Every Deputy can have on the Order Paper as many motions as he likes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that has been ignored by at least two Deputies here, either deliberately or otherwise.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges had a number of things they could have done.  They could, as already suggested, do what is done in Britain, draw them out of a hat.  That could operate to exclude completely some Deputies particularly Independents. They might never get one of their motions brought, whereas in a draw system a large Party has a very good chance of getting one of its motions taken.  On discussion, the Committee decided against that system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present system, the method operated is that the motions in first must be taken first.  No matter how an individual or Party may try to abuse that system, that can be counteracted by another system which will exclude them effectively also.  For instance, the day a Deputy is elected to the Dáil, he may rush to Leinster House and put down 100 motions on the Order Paper in order to monopolise Private Members' Time for years ahead.  A member of another Party can get in behind him and put down 600 motions and make sure he never gets another opportunity when his motions are finished with.  That is absolute chaos and a ridiculous situation and that is the one covered by Standing Orders at present.  That is how it is laid down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a single Standing Order in that book that cannot be frustrated or abused by an unreasonable Deputy. That it has not been done in 40 years is due to the fact that people used common sense.  There is not a single order in the book which cannot be abused if a Deputy wants to abuse it and we have seen it done&mdash;not too often.  Here is one instance where it can be done.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is as representative of this Dáil as it is humanly possible for that Committee to be.  The Committee, in their wisdom, decided on what is the nearest thing to an ideal solution.  We do not deem it to be perfect.  At least we devised a system.  That was not done by any particular Party or member.  It was discussed openly by the Committee and unanimously decided.  The Committee decided on a system whereby every individual in the House will have an equal chance to have a motion discussed in Private Members' Time.  I do not see what anybody can find wrong with that.  They could have done much worse if they wanted really to be unfair.  They could take the members as individuals and operate the same rotation.</P>

The system we are operating ensures you will get only your turn and no Deputy is entitled to anything more.  That is exactly what the new Standing Order means and the two Deputies of the NPD have spent the past three years trying to use this Dáil to tell people that they are of so great importance that 144 Deputies are afraid of them.  They are not afraid of them but they will not allow them to abuse the privileges set down in Standing Orders.  That is the common sense of it.</P>

      <P>In his turn.  That is the mechanics of it.  Under the present system, the first motion on the Order Paper is taken.  If Deputy Dunne had 25 motions on the Order Paper, his 25 would have to be taken before Deputy Sherwin's would be reached.  The present system starts off giving the advantage to the large Party.  It is only from the beginning, remember, that the advantage operates. The largest Party has the advantage from the start.  Now the first motion should be a Fianna Fáil motion, but the Government never table a motion.  Fine Gael is the next largest Party.  A motion is allowed three hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was explaining that when I was rudely interrupted by the Deputy who does not want to be informed.  If no member of the Government Party tables a motion on the Order Paper, then the first motion called will be a Fine Gael motion, because it is the largest Opposition Party.  When that motion has been discussed, a Labour Party motion will be called.  There is complete freedom of choice.  Even if a Deputy tables a dozen motions, he can choose the one he wishes to have discussed.  The next group is the Independents.  They can decide among themselves whose turn it is to have a motion discussed.</P>

      <P>Let us take the position now of the two Deputies who want to be described as a Party.  We have two Clann na Talmhan Deputies in the House.  We have one Clann na Poblachta.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to provide additional money for vocational education throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fundamental characteristic of the vocational education system in this country is its local basis.  It is administered by committees who are appointed by the local rating authorities and a fair share of the money for vocational education comes from the local rates.  On the whole, this local aspect of the system is very satisfactory. I think that Deputies on all sides of this House recognise, as the Irish people generally recognise, that achievements of vocational education committees throughout the country in meeting the educational needs of the people, have been very great.  Each year for the past thirty years, Ministers for Education have been coming before the Dáil and, in introducing the estimates for the Department, have given an account of continual expansion in vocational education&mdash;increases in the number of schools and the <Col N="147" /> number of pupils, a growing variety of courses and classes and strengthening links between vocational education and the cultural, social and economic life of the people.  I do not think it necessary for me, at this stage, to quote statistics to illustrate these developments although I have plenty of figures if Deputies wish to hear them.</P>
    <P>Although the work which has been done already or which is at present being done in the vocational schools is very considerable, substantial demands will be made on the schools in the future in support of the great effort we must make to develop all the intellectual talents of our people and to perfect our artistic ability and manual skill.  On this great effort, and on the manner in which we make it, depends the success and prosperity of the nation.  All our resources in every sphere of the national life must be harnessed to achieve the maximum possible results.</P>
    <P>In particular, we must rely to a very great extent on educational development.  This country is not very rich in raw material for industry and, therefore, we must utilise to the full and in the most fruitful manner the best material any country could have, i.e., the intellect and skill of its people. The work of the schools, particularly that of the vocational schools, will need to be improved and extended to achieve this and this cannot be done without expending more money.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as I have already said, the Chief purpose of this Bill is to increase the financial provision for vocational education.</P>
    <P>As the law stands at present, the income which vocational education committees may receive from the local rates can not exceed in the great majority of cases, the income from a rate of 15d. in the £1; a maximum rate of 18d. in the £1 is permissible, however, for a small number of committees. It is now necessary that more money should be available to vocational education committees from the rates, because of the expansion of vocational education since these limits of rate income were fixed nine years ago and <Col N="148" /> because of the great increase in costs, especially in salaries of teachers and other officers.  Many committees have reached the maximum limit already and some of those committees are to some extent in debt.  Therefore, Section 2 of the Bill provides for a maximum rate of twenty four pence for each vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>It should not be thought, of course, that it is proposed in this Bill to authorise Committees to get an immediate increase of ninepence or sixpence in the pound.  As the law stands at present, a vocational education committee can demand in respect of any year an increase of one penny on the rate which they received in the previous year and the rating authority is obliged to accede to such demand. No change is proposed in that respect: that is to say, there is no provision in the Bill which would compel a rating authority to grant an increase exceeding one penny in the pound in the rate for vocational educational from one year to the next.</P>
    <P>However, existing legislation permits a rating authority to grant of its own accord, and subject to an application from a committee, an increase in the rate for vocational education in any year of more than one penny but not more than twopence in the pound over the rate paid in the previous year. Provision is made in Section 3 of this Bill to enable a rating authority to grant an increase in the rate for vocational education in any year not exceeding threepence in the pound over the rate paid in the previous year.  I should like to emphasise that no rating authority is being compelled to grant an increase in excess of one penny per annum in the rate for vocational education, but where a committee seeks an increase of more than one penny, but not exceeding threepence, the rating authority will be permitted to grant such increase subject to a specific resolution being passed.</P>
    <P>I also wish to offer an explanation of Section 4.  In the principal Act&mdash;the Vocational Education Act, 1930&mdash;it is stated (in Section 2)&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;rateable value&rdquo; means the annual rateable value under the Valuation Acts&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="149" /> For the past thirty years, this has been interpreted as meaning that a rate of one penny in the pound (in so far as vocational education was concerned) was equivalent to the income which a penny in every pound of the gross valuation of a rateable area would produce.  For example, if the schedule of valuation gave a figure of £100,000 for a particular area in a particular year, the vocational education committee would get 100,000 pennies in respect of each penny rate available for vocational education.  Certain rating authorities have recently challenged this interpretation and have claimed that the value of the penny rate should be calculated on the figure of valuation on which rates are collectable.  I understand that the question could not be determined except by submitting it to the courts, or alternatively, by clarifying the law. It appeared to me that the occasion of submitting a Vocational Education Bill to the Oireachtas was an opportune time to remove all possible doubts in this matter.  As I have said, every Government and every rating authority were satisfied for thirty years that no doubt existed as to the meaning of the value of a penny rate, but since certain rating authorities have now cast doubts on that meaning, it is opportune and desirable that the doubt should be resolved.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 5, this merely provides that the provisions governing the payment of travelling and maintenance expenses to members of county vocational education committees shall be on the same basis as provisions in other legislation concerning similar payments to members of County Councils, members of joint mental hospital boards and members of county Committees of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>I ask the agreement of the Dáil to this Bill.  It will, of course, result in an increase in the grants paid by the State to vocational education committees because these grants are determined in relation to committees' income from local rates.  I am aware from what Deputies on all sides of the House said during the debate on the Department's estimates earlier in the year, that the Dáil recognises that <Col N="150" /> more money must be spent on education. It pleases me that the Dáil should hold this view because I myself firmly believe that money spent on education is a gilt-edged investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill can be divided into three sections.  The first section provides for an increased contribution from local authority vocational education committees and the second part&mdash;Section 4&mdash;clarifies the position so far as rateable value is concerned.  The third part of the Bill permits vocational education members to receive increased travelling and subsistence allowances.</P>
      <P>We in Fine Gael welcome the expenditure of more moneys on vocational education but it is contrary to the policy of Fine Gael to ask the ratepayers to make this extra contribution. Fine Gael have already announced their policy.  We are anxious to reduce and to stabilise the rates.  We think we have reached the limit of taxation so far as rates are concerned.  In my county, we pay over 52s. in the £ poor rates.  If we are to add another 9d., we shall increase the burden on the ratepayer and on the small farmer.</P>
      <P>It should be the aim and the duty of all members of this House to reduce local rates.  That is the declared policy of Fine Gael.  At the same time, we want to see more money spent on vocational education but we think it should come from central funds.</P>
      <P>It is a long time since the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1930 introduced what is described in this Bill as the Principal Act.  It was the Act on which vocational education was founded.  We have gone a long way since then in advances in vocational education.  In those days, the principal idea of vocational education was to train girls in domestic economy.  From that, we developed commercial classes, carpentry classes and now we have gone a long way in other technical classes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vocational education is one of the primary methods of education which we should push forward but we are no longer catering for employment in local areas.  The education which is <Col N="151" /> now given by vocational schools will benefit the country as a whole.  Many technical subjects are taught in our vocational schools.  The recipients of this knowledge will not be employed in the local authority area in which they receive their education.  Their education, their know-how, will be of benefit to the nation as a whole.  The nation as a whole should, therefore, contribute any increases which are necessary to provide schools, teachers and others to promote vocational or technical education.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister will possibly say that central funds are contributed but why should the contribution of central funds depend on the amount contributed by the local authority?  That is wrong and it is something which we deplore.  We agree with the Minister that more vocational schools are required.  I think that, in the new era which we anticipate if we enter the Common Market, the technical school and the university will play a very prominent part because technicians will be essential in any industry, be it agriculture or any other industry on which the State may depend.</P>
    <P>I should like to see some of our technical schools devoted to the promotion of the fishing industry.  In the old days of the Congested Districts Board in this country, we had net factories, marine engineering classes, navigation classes.  Many similar and kindred subjects were also taught by the old Congested Districts Board. One, in particular, was the trade of cooper, something which is now no longer taught in any of our technical schools, and apprenticeship to the coopers' union is a closed shop.  The ordinary individual living on the seaboard who is anxious to become apprenticed to the cooper trade or occupation no longer has a chance to acquire the preliminary knowledge necessary to become an apprentice.  If the Minister could concentrate, in conjunction with his colleague, the Minister for Fisheries, on promoting technical knowledge which would be of assistance in expanding the fishing industry, he would be doing a very good thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> A school was recently set up in Galway.  That was highly desirable but we should not be satisfied with one such school.  One of the premier fishing ports in this country is Killybegs and I should like to see set up there a technical school wherein prospective fishermen would be taught the art of net making and net mending, marine engineering and elementary navigation, with particular reference to modern amenities such as radar and the other facilities.</P>
    <P>I should like to see coopering taught in such a school.  The building is procurable in Killybegs in a location which is ideal; the personnel are there; the potential pupils are there; the fishing fleet is there.  I would therefore appeal to the Minister to meet the wishes of the Donegal Vocational Education Committee for the benefit of fishermen and those generally engaged in the industry, not only in Donegal, but in Mayo, Sligo and other western counties.</P>
    <P>While I agree that the school in Galway is ideally situated, unfortunately it is too remote from the real fishing centres.  I understand that in the very near future representations will be made to the Minister to have more money made available to the Donegal Vocational Education Committee for the purpose of establishing a technical school on the lines I have suggested in Killybegs and I sincerely hope he will see his way to accede to that request.</P>
    <P>With regard to Part II of the Bill, the Minister is endeavouring to define rateable valuation.  I was unaware of the fact that some local authorities dispute what has been accepted down through the years as the fund from which they would make their local contributions of so much in the £, whatever it might be.  Rateable valuation, I thought, was something clearly defined in many Acts of Parliament. On the gross rateable valuation of the local authority, it was a percentage in the £ of the actual rate collected, but if the Minister felt there was any doubt about the matter, I think he was quite justified in clarifying it in this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with travelling expenses of those members of subcommittees <Col N="153" /> who reside less than five miles from the locus of the particular meeting of a committee.  I think it is but right that if a man or a woman is willing to spend his or her time on committees such as those dealing with vocational education, they should be paid reasonable out of pocket expenses and I welcome that section of the Bill which increases the amount to which such committee members are entitled.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is something we have treated very lightly in the past.  When it comes to primary education, the State provides 100 per cent, of the salaries of teaching staffs. When it comes to the erection of primary schools, the States provide practically 75 per cent. of the outlay &mdash;in some cases, as high as 95 per cent. In the erection of secondary schools. the State in certain areas gives substantial grants towards the work and contributes very largely indeed towards the salaries of the staffs in these schools.  But when we come to this most important branch of education, vocational training, the State demands from the local authority a very big contribution.  They say to the local authority : &ldquo;Look; we are giving you as much, proportionately, as you must provide.&rdquo;  That is very unfair, particularly in the case of poor counties such as Donegal, Kerry and others on the western seaboard where the rates exceed £2 or £2 10s. in the £.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to hold the gun to the heads of such local authorities and say : &ldquo;The amount of the State grant is proportionate to what you will put up yourselves.&rdquo;  The Minister should reconsider that and he and his colleagues in the Government should have another look at this most important branch of our educational system and decide to make a higher proportionate grant from State funds for the advancement of vocational education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party welcome this Bill as we do any measure which improves our educational facilities, which increases the amount of our investment in education. This Bill increases the amount which local authorities may spend on vocational education to 24 pence in <Col N="154" /> the £.  In previous measures of this kind, there was a certain discretion allowed to local authorities in respect of the amount in the £ they were allowed to spend on vocational education. We note that in this Bill it is a flat amount of 24 pence in the £.  I should like to know from the Minister if, as it appears to us, this will give to some counties more money for vocational education and will mean less to others.</P>
      <P>Will it mean that if there is a higher valuation in one county, there will be a greater amount of money available there for vocational education?  There is no denying the demand throughout the country for more vocational schools and for a wider range of subjects in existing and new schools.  The demand is increasing daily with the expansion of industry and the development of new types of industry.  At the moment we have to provide people in these schools not only to fill the jobs that exist already, but to fill the jobs that will crop up in the future.  When we consider the percentage of our children between 15 and 19 years of age who get any form of education, and when we consider that it is far below that of other countries, we realise the amount of work which must be done before we can satisfy ourselves that the need is met.  Also, with the coming of the new Apprenticeship Act bottlenecks will arise in vocational schools.  I hope the Minister will take steps to provide more schools in towns and villages throughout the country to give each young boy and girl, whether living in a remote country place or a large town, an equal opportunity of being apprenticed to some trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party also welcome Section 5 which gives certain allowances to members of committees who live within a five mile radius of a meeting.  We believe that no public representative, or no person who goes to those committee meetings, should be at a financial loss by reason of doing so.  If people suffer a financial loss because of attending such meetings, we will find ourselves deprived of the views of people who cannot afford such a loss, in setting out the policies of the various committees. <Col N="155" /> We also welcome that provision.  I should like again to congratulate the Minister.  Even if it is a small measure, it is definitely a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I have listened to Deputy O'Donnell speaking about transferring the extra cost to the Central Fund.  I have heard that argument put forward on on a few occasions.  I do not think it would be a very feasible method of approach because it would mean that the man with the large family of, say, ten, would have to pay ten times as much as the wealthy bachelor living on a big farm of land, to provide money for education.  The fact that vocational education is not freely available to all our citizens means that the local rates have some contribution to make. The majority of the vocational education committees I know are composed of reasonable people.  Naturally they fight as hard as they can to get plenty from the Central Fund but we all know that the extra money for that fund comes from extra taxation.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to say if the grants are uniform in all counties. In my county, we feel that Deputy O'Donnell's constituency gets a bigger percentage of grants than we get in Cavan.  We are in no way jealous as there may be various reasons for that, but it takes from the arguments he has put forward that the money should come from the Central Fund because, so far as I know, they are getting a fairly good slice already up there and the Central Fund is no fairy godmother who can provide money by waving a wand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money spent on education is a very <Col N="156" /> sound investment for any nation.  This matter of vocational education is something new.  It has been in existence over a span of 30 years only.  During that time, it has made colossal strides, despite the fact that people had to be more or less educated to what it meant and, secondly, because there was no system of compulsion to compel people to attend vocational schools.  It is all voluntary on their part and the results are very creditable indeed.</P>
    <P>It is, indeed, encouraging to any Government and any local authority, to spend money on vocational education when they see that the demand is there.  It is the duty of the vocational committee and the Government to give those people who would try to attend if it were at all possible a chance of attending a vocational school.  It would be grand if we were in such a healthy financial position that we could provide free education up to the top out of the Central Fund for everyone, but we must be reasonable and sensible and use our limited resources to the best of our ability.</P>
    <P>Vocational education has proved its worth and it is only in its infancy.  I should like to see&mdash;and the Minister may have it in mind&mdash;a system under which there would be a smooth change over from the national school to the vocational school or the secondary school, and right on to the top without any overlap.  By virtue of the fact that the national schools are under the managerial system and the vocational and secondary schools are under other bodies, it is not easy to handle this problem, much as one might like to. If it were possible to do anything in that line, it would be an advance.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of this Bill.  It provides extra money and it will help, I hope, to induce vocational committees to try to cope in some way with the problem of bringing vocational education to all parts of the nation.  I know it is a difficult job.  If money were handed out <i>ad lib.</i> schools might be built where they were not required, but by continuing this method some consideration might be given to having a central school in each county in which people who have finished two or three years at the vocational <Col N="157" /> school can go further.  One of the factors that has more or less hampered a real advance in vocational education for quite a number of years is the fact that there did not seem to be any proper outlet for those who had vocational education.  That has been remedied and we can congratulate ourselves, the vocational committees, the teachers in general, and all others who have worked in this great effort at raising the standard of education of the ordinary people of the country.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to reconsider the financial aspects of this Bill.  Everyone agrees that vocational education is essential and must be provided.  Everyone also agrees that it is now an accepted principle in Northern Ireland and in Britain that the Central Fund is responsible for the greatest portion of education.  The Minister and the Government made a great deal of ballyhoo about the reduction in the rates by an increase in the grants a short time ago.  It was very welcome and it was evidence that the Government were convinced that the burden of the rates then was excessive on the agricultural community, but with the next move, what has been given will be taken back.  In Northern Ireland, there is complete derating of agricultural land so that even if vocational education were a 50 per cent. charge on the rates, the farmers would not have to pay anything.  The same thing applies in Britain, but we have no such thing here.  As Deputy O'Donnell has pointed out in relation to Donegal, which is beside the Six Counties, there is complete derating of agricultural land at Strabane and at Lifford the rate is 52/- in the £, less the agricultural grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government say we must face up to the situation created by the Common Market, that we have this and we have that to do.  That is true. There must be technical training and the necessary education must be provided. However, I submit that in these circumstances that is a national charge and that the Government, if they intend to retain the present levy on the rates, should stabilise it at that and <Col N="158" /> that whatever increase is necessary should be a charge on central funds.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is an essential service.  It serves a great need and is of material benefit.  It is of material benefit through the ordinary classes for domestic economy, woodwork and so on.  Before I became a blacksmith, I served two years in a vocational school training as a carpenter.  I suppose I would make a bad carpenter but at least I am able to put a pane of glass in a window.  Such a class gives the boy who attends it a skill in his hand and that is very important, no matter what part he plays in life afterwards.</P>
    <P>There is one other comment I should like to make.  I am very much afraid of this rule relating to expenses, that a person must be outside the five-mile limit in order to get his expenses.  As sure as there are little apples, half the committees of the country will be appointed from outside the five-mile limit and fit and proper people within the five-mile limit will be excluded.  I suggest to the Minister he should simply say that expenses will be paid and that if a person who is resident in the town or within the five-mile limit claims expenses, he will not be denied them.  They will be small, of course. This idea of the five-mile limit is not a sound principle because the unfortunate situation will arise that everybody from the town in which the committee is being held, whether it is a priest, a person or some other townsman, will be excluded and somebody who will be making something out of it will be appointed.  I regret to say that is the temptation and I believe it should be avoided.  We should not put a premium on this type of work.</P>
    <P>In Longford, a penny in the £ brings in approximately £600 or £700&mdash;hardly as much as that.  It is a very serious matter when it is considered that 9d. today is one-fifth of the total rate in 1932, that in 1932 our rates in Longford were 3/4d. in the £ and that we are now without any hesitation bringing in a further increase of 9d. on a rate of 44/- or 45/- in the £.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the whole financial structure of the Bill.  I agree that vocational <Col N="159" /> education is necessary but the State should undertake the financial responsibility for whatever increases are necessary for schools, teachers and everything else.</P>

      <P>I welcome this proposal to increase the grants to vocational schools.  The aspect I do not welcome is the snag of increasing the demand on local authority.  I would appeal for greater consideration from the Minister.  The vocational school plays an important role in the economy of this State and the Minister should consider on its merits the question of increasing the grants still further.</P>
      <P>There is a continual demand for courses in technology in the city of Galway vocational school.  With the coming of the Common Market, such courses are very important in order to gear ourselves for whatever repercussions there may be.  I am a member of that vocational school committee and we find ourselves in a very peculiar position.  We provide classes for children from outside the town. On several occasions, we appealed to the county council to meet the extra costs due to the attendance of an increased number of children.  There is a greater case now for a larger contribution from central funds.  We also provide classes for fishing trainees, being the only school in Ireland to do so.  These trainees come from all over the country.  Over the past two years, we have sent out a great number of personnel to take charge of the fishing fleets that are playing an important part in the economy of our country. Were we to close down tomorrow morning, the Minister would find himself running around the country looking for another place.  I do not hold with Deputy O'Donnell who says it is too remote from his area.  It may be a bit remote but it is centrally situated between Donegal and Kerry.  The Minister should appreciate the part they are playing and consider giving increased grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which we should bear in mind on this question of vocational education is that hand in hand with it goes the great need for guidance in careers.  It is a very important aspect <Col N="160" /> which would prevent, if I may say so, the square plug being put in the round hole and it is a matter to which the Department should give their immediate attention.  I should like to take the opportunity of complimenting Independent Newspapers Ltd. on the very important series of articles on careers which they are presenting at the moment.  I hope they will consider putting the series in book form as they will be very important for future reference by parents.  Possibly the Department might take it as a text book in conjunction with some steps they may take in that respect.  The Minister should take up this aspect of the matter right away because we have too many square plugs in round holes, or friends of friends getting into jobs they are not fitted for.  Because of their pull, we have to some degree the position that men are not fitted for the position they hold.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá ar an mBille seo.  Money spent on education is money well spent and the vocational continuation of education is for the majority of our children.  Not all of them go to secondary schools and for those who do not go to secondary schools, it is necessary to have continuation education in the vocational schools.  As many as possible of those schools should be in every county in this part of the country.  It is very necessary, for, after all, under the Apprenticeship Act which will come into force on 1st April next year, it will be necessary for any boy being apprenticed to have the group certificate of the vocational school or the Intermediate Certificate. As far as that goes, the group certificate for the boy being apprenticed to a trade is more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the matter of raising money for the schools, the Government provides in the proportion of two to one.  I do not think that any vocational education committee, any county council, or borough council, would object to paying money to give boys and girls of their own area an opportunity to have some training in a skill which is very necessary.  Prior to 1922 and for a few years afterwards, there were very few technical schools <Col N="161" /> and the result was that unless a person lived in a city or near a city, he had no chance of getting a technical training. The position has improved considerably and I hope it will improve more in the future in order that our boys, particularly, will be equipped with some skill and will be an advantage to their country and enabled to build up their country.  If it is necessary for them to emigrate, they will have some skill and not always be carrying the hod as they have done and as our people have done for the past 100 years, building up other countries under poor circumstances without any skill whatever.  Our pupils are as bright and as able as the pupils of any other country and I do not see why we would not give them the opportunity to learn.  As I say, money spent on education is money well spent.</P>
    <P>Another matter I should like to mention is rating.  We had a difficulty with the Dublin Corporation.  The manager said that the amount should be levied on the net collected rather than the gross.  On making inquiries, I found that quite a number of properties have a set valuation but not the full amount is collected from those properties.  Nevertheless, the Corporation is asked to pay on the full amount of the valuation as if they collected all the money, which means that if there is a rate of 1/6 in the £, the Corporation must put on another 1d or 2d in order to have the full amount to be given to the vocational education committee.</P>
    <P>It might be well if some arrangement were made whereby the Corporation would know the exact amount they are asked to pay.  If they are asked to pay 1/6d., let it be 1/6d.; if they are asked to pay 1/9d., let it be 1/9d.  Something should be done in that matter.  A Deputy referred to the college in Galway and he is looking for a higher subvention.  Here in Dublin we have four or five colleges of technology.  We have Bolton Street, which has just been completed and we have Kevin Street, which will be built in the course of the next few years.  They have started on it already.  We have the School of Commerce in Rathmines and we have the college in Cathal Brugha Street <Col N="162" /> where domestic science teachers are trained.  We have also Parnell Square and we have a school in Ringsend where teachers are trained by the Department at present.</P>

I am referring to the colleges of technology which are to be built.  We hope that in the near future we will have a college of commerce to replace the one in Rathmines.  I appeal to the Minister that in such cases we should get a higher subvention towards the capital cost of those colleges.  Not alone have we students from the city but we also have students from the country areas. ESB apprentices and others from different parts of the country get their education in these colleges.  It is only fair therefore to ask for a higher subvention from the Government, particularly to meet capital costs.  I would ask the Minister therefore to consider that matter seriously because it would be unfair to saddle the ratepayers of Dublin with the full amount.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say something on the use of vocational schools.  In several parts of the country, there are no secondary schools and bright children in those areas find themselves unable to take up positions. Until such time as secondary schools are provided in those areas, it should be possible to use the vocational schools as secondary schools also, so that if these children did not want to go to the vocational school, they could have a secondary education.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on the Bill and to pay a tribute to the teaching staffs of the vocational schools in Dublin on the manner in which they carry out their duties.  They are dedicated people, providing a wonderful education for many of our citizens.  I should like to join with the previous speaker in appealing to the Minister for Local Government to have a second look at the position of vocational <Col N="163" /> education in Dublin.  The Bill, as it stands, makes it permissive for a local authority to spend up to 2/- in the £ in the rates for vocational education. Dublin Corporation expenditure is at approximately that level at present, and with the commitments ahead of the Dublin City Vocational Committee, the figure is bound to be exceeded in the near future.  There is vast capital expenditure and a consequent expenditure on providing equipment and staff to meet the demand for this service, particularly from the expanding outlying areas.  I know the Minister is sympathetic to this appeal and I feel sure that in his reply he will try to meet the point.  In a sense, Dublin city is at a disadvantage because it has reached the maximum and will exceed it in the future.</P>

Tá súil agam go bhféachfaidh sé isteach san taobh sin den cheist.</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to provide for the future growth of vocational education.  There is an aspect of education I referred to here previously on the Minister's main Estimate. There will be a continuing necessity here for many years to come for expansion of opportunity for the young people to obtain vocational education, particularly in the context in which we now find ourselves here where we face the probability of entering into the European Community. Therefore it is more than ever necessary that in regard to education we should take cognisance of the allimportant part vocational education will have to play in the lives of the people in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as primary education is concerned, it fits the children of the <Col N="164" /> nation to avail of the further education which is to be available to them.  We are not so far able to provide for the community the necessary university education for the number of people who could avail of it.  Speaking here previously on the Vote for the Department of Education, I mentioned that I thought it was necessary&mdash;and I still hold the view strongly&mdash;that quite a large number of our secondary pupils, having done the Leaving Certificate, should then move on to vocational education and particularly to the higher technical aspects of education. In the rural areas, this would be dependent, in the main, on the provision of vocational schools.</P>
    <P>Speaking for my own constituency, I am well aware of the efforts which the vocational committee are making to meet the demand for schools in various parts of the county.  Of course, their efforts in that respect are hampered by the amount of money at their disposal.  Reading this Bill, one aspect strikes one very forcibly.  The section of the Bill which obliges a rating authority to provide a certain rate for education is, I think, the kernel of the whole situation.  Everybody may be well disposed to the provision of education, but I think the stage was reached this year when it was found necessary by this House to make extra provision to relieve the local authorities from some of the burden.  When the demands of vocational education are made in the future, will the rating authorities be disposed to provide the money so necessary to provide this important type of education?</P>
    <P>Although it is an established principle that every child in the nation is entitled to equality in regard to education, we find that in the local areas that does not pertain.  It is a practical difficulty that has to be got over because of the lack of schools.  This lack depends on the amount of money at the disposal of the local committees and I suggest that if we are to proceed at the pace at which we should proceed to meet the challenge of the present and the coming time, we should be prepared to invest capital in providing these schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> If as the Minister rightly said tonight, substantial demands will be made on schools in the future in support of the great effort which we must make and also if it is true that the best materials any country has are the intellect and skill of its people, I suggest to him that the present generation, or even the school-going generation after this, will still be denied the opportunity they are entitled to because schools will not be available for them. It is in that context that I suggest there is a greater need for the provision of funds from the central authority.  I do not doubt the local authority would provide these over a period of years but it is because of the urgent necessity to meet the needs of the times in which we live that we should go ahead and provide hand-in-hand with the expanded programme in regard to primary schools, more vocational schools at convenient centres in the country.</P>
    <P>Taking the rate of a penny in the £, so far as my constituency is concerned, I believe&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;its produce would be approximately £2,000 on the valuation.  Even if we were to multiply that by three, it would mean that even an increase of threepence in the £ would not provide the price of one extra vocational school in the country in any one year. The Minister has a great amount of goodwill in regard to education and from that point of view, I suggest most earnestly to him that in assisting vocational committees in the future and bearing in mind the fact that the local community through the rates cannot afford to speed up the development and provision of schools as quickly as it is necessary, the Minister should again look at this matter, with a view towards providing what Deputy Barron referred to, the capital cost of the buildings involved in making available this necessary type of education.</P>
    <P>This State is young in the matter of vocational education and has not been able to provide itself with all the schools necessary, but it is apparent, through the growth of education, that our people are eager to avail of the opportunities provided.  The increased numbers in primary and secondary <Col N="166" /> schools and in universities bear witness to the growing appreciation of education. Our universities have been benefiting the world at large through the efforts of their graduates abroad. In vocational education, we are about to face the challenge of Europe and it is in that respect that the people now growing up will need adequate training, if they are to use their skills to the best advantage of the nation.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to urge the Government to provide money outside and beyond what can be raised from the rates.  What can be raised from the rates will be necessary for the payment of teachers if we are to achieve an increased tempo in vocational education but in the case of the capital sums necessary to provide schools, if we are to wait on subventions available from rates plus grants from normal sources, I am afraid the rate of progress will not be quick enough to measure up to the kind of effort so necessary in this age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We are certainly reminded that the holidays are over. This Bill will enable the committees to proceed faster with the erection of schools and the provision of more and more varied classes.  On the question of building, I, at least, find that the technical schools that are being erected, although very fine buildings and a credit to the committees and architects, are much too expensive.  A greater number of schools could be built with the same amount of money.  I do not think engineering rooms should be as elaborate as those provided in some vocational schools.  Engineering classes are of such a character that a schoolroom should be specially designed for them and could be much cheaper than, say, rooms for commercial subjects.  I feel some committees are making that and <Col N="167" /> other mistakes in providing very elaborate rooms for classes which do not require such very fine work.</P>
      <P>Our committee in Donegal have had to push the Department to provide engineering classes in some of the schools, when new schools are provided. In some cases the Department have agreed that we were right; in other cases, although we pressed for the provision of engineering classrooms, the Department would not give way.  There is no vocational school being erected in any district which does not require an engineering classroom. In view of the increased use of agricultural machinery, it is necessary that even the most remote rural technical school should have an engineering classroom.  I would therefore urge the Minister to ensure that such engineering classrooms will be attached to each vocational school being erected in rural Ireland.  As I have said, these classrooms need not be very elaborate. Something less expensive than those which have been built up to the present would suffice.</P>
      <P>I would also suggest to the Minister that there should be a central technical school or college in each county, or perhaps in some of the larger counties. There are many pupils who, having done a three years course at the vocational school, would like to take more advanced courses.  Under the present system, they can do so only by attending the Bolton Street Technical Institute in Dublin.  That is not feasible in many cases.  I would press for the provision in each county of one or two advanced technical schools to cater for pupils anxious to proceed to higher education.  That suggestion has been made on a number of occasions.  Such higher technical education should be provided quickly, if we are to sustain the interest of young people in vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that instead of the usual technical school catering for subjects such as domestic economy, woodwork, commerce and so on, there should be specialised technical schools in major fishing ports such as Killybegs, to provide courses in all aspects of the fishing industry and to equip <Col N="168" /> boys for a fishing career.  It would be a great advantage to the boys in these ports to have specialised technical knowledge which would equip them for such careers.</P>
    <P>There is a great development in the teaching of foreign languages in technical schools, even in rural Ireland. Vocational education committees would be acting wisely in providing increased facilities for the teaching of German and French, which will be useful and necessary languages for young people in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>For the rural community, the most useful branch of technical education is building construction.  In Donegal and other counties, we have very useful classes and very good teachers. Building construction teachers serve a very useful purpose in the community by instructing persons who want to build new farm houses or reconstruct dwelling houses or farm buildings.  The difficulty is in getting sufficient teachers.  More classes could be provided if more qualified teachers were available.  The training of these teachers is a matter for the Department and I would suggest that the number of teachers in training and qualifying annually should be doubled. Persons wishing to carry out building work are brought to a central hall or classroom and there shown how to make doors and windows and told something about the planning of a building.  Then they carry out the work under the direction of a building instructor on the site.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Minister's Estimate, I referred to a matter which requires review.  Building construction teachers have the same conditions of service as apply to teachers whose work confines them to a classroom. They must give 400 hours per annum teaching in a classroom.  That is a mistake.  The hours spent on building sites laying off or helping the farmer to build the house should count as part of the 400 hours.</P>
    <P>Under a recent Bill introduced by the Minister, county councils have been enabled to give larger sums towards scholarships.  That is a very good idea.  The committees have increased the numbers of university, <Col N="169" /> secondary and technical school scholarships. Our committee gives about ten scholarships to vocational schools. Those who enter for these scholarships have to do the same examination as applicants for entry to secondary schools.  I believe there should be a different examination for those wishing to obtain vocational scholarships.  It is our experience that it is those from the bottom of the list who are taken for the vocational schools.  We have about 35 scholarships to secondary schools.  Those are awarded and, after that, we have to take from 35 on into the vocational schools.  That situation should not obtain.</P>
    <P>The vocational teachers throughout the country are certainly deserving of our gratitude for the dedicated way in which they do their work.  Not alone do they do their normal hours of work but they do more than is required of them&mdash;I speak now with particular reference to building construction teachers, agricultural teachers, and so on&mdash;and thereby help the community considerably.  They are an asset to the country and they deserve the thanks of all.</P>

      <P>Running through all the speeches here on this simple measure, there was a good deal of <Col N="170" /> emphasis on the urgency of our admission to the Common Market.  Surely the education of our young people should be of primary consideration, irrespective of any significance with regard to European commitments?  Is it only now that the Christians in this House are wakening up to the fact that they have a responsibility to the less well-off sections of the community and to the young people of Ireland? Is it only now that their consciences are awakening to the fact that we spend less here on education services than almost any civilised country in the world?  The only reason that we are spurred on now, or shaken out of our attitude of self-complacency, is the cold shiver of competition likely to be experienced if Common Market arrangements come to fruition.  It is a poor comment on the outlook of members of this House that commitments in Europe should be one of the main reasons why we are embarking on a wider or more extended scheme of educational benefits for our young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vocational education has been described as the poor man's university. It is poor, so far as the funds are concerned certainly.  I suggest to the Minister&mdash;I shall not take very long on this because it is a waste of time talking in this House&mdash;that there is a definite bias in favour of the urban areas as against the rural areas in the giving of grants for educational purposes. One would imagine, with all the talk there is about the necessity of stablising the population in rural Ireland and giving the younger people facilities to equip themselves properly, giving them a decent education, that any bias would be in favour of the rural areas.  I listened to a Dublin Deputy speaking here this evening pleading that Dublin should get bigger grants because it caters for so many from elsewhere.  he is quite right to make his own case, but in the current year, according to the figures I have seen, a special grant of £60,000 was made available to the Dublin City Vocational Committee and over £42,000 to Dublin county.  The two combined are greater, from what I can gather, than all the special grants made available to the rest of the <Col N="171" /> country for vocational education.  If that does not show a definite bias, or preference, then I do not know what it shows.</P>
    <P>The Minister comes in here this evening charged with responsibility for vocational education.  When we call to his Department, we find that vocational education is in a watertight compartment; right beside it, we find the secondary education outfit, and somewhere else we have the primary education outfit.  None knows what the other is doing.  There is no coordination; there is no guidance; there is no co-operation.  There might as well be three separate Ministries.  I urge on the Minister that he should hammer down the iron curtains inside in the Department of Education.  This Government would be doing a better days work for this country in knocking down the iron curtains in education rather than talking a great deal of humbug about another Iron Curtain.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the cost of building and of the fact that some vocational schools in rural areas seem to be too costly.  New building techniques have been developed in the past seven or eight years and it is possible, with these new techniques, to reduce the capital cost of a first-class school by 50 per cent.  I do not want the Minister to get hurt and to say that this is not a matter for him, that it is the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  Fine Gael Deputies have stated that the rates cannot afford an extra penny or twopence for educational purposes.  If that is so, is there any move on the part of the major Opposition Party to force this Government to adopt new building techniques to provide good schools and at the same time, halve the building costs?  Is that not one way of dealing with the problem of the burden of local rates?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter for the committee because the committee must get the sanction of the Department and the Department has been very slow to sanction any new <Col N="172" /> building arrangements or techniques. I am not criticising architects.  I know they are involved.  I am sure trade unions are involved to a great extent, but in the long run there would be plenty of work for the architects and plenty of work for the tradesmen, if a bigger scheme of building were embarked upon.  I think the Minister is aware of the developments which have taken place and which have been put to him in this House and to his predecessor in the past four or five years.  I have yet to see any worthwhile programme evolved to utilise the building techniques and the types of material available.</P>
      <P>I know that in so far as some secondary schools are concerned very successful efforts were made but departmental sanction is not necessary there because there are no State grants available for building secondary schools.  Departmental sanction is necessary in the case of vocational schools.  On that basis, the Minister should let us know whether there is envisaged a dynamic building programme in the vocational field.  I hope that the word &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; does not shock him at this stage.</P>
      <P>Finally, I think I should refer to my own county.  I feel that Roscommon is badly neglected in the matter of grants.  I mentioned the figures of special grants for Dublin city and county.  There are various vocational committees throughout the country which have received special grants or are about to receive special grants within the present financial year.  I do not criticise those grants at all.  I do not begrudge them and I think it is highly essential to give them, but I suggest that the Minister should examine the situation whereby Roscommon is one of the few counties where the only contribution from the Department for vocational education is on a £ for £ basis; in other words, for every £1 raised by the local authority, the Department will give another £1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In several urban areas, for instance, for every £1 raised by the local authority, £4 is given by the State.  In many counties, it is £2 for every £1&mdash; £2 of State grant for every £1 raised <Col N="173" /> locally but in my county the contribution is £1 from the State for every £1 raised locally.  I can see no justification for that.  I know that in a number of counties, where a similar situation arose, as a result of strong pressure, the Minister decided to alter the position and improve the ratio.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should for the coming year take another look at the financial arrangement for my county.</P>
    <P>Let me put it to him this way.  The Undeveloped Areas Act is operating in counties in the West of Ireland and in a number of other counties.  Whether by coincidence or otherwise, every county that comes under the Undeveloped Areas Act, in relation to vocational education is in the £2 to £1, the £3 to £1 or the £4 to £1 bracket, with the exception of Roscommon.  It is the only county that is out.  If it is feasible and right that the county should be included in the Undeveloped Areas Act for special assistance as regards Government grants for industrial and other developments, is there any reason why it should be excluded when it comes to the question of getting these grants from the Department of Education?  That may be a point which has not struck the Minister before.  I would ask him to have that matter examined and let us know what the position is.</P>
    <P>With regard to new types of building material and new building techniques which are in operation&mdash;I want to use the argument used by the Common Market enthusiasts&mdash;if we are serious about competing with European countries, we will have to bring in this building programme by way of a crash programme.  It will have to be well under way by 1967.  The Minister should be in a position to accept plans on that rather than bring in this type of Bill which allows vocational education committees to raise another penny here and there.  It is not a very big step in view of the fact that very big initial steps have been taken in other fields.</P>

      <P>I have every reason to believe that, when the Minister is concluding, he will pay a tribute to the amount of work, thankless and voluntary, which has been put into the development of vocational education in recent years.  There was a time when the vocational education committees were linked up with the county committees of agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a time during the early days of vocational education when the agricultural committees and the vocational education committees were as one, until the Vocational Education Act was passed. It established the vocational education committees.  There are many members of this House who have given very long and faithful service on vocational education committees.  They no doubt realise the great value and importance of vocational education.  I am quite satisfied that in very recent years, particularly in the past year and in the present year, there seems to be in rural Ireland a keener interest and steadier growth in vocational education. I am sure the records of the Department will bear that out.  They have applications in regard to sanction from vocational education committees, not alone in the midlands but throughout the country, for new schools, extensions to existing schools and additional buildings.  This is where I want to agree very fully with Deputy Cunningham.  It will eventually reach the stage when it will be impossible to staff these schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of us who are members of vocational education committees know that the big difficulty that presents itself is the staffing of our schools. with trained teachers.  I would ask the Minister to take steps to double up on the output of teachers for our vocational schools.  An effort should be made to bring home to the parents of those who are seeking careers that there are many openings.  With the <Col N="175" /> steady growth of vocational education, there should be further openings for people who are interested in the teaching profession.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied with the manner in which the Department of Education are dealing with this steady growth.  There seems to be either a shortage of money or a deliberate holdup of sanction, both for extensions to existing schools and for the giving of the green light for the construction of new schools.  In my constituency, we probably realise the value of vocational schools more than in any other constituency.  In the county of Offaly and in the county of Laois, there are vocational education committees with a splendid record of service to the public.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have been closely connected with vocational education in the training of apprentices for the various workshops and they deserve to be complimented on the manner in which they have co-operated with the staffs of vocational schools probably not alone in my constituency but in other constituencies also where Bord na Móna are carrying out activities. The same applies to the ESB.  We have a number of ESB power stations in my constituency.  The ESB have expressed their appreciation in no uncertain terms that their employees, in their early years, received a sound education in the technical schools.  They have co-operated in the conducting of classes for apprentices and others in that regard.  The same applies to the briquette factories in that constituency. Many of the key workers are the products of our vocational schools. We were disappointed we did not get the fertiliser factory which Wicklow got.  I am sure we would have the very same boast in that regard.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is an absolute necessity.  Whilst we have to pause and question ourselves in regard to its financing, we have to admit, viewing all the legislation that comes from the Government, that every Bill that has been brought in has piled an additional burden on the taxpayers, either directly or indirectly.  That is particularly striking when we carry our <Col N="176" /> minds back to the undertakings given by the Government to relieve the taxpayer. Not alone is the taxpayer not getting any relief but every Bill brought in here piles up an additional burden of taxes.</P>
    <P>This Bill will increase the rates as well as central taxation.  There was an uproar in this country by the members of the present Government when, during the time of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government, the rates were 3/6d. in the £ and taxation was £20 million.  Today, taxation is £163 million and in many cases rates stand at 53/- in the £, as a result of the policies being implemented by the men who pledged themselves to cut down on the 3/6d. rate and the £20 million taxation.  Now we see rates at 53/- in the £ in many counties and taxation standing at £163 million. However, we have to view the picture as it is here.</P>
    <P>This House realises that vocational education is an urgent necessity.  I have often wondered why the Department of Education had a ceiling on the amount for which a vocational education committee could ask its county council.  If vocational education is to develop in order to meet the educational requirements of our people in the Common Market period which lies ahead, the curbing of spending on vocational education must stop.</P>
    <P>When vocational education committees are given their allocation of money in the form of a State grant, on one hand, and a contribution from the county council, on the other, there is too much restriction by the Department on the spending of that money.  I was expecting that, when this Bill was introduced, vocational education committees would be given a little more power in relation to the spending of their funds.</P>
    <P>I want to take this opportunity of offering serious criticism to the Department for failing to sanction a proper rate of pay for caretakers of vocational schools throughout the country.  I understand that, when the vocational education conference met in Athlone earlier this year, there was a full-dress debate on this matter.  I am sure that when the report of that conference is submitted to him, the Minister will, <Col N="177" /> for his own information, note the comments in that regard.</P>
    <P>In towns such as Portlaoise, Portarlington, Birr and Tullamore, I fail to understand why a caretaker of a vocational school should be treated as he is being treated at present.  Consider a man who is devoting all his time to that work.  Even when school is not in session, there are the grounds to be kept, rooms to be looked after, machinery to be watched.  The premises have to be looked after.  I fail to understand why the Department insists that his rate of pay should be linked to the rate of pay of an agricultural worker in the district.</P>
    <P>There is no comparison whatever between the duties of an agricultural worker and the duties to be performed by the caretaker of a vocational school.  I think there is a circular in the Minister's Department&mdash;No. 17/51, if my memory serves me correctly&mdash; which lays down certain duties whereby the members of vocational education committees must provide for the caretakers of vocational schools. That circular is outdated and the Minister should take the necessary steps to review the position.</P>
    <P>This has been a constant worry to the vocational education committee of which I am a member.  When the committee sit down to consider the rate of pay for men giving valuable wholetime service&mdash;men who are prepared to work many hours in addition to what they would normally be called upon to work&mdash;we find that, when the committee are prepared to pay what they think is a reasonable rate, the Department threaten to surcharge the members and fail to give sanction and effect to the wishes of the committee. Vocational committees are made up of men who have a certain responsibility in the matter of the spending of ratepayers' money.  they also have a sense of the value of their employees. For those reasons, the Minister would be well advised to seek closer co-operation with vocational educational committees in general.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, caretakers in vocational schools&mdash;there are hundreds of them in the country&mdash;are entitled to wages sufficient to ensure for them a reasonable standard of living, and if <Col N="178" /> county vocational educational committees are prepared to foot the bill to provide such wages, I think the Minister should not clamp down on them. Why should such caretakers not be grouped as a separate section in the community, instead of being forced to depend on local agricultural rates of pay?</P>
    <P>In matters of that kind, as in many others, the Department would be well advised to have periodic consultations with representatives of vocational educational committees to find out what the general pattern of feeling is in regard to what the standard rate of pay for school caretakers should be. The Minister may have difficulties in such consultations, because a congress is held once a year of representatives of vocational educational committees, but that congress has not got the same negotiating machinery as is available to the General Council of County Councils and the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, both of which come together and have resource to top level conference.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Minister that he should take the initiative in giving to a body formed of representatives of vocational educational committees facilities to consult with his Department on problems relating to vocational education.  I had hoped this Bill would make provision for the setting up of such machinery, for the setting up of a congress of vocational educational committee members from throughout the country with facilities for top level consultation.  At the moment you have the people responsible for the vocational education system completely unorganised, as one might say.  If the Minister, as Deputy McQuillan suggested, is to launch a huge building scheme of vocational schools throughout the country, he must have such consultation facilities available in order to determine where such schools should be built.</P>
    <P>There is undoubtedly a huge demand for new vocational schools&mdash; schools in which there will be facilities for the general teaching of engineering as well as many kindred subjects&mdash; throughout the length and breadth of the country.  In face of this demand, <Col N="179" /> it becomes obvious that there is an urgent need for the setting up of machinery whereby there can be provided machinery for consultation between the Department and representatives of vocational committees.  I am not at all satisfied that the annual congress of vocational committees held in some town by the seaside for two or three days is at all effective in this matter.  A representative body of those committees should be set up and should meet more frequently.</P>
    <P>Members of vocational committees give unselfish service and I think that when the Minister is replying he should pay a tribute to those people, members of county councils and the clergy and others, who give their time so selflessly in the interests of vocational education.</P>
    <P>Another problem the Minister should consider seriously is that of the provision of transport for pupils anxious to attend vocational schools.  In most parts of the country, vocational schools are in the big towns but the time has now arrived when farmers' sons want to attend classes in engineering.  Every farmer's son nowadays knows that the day has come when he must have mechanical training, when the horse is a thing of the past on the farm.  He wants to know something about mending and maintaining a tractor, about how to keep and drive a combine harvester.  He wants to know about replacements for mechanical implements.  The sad part is that most farmers' sons now leaving national schools live at great distance from vocational schools.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McQuillan rightly pointed out, it is in matters such as this that the need for closer co-operation between the Department and the vocational education committees is so obvious.  There is this great new demand for schools in each county and it is only representatives of county committees who can give the Minister the required information about where new schools are most needed.</P>
    <P>Reverting to the question of providing transport for pupils to vocational schools, in my constituency, committees have been set up for providing transport for such pupils. <Col N="180" /> That is an idea to be commended&mdash; the idea of public-spirited citizens coming together to give children an opportunity of attending vocational classes.  However, I think an effort should be made by the Department to revise their policy in this respect so that county vocational committees will be left free to make financial provision for such transport.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Deputy Cunningham that no vocational school should be without facilities for the teaching of engineering.  It should be a condition laid down by the Department that no vocational school will be without an engineering classroom. I was also impressed by what Deputy MacEoin said but I should like to add that there is a very good opportunity for co-operation between the trade union movement and vocational committees.  The same spirit of co-operation, I am glad to say, exists as far as industrialists are concerned. Some of our finest industries are to-day being managed by people who had their first grinding in vocational schools.  That is a great credit to the people concerned and to the educational system.  I feel, however, that it is necessary there should be more frequent conferences between the trade union movement, industrialists and the Minister because a lot more could be done in this direction if a greater spirit of friendliness and co-operation existed.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested we should have better facilities in our vocational schools for the teaching of continental languages.  I agree.  We heard in the radio recently where in one midland area 40 people were enrolled in a French class, 40 were turned away and and an Irish course attended by six people had to be closed down.  There is no doubt that in every county a great demand exists for training in continental languages.  We are coming to the time when continental languages will be necessary for our people.  In this connection, I would ask the Minister to make it clear whether it is a fact that if a person offers himself as a teacher of French or German.  he must first have a qualification in Irish before being allowed to teach the continental language?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> If that is the position, it shows a high degree of lunacy on the part of the Department and steps should be taken forthwith to end it because there is a demand for the teaching of French or, indeed any continental language. French is probably one of the most important universal languages and it is now becoming an absolute necessity for anyone who wants to do business on the Continent.  French is a language we should know and it must be taught to our people in the future.  That is why I think we should get more teachers, and we should cut out the condition that they should be qualified in Irish in order to teach a foreign language.</P>
    <P>I should be glad if the Minister would refer to that when replying because I am given to understand that it is one of the reasons why there is such a shortage of teachers of foreign languages.  Steps should be taken to encourage such classes and the Department should provide the teachers.  We have now reached the stage at which the shopkeeper must cater for the customer.  Our schools must now cater for the demands coming from li = "3" fli = "-2"those who attend them.  If there is a demand in that regard, an effort should be made to meet it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome.  I hope and trust that the debate which has taken place will give the Minister at least some food for thought.  There is a growing realisation not only in this House but throughout the country to-day of the need for a furtherance and continuation of large-scale vocational education.  I should like to express the hope that we may see the day when there will be a greater link-up between our national school education and our vocational school education.  I should have liked to see a dove-tailing of one into the other in order that when children leave the national school at 14 years of age, the services of the vocational schools in which wonderful and outstanding work is being done, will be immediately available to them. The teaching staffs of our vocational schools deserve the highest possible praise for the excellent manner in which they discharge their duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> This Bill will certainly be a help. The only thing I am afraid of is the growing protests from the ratepaying community against any further burden on local rates.  Steps should be taken by the Government in an attempt to relieve the demands and pressures on the ratepayers by giving increased grants and increased financial facilities to vocational education committees to help them to carry out their valuable and important work.</P>
    <P>Clara is an industrial town. Arrangements have been made by the Offaly Vocational Education Committee to proceed with the erection of a vocational school in Clara.  For over 40 years, there has been a genuine demand from Clara&mdash;which is probably one of the most industrialised towns in the midlands&mdash;for a vocational school.  Now that it is being started, I would ask the Minister to ensure that no time will be lost and that there will be no hold up on any financial commitments entered into by the committee and the Department.  I would ask him to keep a special eye on the proposed vocational school for Clara to see that no time is lost in having it satisfactorily completed.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the extension that is about to be added to the vocational school in Birr.  In view of the growth of the town and the enrolment in the school this season and last season, a very good case has been made for a substantial extension.  I hope the Department will be helpful and that the obstacles which very often present themselves will be reduced as far as possible.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other county which I have the honour to represent, Laois, the Minister gave sanction in principle to the erection of a vocational school in Mountmellick.  By some strange coincidence, the sanction in principle arrived ten days before the general election.</P>

Naturally the Fianna Fáil Party arrived in Mountmellick and said on the eve of the general election: &ldquo;You will have a vocational school any day at all now.

      <P>They got it very cheap and the Deputy knows it and there was no auctioneers commission, either.  It was one of the best sites for a vocational school that could be procured.  I ask the Minister to speed up as far as possible the machinery for the erection of that school in Mountmellick.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, a vocational school was erected in Portarlington.  Grave doubts were expressed at the time as to whether the school would be a success, but, to the amazement of everyone, due probably to the fact that we have one of the best headmasters in Ireland in Portarlington, the school had to be extended.  This year, there is a record-breaking enrolment. That is a tribute to the people in Portarlington, to the parents and to <Col N="184" /> those who encouraged vocational education there, and it is a tribute to the teaching staff who pay such special care and attention to those who attend the school.  I trust that when the Department remove all the barriers so that we can carry out the erection of the school in Mountmellick, it will be as successful as that in Portarlington.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling Deputy Lalor is going to speak and before he does so, I should like to refer to his town of Abbeyleix.  In that town, there has been a genuine demand for a vocational school for many years and I am glad to say that steps are now being taken to provide it.  Again, may I say I helped with the site and may I say it was long before Deputy Lalor entered public life?  However, in view of the distance between Portlaoise and Abbeyleix and in view of the fact that there were so many anxious to enrol in Abbeyleix, I would ask the Minister to take steps to reduce the delay as far as possible in providing the town of Abbeyleix with a school.  I have no desire whatever to enter into a poaching campaign with Deputy Lalor.  We have always been good friends and we have no desire to be anything else, but I am sure I am only expressing the Deputy's sentiments in asking the Minister to be as helpful as possible in providing the long-awaited school in that area.</P>
    <P>May I express to the Minister my own good wishes for his success in his sphere of vocational education?  It is certainly something that is very dear to me because I have seen the excellent results over the years.  What we need is greater drive, less interference from the Civil Service and more understanding of the difficulties on the part of the elected representatives. With a greater degree of co-operation, I have little doubt that many of the difficulties which exist will in time be solved by mutual understanding and agreement.</P>

I am glad Deputy Flanagan realises the situation as it exists today.  After all, Bord na Móna was established by this side of the House.  There would be very little use in Deputy Flanagan looking for vocational schools in Abbeyleix or anywhere else, if it were not for the industrial policy of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>There is very little use in talking about vocational education until you have the industries there to absorb our trained people.  It must be realised that in this country today the collar and tie man is filling a secondary place as compared with the trained worker.  I have seen young lads who after an ordinary national school education have done a course at the Cobh technical school and then been sent out to Holland for a year or been taken into the Rushbrooke Dockyard for a year and trained; these boys to-day are earning anything from £15 to £25 a week.  At the same time, you will see an unfortunate person with a B.A. <Col N="186" /> after his name in the city here wearing a pair of white gloves and wielding a baton or leading around one of these dogs that Deputy Dr. Browne is complaining about.  A complete change is taking place, a change for which we must prepare.  Technical training must be made available to the young people before they can be absorbed into those industries.</P>
      <P>I entirely agree with what has been said here about Dublin because we are in the same position in regard to Cork city.  There is this drive by certain industrialists for the city man or the lad trained in a city technical school as against the rural school.  We are insisting in my constituency that the technical trainee acquired by industries in east Cork towns will be drawn from the local technical school as against the city school.  Therefore, higher grants and better technical training are required for those in the rural areas where the young people are trained than are required in the city.</P>
      <P>The situation that has developed has developed not on account of the Common Market programme but on account of our industrial programme here and the employment given by our industrial programme.  There is an absolute necessity for having some technical training provided for the young lad who is to be absorbed in industry today.</P>
      <P>I had to laugh at the comparison made by Deputy Flanagan between the caretaker of a vocational school and the agricultural labourer.  The agricultural labourer must have three times the skill and the engineering technique required by any caretaker. There is no comparison whatever between the two.  I would ask the Minister, when dealing with technical schools, to see that there is full co-operation between the head of the local industry and the local technical school so that the apprentices can be drawn from that school, wherever it is.</P>

In regard to his proposal about a vocational education general council, if he wanted that, it would be the same as the General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture.  My friend, Deputy Meaney, when he started on that did not want the help of any Minister and it was done and it was a great success. There is nothing to stop the vocational committees from doing the same thing in the morning, if they want to.</P>

      <P>Níl rá agam ach go n-aontaím lena bhfuil san mBille seo.</P>
      <P>Since the Party I speak for regards as the most urgent educational task before the nation the development of vocational education, we enthusiastically welcome this Bill.  The Bill affords the local authority an opportunity to make more money available to expand vocational education.  I hope that the members of the various local authorities, who have the obligation of striking the rate for such moneys, will do so in a generous fashion.  I hope they will not be mean or niggardly in the money they make available for this purpose because we regard money spent on education, and particularly on vocational education, as money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said that the vocational school is the poor man's university. We on the Labour benches express the hope that there will be a dovetailing of this educational system and that we can look to the day when the boy or girl entering the vocational school, from the commencement of his or her studies, will have the opportunity of <Col N="188" /> greater educational pursuit to a technological college or to a university. We look to the day when scholarships will be available to assist the student in a vocational school to attend the highest flights of education in this country.</P>
    <P>It is true to say, as a vocational teachers' organisation stated recently, that there are 3,500 students in technical schools who could benefit by a higher education but the opportunities, seemingly, are not there for them to continue their studies.  We regard it as a great waste of human talents that the vocational schools are merely turning out mainly unskilled people and, to a large extent, are sending too many boys and girls into blind-alley jobs.  Many Deputies have expressed concern about the impact which this measure will have on the rates of the local authorities.  I feel that industry can help to a large extent in this regard.  Since it will be the function of the Minister to turn out highly skilled, highly educated and adaptable work people, fully conscious of new techniques and devices in operation in these modern times, they will to a large measure be going into industry and it is only fair that industry should finance the vocational education to some degree.  Industry should acknowledge the contribution being made by the State in turning out skilled artisans, technicians and technologists for the benefit of industry.  I would not thank them for financing vocational education by way of grant, or by providing appliances for the kind of student they expect to utilise in their particular firm or industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to see vocational education being uplifted and winning new prestige.  At present parents are unlikely to send, and do not usually send, their children to a vocational school as winners of a scholarship. They prefer to send them instead to the secondary school.  They regard vocational education as having something less than the academic standard one associates with a secondary school. That is a bad thing because technical knowledge available under the vocational system is becoming more and more important in these times.  If the <Col N="189" /> Minister is not actuated by a cultural motive, or by social considerations to make more money available, it is self-evident that the economic advances with which we have to contend, particularly in the context of the Common Market, will force him to utilise vocational education to a much greater extent than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see these extra moneys being made available because it should obviate the interminable delays in the Minister's Department in relation to the sanctioning of the erection of new schools, additional accommodation and equipment, from time to time.  These delays in the sanctioning of money are not good.  I remember, speaking of my own constituency, that it took 21 long years of unceasing effort and agitation to secure our new technical school in my native town of Clonmel.  It should not take that long for teachers and pupils to be relieved of the purgatory of having to inhabit dark, dank and dilapidated buildings.  The Minister will take cognisance of the fact that he has the National Apprentice Board to assist in channelling pupils into the proper trades.  In our technical schools nowadays, progress should not be retarded in this regard and we should ensure that the skilled labourer is made available where he is required and obviate the possibility of certain trades being flooded with boys where they are not required.</P>
    <P>In connection with the National Apprentice Board, which is so closely related with vocational education, I hope employers will be conscious of their responsibilities and release the apprentices for training in technical schools without any loss of pay.</P>
    <P>By and large, we welcome this measure.  We sincerely hope the local authorities will administer it in the spirit in which the Minister intends and that the 24 pence he makes provision for will, as far as possible, be spent.  Previously, vocational committees were entitled to ask for an increase of one penny in the rates over the previous year and the new Bill now permits an increase of threepence. I do not think it is obligatory on local authorities to increase to the <Col N="190" /> extent of threepence but they now may make such an increase by a simple majority.  Is that so?  The local authority can pass an increase of threepence by way of a simple majority up to 24 pence in the £?</P>

      <P>That is very worthwhile and should permit vocational committees to embark upon their many very desirable schemes for the furtherance of vocational education.  I want to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the vocational committees for their sacrifice and devotion to duty and to pay particular tribute to the CEOs who are the kingpins in the programmes of the various committees. No words of mine could express the appreciation we all feel of the great work being carried out by these bodies.</P>
      <P>I regret to say that many of the anti-progressive people on our county councils do not appreciate the intrinsic value of the work of vocational education. They are primarily concerned with opposing increases in the rates, irrespective of the consequences.  They would do a great disservice to themselves and serious injustice to the nation by cheeseparing in this vital matter of providing finance for education. I hope they will be influenced by the spirit of the Bill and will give generously, where education is concerned. I look forward to the day when we have a vocational system which will give every boy and girl the opportunity of higher education to develop the latent talent he or she possesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope we shall see the establishment of more colleges of technology.  The only technological colleges we have at present are those in Dublin, in Kevin Street, Bolton Street and Rathmines. That is not good enough.  It is not a good thing that technological training of this kind is available only to the people of our capital city.  We want to see such colleges in other industrial centres, so that our boys and girls may pursue their education, take out degrees in engineering, science and the <Col N="191" /> arts and have the opportunity of receiving a university education.  Until that day, we shall not be satisfied.</P>

      <P>As a member of a vocational committee, I welcome the Bill.  I am glad that under it we will have authority to strike a rate of more than the penny provided under the old system and that we may, in fact, increase the rate by as much as threepence. We have been told that an increase of threepence in any one year might invoke protests by the ratepayers. I have found that no matter how conservative a county may be and no matter what organised agitation there may be in regard to rates, any such rate for vocational education or for agricultural advisory services has never brought forth any serious protests from the ratepayers.  The point has been made that this threepence should be devoted to the employment of extra teachers and that the provision of capital should be a State charge &mdash;in other words, that the State should bear the full responsibility for any li = "2" fli = "-1"new school.  That is a questionable policy.  If the State could be got to supply 100 per cent. capital investment, there is hardly a committee that would not welcome it with open arms.</P>
      <P>The style of school we have been erecting over the years is far too costly.  We have been building on a palatial style, out of keeping with the main purpose of the schools.  I have a case in mind where we had tentative proposals for a school before my own committee.  I was amazed to find that the estimated cost per room was £9,000, for a three-roomed school in an average rural village.</P>

      <P>I do not know how big they were, but that was too costly.  There should be a reappraisal of the whole situation and a recasting of the Department's programme, so <Col N="192" /> far as costs are concerned.  I do not see why a room for carpentry or metal work should cost between £6,000 and £9,000.  I believe a building more on the factory style could provide suitable accommodation.  I realise fully that a new vocational school is a striking and imposing amenity for any locality but I believe we could provide the same service and amenities at a far lesser cost.</P>
      <P>With regard to the clamour we have for the erection of schools, I want to say that you can overdo the building of schools.  Before you undertake the erection of a school, you have to make a survey of the area to be served and you have to have a fair idea of what the attendances will be like in order to justify its erection.  In areas where such a survey reveals that sufficient numbers might not be available to justify the erection of a school, the boys and girls there should not be left unprovided for.</P>
      <P>A point has been made about the provision of transport.  I have in mind a school in my constituency where the parents contribute by arranging to provide a bus operated by a private firm.  In some instances, it is a heavy impost and very unfair to the parents who have to subscribe to this cost. I support 100 per cent. the point made by my colleague from Tipperary.  He outlined the position in Dublin where we have the important finishing-off medium in the three or four centres he mentioned, the schools of technology, where the vocational school product is finished off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us face the facts.  Our boys in the country do their two or three years course and get the group certificate which includes woodwork and metal work but we still cannot say they have the necessary finish to enable them to go into full adult employment.  They have been absorbed in centres like Shannon, Limerick and Cork but they have to go in at what may be described as half-advanced apprenticeship period. That is in itself a guarantee or a hope for the parents that if they send children to vocational schools, there is an outlet for them, but these children are still denied the opportunity of going to schools that can pick out the talent <Col N="193" /> that exists in many boys and girls in rural Ireland so that they could be properly finished off.  If we had one finishing centre in Limerick, Cork, Galway and the other provincial centres where boys could go with the help of scholarships, which I am sure local authorities would only be glad to give, it would greatly help to advance those boys.</P>
    <P>From what I have heard, I am sure great strides forward are being made in the vocational schools but I fear that several brilliant boys have lost that finish, that final veneer which would fit them for life as perfectly trained technicians in the many callings and openings now existing.</P>
    <P>I may be wrong and may get no support but I say that the Minister and Department responsible for the operation of vocational education should reexamine very carefully the school building programme and try to regulate the cost so that for the same amount of money, we could provide more schools than are at present being provided.  It is ridiculous to be putting up vocational schools costing between £20,000 and £30,000 in centres where adequate buildings to give the same service could be built at lesser cost.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister and his officials to examine proposals or suggestions for giving aid by way of grant-in-aid where schools could be improved and attendances improved by the provision of transport in congested areas.  Those proposals are well worth examination.  Let every county and area speak for itself but we have nothing but the greatest appreciation for the present Minister and his officials in their administration of vocational education.  I hope that it will continue to be the policy of the Minister to ensure that proposals that are submitted will be considered and sanctioned without undue delay.  I have no doubt that the Minister and his officials are energetically behind the vocational education policy and programme and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to try to find a way equitably to reward chief executive officers according <Col N="194" /> to their responsibility as measured by the number and size of their schools, the number of pupils and teachers.  It is due to their enthusiasm, initiative and great devotion to their work that vocational education has advanced in the splendid way it has advanced up to now.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Minister to use his influence with Dublin city vocational education authority to award a limited number of agricultural scholarships.  It may sound peculiar to look for agricultural scholarships for students from Dublin city but I have come across this situation more than once.  We have many people in Dublin at present who have come from the country. Occasionally we meet people who have been left farms and want to settle their son on one of those farms.  They may be civil servants or employed in some other capacity and may have no opportunity of giving the boy a year at an agricultural college.  I have met the situation that on one side of the road, you are in the county and on the other, the city, and just because a boy is on the wrong side he is deprived of an agricultural scholarship.  That is very wrong and I should be very pleased if the Minister would use his influence to induce Dublin city vocational education authority to give a limited number of agricultural scholarships.</P>

      <P>We have gone a long way from the Bill I introduced and very many of the points brought up by Deputies I have dealt with already on the Estimates this year but I shall try to deal with the Bill and some of the points which were raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from the debate that what I said at the beginning is true, that there is an obvious demand and a need <Col N="195" /> for an extension of vocational education. I regret that some Deputy referred to the vocational education system as a poor man's system.  Vocational education occupies its own rightful place, a place which cannot be filled by any other system in our post-primary system of education.  I am aware that as yet there are gaps in our post-primary system of education, social gaps&mdash;we went some of the road to filling these when we introduced the scholarship scheme which will give scholarships to 5,000 or 6,000 extra students each year&mdash;and there are geographical gaps&mdash;which will be met to some extent by the provision adumbrated by the Taoiseach in a recent statement about the recommendations of the Committee on provisions for the western regions&mdash;and there are other gaps which will be filled by the vocational system itself, if given the adequate means.</P>
    <P>As I said, this Bill is calculated to extend the means of the vocational education commitees to do what they are very well able to do and what they have proved themselves capable of doing and for which they have been praised by many Deputies.</P>
    <P>Nobody has any doubt that we need more education and that more money should be spent on it.  Some Deputies are lucky when they can consider a reduction in rates, a reduction in taxation and increased expenditure on education.  One Deputy was able to manage this and refrain from laughing. We have to find the money if we are to spend the money.  The main contention of most Deputies has been that this money should come from the Central Fund.  There is some psychological appeal about talking of a Central Fund out of which everybody can draw and into which nobody seems to have to subscribe.  That is the main reason why people want to get away from paying immediately.  The fact is that whether you pay centrally or locally, you still have to pay for this extra education.  The real fact is that in extending the right of a committee to raise more money locally, we are also extending the amount of money which will be paid from the Central Fund. <Col N="196" /> In coming to a decision as to how it should be done, I was mainly influenced by the local character of the vocational education system in its development and the agility and adaptability of this local type of set-up.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill to prevent the administrative act of the Minister for Education, acting with the Minister for Finance, of coming to the aid of a committee which cannot find itself solvent and provide, out of its own funds and the ordinary addition from the State, an adequate system at the same time.  There is absolutely nothing in this Bill to interfere with that.  It has been found up to now that the giving of £ for £ in most instances has been adequate.  Some of the counties which are not quite happy with this situation are not really in a position to make a valid complaint since they have not reached the full amount of the rate strike which will get the full amount of the State grant. Other counties less well off were found to be at the full rate with its corresponding full State grant and were found to be incapable of maintaining a solvent position and these counties have had added help from the State, in the case of about eight of them, an extra ratio, a two to one ratio, or in some very small schemes which could not raise enough rate to have an adequate scheme, a four to one ratio, and as well as that, there have been excess grants.  Indeed, one of the counties most benefiting from excess grants has been the most vocal in saying they are not being treated as well as the others.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give you one guess.  At any rate the provision which has been made has appealed to me as the proper way to finance the vocational education schemes and I should like to say now that up to this the rating authorities have never been found reluctant to make provision for vocational education and, as Deputy Collins pointed out, the ratepayers have always been very happy to pay for this education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be no dispute that <Col N="197" /> we need to get more money and I think anybody responsibly dealing with it would do as I have proposed to the House.  The rate of increase in the rates cannot be more than a penny a year.  On demand, the rating authority may allow up to threepence but the Vocational Education Committees cannot put a burden of more than a penny in the £ each year on the rates and I do not think this is a frightening prospect, considering the very immediate and very useful returns which are got from vocational education in each rating area.</P>
    <P>In what I have said already, I think I have answered some of the points. Somebody asked me if grants were equal throughout the country.  Deputy O'Donnell, who spoke first, suggested that we should do something about the fishing industry at Killybegs.  I await a proposal from the County Donegal Vocational Education Committee and if I receive a proposal, as I expect I will, from the committee about a special type of school there, it will receive every sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>Now that we are on to principle, sanction in principle is all I can give because the provision of schools is a matter for the committee in the order of its own priorities and the committee of which the Deputy is a member sets its own priorities and I have no right to upset these.  So they have the sanction to go ahead and all I can give them is the principle and they can set the priorities.  What did strike me when the Deputy was talking was that he mentioned something about selling a site to the committee. I hope it was as an auctioneer because, if he sold it as an owner, he disqualifies himself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes me very happy.  The question of the establishment of a General Council of Vocational Education Committees was raised.  The Vocational Education Association serves the purpose of this body which the Deputy suggests but if particular committees feel that the Association should meet more frequently or should be more active, they should bring their views to the Association itself.  There is hardly any need for a new association.  The existing association is well able to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not know how far I should wander after those who wandered away from the Bill.  Deputy Flanagan raised a question about Continental language teachers having to know Irish.  Almost all the Continental language teachers we have are part-time. The rule does not apply to them.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy was very interested in his own county being better treated.</P>

      <P>I do not know what answer I can give except to say that all counties are being treated better now than they were some years ago. That is a reflection of the improved financial situation in the country as well as evidence of the policy of this Government of investing money in education, believing that investment is a good one.</P>
      <P>The question of school building interests me.  Someone suggested the provision of vocational schools was slow.  I shall follow up that matter. The provision of schools generally has been speeded up very much in the past few years.  National school buildings have doubled and, as I said during the debate on the Estimate, we are considering new methods to speed up the provision of schools even more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the House will pass this Bill. <Col N="199" /> The committees have to budget at this time of the year and it is a matter of urgency that the Bill should become law without any undue delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill contains a series of amendments of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, and also some new provisions.</P>
      <P>To assist Deputies in considering the variety of miscellaneous matters dealt with, a memorandum has been circulated with the Bill explaining briefly the purpose of the provisions section by section.  Perhaps I should add that the sections which amend the 1959 Act are arranged in the sequence of the corresponding sections in that Act.  For instance, the group of sections numbered 18 to 22 are concerned with sea fisheries and will enable existing provisions to be more effectively enforced.  An example of a new provision is Section 34 which is to provide such additional powers as may be necesary for the implementation of recommendations that may be agreed internationally for the conservation of fish stocks and the rational exploitation of fisheries.  Those recommendations would be made under the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention of 1959 which is to supersede a somewhat less satisfactory Convention of 1946.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the inland fisheries side, there are so many points noted for attention that I found it necessary to be selective so as to avoid delaying the Bill.  I think it better to leave over some further reforms for detailed discussion and more mature consideration. To the bodies who have been pressing for such further measures, I would say that the present Bill tackles those aspects of the law in the greatest need of reform and that the desirability <Col N="200" /> of additional amendments should be seen more clearly when the effect of the present provisions can be judged in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>Several of the provisions in the Bill strengthen the law relating to fishery offences.  Section 31 provides for a general correlation and upward revision of penalties.</P>
    <P>I have referred on many occasions to the pernicious practices of using poison or explosives for the capture or destruction of fish.  This subject is dealt with in Section 16 for the purposes of which Section 2 provides a wider definition of &ldquo;deleterious matter&rdquo; than has heretofore been employed.  The convicted poisoner or dynamiter of a fishing river will henceforth face the following increased maximum penalties, namely, £100 or six months imprisonment, or both fine and imprisonment if convicted summarily or £500, or two years imprisonment or both fine and imprisonment if convicted on indictment.  In either case, there will be no power to apply the Probation of Offenders Act.</P>
    <P>Section 23 lays down similar penalties for the newly created offence of using a boat or vehicle as an aid to the commission of a fishery offence and also enables the boat or vehicle to be forfeited.  While some of these penalties may at first sight appear rather drastic, it is essential that poaching activities be curbed if we are to preserve our hitherto unspoilt fisheries, of which a fair number still remain, and also to reap the full fruits of the programme of fishery development on which public money is being expended.  Other provisions are also aimed at making things more difficult for poachers: Sections 9, 10, 17, and 26 would help to prevent them from catching fish and Sections 14, 15, 24 and 27 would tighten up control over the disposal of any salmon or trout illegally caught.</P>
    <P>In referring to Section 16 and allied provisions I have been speaking of what I may call the professional poacher or destroyer of fish.  The fisheries code deals somewhat less stringently with the incidental destroyer of fish&mdash;who, whether he be manufacturer or farmer is on occasion, responsible <Col N="201" /> for grave injury to fisheries by discharging harmful effluents.  It is right to give warning that the wider definition of &ldquo;deleterious matter&rdquo; appearing in Section 2 of this Bill will also apply in Sections 171 and 172 of the Principal Act and that the penalties for offences under those sections have been revised in the Table which forms part of Section 31.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 13 and 32 of the Bill are concerned with the power to make fishery bye-laws, which fulfil an important role in supplying <i>ad hoc</i> conservancy measures to meet the particular circumstances of different river systems.  The procedure for making bye-laws involving the holding of public inquiries and the giving of lengthy statutory notices, although it has much merit, does not lend itself to taking speedy action; this is something which I feel should be remedied. In case of emergency, where, for instance, due to prolonged drought, fish in a particular river system are being exposed to undue exploitation, it should be possible to apply restrictions by bye-law without all the formalities which now attend the making of such an instrument.</P>
    <P>There is also at present a technical difficulty which prevents the alteration of the weekly close time.  It is therefore proposed to make it possible to impose restrictions of an emergency character, including the extension of the weekly close time, on a short-term basis and without the present formalities. Should experience show that restrictions so imposed would need to be continued for an extended term, then an enquiry could be ordered giving due notice so that parties concerned would have an opportunity of voicing their objections.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 (2), 5, 6 and 7 relate to membership of boards of conservators. I have been urged to make a variety of changes in this system.  I agree that the machinery for election of boards of conservators is in need of overhaul. There is a feeling that the present system of voting is open to abuse. There is pretty general agreement that voting should be by secret ballot after formal nomination of candidates but <Col N="202" /> opinions are divided as to whether personal voting should be retained or whether it should give way to postal voting.  I have come to the conclusion that in reforming this machinery it would be well to proceed by easy stages.  In Section 6 I propose to take fairly wide powers to make regulations governing the procedure for elections. Included in these powers would be the power to repeal or amend any of the provisions of Section 27 of the 1959 Act which might be in conflict with the general purpose of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Specific mention is made in this enabling section of power to provide for nomination of candidates for election and for postal voting at elections of conservators if it should be deemed desirable to prescribe that method of voting.  I may say that in drawing up these regulations I propose to have further consultations with the various groups interested.  The other provisions relating to boards of conservators would extend the term for which they are to be elected in future from three to five years in the interests of better continuity of administration; add to the present requirement for the office of conservator, namely, that the candidate should reside or possess real property in the fishery district, the additional qualification that he should be either a licence holder or a rated occupier of a fishery in that district, and prevent the co-option of members disqualified for non-attendance.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for contributions towards the expenses of the Council of Boards of Fishery Conservators which can play a useful role in studying the common problems of the various boards and providing a forum for expression of their views.  Provisions for eel fishing, which is steadily developing, are contained in Sections 11, 12 and 13.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw particular attention to Section 28 which proposes to give power to control salmon fishing at sea.  Deputies are no doubt aware of the situation that has arisen elsewhere with the development of large scale drift netting for salmon.  I want to make it quite clear that, should there be any similar development here after the enactment of this Bill, I will <Col N="203" /> not hesitate to impose such controls as are necessary in the interests of preservation of our valuable salmon fisheries.  It is not my intention&mdash;I wish to emphasise this&mdash;to interfere with drift netting for salmon as carried on traditionally in certain areas.</P>
    <P>In recommending this Bill to the House, I should like to express my appreciation of the assistance and advice afforded by the various bodies interested in fishery development and conservation throughout the country. If there are any points arising out of the Bill on which Deputies desire further information or clarification, I shall be glad to help in any way I can.  I look forward to constructive suggestions in the course of the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any measure which will improve our fishery administration and tighten up the existing fishery laws will be favourably received by this side of the House.  Not only will it be favourably received but any measure such as the measure presented to us tonight will have our support.  I think that a Bill of this kind has been under consideration by the Department for some considerable time.  It is one to which those of us who are interested in the preservation of our fisheries and their stocks will certainly give our unqualified support.</P>
      <P>Realising the importance of our fisheries and that the fishing industry is one of our major national assets, we feel that the House should give the matter serious thought.  It is our duty as Deputies to put forward any constructive proposals which we may have in mind and which will be in the interests of the development and the safeguarding of our fisheries in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with the preservation of our fisheries, the selection of the various boards of conservators and the penalties to be imposed on those who are found guilty of fishery offences.  In that connection, I want to assure the House that I and this Party in general have taken every possible step to bring home to the minds of our people the importance of preserving our fishery stocks and the importance of boards of conservators providing the proper <Col N="204" /> measure of protection for our fisheries. In view of that, I feel that the steps taken in this Bill are taken genuinely in the interests of the preservation of our fishery stocks.</P>
    <P>The question of the election of boards of conservators is a matter which has been engaging the attention, I am sure, of the Department for some considerable time, but I am glad to see that at least some steps are now being taken to modernise the law in relation to the election of members to these boards.  The qualifications for nomination, as set out in this Bill, should be adhered to.  Whilst I feel that the election should be by secret ballot&mdash;and there are many reasons why the election to boards of conservators should be by secret ballot&mdash;it is my view that the qualification for postal voting should also be included. It is a matter which has given a considerable amount of trouble and was open to a considerable amount of criticism.  The present system of election is not, in my opinion, a democratic system.  I think it is a good idea to extend the term for membership of boards from three to five years.  I also feel that the qualifications set out in this Bill for membership of such boards are reasonable.</P>
    <P>There are a few points in relation to which I would be glad if the Parliamentary Secretary could give me some additional information.  In regard to the inland fisheries, the question of the protection of our fisheries is probably of the greatest possible importance. I am glad to see that the law is being tightened up in this regard. After all, it is certainly high time that steps were taken to emphasise the seriousness of fishery offences.  There are people who use either poison or explosives when conducting the mean campaign of poaching. That is something which warrants the steps being taken in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I expected that, when we were reviewing the protection of our fisheries, some steps would be taken to provide a greater measure of financial support for boards of conservators to employ more full-time water-bailiffs. I understand that there are boards whose financial resources are <Col N="205" /> not very healthy.  If the best type of water bailiff is to be attracted, he must be well paid.  For that reason, I hope that, when this Bill becomes law and when the boards of conservators are considering their future policy in relation to the protection of our fisheries, they will undertake a reorganisation of their staffs. and take steps to increase the staffs on a wage which will attract more people to the job, thus enabling the waterkeeper to devote more of his time to certain stretches of river.  I understand there are very large stretches of water under the supervision of, say, one or two waterkeepers.  They have very extensive stretches of river to protect and it is impossible for them to be in two places at the one time.  If the staffs were better paid, it would attract the right type of person.  The post of water bailiff or waterkeeper should be regarded as a high one in the service because of the special duties which he must perform.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to see those who have given years of service in this regard covered by a pension scheme and that provision be made for their future.  I understand there are quite a number of them who have devoted the best years of their lives to the service of boards of consevators.  In the early stages, they were employed at various low rates of pay.  They have given very honourable and faithful service to their boards.  Financial arrangements should be made to safeguard their interests when the time comes when they can no longer be employed.</P>
    <P>I come now to fishery offences.  I have always held the idea that district justices were too lenient.  Probably district justices went as far as the law enabled them to go but there are many instances&mdash;and they are on record&mdash; where waterkeepers, in the lawful discharge of their duties, were assaulted and beaten up.  I have often felt that the full measure of the law was not meted out to the offenders.  The protection of our fisheries is of the greatest possible importance to us.  The law as it stands has not been sufficiently severe to discourage, to a great degree, illegal fishing.  I hope that when this Bill becomes law, it will at least be a contribution to the safeguarding <Col N="206" /> of our fisheries from unreasonable trespass and serious offences.</P>
    <P>I agree with the section which deals with the procedure for making bye-laws involving the holding of public inquiries and the giving of long statutory notice.  No doubt, due notice must be given of major changes.  There should be provision for cases of emergency.  From time to time, we have known of cases where speedy action was called for.  As the law is framed at the moment, there is no provision for any speedy action&mdash;for example, the making of bye-laws without the holding of such public inquiries.  I feel no major changes ought to take place without boards of conservators at least having an opportunity to present their views on whatever changes the Fisheries Branch may have in mind.  No doubt, meetings of the board can be arranged at short notice.  There would be no reason for any great difference of opinion between the boards and the boards' officers and the officers of the Fisheries Branch in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should give us some further information in relation to Section 23.  The provisions of this section are rather far reaching. Subsection (1) provides that if a person uses a boat or vehicle as an aid to the commission of an offence under any provision of the 1959 Act, such person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than £100 or to imprisonment for not more than six months and, on conviction, to a fine not exceeding £500 or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years. There might be extenuating or very special circumstances.  If there were very special circumstances, there should be some provision to cover such a case.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) contains a very far-reaching penalty.  It provides that, save in the case of a boat which is used without the consent of the owner, any boat used for the commission of or assisting in any offence under the provisions of the 1959 Act&mdash;except an offence in relation to sea fisheries&mdash; shall be forfeited.  No discretion as regards the forfeiture of the boat shall <Col N="207" /> be given to the court.  If a person is convicted on indictment of an offence and it is proved that a vehicle was used in the commission of the offence, the vehicle may be forfeited by order of the court.  Here, discretion is given to the court with regard to the forfeiture of the vehicle.  There may be very special circumstances and I am wondering if we may be framing the law a little too tightly.  However, I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to give us certain guarantees in relation to that point.</P>
    <P>Section 27 prohibits the buying of salmon or trout unless the purchaser is the holder of a dealer's licence or an exporter's licence.  That is reasonable enough.  It is only right that those details should be given.  It is my experience that the poacher would not be half as active as he is, if it were not for the fact that he has an outlet for his catches.  It is not to the credit of boarding houses, guest houses or hotels <Col N="208" /> that they should purchase illegally-caught fish.  That is why I feel it is only right that identification should be given in this regard.</P>
    <P>However, I am wondering if there may be any special circumstances which may again crop up in relation to this or if the Parliamentary Secretary may consider that the law is being framed too rigidly here.  In the case of very special circumstances, a person who would not be guilty of a very serious offence might in some way or other, so to speak, be caught out and, I am wondering if the section is framed the right way, so as to give an outlet for some person who really would not be guilty of an offence but who at the same time could be under very grave suspicion.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 31st October, 1962</P>
