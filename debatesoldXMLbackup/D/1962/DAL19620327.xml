    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach what are the points in his statement made to the Council of Ministers in Brussels on which the member countries of EEC require further clarification at the meeting which is to be held on 11th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The points on which clarification is required have not yet been detailed.  As stated in the official announcement of the 20th instant, they are of an economic character.</P>
      <P>I should, however, make it clear that during the course of the negotiations with the member countries of the European Economic Community it may not be desirable in the national interest to disclose information as to the precise matters under discussion at any particular stage.  While it will be my purpose, consistent with the successful outcome of the negotiations, to give the maximum amount of information in the Dáil, I cannot undertake, in advance, to answer all questions of this nature, and indeed, I hope that Deputies will not press unduly for information in circumstances which might create additional difficulties in the negotiations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether any question has been raised either officially or unofficially by the European Economic Community as to our ability to bear the responsibility, economically, which could fall upon us if we were admitted a full member of the European Economic Community?</P>

      <P>Medical officers of health authorities are not, of course, restricted to the use of medicines included in those Lists.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The most recent period for which the information asked for in the first part of the question is available is the year ended 31st December, 1960.  In that year a total of approximately 292,000 persons received in-patient institutional services under the Health Acts.  Patients who received treatment in general or acute hospitals but whose treatment was not concluded by the end of the year have not been included.</P>
      <P>Figures of cost relate to financial years.  The net total cost to Health Authorities and the Exchequer of institutional services qualifying for recoupment under the Health Services Grant in 1960/61 amounted to £8,266,000.  This figure is exclusive of deficit payments from the Hospitals Trust Fund made to voluntary hospitals. These totalled almost £1,500,000 for the year.</P>
      <P>In addition to the foregoing, approximately 28,000 patients were treated in district mental hospitals during 1960 under the Mental Treatment Acts at a cost of £4,049,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I had better refer the Deputy to the reply I gave to Deputy Michael Donnellan in the House on 15th February last:</P>
      <P>As announced by the Taoiseach in June, 1961, a general review of local finance is being undertaken in conjunction with the Economic Research Institute.  Furthermore, one item in the terms of reference of the Select Committee of this House on the Health Services, which is due to be constituted in the near future.</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Committee has, of course, been constituted&mdash; is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to examine the existing arrangements for meeting the cost of the services and alternative arrangements which might be adopted for meeting such costs&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, it does not appear to me that that is a very satisfactory reply to the question I asked.  I ask the Minister &ldquo;whether in view of the steep increase in the cost to health authorities this year of health services he proposes to increase the grant from central funds&rdquo;.  It is surely possible for the Minister to reply negatively or affirmatively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  I think this question is at the moment an open one.  When the Government receive the Report of the Select Committee with the arguments for and against the recommendation, then we can consider this question.  As far as I can see at the moment, the situation is reasonably satisfactory.</P>

    <P>Charges in respect of services provided in institutions accommodating mentally retarded patients and deaf and dumb, are not included in the above, as they are not recorded by health authorities in a manner which would permit their classification according to daily rates of charge.  It is, however, clear that far the greater part of these services is provided free of charge to the recipients as the average amount collected by health authorities per patient works out at the very low figure of less than fourpence per day.</P>

The nature of the scales for the various grades is set out in the book of Estimates for the public services. <Col N="474" /> The system of differentiation on a marriage basis involves the payment of unmarried officers at lower rates than married officers.  An officer to whom this system applies accordingly contributes, by working for a lower rate of pay while unmarried, to the allowances which he will receive when he marries and has children.  Where a grade has made no such contribution the question of granting such allowances does not arise.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the exploration company concerned are considering a number of schemes for handling the Tynagh ores if mining operations are considered feasible and that these schemes may include the laying of a pipeline.  They have not, however, approached me for any facilities in connection with such a scheme and I should think that their plans have hardly reached the stage where final decisions on matters of this kind could be taken.</P>

      <P>There has been an increase in the number of eligible applicants for rehousing in the last year while at the same time the rate of vacancies in the existing estate has fallen appreciably. The Dublin Corporation, in view of these altered circumstances, have already arranged an expansion of their programme.  This is evident in the increased number of completions this year as compared with the previous year, in the volume of work in progress and that planned for next year and in the anticipated increased level of housing capital expenditure.</P>

      <P>Persons displaced by a statutory operation of a housing authority are normally rehoused on displacement.</P>
      <P>Where a statutory notice is served by a housing authority on a person having control of an unfit house, requiring such person to repair, close or demolish it, as the case may be, the housing authority is obliged to ensure that the terms of the notice are complied with in due course in accordance with the provisions of the Housing Acts.  If, as a result of the service of a notice, a tenant is displaced from an unfit house, subsidy is available from my Department towards the cost of his rehousing. A person who knowing that a Demolition Order has come into operation in respect of a house, enters into occupation of that house, commits an offence and is liable to prosecution in addition to being required to vacate.</P>

      <P>Statistics on the lines requested, therefore, could be ascertained only by a detailed individual examination of the numerous estate files relating to County Meath for the period mentioned.

      <P>asked the Minister for Education in what circumstances teaching experience outside the Republic is recognised for State salary incremental purposes; if service in certain African countries is not recognised in respect of clerics while it is recognised in respect of lay persons; and the reason for this discrimination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 22nd March, 1962, to a similar question.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part, the position is that the religious communities who made representations to me in the matter stressed their wish that such recognition should be confined to lay teachers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is one of misunderstanding of the intention of limiting this concession to lay teachers. As I told Deputies last week, the concession was to help these emergent nations by attracting lay teachers to go there and therefore it was not necessary to apply it to missionary priests and brothers who were already going.  We were not asked to apply it to them.  I did not explain that at the time and I think, perhaps, some religious organisations felt there was discrimination against them.  It was not intended.  The idea was to attract lay teachers to these emergent countries and the people who asked me to do so stressed that they did not require any concessions for people already going there for other motives.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, with your permission I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>All national teachers do a course in physical instruction as part of their training and are regarded as qualified to teach the subject in national schools.  Physical instruction is an optional subject in these schools but it is taught in most of the large and many of the small schools.  I have stated the position in secondary schools in the reply which I gave to the Deputy to Question No. 73.</P>
      <P>In vocational schools, the position is similar to that in secondary schools. In 32 of the 288 vocational schools there are full-time qualified teachers. In the remainder physical instruction and/or organised games form part of the extra-curricular activities.</P>

      <P>Surely in the absence of adequate rural readers it should be the Minister's function to take the initiative.  Is he aware that Baldwin's Rural Reader was revised and brought up to date at the instance of the Minister for Agriculture and is available in that Department and requires only editing to get it published?  In the <Col N="500" /> absence of some initiative on the part of the Minister for Agriculture it is not likely that any publisher would publish it to compete with some inadequate publication of their own.</P>

      <P>There is a rural reader in use and, generally in practice, the teachers are permitted to select the reader.  The one mentioned by the Deputy, while it may be all right from the point of view of the Minister for Agriculture would not be very attractive to school children.  It does not contain any poems and would, perhaps, make tedious reading because it is mostly about crops and manures.  It may be satisfactory from the point of view of the Minister for Agriculture but the Minister for Education would not regard it as very attractive.</P>

      <P>The person to whom the Deputy refers applied for a service certificate under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1934.  The Referee, to whom the application was referred, reported that the applicant was not a person to whom the Act applied.  A service certificate, which would qualify him for the award of a military service pension, could not, therefore, be granted.  The case was subsequently examined on review, as well as on petition under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1949, but in each instance the original finding of the Referee was confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person in question is ineligible to be considered for the award of a special allowance, not being the holder of a Service (1917-1921) Medal duly awarded in respect of continuous membership of Óglaigh na hÉireann or kindred organisation during the period <Col N="503" /> of three months ended on the 11th July, 1921.  He emigrated to the United States of America in 1920 and did not return to Ireland until 1925 or 1926.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary to meet the cost of increases in the incremental salaries for recognised secondary teachers and for the payment of supplementary allowances to probationary teachers.  The increase in the incremental salaries has been accorded with effect form the 1st November, 1961 and arises from the implementation of a report from the Secondary Teachers' Arbitration Board.  The Arbitration Board met on 23rd February and 2nd March, 1962.  The findings of the board have been approved by the Government and the cost is estimated to be £370,000 for a full year.  The amount which will be payable in this financial year will be £90,000.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate provides also for the payment of a supplementary allowance to probationary teachers in accordance with a scheme which was introduced with effect from 1st August 1961.  The supplementary allowance at the rate of £200 is payable to a teacher during his probationary year of teaching service.  The additional cost of this scheme is estimated at £50,000 in a full year. The cost in the present financial year would, accordingly, be £24,000.  The total sum payable in the current financial year on the incremental salary increases and the supplementary allowance, is estimated at £114,000.  Due, however, to anticipated savings generally in the subhead, the net additional cost is estimated at £102,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is one that is acceptable to the House.  It is merely to pay to secondary teachers principally the increase of salary awarded to them. It is one which we accept.  There is one matter to which I should like to <Col N="513" /> refer.  A number of new lay secondary schools are being established throughout rural Ireland, particularly in the smaller towns.  I understand that in relation to a teacher who wishes to establish such a school the expenses of paying teaching staff are borne by himself for the first year.  I stand subject to correction on this matter but I do know for a fact that during the first year he is at a considerable financial disadvantage.  It may be a probationary period and the Minister and his Department may be quite right in refraining from paying such a teacher or headmaster capitation or salary during that year.  Should that school prove efficient and should that teacher continue with his secondary school, then such arrears should be paid to him, if not in a lump sum, then spread over a period.  I am not too certain of the mechanics of it but, perhaps, the Minister knows what I am referring to and he might let us know the present position.</P>
      <P>In Gaeltacht areas grants are now given for the establishment of such secondary schools.  I do know very good teachers, teachers displaying initiative, who are refraining from establishing such schools as a result of this financial loss which they would sustain in their first year.  Perhaps the Minister would look into that and tell us what the position is.  If he can rectify the matter between now and the main Estimate later on at the beginning of the financial year we would be very glad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask two questions.  One arises from the situation that will come upon us as a result of our increasing participation in the Common Market of Europe, that is, the availability of teachers of modern European languages. I understand that at present if you get a French woman to teach French, although she is a graduate of a French University, she is not eligible for incremental salary here.  Perhaps one of the most urgent things necessary in our secondary school system today is to provide greater access not only to the capacity to read and write Continental languages but also to speak them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously there is a special advantage <Col N="514" /> in many cases of having a teacher who is a native speaker of the language concerned.  The children will be furnished with an adequate speaking knowledge of the language with which they can subsequently go abroad in order to improve their linguistic capacity. I should be glad to know if a school employs Continental graduates of a sufficient standard whether such persons should not have available to them the ordinary increments which qualified secondary teachers here ordinarily enjoy.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to raise with the Minister is this: I understand that it is becoming progressively more difficult to get science teachers in secondary schools for the reason that science graduates are very eagerly sought at present by industry both at home and abroad.  As I understand it the present difficulty of science graduates is that they cannot qualify for increments if they do not take out the Higher Diploma in Education.  It would be a desirable thing, in view of the acute shortage of teachers in this category, to waive the requirement of the Higher Diploma in Education.  I do not propose to dwell on the value of that qualification at this stage of a Supplementary Estimate but I do suggest that it is hard enough to get science teachers at all at the present time and that it might be a very material help to schools trying to get good men and women to teach science to have science teachers exempted from the obligation of taking the Higher Diploma in Education.  I should be glad if the Minister would consider those two proposals with a view to improving secondary educational facilities in all our schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickByrne" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Dillon in regard to the point he made about the scarcity of science teachers and to take issue with the Minister on the reply he gave to me in the House last week in connection with the eligibility of Irish science graduates returning from Britain for incremental salary in this country.  The Minister seems to be convinced that the scarcity of science teachers is due entirely to the competitive position as between teaching and industry.  It is a fact, <Col N="515" /> which cannot be controverted, that there are Irish science graduates teaching science in British schools and that there are science graduates from Dublin, Cork and Galway teaching science in the Six Counties who would be glad to come back here if they were not placed at a considerable financial disadvantage by doing so.  The number I am speaking of may not be very large but I am sure the Minister will agree that even six such teachers brought back here would serve a good purpose.</P>
      <P>On the general question of the ineligibility of teachers with British certificates or, indeed, any foreign service, particularly British service, because there are so many of our graduates in Britain, I would urge on the Minister the desirability of not penalising those of our graduates who have been compelled to emigrate in order to earn a living and who, after five, six, or ten years abroad, are anxious to come home.  At present, when they do so, they have to start at the bottom of the scale.  I can see the Minister's point in relation to adding to the number of jobs, but it seems to me rather parsimonious to rely so very much on first year graduates from our universities who will be paid less in the early years than would those coming back from Britain.</P>
      <P>As far as the laws made by this Parliament are concerned, it is an anomalous situation that the Department of Education should accord a degree of recognition to Partition which is not in accord with the principles laid down in our Constitution. Some of the religious orders operating secondary schools in the Republic also operate schools in the Six Counties.  That is true in particular of the Christain Brothers.  Under their system of administration, they periodically interchange teachers as between one school and another.  That is something which cannot be done now as between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six.  I shall avail of every opportunity presenting itself to protest against that unconstitutional action by the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question of incremental salary, the Minister told me not 20 <Col N="516" /> minutes ago that there had been some misunderstanding about the recognition of teaching service in the emergent countries of Africa and that those who hoped that incremental salaries would be available to all teachers, including the members of religious orders, with suitable experience, were labouring under a misapprehension. The Minister has resolved a doubt on that issue at least.  I can assure the Minister&mdash;I am sure he is aware of it &mdash;that a number of people are grievously disappointed by the fact that this concession is not being made available to members of religious orders.  It seems to me rather churlish to take for granted in this fashion the services rendered by our missionary priests and nuns.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that to a very large extent secondary education in this country depends on these good people and, even more significantly, depends on the salaries paid, in theory, to individual members of religious orders for their services, but which are, of course, made available in fact for the general education administered by the orders concerned.  In so far as I believe, as do many other Deputies, that the financing of secondary education is very much neglected in this country, I feel very strongly that it is wrong to deprive these people of the salary scale made available to lay teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make just one point in connection with the Minister's discourteous remarks here last week when he was asked about the situation in relation to Irish teachers from this part of the country who teach in the Six Counties.  His reply and his attitude on that occasion show up, to my mind, at any rate, the hypocrisy in Government circles on the question of Partition from the point of view of education.  We have the extraordinary position that the Minister admitted last week that an Irish teacher who goes to Ghana, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone&mdash;those were the three countries he mentioned &mdash;will have service in these countries recognised here for incremental purposes. If an Irish teacher, who cannot obtain employment in the Twenty-Six Counties, goes to Belfast to teach there, <Col N="517" /> that teaching experience is not recognised for incremental or superannuation purposes in this part of the country.  That is a disgraceful situation and I do not think too much publicity can be given to it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Irish public are aware of the fact that there is in the Department of Education an actual barrier erected against the Six Counties and that a system of partition exists in one of the most important fields in which there should be the closest co-operation and communication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be a question of having to wait until our abject appeal for admission to the Common Market is either accepted or rejected.  If we are accepted, it is presumed Partition is likely to come to an end.  Here is an opportunity in which we can break down the existing barrier, inviting co-operation from the authorities in the Six Counties in the field of education.  I should like to support Deputy Byrne on one aspect, though I am more concerned with a wider aspect than the teaching orders.  Approximately every three years, or at the outside, every six years, the teaching staffs in the Christian Brothers' schools are transferred from one foundation to another.  A Brother who has been teaching in Belfast and is transferred here will not have his teaching experience there taken into consideration for incremental or superannuation purposes.  The fact is that Brothers teaching in the Six Counties cannot be transferred to this part of the country. They might as well be teaching in Timbuctoo when it comes to the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why should we put on this air of hypocrisy about civilising the people of Ghana, Nigeria and Sierra Leone? Why can we not look a little nearer home and give our own people an opportunity to teach in their own country with the same facilities as we are prepared to accord them apparently when they go abroad?  The hypocrisy is shown up all the more when we remember that clerical teachers are not given these incremental bonuses or attractive salary <Col N="518" /> scales because they have done teaching abroad.  This is an attempt&mdash;how the idea evolved I do not know&mdash;to attract people to go to these countries. If the Minister is really serious, then he should allow these teachers to go to every country.  There is just as much scope in South America as there is in Africa.  I do not know what the actual connection is with some of these countries mentioned by the Minister, but we would be far better off, and there would be far more respect for us, if we sent trade ambassadors to these countries in an effort to find a suitable market for the produce we cannot get rid of here at the moment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a young man and he should be one of the first to bring about the change so badly needed in his Department's attitude on this issue of partition in education.  There was not much use in the past talking to the old fogies sitting on those benches for the past 35 years because they had all gone past the stage of thinking of anything except their lunch, their tea and their dinner. Surely he, as a newcomer, is not prepared to fall into the old routine and take the bad advice of people who are still thinking in terms of the stone age period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to explain to Deputies this question of the recognition of service abroad.  Generally speaking up to last year we did not recognise service abroad because we did not have to attract teachers from abroad.  We had a sufficient number of teachers of our own.  An individual teacher teaching abroad might like to come home, but if he did come home, a post would not be created for him but he would take it from another man who would have to go away, so it was not really to the advantage of the country to recognise service abroad generally.  An apparent advantage to an individual would be a disadvantage to another individual because we did not have an insufficiency of teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recognition of service in the countries mentioned by Deputy McQuillan was given at the request of missionaries in those countries, and the leaders of the emerging countries who <Col N="519" /> wanted lay teachers to go there&mdash;lay teachers employed not here but elsewhere. To make it more attractive to those lay teachers to go to these emerging countries than to another country, I made the concession of allowing them a higher position on the incremental scale, when and if they returned to teach in Ireland.  It was a concession with a purpose: the purpose of getting lay teachers to go to these emerging countries, not to give a motive to the priests, nuns and brothers who were already there, motivated by their missionary vocation to go to those countries.  Again, if you look at it from the point of view of an individual, there seems to be discrimination and that is why I am glad of the opportunity of explaining that our motive was to attract lay teachers and not missionary teachers who were already attracted there.</P>
    <P>The other areas which I recognised were certain European countries: France, Spain, Italy and Germany, and that was for our own advantage, to give us teachers with a proficiency in the languages of those countries. We give recognition to teaching service in a country where the language the teachers learn is the vernacular in order that we will have teachers proficient in those languages.  The overall question of recognition of service anywhere and everywhere abroad raises an awful lot of difficulties.  It is being examined, as I have told the House, but my first care must be what is best for the educational system here.  I do not intend to let it lie.  It is being examined and will be constantly examined.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's suggestion about native speakers of foreign languages being prepared to teach here might have some attraction, but native speakers of a language are not necessarily always the best teachers of the language.  What I have done to date has been to get teachers and try to make them proficient in languages. As has already been announced, one of the biggest teaching bodies, the Christian Brothers, are making arrangements to have teachers trained in the teaching of languages.  I may say that the whole question is being <Col N="520" /> examined continuously.  It is regarded as urgent and already some steps have been taken, but my mind is not closed to other suggestions.</P>
    <P>There is a scarcity of science teachers in every country in the world. Science graduates are employed even before they get their degree.  They are snapped up by industry and at the moment I am trying to work out some system of attracting science graduates to teaching.  It is very difficult to compete financially with industry and, indeed, industry has other attractions as well.  I am not in a position to make a statement at the moment as to what my intentions are, but I am trying to work out some way of attracting science graduates to teach here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell mentioned the probationary year.  I think he meant the first year of establishment of a school.  A school is established about a year before it is inspected for recognition. Once it is recognised, the salaries are paid retrospectively, but we cannot pay money until a school has been examined and found suitable for recognition. The probationary period mentioned in the Supplementary Estimate is the first year's secondary teaching of a graduate with his H.D.E.  In his first year, he is usually paid by the college alone.  The salary has been found to be unattractive and inadequate.  For that reason, and to attract people to stay at home and teach in the schools here, I brought in this payment of a grant during the probationary year.  It is not the year of establishment of a school, but the first year of the teacher's teaching life.</P>

    <P>The introduction of this Supplementary Estimate becomes necessary mainly because expenditure under Subhead P (Defensive Equipment) of the Vote for Defence for the present financial year will be substantially greater than the voted provision and because it is proposed to utilise additional receipts by way of Appropriations-in-Aid. There will also be increased expenditure, because of recent increases in salaries, pay and allowances, under Subhead A&mdash;Pay of Officers, etc.; Subhead B&mdash;Marriage Allowance; Subhead G&mdash;Subsistence and other Allowances; and Subhead Y&mdash;Departmental Salaries, etc. Under Subhead F, there is provision for the replacement of stores issued from stock on repayment to the United Nations for use in the Congo; under Subhead P2, there is provision for the cost of the purchase and repair, etc., of the yacht &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo;, and there is also increased expenditure under Subhead AA in respect of the Special Criminal Court.  The gross total additional expenditure under all these subheads is estimated at £278,827.</P>
    <P>The net provision for defensive equipment in this year's Vote is £149,051, consisting of £20,130 to meet sums outstanding in respect of equipment ordered in previous financial years and a net sum of £128,921 for new purchases.  The total expenditure under this heading will, it is now estimated, be £280,051, consisting of £44,055 in respect of equipment ordered in previous financial years but not delivered until the current year&mdash;a matter over which we really have no control&mdash;and £235,996 in respect of <Col N="522" /> new purchases.  It is expected that there will, therefore, be a net excess of £131,000 on the subhead. Subsequent to the framing of the Estimate for 1961/62, conditions in the Congo, where some of our troops were serving, changed by reason of the resolution adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations on the 21st February, 1961, authorising the use of force, if necessary, by the United Nations forces there.  Deputies will, no doubt, recollect that my predecessor in office, when speaking on the Estimate for the present financial year, assured the House that the question of the equipment of our troops serving in the Congo was being kept constantly under review and that any additional equipment considered necessary in the light of experience or changed conditions would be supplied and no effort spared to make it readily available.</P>
    <P>In the light of the changed circumstances, it was decided to purchase a quantity of up-to-date small arms and ammunition for our troops in the Congo to enable them more effectively to discharge their role there, as well as a quantity for the training of the troops at home in their use.  These purchases were financed as far as possible by the curtailment of purchases of other types of defensive equipment, leaving the net estimated excess expenditure of £131,000 already mentioned.</P>
    <P>Concurrently with the decision to purchase the small arms and ammunition to which I have referred, it was decided to dispose of a quantity of obsolescent small arms and ammunition. As a result of such disposal and additional receipts in other respects, Appropriations in Aid are now expected to amount to £157,755 more than originally estimated.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that the Government decided to purchase the yacht &ldquo;Asgard&rdquo; because of its historical associations.  The cost, together with fees, repairs and sundry other items, amounted to £6,040 approximately. After purchase and repair, the yacht was, at the end of last July, taken over by a crew provided by my Department and brought to Howth for the <Col N="523" /> reception ceremony.  She will, from now on, have a limited use, in connection with the training of members of an Slua Muiri at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to apply the increased Appropriations in Aid which I have mentioned, together with anticipated savings on other subheads, to meeting the additional expenditure about which I have spoken, necessitating only a token Vote of £10.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is similar to other Supplementary Estimates which have been moved in respect of salary and wage adjustments and accordingly meets with our approval.  However, I am anxious to ascertain from the Minister the date on which the pay and salary increases have been made effective and whether it is possible to say if final details of salary increases have been worked out for each rank.  I should also like to know if the Minister can say what are the percentage increases for officers, N.C.O.s and privates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the effects of salary increases is that they impose a very serious differential on personnel who have retired recently compared with those who have retired since salary and wage adjustments were made. Pensions are, and have been for as long as one can remember, both in the Army and elsewhere, awarded on the basis of pay on retirement.  That was satisfactory enough when wages and salaries were constant and provided the person attained a certain rank he secured the pension appropriate to that rank. Nowadays, because of the increase in the cost of living, and the salary and wage adjustments that are consequent on these increases, many retired personnel find that although they reached the same rank, and served up to the same age limit as their colleagues, they find that merely because they happened to retire a month or two, or sometimes only a few days, earlier than persons serving in a similar rank and who retired at a similar age limit, their pensions are quite substantially lower because of the arbitrary fixing of the effective date of the new pay award.  Undoubtedly this is a matter <Col N="524" /> which affects more than the Minister's Department, and the personnel serving under the Department of Defence, but it is a matter which should be the subject of consideration.</P>
    <P>There will be general satisfaction that up-to-date small arms have been provided for our troops in the Congo. One of the criticisms expressed here on previous occasions was that in the earlier period our troops were inadequately equipped compared with troops serving from other countries. On the other hand, we should endeavour to keep the purchase of defensive equipment to the minimum because of the very rapid changes in the type of equipment now in use and the fact that much of the equipment purchased becomes rapidly obsolete.  At the same time it is satisfactory that it has been possible to equip our troops with the up-to-date small arms which are generally in use there and which I understand have been provided now for some months for our personnel serving there.</P>
    <P>I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to give the latest figures for the sums of money refunded to this country by the United Nations in respect of our troops in the Congo and also if he could say whether these sums are refunded at regular intervals. One of the unsatisfactory features of the United Nations operations so far as certain countries are concerned, including our own, is that while we pay our liabilities to the full and on time, other countries are in arrear in respect of their subscriptions.  Consequently, in addition to paying our own portion of it, we have been obliged to subscribe to these special bonds as well.  At any rate, it would be satisfactory to know, in respect of any refunds due to us, that payments are made at regular intervals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate being discussed is, I suppose, very necessary. In fact, the Minister had no option but to look for extra money to cover the various things referred to in his opening statement.  The amount of money being spent on small arms for our troops in the Congo appears perhaps fairly high, but, when we consider that until the Congo operation <Col N="525" /> started the Army units in this country were still going gaily onwards with the old Lee Enfield rifles and equipment which had gone out of date and was considered obsolete in practically every other civilised country in the world, the picture appears different.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the amount being spent on arms should be kept down as much as possible in a country such as ours which has no intention of attacking anyone, but I still think that what arms are needed should be the very best and that we should get whatever modern equipment we can afford. It is not fair to the solider of today to expect him to carry on either in Ireland or in the Congo, in a training period or under active service conditions, with the type of equipment and arms used by his predecessors over a long period of years.</P>
      <P>With reference to the Congo, I am wondering whether the time has not come when the Minister and the Government should take a look at the situation there.  There are rumours about another battalion going out.  I suppose if that is being planned there will be extra costs involved.  There is no doubt that the Irish Government sent out the troops with the full support of this House and they have been doing their very best there under very trying conditions.  There are so many garbled versions of what did and what did not happen there trickling through now that the Minister should see to it that the good name of the Irish soldier is preserved, because there are people only too anxious to seize on the slightest opportunity of taking away not only the characters of the soldiers concerned but the reputation which the Irish have of being brave men and particularly brave soldiers.  The Minister, being the type of man he is, will ensure that every effort will be made to see that the smear campaign being used, particularly in the press across the water, will be dealt with adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of rates of pay does not arise now, but I would say that the Minister has made a great start and the question was dealt with in a <Col N="526" /> very reasonable way during his short time in the Department.  I would ask him to continue the good work, because if we are going to have a satisfied army&mdash;and we need it&mdash;we must treat it decently.  There is still a long way to go with regard to rates of wages and conditions of service, particularly uniforms and housing conditions, which the Minister might keep in mind in the coming year.</P>
    <P>With reference to pensions, I should like to say that while the whole pension system in this State seems to be built up on a kind of topsy turvy system where you do not know who is entitled to what, there is one small group of people who were in at the foundation of this State and who served the country very well.  In 1954 an Act of this House gave them an extension of a couple of years of service, which was subsequently removed in 1957.  They had very decently been given an extra two years' pay on retirement as if serving officers, but when it came to make up their pensions that period was not considered for pension purposes.  The Minister is well aware of the people referred to.  A very small group is involved, and I would ask him again to look at that and see if he could do something even at this late stage to give justice to people who helped to found the State, as an unfortunate decision by a Minister at that particular period treated them very unjustly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to go into great detail now, but rather on the Minister's main Estimate.  I shall deal with certain statements that he has made. He stated that part of the sum required was for the purchase of equipment ordered in previous financial years.  Does that mean that this stuff is somewhat obsolete?  The Minister then stated that it was necessary to re-equip with small arms our forces in the Congo. In other words, he admitted that the arms they possessed were of no advantage, and that the equipment of our <Col N="527" /> Army at home was of little advantage. The men who left were equipped with the form of weapons used here, and one can bet that they went with the best, and if the force in the Congo has weapons which were obsolete then the weapons of the Army at home must be obsolete.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister referred to the need for equipping our forces with modern small arms.  Against whom?&mdash; an infant State, a State of no consequence, with no fire power anyway equal to any modern State.  If the Minister found it necessary to purchase modern small arms to stand up against an infant State, partly civilised, what chance then would that same force have had against a modern State if for some reason the United Nations required our support?  If, in fact, at some future date a greater force is required against some modern State will we then be faced with the position where we will have only a small force not found capable of dealing with backward people in the Congo?</P>
      <P>How will we stand up to a modern army in some modern State?  Is the Minister satisfied that the armed forces are equipped at all to take their part with the United Nations?  In view of the statements made, I do not think so.  I propose to go into this point in more detail on the main Estimate, and there is nothing more I have to say now except that I am convinced from what has been said that we are in no position to play a part against any modern force if required to do so and therefore the lives of our soldiers are largely at stake on that account in the Congo.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with some of the matters consequential to the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate, I should like to make some remarks which would perhaps be more applicable on the main Estimate but which might have lost some of their topicality by that time.  Perhaps I would be allowed on this occasion to express the appreciation of the citizens of Cork of the work which the Army rendered in the recent flooding episode in that city.  On an occasion when a <Col N="528" /> sudden emergency arose, the rapidity with which the Army came to the assistance of the citizens was most praiseworthy.  I have nothing but the highest commendation for the efficiency and courtesy of those participating in the relief of people stranded, both pedestrians and people with vehicles. It is occasions like this which bring home to the people the advantage of having a highly-organised service available, such as is provided by the Army.</P>
      <P>With regard to the remarks of the Minister in relation to our participation in the Congo influencing the purchase of certain small arms, we may take it this development is regarded as being necessary for our troops in any action they may be called upon to participate in and that it is not solely because of the Congo.  While the people are prepared to see the State play its part in the contribution made towards financing the effort, there is a feeling that we did play our part in that respect and it would not be well received if it were found there were charges bearing on the Exchequer solely applicable to our participating in the Congo, in view of the power playing of so many other wealthier nations who did not play their part in financing the operation.  We may take it that these purchases have arisen because it has been brought home by our experience in that region that they were to the normal advantage of the Army and not particularly for that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the increases that have been awarded, there is no doubt, as Deputy Cosgrave said, they were absolutely necessary so that we could maintain the personnel we have and attract more suitable personnel by way of recruitment.  It is a matter of concern, and there was some conjecture regarding the point, that we found it difficult to get that measure of recruiting we require.  It was felt it was because there was nothing happening and that life was dull in the Army.  It was thought that with the glamour and publicity attending our participation in the Congo there would be improved recruiting.  It has been brought home to everybody that, unless men can get a suitable reward <Col N="529" /> for their service in the Army, they will not be forthcoming.  They are no longer attracted by the glamour of a uniform or the way of life in the Army because they, like everybody, must maintain families.  Unless we are prepared to pay them adequately, we cannot hope to get anything like the type we would wish to serve in the Army.</P>
    <P>There is a considerable grievance among the personnel employed by the Department of Defence in Cork harbour in regard to transport.  Some 35 men engaged on these vessels have applied for an improvement in their conditions both by way of pay and by way of more suitable working hours. The hours they are called on to work and the conditions under which they have to work are very serious.  They provide a service which is absolutely desirable.  I would ask the Minister to look into the claims that have been made by the transport section, Naval, Army and civilian, on the islands in the harbour, and to see that the claims made by these men will be favourably considered as soon as possible, so that whatever grievances may exist will be eliminated at the earliest opportunity. I hope that the voting of these additional moneys will make it possible for the Minister to go a long way towards improving their pay and conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with Deputy O'Sullivan in his comments on the matter of pay.  While I greatly rejoice that the question of pay has not been entirely ignored and that £100,000 more has now to be provided, I should not like the Minister or the Government to feel that the matter has been finally adjusted.  I need only point out that prior to the recent pay increase, there was a disparity between the pay of a commandant and that of a higher executive officer in the Civil Service of £150.  It has always been a source of grievance to Army officers that their rates of pay have been so far below those of equivalent ranks in the Civil Service.  That disparity between a commandant and a Civil Service higher executive officer has now been increased from £150 to £175, which <Col N="530" /> means that the Civil Service officer has got proportionately a higher increase than the Army officer.  The question of children's allowances is still a matter of grievance, and I hope that in the main Estimates these matters will be discussed more fully.  While I welcome the increased rates of pay we are now providing, I hope the Minister will not feel that everything has been done and everything in the garden is lovely.</P>
      <P>On the question of Subhead P&mdash; Defensive Equipment&mdash;I should like to say, in defence of the Minister, that I am absolutely satisfied that the troops sent out originally to the Congo were properly equipped for the task given to them.  I thought that the Minister made that perfectly clear.  It was not a matter of the troops being sent out inadequately equipped, but of their task being altered.  Whereas originally they went out purely on a police operation, they were subsequently instructed by the Security Council of the United Nations to use force, if necessary, to suppress a civil war.  This meant a change in the whole operation. Whereas it would have seemed aggressive, and might even have incited people to violence, if United Nations troops came in very heavily armed on the first occasion, it subsequently became necessary that the armament carried by them should be of a more offensive type.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The other forces came in well armed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>That remains to be seen.  In actual fact, I do not think there was any great disparity between the respective forces at all.  Every effort was made, as far as I understand it, to have a standard system.  It is a matter of general knowledge now that our troops in the Congo are no longer armed with the British type rifle, the Lee-Enfield, but with the Belgian FN rifle.  There is, I think, quite an unnecessry air of secrecy about the details of armament possessed and carried by our troops. I feel on this occasion the Minister might be a little more specific in his reference to the defensive equipment.  If, as appears to be the case, the great proportion of the new equipment purchased by <Col N="531" /> reason of the Congo operation was accounted for by the supply of FN rifles, many of us in this House and outside it would be interested to know that fact.</P>
      <P>I must say I take an almost unholy joy in the increase shown under subhead (Z)&mdash;Appropriations in Aid&mdash; because for several years now, I have been advocating on every Estimate that we would sell surplus and obsolete equipment.  I was therefore very glad to hear the Minister say we had at last got rid of a substantial quantity of obsolete small arms.  I do not know whether we have got rid of all we could get rid of, but I would urge the Minister to press on because as long as this equipment is kept, some unfortunate quartermaster has to look after it and a number of N.C.O's and men will be kept busy cleaning it and checking it from time to time.  The sooner we get rid of it, the better. I am delighted to see that an additional sum of £140,000 has been realised and I hope the good work will go on.</P>

      <P>There is a sum of £887 in this Supplementary Estimate in connection with the Offences Against the State Act and the Special Criminal Court.  I hope this is the last time we shall have any such Estimate before the House.  The majority of the people in this country do not realise that the Special Criminal Court is composed of men who have little or no knowledge of the law, over and above what an ordinary layman has. I say that in no sense of disrespect to the officers concerned.  They are laymen given a job which should be done by our judges in the various courts.</P>

There is no question that as far as justice was concerned, it was the last thing the defendants got. Members of the police force and of <Col N="532" /> the court consulted on what would be suitable sentences, depending on the pressure being brought to bear by the Government of the day.  That is not justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to criticise the expenditure of the sum involved.  May I put it this way: in so far as this court is concerned, the reason we are spending the money is that the Government found it necessary, in accordance with their own information, to set up a court.  The information given to them, we were told, was that the evidence would not be forthcoming to convict those men and that the question of intimidation of juries was likely to arise.  I asked what evidence was available to the Government, through the police force, that there was a danger of intimidation of juries and the reply I was given by the Minister was that there was no evidence available that juries would be intimidated.  I think it showed lack of confidence in our people; it showed lack of maturity on the part of the Government and it showed that, as far <Col N="533" /> as the general public were concerned, the Government had no confidence that Irishmen or juries&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is proceeding to criticise the setting up of these courts and as I have already pointed out to him, it is not in order to criticise an Act of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely giving the reasons why I think we do not want any more expenditure of this nature.  If I do not give the reasons why I think such courts should not be there, I cannot very well criticise the expenditure involved.  I merely want to bring it home clearly that this money need never have been spent and that justice would still have been done.  In this House and outside it, we subscribe to the Convention on Human Rights, and we criticise other countries for daring to set up such courts.  It is only fair that we should criticise ourselves for failing to see that justice is done in this country. The argument that juries would be likely to be intimidated and that evidence was not likely to be forthcoming does not hold water.</P>
      <P>I shall give an example.  There was an attempted jail break not so long ago by a number of prisoners.  Those prisoners were retried, if you like, on charges of attempting to escape but they were retried before the Special Criminal Court.  Why was it necessary to do that?  Why could they not have been brought before the ordinary courts of justice in the State?  Was it because there was no evidence forthcoming? Was there not plenty of evidence there?  Was there a question of the State being afraid juries would not do their duty in connection with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall put it as bluntly as I can. I think it was a wrong decision on the part of the Government to set up the special criminal courts.  I feel we would have less expenditure of the nature we are providing for here today, if the Government had stuck to the normal procedure of justice.  I regret to have to say that I really feel the reason why the Special Criminal Court was set up was that pressure <Col N="534" /> was brought to bear on the Government from outside the State.</P>
    <P>On the question of Subhead P&mdash; Defence Equipment&mdash;I shall not join the other Deputies on a trip to the Congo as far as conditions are concerned, but I should like the Minister to break down the figure for us: what defence equipment was involved; what proportion was small arms, such as sub-machine guns; what proportion was ammunition; and what part of it was equipment such as helmets and so forth?  Was a proportion of it armoured cars and were they purchased within the last eight months?  Were the armoured cars concerned inferior and were the troops who used them satisfied they were not inferior to the Swedish cars available to the units from the Swedish force there?  I know there was considerable satisfaction amongst the troops, earlier on, that the equipment was made available.</P>
    <P>Purely for information purposes, at this stage, I should like the Minister to break down the figures so that we would have an opportunity of making up our minds on the question.  As Deputy Booth said, there should not be too great an air of secrecy about all this.  There is no question of any secret weapon involved as far as our Army is concerned.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that full details might be given of the number of machine guns and other types of equipment purchased for this sum of £141,000 which the House is now giving to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="Mr. Jones Mr. Jones">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Jones</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention will be brief.  I join with Deputy Booth in saying I am glad some of the old equipment is being got rid of.  It is equipment that has been found to be of no value in a State with a modern Army. Consequently, it would only involve us in the expense of keeping it from going rusty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to an item in the Appropriations in Aid which deals with the sale of surplus stores and unserviceable clothing.  I should like information in respect of that item.  How much of the actual appropriation referred to small fire arms and what portion of it referred to clothing? <Col N="535" /> Some part of this surplus clothing is, I take it, uniform which has been found to be either unserviceable at present or surplus to requirements.  I hope the Minister will tell us in what fashion it is disposed of.  Is it disposed of by way of contract, for example?</P>
    <P>Another item in the Appropriations in Aid which I notice is item No. 12&mdash; Receipts on discharge by purchase.  I should like the Minister to comment on it.  Are we to take it from that that more people, for one reason or another, are seeking their discharge from the Army by way of purchase? That is what seems to be indicated by this item.</P>
    <P>Deputies have already made reference to the fact that the recruiting campaign as such has not so far met with the measure of success which everybody would desire.  I should be concerned if there were a greater tendency to be attested into the Army without being considered suitable and, if found unsuitable, their discharge is sought under this heading.</P>
    <P>In the ordinary way, we are aware that over the years our full complement of Army personnel has not been reached.  Perhaps the conditions of service, conditions of pay, and so on, did not attract young people.  This Estimate reflects an improvement of conditions and, as such, is to be welcomed. I should like the Minister to tell us something in this connection in relation to the Appropriations in Aid.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Sherwin to the type of equipment which is being bought and to which the Minister referred as coming to account at this stage though ordered on previous occasions.  I take it that the normal practice here is, as formerly, that equipment ordered in one year is not included until the next financial year and that that is all that is mentioned.</P>
    <P>I take it that the equipment available is the most modern type and that we are no worse off in that respect than any other country which is ordering light arms.  The improvement in conditions in so far as the men are concerned is to be welcomed.  It is essential that the fine tradition <Col N="536" /> which our soldiers abroad have upheld by their conduct in the Congo&mdash;and which, in some quarters, has been decried&mdash;should be maintained.  I join with other Deputies in praising their conduct there.</P>
    <P>There is one other item to which I would ask the Minister to refer, that is Subhead F&mdash;Medicines and Instruments&mdash;replacement of stores issued to the United Nations.  I take it that the £2,500 for that equipment will be recovered in due course from the organisation concerned?</P>

      <P>We shall be having the main Estimate in a short time.  I take it that I will hardly be expected to go into great detail now, seeing that the next occasion is not so far away.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, I should say that the increased pay to officers and men is effective from 1st November last.  This question about the percentage increase can be answered by saying that it is more or less in line with the percentage increases granted to the Civil Service in general.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point which he made about the ill-luck of those who retired before the effective date for the new pay rates, all I can say is that, no matter where we fixed the date, there would always be somebody on the wrong side of it.  I do not think there is anything open to me to do to remedy that position. On other occasions, the remedy was found by way of a general increase of pensions provided by the Minister for Finance.  Deputy Cosgrave also asked me to give the total payments by the United Nations.  So far, we have made three claims.  The payments under these three claims have been very little short of £600,000.</P>

    <P>Deputy Tully asked me to do what I can to preserve the good name of our soldiers.  I take it he is referring to our troops who are serving as part of the United Nations Force in the Congo.  He has given me a pretty <Col N="537" /> big task there because of the persistent desire on the part of certain newspapers to blacken not alone the Irish troops in the Congo but all the United Nations contingents there who are trying to carry out the United Nations mandate.  In the recent case the Minister for External Affairs did issue a statement, on behalf of the Government generally and particularly on behalf of our troops.</P>

    <P>Deputy Sherwin queried my reference to the payments in respect of the carry-over on deliveries of equipment from previous orders.  This is no fault of the Department because delivery dates, I understand, are outside their control.  We must take the equipment when it is offered.  That is why the subsequent payments arise.  Deputy Sherwin also questioned whether the Army was adequately equipped.  I do not know exactly what he means by that term.  It is very largely a matter of opinion nowadays, but our men in <Col N="538" /> the Congo are as well equipped with personal weapons as any other contingent in the United Nations Force. The particular weapon that has given rise to the increase for which I am seeking money is the new F.N. rifle which is essentially a personal weapon but which can be used as a sub-machinegun or as a single-shot weapon. I take it that the fact that we are in the United Nations and have a contingent serving in that Force enables us to get those weapons much sooner than, I think, would ordinarily be possible.  I understand they were only generally available some time last year.  They are very expensive weapons and we have seen to it that our units in the Congo are well equipped with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have sufficient of them at home to train our units and they are receiving training.  In fact, in anticipation of the United Nations requesting a battalion and of the request being granted by the Government, the necessary preparations are being made by the Army to fulfil it. One of the preparations is the training of men in the uses of this most modern weapon.</P>
      <P>Whether or not our troops are adequately equipped may possibly be answered to the satisfaction of Deputy Sherwin when I tell him that in the serious fighting before Christmas the most difficult task was assigned to the Irish contingent, the task concerning the tunnel which received so much publicity.  That should go some way to answer the Deputy's query and assuage his anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall have Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks about the aid given by the Cork Army units during the recent flooding in Cork passed on to the officers in the Cork Command.  As regards his questions about recruits and the suggestion that the answer would be better pay, the men now have better pay.  So far as I can find out a married man, a three star soldier, is as well off as any man in comparable employment outside, but the fact is that there are so many opportunities for employment outside that we have the usual experience of not being able <Col N="539" /> to get men in the Army when outside employment is available.</P>
    <P>In regard to the ferry service at Cork Harbour, that claim was made about January and is under consideration. It depends to some extent on a wider claim made on Cork Harbour Commissioners for somewhat similar classes of employees and when that claim has been resolved the question raised by Deputy O'Sullivan will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Booth asked about the differential between a Commandant and a Higher Executive Officer in the Civil Service before and after getting increases.  I wonder if the situation bears the interpretation he puts on it, or whether, if other advantages and perquisites were taken into consideration, there would not be a fairly general equalisation.  However, he will have a further opportunity, if he has further evidence to give on the matter, to bring it up on the main Estimate which will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan asked about the breakdown of equipment and I think I have given that information already. The main item is the purchase of the new F.N. submachine guns.  They account for the largest single item, £147,000.  There is also £69,000 for 84 m.m. recoilless anti-tank guns.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Jones's queries on the Appropriations-in-Aid, I do not think I can give him all the information he seeks particularly in regard to clothes, but the main cause of the increases has been the sale of these obsolete and obsolescent weapons.  I understand that the market is mainly in the United States where they are used for sporting purposes and that £130,000 has been realised by the sale of such weapons.  We shall probably be able to give him more detailed information on the appropriations in general when the main Estimate comes along.</P>
    <P>I do not think any other point was raised.  If there is any point with which I have not dealt adequately, it will be open to Deputies to put their questions again on the main Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £565,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health (including Oifig an ArdChláraitheora), and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities and miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>Almost wholly the need for this supplementary provision arises from the operation of the eighth round of increases in salaries and wages.  Certain increases of costs have arisen for other reasons, as I shall explain, but these are a very small part of the Supplementary Estimate and they could have been met out of savings on the Vote generally.</P>
      <P>The provision under Subhead A., covering Salaries, Wages and Allowances, is in respect of the staffs of my Department, administrative and professional. It is estimated that within the current financial year, the application of the remuneration increases to these staffs, in accordance with the increases awarded to the Civil Service generally, will cost £12,300, but against this, can be set a sum of £5,800 which will be saved as a result of vacancies in posts for which provision was made in the original Estimate.  The net requirements are thus £6,500.</P>
      <P>Under Subhead B. covering Travelling and Incidental Expenses, it is found necessary to seek an additional sum of £1,000.  This is a variation such as may arise in any year due to an unforeseen increase in activity, involving more travel by officers of the Department, principally professional officers carrying out inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Subhead G. covering Grants to Health Authorities, it is necessary to make additional provision to meet the increase in grants which follows on the increase of expenditure by health authorities in respect of remuneration of their staffs.  The original provision <Col N="541" /> under this Subhead proved to be very close to what would have been payable had not the &ldquo;8th round&rdquo; had its effect on the expenditure of the local authorities. It is estimated that increases in remuneration of local staffs will cost a total of £1,200,000.  The grant payable in support of local expenditure is at the rate of 50 per cent., which means an additional sum of £600,000, but as five per cent, of the grant is withheld until final statements of expenditure have been submitted after the close of the financial year, the amount which will fall to be issued within the year ending on 31st of this month is estimated at £570,000.</P>
    <P>The high proportion of the expenditure of health authorities which is absorbed by the remuneration of their staffs will be evident from the increase which must be faced as a result of the grant of higher salaries and wages.  The total local authority expenditure of £18,130,000 on which the requirements under this subhead were originally based included £8,800,000 in respect of salaries and wages of their own staffs.  The estimated addition of £1,200,000 brings this figure to £10,000,000.  More than 55 per cent of the expenditure in the year 1961-62 on the health services is thus attributable to the remuneration of staffs of health authorities.</P>
    <P>The additional funds sought under the subhead covering the supply of vaccine lymph are required to meet exceptional demands which arose following outbreaks of smallpox in Great Britain.  In all, additional supplies sufficient to vaccinate more than 200,000 people were purchased from abroad, and these, together with a relatively small additional item in respect of storage, account for the full amount of the supplementary provision.</P>
    <P>The items which I have mentioned comprise the total estimated additional expenditure and they amount to £581,900.  Against this amount, it has been found possible to offset a total of £16,900 made up of £4,100 on anticipated increases in receipts under the heading of Appropriations-in-Aid, and £12,800 savings on other Subheads. These off-setting items represent relatively small variations from the original <Col N="542" /> Estimates, and are such as would be expected to occur in the normal operation of a Vote of more than £9,000,000.  The net amount of the Supplementary Estimate is accordingly £565,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unusual to find a Supplementary Estimate necessary for the Department of Health and certainly it has not been common practice in recent years to introduce such an Estimate.  The Minister has said that this Supplementary Estimate is necessary because of the eighth round of wage increases and we are faced now by the necessity to find an increase of some six per cent. in the money sought at the beginning of the financial year for the provision of health services.  It seems difficult to understand why the effect of the eighth round was not contemplated when the original Estimate was brought before the House at the beginning of the financial year. Apparently it was not taken into consideration and now we must accept this increase as necessary.</P>
      <P>I should like to direct the attention of Dáil Éireann to certain facts which emerge from this Supplementary Estimate which is due chiefly to wage increases.  It appears that of a total health expenditure of roughly £18 million, close on 50 per cent. is involved in salaries and wages.  That underlines some of the criticism expressed in relation to the manner in which our health services are at the moment organised.  That 50 per cent. of what we spend on health must be devoted to salaries and wages is certainly alarming.  However, we cannot do anything about that at the moment and we can only look forward to a more sensible organisation of our health services in the future.  As they are at present constituted, apparently the sum sought by the Minister is necessary and must be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in moving this Supplementary Estimate has, of course, had regard to the effect of the eighth round on the money which he must provide by way of grant-in-aid to health authorities.  At the moment he provides 50 per cent. although he pays <Col N="543" /> only 45 per cent. in any one year. Earlier in the course of our proceedings, I questioned the Minister as to whether this year he might consider increasing the proportion of that grant-in-aid.  He found himself unable to answer that question either affirmatively or negatively.  He referred to the fact that a Select Committee of this House was considering health services and matters concerned with them.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the Minister fair notice here and now that the existence of the Select Committee on the Health Services will not be recognised by anyone on these benches as an umbrella to protect him from dealing with the effects of the health policy which he and his Government colleagues are pursuing.  It has resulted this year in an impact on rates all over the country.  The increase which necessitated this Supplementary Estimate has also been felt by every health authority throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but I am making only a passing reference to the fact that there must be, parallel with the increase for which this Supplementary Estimate is sought, a corresponding impact on the rates which certainly has meant a very substantially increased burden on every ratepayer.  When this year the eighth round brought home to the Minister that we were devoting out of the money we voted for health services almost 50 per cent. for the payment of salaries and wages, I should have thought that would lead to new thinking on the manner in which our services were organised and that as a matter of urgency a new policy would be embarked upon.  That is not to be.  We are to have a Committee. A Committee is apparently to report and advise and until such time as that is done, the Minister will not be in a position to give the simplest answer to the simplest question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> I observe that portion of the sum sought here relates to the supply of vaccine lymph.  I can understand that this sum is found necessary because of the increased demand made upon supplies by reason of the outbreak of smallpox in the neighbouring island of Great Britain.  Fortunately, we have not had an outbreak of smallpox in this country since the early years of the 1920s and let us hope that no such outbreak will take place.  By reason of the proximity of the smallpox outbreak, particularly in Wales, understandably, there has been&mdash;and very properly&mdash;an increased movement towards vaccination.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister may not be in a position to deal with this now. Possibly later on he may have some information but I should like to bring to his notice the fact that there has been a general feeling that whatever vaccine is used for these vaccinations has had a general weakening and definite reaction within ten days or so. It is commonly stated that the vaccine is either unduly strong or possibly may not be entirely suitable.  If the Minister is in a position to deal with that now, I should be obliged if he would or, perhaps, if he finds it more convenient, he might devote portion of his speech on the main Estimate to that feeling which is abroad.</P>
    <P>As I say, we cannot oppose this Supplementary Estimate.  It is unfortunate that it should be found necessary. It indicates the march of increasing costs for our health service without any corresponding increase in the standard and value of the services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants to local authorities amount to £570,000.  I think I am correct in saying that that represents approximately 45 per cent. of the total charge.  That means that the local authorities have to find approximately £600,000 to match this grant.  I wonder if the Minister might avail of the setting up of the Committee to use it as justification for a more liberal approach to this particular subhead instead of an umbrella to disclaim responsibility for the added burden the ratepayers have to bear.  I do not think he will query the fact that the total sum of approximately £1,100,000 <Col N="545" /> which has to be found by the local authorities under the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, is largely the result of the policy for which the Minister is responsible and which the Government are operating.</P>
      <P>Without going into the merits of the policy, I wonder if the Minister has not sought to obtain a larger appropriation to relieve the rates position, bearing in mind the fact that the rates part of this sum has to be found by farmers, small and large, and by business people in country towns who are not benefiting by the large outlay of public funds and quasi-public funds which is taking place in building in our cities and larger urban centres.  I often think this House has completely forgotten the circumstances of the ratepayers in the country towns.  The farmers have made known their reaction by peaceful and emphatic demonstrations in the public streets to draw the attention of the public to the fact that, while their incomes remain static, or decline, their charges in the form of rates are steadily rising.</P>

      <P>I am making the case on this Supplementary Estimate that this subhead should be enlarged as an <i>ad interim</i> measure to lighten the burden, pending the completion of the review of the whole system; and I want to draw the attention of the Minister to one section of the community that I think he has completely forgotten.  The circumstances of the small businessman in rural Ireland have been greatly exacerbated, first, by the decline in the income of the people whom he is trying to serve and, secondly, by the disappearance of 250,000 people from the country in the past five years.  These 250,000 potential customers of the country shopkeeper have left this country in the past five years, with a corresponding reduction in the volume of business these people are able to transact.  At the same time, the rates on the premises in which the business is being conducted are steadily rising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is your ruling, I shall leave the matter to germinate in the Minister's mind, as I hope it will, because, if it does not, the situation in rural Ireland will, in my opinion, become truly critical.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has mentioned vaccination lymph.  Vaccination, as a consequence of the outbreak of smallpox in Great Britain and on the Continent, has naturally expanded here.  It is only right that ample supplies of lymph should be made available.  As Deputy O'Higgins said, it is true that the lymph being used, while it produces in no case anything approximating to lethal consequences, has had the result that some children and adults reacted to it much more distressingly than has been our experience in the past.  It would be a great pity if the impression were spread abroad that, as a result of the precautionary measures at present being taken to vaccinate against smallpox, vaccination against smallpox is something more serious than it really is.  The fact is that the disturbance in health on vaccination against smallpox is normally very slight indeed, while the consequences of contracting smallpox, without ever having been vaccinated, are truly appalling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recall the grim picture painted for me by my father when he was a young medical student in this city during a smallpox outbreak in the nineteenth <Col N="547" /> century.  A young medical student who shared digs with him disappeared from the digs.  My father went looking for him and ultimately discovered him dying in one of the smallpox wards of a city hospital.  He succumbed largely because of the fact that he had never been vaccinated, whereas others who had been vaccinated, even in very early childhood, got the disease in a very mild form, and those who took the prudent precaution of repeating vaccination came unscathed through the epidemic.</P>
    <P>Smallpox has become so rare that people are inclined to forget all the horrors that attend on the disease when the patient has never been vaccinated. It is a good thing to emphasise the gravity of that danger and, at the same time, to remove, in so far as it is within the Minister's power, any widespread impression arising from the use of the present lymph supply that there is any serious inconvenience in being properly vaccinated.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister had time fully to explain to what exactly the deficiency in the recoupment from the American Grant Counterpart Fund in regard to technical assistance is due.  Is it that the Counterpart Fund is exhausted and that part of the appropriation for health has simply got to fall on the Supply Services?</P>
    <P>I do not know that there is any other matter to which I wish to refer but I should be glad if, in answering, the Minister would touch on the points to which I have referred.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I merely wish to plead with the Minister to consider increasing the amount of the grant to local authorities.  At present, it is on a 50/50 basis and it is becoming increasingly difficult for local authorities to meet the various subventions they are called upon to meet.  A large part of the increases local authorities have to pay are due to policy initiated by the Minister and his Department. An example of that is the raising of the ceiling from £500 to £800 which means that an increasing number of people <Col N="548" /> have now to be admitted to institutions at some nominal fee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that some national policy is desirable in evolving effective measures to ensure that smallpox is not introduced into this country.  I appreciate that the Minister and his officials are doing everything they possibly can in that respect.  I appreciate the active measures taken.  The Minister told me in reply to a question recently that he did not think it was possible to ensure that no smallpox would be introduced into this country from Wales.  Wales is not very far from Rosslare Harbour.  In the changing circumstances of our modern world, we are exposed to considerable risk. Numbers of visitors come in here now as compared with the not so distant past.  There has not been a case of smallpox here for over 60 years.  There was no threat until quite recently.  It is well to appreciate that the threat is there of smallpox invasion into Europe and its subsequent entry into this country.  It can be brought in here by Asian visitors.</P>

On subhead C., Fees to Counsel, an additional £18,000 is required.  There are two items I might mention, Shanahan's Stamps, £10,560, and O'Donovan v. the Attorney-General, £2,560.  On subhead D., General Law Expenses, an additional £8,000 is required.  The main item in the excess here is costs of £6,920 awarded against the State in O'Donovan v. the Attorney-General. Another item is Cowan v. the Attorney-General, £1,500.  In subhead E., Defence of Public Servants, the additional sum required is £1,200.

    <P>As the House is aware, we had on the Order Paper, in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, a motion dealing with some of the matters which are taken in this Supplementary Estimate. As the Minister has indicated, the Supplementary Estimate deals largely with the Singer case and the ramifications arising out of it.  Our motion dealt solely with that case and called upon the Dáil to condemn the Government for their failure to bring charges against Dr. Singer before the courts in such appropriate legal form <Col N="550" /> as would enable the courts to give effective judgment on such charges.</P>
    <P>You, Sir, as Ceann Comhairle, have ruled in your wisdom that such a motion goes beyond what Standing Orders permit.  While we might differ with you on that ruling, I want to make it clear that we in this Party have always accepted the rulings of the Chair as being final.  One of the matters about which, all through the years, we have been very careful has been to ensure that the rulings of the Chair are supported, by our votes in the lobby, if necessary.  That is a course which we, I am glad to say, have always followed but which other Parties in the House have not always followed if it did not suit their convenience. Indeed, I well remember one case in which the Taoiseach himself was prepared to subordinate his principles for temporary petty expedients, and to walk into what I am sure he now realises was the wrong Division Lobby.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, you having ruled in this fashion, we bring the matter about which we and the country as a whole have such reason to complain before the House in this motion to refer back for reconsideration Vote 18 in respect of Law Charges, which the Minister for Finance has now introduced. The question of Shanahan Stamp Auctions and Dr. Singer and the charges that are made against him were considered somewhat by the House on the Estimate for Law Charges last year on 20th July, 1961. Some things were said then which I must now repeat so that everyone can understand clearly and beyond question that the same observations apply.</P>
    <P>I want to make clear that in condemning the Government&mdash;for of course a motion to refer back an Estimate is tantamount to that&mdash;we are not in any way casting any reflection or aspersion in any shape or form on any judgment of any court.  The courts have given their verdict on the evidence that was brought before them and on the evidence that was brought according to the forms in which the Executive brought it.  Our complaint is not against the courts, and nothing that I shall say can in any possible <Col N="551" /> circumstances be construed, or could or should be construed, as in any way a criticism of the courts or of their decisions.</P>
    <P>What we complain of, and what we accuse the Government of, is their failure as the Executive to bring before the courts the proper legal form of the charges which should have been brought.  We all understand, whether we are lay people or whether we are lawyers, that matters being brought before any court on any subject, be it criminal or civil, have to be brought before them in the appropriate and proper form.  So far as criminal law is concerned I am in just the same position as many other Deputies in the House.  I know nothing of criminal law; I have never practised in criminal law; and I do not propose to pose as an expert in any way in criminal law.</P>
    <P>It is an undoubted fact that the constitutional position which we have here, as in most other democratic States, lays upon the Executive, for the time being, the duty and the obligation of bringing to the Judiciary those charges and that evidence which the Executive feel are relevant and proper, if any person&mdash;I was going to use the word &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; but it is not necessary that it be a citizen&mdash;has contravened the law of the land.</P>
    <P>Equally, it would be quite disastrous to our good name here if we were to attempt to decide in Dáil Éireann whether or not Dr. Singer was or was not guilty of any charges.  I do not propose to do so.  I do not propose to ask the Dáil to make any comment whatsoever in that respect.  The people can come to their own conclusions from such evidence as would be available, if it were put in appropriate and proper form before the courts. According to the question answered today, question No. 82, this case was before the courts in one form or another for 240 days, not all of the day perhaps, in certain cases, but on no fewer than 240 days the time of a court was taken up in connection with it.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that there was involved in the complaints made a sum of at least £750,000.  Some would put the figure a little higher but certainly <Col N="552" /> no one can gainsay that the charges in all covered at least £750,000.  It transpired in the course of the hearing of these charges that some 30,000 people were involved; that 30,000 people, the vast majority of whom were Irish citizens resident in Ireland, had invested money in Shanahan's Stamp Auctions.  The germ of the case by the Executive was that these people had not got a fair run for their money, putting it in non-legal terms.  This case, as I say, involving that sum of money and that number of our people, was one in which it clearly behoved the Executive to take every possible precaution to ensure that it succeeded in bringing to the courts all the surrounding circumstances and facts in such a way that the most exacting court could take no possible objection.</P>
    <P>We all subscribe to the view that according to the law, a person is innocent until he is proved guilty.  As I say, without going into the question of guilt or innocence, the very magnitude of the case, both as to the amount of money involved and the number of our people involved, laid a very much heavier and more stringent burden on the Executive to ensure that everything possible that could be done was done to give the courts a free and unfettered opportunity of judging on the merits the facts surrounding this case.</P>
    <P>Under the Constitution, there is a clear and express duty imposed upon the Taoiseach to ensure that as head of the Executive, he brings those facts to the notice of the courts in the appropriate way because to him and him alone&mdash;not to the Government as a whole, but to him and him alone&mdash; is left the duty of choosing the first law officer of the Executive.  It is with the Taoiseach and no one else is left the job and the task of selecting an Attorney General, just as it is the task of the Attorney General to ensure, as the guardian of the public interest, that he brings the facts and the evidence to the court in proper legal form.</P>
    <P>It is therefore no excuse for any member of the Government or for the Taoiseach himself to say that it is not in any way connected with their <Col N="553" /> functions as an Executive.  It is the head of the Government, because he is the head of the Government, who has the responsibility and the task of choosing the first law officer of the State, and if the first law officer of the State does not fulfil the task with which he is entrusted, it is the duty of the Taoiseach to ensure that such failure is made good and to make certain that the public weal cannot be disturbed thereby.</P>
    <P>In this case, the Executive brought to the court in the initial instance a series of charges.  I shall not weary the House by going over all the charges or by going over the various periods and dates involved.  Suffice it to say that it took no fewer than 63 days for the taking of the first depositions, before those depositions were concluded.</P>
    <P>One of my charges against the Government in respect of that is that they did not take adequate care at all to ensure that during those 63 difficult days, adequate precautions would be taken to present the charges in proper form before the courts.  The Minister for Finance has, at the instance of the Minister for Justice, agreed that the ordinary precaution in a case of this size in that respect was not taken, that the Attorney General did not instruct any counsel to act for him in the district court and that is one of the reasons why the indictments that followed were not followed in due and proper order.</P>
    <P>Having, as I said, taken 63 days and wasted and taken up the time and the expense of the district court, quite apart from the cost otherwise for that hearing, a trial followed after a considerable delay.  The Taoiseach was naive enough to expect the House and the people, apparently, to believe that the delay between January and May for the hearing of the indictments following that district court hearing was due solely to the difficulty of typing copies of the depositions.  No matter how long they might be, anybody knows that it would have been perfectly simple to get photostatic copies in a very short time, perhaps, admittedly, at the expense of deferring <Col N="554" /> other matters that were required. Perhaps it would have meant taking over one of the machines from one of the other courts, but in a case of this size, it was not merely desirable but essential that proper steps should have been taken to ensure that there would be no complaint of delay.  There was that delay.</P>
    <P>There was then a trial.  At that trial, there was a conviction by the court, and that went on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Anyone who has read the judgment in respect of the Court of Criminal Appeal, as, I am sure, many members of the House have read it when it was placed in the Library, can only come, from reading that with a clear view, to the conclusion that the court was passing stricture on the law officers of the State for the manner in which they drew their indictments and for the manner in which they, by so doing, prevented the courts from passing judgment on the merits of the case.</P>
    <P>In the early part of the judgment, the judge himself remarked how essential it was in a case of that magnitude to make sure that more than usual care was taken, but in fact, as appears from this judgment, no charge of false pretences was laid at all: in fact, as appears from this judgment and from the statement made by the Taoiseach the other day, no effort was made to inform the court in open court that one of the jurymen was an investor in Shanahan's Stamps; and, in fact, as appears from the judgment, no effort was made to frame an indictment applicable to the case of a person dealing with money which had not come into his own hands but had come into the hands of a company with which he himself was dealing.</P>
    <P>The judgment that has been written on these three items alone makes it clear that the court in passing judgment not merely passed judgment on the conviction as such but passed critical judgment on the manner in which the charges had been framed, and the Taoiseach himself accepted last Tuesday that the ultimate responsibility for the framing of the charges must and did lie with the Attorney General. <Col N="555" /> Without going into details or further technicalities, there are the facts that the Executive considered there were charges involving £750,000 and that there were charges in respect of which no fewer than 30,000 people felt they had a complaint, and yet according to the verdict of the court, the indictments were not so drawn as to enable the courts to pass judgment on the merits of the facts before it.</P>
    <P>That failure can be laid in one place and one place only&mdash;on the Government. If people here cannot now categorically say that, according to a court judgment, they were defrauded, cannot say that, according to a court judgment, their case had merits, then the failure can only be laid and must be laid at the door of the Government, who failed to bring those charges before the courts in the proper and accepted legal form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand very well the desire of the Fine Gael Party to make all the party political capital they can out of the unsatisfactory outcome of this trial.  I gather that the suggestion which Deputy Sweetman wants to put before the House is that either because of lack of enthusiasm in the prosecution of Singer and his accomplices by the Government or lack of professional competence on the part of the Attorney General the unexpected and unforeseen results of which we are aware came about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Singer came to Ireland about 1954, at a time when another Government were in office and Deputy Sweetman was a member of it.  During that time, he set up with those Irish associates of his, this stamp auctioneering business, which developed on a considerable scale and attracted a great deal of public attention at that time.  It was not until after the change of Government, indeed some time after it, that suspicions began to develop that the business was not being conducted in a straightforward way.  I want to say that the first person with public responsibilities who began to develop those suspicions was the present Attorney General, and it was he who <Col N="556" /> requested an investigation by the Garda Síochána into the manner in which this business was being conducted prior to the robbery, or the alleged robbery, which put the business into liquidation.  It was the Attorney General who decided that proceedings should be instituted against those who participated in the conduct of that company, and who took steps to secure the arrest of Singer and the others at a time when the investigations by the Garda Síochána, although they had produced <i>prima facie</i> evidence of fraud, had not yet turned up sufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution, fearing as he did that Singer might abscond; and the long delay to which Deputy Sweetman refers was partly attributable to that fact, that an arrest to prevent an abscondment had been made, although inquiries had not been completed or all the depositions of witnesses recorded.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is, of course, although not a member of the Government, in much the position of a Minister, in that he has to take ultimate responsibility for all acts done in his name, whether or not he directly participated in them or was even in fact aware of them at the time of their commitment.  It is the normal practice for the Attorney General when a criminal case arises for prosecution to designate counsel to act in the case and to leave to the counsel whom he so designates the preparation of the indictment.  The normal practice was followed in this case.  When questions were asked in this House last week, Deputy Sweetman said that it was common knowledge that the indictment in this case was drawn up by the Attorney General personally.  I notice he did not repeat that this afternoon. Possibly he has learned some of the facts since.  That statement was untrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I still say it is common knowledge and, let me add, if the Attorney-General did not examine a case involving £750,000, in my view, he was even more criminally negligent in not doing so.  A Minister would do so in the case of his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="557" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General, quite properly, left the drawing of the indictment to the very competent senior counsel he had engaged to conduct the State case.  That is, as I say, the normal practice.  The Attorney General is available for consultation with the counsel whom he engages, if they desire it.  But, the attempt to attack the Attorney General purely on the suggestion that the preparation of the indictment in this case was something he did&mdash;and the implication is that he did it in a way different from that which the counsel whom he engaged would have done it&mdash;is completely without foundation.</P>
      <P>Let me be quite clear in this matter. I do not accept that there was anything wrong, and I hope indeed to convince the House there was nothing wrong with the indictment and certainly there is no foundation for the suggestion that it was so drawn that a conviction could not be secured.  It is true, as Deputy Sweetman said, that in our system of law a person is assumed to be innocent until convicted in accordance with the law.  It would, I agree, also be undesirable that we should use the privilege we have here to make statements about the guilt of individuals which had not been established in any court, but in this particular case I think the Ceann Comhairle can allow us a certain discretion because we are aware of the fact that Singer was indeed convicted of the majority of the charges which were made against him, even though that conviction was ultimately set aside on technical grounds by the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Sweetman was inclined to gloss over the details of what happened during and subsequent to the trial of Singer.  I presume he has read the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I urged him and his leader, Deputy Dillon, to do so. Singer was indicted on 21 counts.  Three of these were counts of criminal conspiracy and 16 were counts of fraudulent conversion.  I may say here that <Col N="558" /> from the beginning the counsel acting for the State in the matter had serious doubts about the possibility of obtaining enough evidence to secure convictions on the fraudulent conversion counts.  In our system of law, it is not enough merely to suspect a person is guilty; that guilt must be established in a court by evidence of a kind which is admissible in law.  To prove fraudulent conversion it is necessary to establish that money received by a person for one purpose was used by him improperly for a different purpose.</P>
      <P>In this particular case of Shanahan's Stamp Auctions, it was necessary to establish that money received by the company or its directors from the investors, as they were called, from persons who had advanced or loaned money to them for the purchase of stamps to be subsequently auctioned, was used instead to make payments in the form of alleged profits earned by previous investors.  It is believed that is what happened, but the difficulties of proving it are obvious when it is realised that all the moneys received by the company, whether in the form of investments or loans or profits, were held in one fund from which all payments were made.  I mention this fact now because it will become relevant in the general survey of the case I am going to give.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say, however, that in the first trial of Singer convictions were recorded on all the counts of fraudulent conversion.  It was clear, however, from the beginning that the State would have to rely mainly on the possibility of securing conviction on one or other of the three counts of conspiracy.  I may perhaps refer to these briefly because again there is an aspect of them which will later be seen to be important.  Each of the three counts alleged conspiracy to defraud over a period of time ending on the 23rd May, 1959.  The first count alleged conspiracy in the period beginning on the 1st January, 1958; the second count alleged conspiracy in the period beginning on the 1st January, 1959; and the third count in the period beginning 12th October, 1954.  When the trial was over and the issues were being put to the jury, counsel for the State asked <Col N="559" /> the jury to convict Singer on the first and second of these counts, to convict him in respect of the period beginning on 1st January, 1958, and ending in May, 1959, or in respect of the period beginning on 1st January, 1959, and ending in May, 1959, and not to convict on count No. 3 in respect of the period beginning on 12th October, 1954.  But the trial judge directed the jury to find Singer not guilty on counts one and two and left it open to them to convict him on the third count, which they did.</P>
    <P>It is, Sir, against the practice of this House to express here any criticism of the decisions of our courts and of the judiciary and you have, in fact, advised me that these rules, which apply on all occasions, will apply equally during this debate.  I therefore will not express any personal view upon that decision of the trial judge, but I will direct the attention of Deputies to what the Court of Criminal Appeal said about it.  They held that in so directing the jury the trial judge went wrong.  In the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, it was pointed out that the jury could not, on the evidence which was produced, have found conspiracy to exist before 1958.  They said the jury should have been told that the evidence did not warrant an inference of conspiracy charged earlier than 1958.  They should have been advised that their verdict should have been on count No. 1 and that the other counts should have been ignored.  In fact, as I mentioned, the trial judge directed the jury to find the accused not guilty on these first two counts of conspiracy and in respect of them a verdict of not guilty was returned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>By direction.  There was then an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal by the accused on three grounds.  Two of those grounds were rejected by the court and therefore are not relevant here.  On the third ground, the court held that the trial should be set aside and a new trial ordered.  That was because it was found that the foreman of the jury was an <Col N="560" /> investor in Shanahan's Stamp Auction Company.  That is a fact which was not known before the trial concluded. Deputy Sweetman seemed to imply differently in the course of his remarks.  It was not in fact known by anybody&mdash;I mentioned this here in reply to a Parliamentary Question&mdash;and if we are to accept the affidavit of the accused it was not known to Singer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>He said so himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said was that the foreman of the jury was employed by a firm of auditors and one member of that firm had been appointed Liquidator for the auctioneering company but that had no relevance to the appeal.  That particular fact was known to the trial judge who regarded it as of no importance.  The appeal was on the ground that the foreman was an investor in the stamp company and therefore presumed to be a claimant on the assets of the company.  I do not know why that fact did not become known before that.  It is, I think, a common experience of all of us that people who invested money in this company are not disposed to talk about it.  The Court of Criminal Appeal said:</P>
      <P>The juror should have informed the court of his position as investor and claimant...</P>
      <P>and then went on to say:</P>
      <P>It is very desirable that in a case of this kind the trial judge should remind members of the jury panel of their duty to disclose any interest they may have in the prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I say as a layman&mdash;I am not in this expressing any criticism of the court&mdash;that I find it difficult to understand how it is that a person who is charged with a criminal offence and who has a right to challenge members of the jury empanelled to try him&mdash; to challenge, I understand, five of them peremptorily and any number without limit for cause shown&mdash;and does not exercise that right of challenge though the trial judge reminds him that he has it, can nevertheless, when the trial is over, seek to upset the verdict because of the composition of the jury.  That has been held however <Col N="561" /> to be the law and there is probably good legal theory why it should be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not an equal responsibility on the prosecution to examine the <i>bona fides</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly a prosecution has that right.  The jury members are selected from a panel of the jurors' list by the county registrar and brought to the court where the prosecution and the defence can challenge them and where the supervision of the proceedings is the responsibility of the trial judge.  Let me deal with the precise allegation in Deputy Sweetman's statement that the indictment of Singer was so drawn that the courts could not in fact have brought in a conviction.  As I have said, there was in fact a conviction recorded&mdash; on one conspiracy count and on the fraudulent conversion counts&mdash;and that would have stood but for the Court of Criminal Appeal deciding to set the trial aside because of this fact that a member of the jury was found to have this personal interest in the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When ordering a new trial&mdash;and that was the only question that arose by reason of this defect in the composition of the jury &mdash;the Court of Criminal Appeal turned to consider the charges that should apply in a new trial and here they came up against this outcome of the previous trial to which I have referred&mdash;the acquittal of the accused on the direction of the judge on two of the conspiracy charges, the count in respect of the period from January, 1958, to May, 1959, and from January, 1959, to May, 1959.  They adverted to the fact that no evidence of conspiracy prior to 1958 had been produced and therefore decided not <Col N="562" /> merely that the conviction in respect of the longer period&mdash;from October, 1954 to October, 1959&mdash;could not stand but that in fact Singer could not be put on trial again on the conspiracy count.</P>
      <P>Again let me say as a layman, that I cannot make sense out of it. I suppose I do not have to, but I ask why, if a trial is upset because of a defect in the composition of a jury and a verdict of guilty set aside, a verdict of not guilty should stand? No doubt there is a legal explanation but as a layman with some commonsense, I cannot see why it should be so.  The Court of Criminal Appeal set aside also another charge which related to the general deficiency in the funds of the company.  I am not going to try to give a simple explanation of what is involved here.  I gather that in cases of fraudulent conversion it is considered that charges should relate to specific sums of money and that it is only in very rare cases that a charge of general deficiency is accepted.</P>
      <P>If I could attempt to put that in plain, layman's language, it would mean that if a person received money for a particular purpose and did not use it for that purpose he could still be convicted of fraudulent conversion if it could be proved that he just had not got the money anyway.  It is rare that courts permit a general deficiency charge of that kind.  There are numerous legal rules and precedents in the matter and the courts prefer to have specific charges relating to exact sums of money, improperly diverted to purposes other than those for which they were made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Court of Criminal Appeal then ordered the re-trial of Singer on three specific charges of fraudulent conversion. In the first trial of Singer the indictment drawn by State Counsel not only stood but it procured a conviction.  At the second trial that indictment did not matter.  He was tried on the specific charges contained in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  As I said, there was, from the beginning, serious doubts in the minds of State Counsel whether in fact sufficient evidence to make these charges stand could be <Col N="563" /> produced in court and, as we now know, during the course of the trial the judge, a different trial judge, stopped the proceedings and ordered the acquittal of the accused on the ground that the State could not succeed by reason of the inadequacy of the evidence available.</P>
    <P>I suppose everybody in this House and probably most of the people in the country, believes that because of these unforeseeable complications and legal technicalities, a criminal has escaped his due deserts.  The question which I have asked myself and which I have discussed with the legal advisers of the Government&mdash;and it seems to me to be really the only relevant question that arises at this stage&mdash;is whether, arising out of our experience in this case, there is a need to carry out a general review of the practice in our courts in the trial of criminal cases of this character.  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>That procedure for the trial of criminals in such cases is the outcome of long practice and a great deal of thought.  It is, of course, designed, and very deliberately designed, to protect the interests of accused persons. It is based upon the belief that it is far better to take the risk of a criminal escaping justice than the risk of an innocent man being wrongly convicted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman made it clear that this matter is being raised here by him, and this reflection made upon the professional competence of the Attorney General, for Party motives.  So far as I know, there is no precedent for a question of this kind being raised in this House.  I think it would be highly undesirable that such a precedent should be established now.</P>
    <P>There have been instances before, and I am sure there will be again, of criminals escaping punishment by reasons of court decisions that their indictment was wrongly prepared.  I recollect one such case, which aroused a great deal of publicity at the time, during the lifetime of the first Coalition Government.  Certain people, charged with fraud&mdash;in connection, I think, with the running of greyhounds&mdash; escaped trial by reason of a court's <Col N="564" /> decision that the indictment was wrongly drawn.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was not raised here.  There was a feeling that even if the incident could be turned to political advantage, no attempt to do so should be made.  If cases of this kind are to be made the subject of Party political debates in the Dáil or if, worse still, some attempt should be made here to re-try cases of which the courts have disposed it could create very great difficulty for law enforcement in this country.</P>
      <P>In the United States of America they have developed a practice of trying criminals in the newspapers before they ever get to the courts.  That is bad and it will never be allowed to develop here.  But, to re-try cases by politicians after the courts have dealt with them, would be a great deal worse.</P>
      <P>So far, therefore, as Deputy Sweetman has made suggestions against the Government&mdash;or, through the Government, against the Attorney General&mdash; I want to say this and only this: We instituted the proceedings in this case. These proceedings were pursued vigorously and persistently.  I make no apology for the length of time involved.  That indicates the persistence with which the State sought to secure the penalties we thought appropriate to the offences.</P>
      <P>We entrusted the conduct of this case in the courts to very highly competent counsel who used every legitimate legal device and every argument open to them to secure conviction. There is no foundation for the suggestion that, by reason of any defect in the indictment or any lack of vigour in the manner in which the case was prosecuted, the courts were prevented from arriving at an effective verdict.</P>

      <P>I want to say only one thing further.  There was a suggestion here during the course of our exchanges at Question Time last week that there should be some sympathy for the one member of this conspiracy who was convicted.  I think that is just maudlin sentimentality. That person who is now in jail, having been convicted of being in this conspiracy, is properly there.  The fact that another person involved in the conspiracy succeeded by legal technicalities in avoiding his punishment is no reason whatever why the other person's punishment should be mitigated.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has chosen to travel all over the countryside in his effort to cover up a fact&mdash; a fact which, I suggest, he confirmed in the course of his speech.  I took a note when the Taoiseach was speaking. I believe I quote him correctly when I say that he stated categorically: &ldquo;Dr. Singer was in fact convicted but his conviction was set aside on technical grounds.&rdquo;  That is the burden of our complaint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want and I do not believe any Deputy in this House wants to re-try a defendant in Dáil Éireann.  We interpreted the Ceann Comhairle's ruling on this matter in the narrowest possible sense.  Perhaps Deputy Sweetman might have had more to say if we did not accept the Ceann Comhairle's ruling in its most literal and restrictive sense.  But we <Col N="566" /> certainly think that no useful purpose is to be served by any attempt to re-try a person charged before the criminal courts, either before or after his conviction, whether he is acquitted or convicted, in Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, I think, unbecomingly, has chosen to speak of a desire to raise this matter for base political Party purposes. If I have any reason to blame myself, it is for the excessive reluctance with which we brought this matter before Dáil Éireann and the consequent delay which would be inexplicable on any grounds other than that we fully appreciated the gravity of this situation and very carefully weighed the public duty that devolved upon us to embark on this inquiry which is certainly not agreeable to me nor to any member on this side of the House.  But the fact that the public duty may be disagreeable does not acquit the Opposition of responsibility for discharging it.  When the Taoiseach says that &ldquo;Singer was in fact convicted but his conviction was set aside on technical grounds,&rdquo; I conceive it to be the duty of the Opposition to call those facts in question in Dáil Éireann and to say: &ldquo;How is it that the law officers of the State failed to bring a case to the courts in a form that would make it impossible for a convicted criminal to have his conviction set aside on technical grounds?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the technical ground.  The technical ground was the presence on the jury of this investor in the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The full gravity of the matter is borne out by the protestation on the Taoiseach's part of the effect it has had on his mind when he said that when he came to read the story of the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, his first reaction was: &ldquo;If this is the law, we ought to change it.&rdquo; If that is the reaction of the Taoiseach who I have no reason to believe was a subscriber to these funds, how much more might that be the reaction of thousands of defrauded people up and down the country.  Lest the whole administration of law in this country should be brought into disrepute <Col N="567" /> by failure to understand where responsibility in this matter truly lies, we have, with profound reluctance, decided that the proper thing was to bring the facts before Dáil Éireann and seek full clarification; but I think the Taoiseach has inadvertently provided this when he says: &ldquo;Singer was in fact convicted but his conviction was set aside on technical grounds.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He asks: &ldquo;Do the Opposition suggest a lack of enthusiasm on the part of the Government or a lack of competence on the part of the Attorney General?&rdquo; Something was lacking in the way this matter was brought to the courts because this is certain, that Singer is now disporting himself in Spanish sunshine at a time when thousands of poor people here have been defrauded and the facts of Singer's conduct of Shanahans' Stamp Auctions have never been passed upon by any court of criminal law on their merits.  The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal&mdash;which the Taoiseach has enunciated&mdash;was: &ldquo;On technical grounds, we must set aside the conviction,&rdquo; and Singer is in Spain.</P>
      <P>I do not feel the Taoiseach's righteous indignation that anyone should demur to the fact that Singer is cavorting in Spain in conditions of great affluence, while Shanahan, his innocent tool, is doing 15 months hard labour in Mountjoy is justified.  Perhaps that is incomprehensible sentimentality on my part, but I do not think so.  I should like to see equal justice done to everybody but I think it is a cruel joke that the servant of a principal should serve a term in jail and that, because the conviction of the principal was set aside on technical grounds, he should be honeymooning in Spain.  I think there is a contrast between these two things which calls for indignation at the lack of that which would have enabled the criminal courts of this country to pass on the merits of the charges brought against Singer in respect of what he did in connection with Shanahans' Stamp Auctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that it is a good system of law, one that I love, that a man is deemed in this <Col N="568" /> country to be innocent, unless and until the State can prove him guilty. I should have no complaint, no matter how deeply I felt, or 1,000 others felt that a criminal was guilty, if a jury of 12 citizens of this State, having heard the evidence, decided he was innocent.  If he put himself upon the country and had been acquitted by 12 fellow countrymen, that would satisfy me whether I agreed with the verdict or not.  What I object to, and what I think a great many people in the country legitimately object to, is that in the words of the Taoiseach, &ldquo;Singer was, in fact, convicted but his conviction was set aside on technical grounds.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now the Taoiseach has sought to say that the Attorney-General chose counsel and left to counsel the drawing of the indictments.  It is not my job or the job of any other member of Dáil Éireann to dictate to the Attorney General how he does his business, how he discharges the duty of his office any more than the Taoiseach has a right to say: &ldquo;I told a principal officer in my department to do that and he did not do it.&rdquo;  That is no defence.  In many ways, it makes the discharge of our duty in this matter all the more onerous and disagreeable that the Attorney General is not a member of Dáil Éireann.  It would be very much easier if he were present and in a position to answer for himself, but he is the nominee and, in constitutional terms, the creature&mdash;that is a word I employ with no intention of personal disrespect&mdash;of the Taoiseach and it is the Taoiseach who must answer for the due performance of his duties to this House.</P>
    <P>It is not open to the Attorney General to say: &ldquo;These indictments were drawn by somebody else; I knew nothing about them.&rdquo;  It was his duty when he was charging a man with fraudulent conversion and conspiracy relating to over £1,000,000 of our people's money&mdash;and that very largely drawn from poor people&mdash;to concern himself at every stage that all the facts would be brought before the criminal courts in a form which would give a jury of 12 men and women unbreakable seisin of those <Col N="569" /> facts to give a verdict on them.  That is where the Attorney General failed because he brought the facts&mdash;by himself or by another&mdash;before the court in a form which resulted in Singer being convicted but his conviction being set aside on technical grounds.</P>
    <P>I do not want to follow the Taoiseach all over the lot; I do not think any very useful purpose would be served by that.  The Taoiseach admits that he is not a lawyer.  I am a member of the Bar but I have never practised; therefore I am in identical circumstances with the Taoiseach, having no theoretical or practical experience of the administration of the criminal law. But, when the Taoiseach says to-day that the long delay between the district court proceedings and the presentation of the case to the Central Criminal Court was due to the necessity of typing an infinity of documents, that does not seem to correspond with what he told me before.  What he said today was that the delay was largely due&mdash;I think I quote him correctly&mdash;to the fact that the Attorney General, knowing or believing there was a criminal at work in the country, directed what might be described as his premature arrest in order to prevent the possibility of his decamping before the Attorney General could bring him to justice and that the delay between the district court proceedings and the proceedings in the higher court was due to the fact that the case was not complete, that the Attorney General was still urging the Gardaí to gather up all the information so that the case could be fully brought before the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>That is what I understood the Taoiseach to say and I must meet the Taoiseach when he makes this affirmation and advances this additional evidence of diligence and competence on the part of the Attorney General.  His case to-day was that the Attorney General in dealing with this situation had Singer prematurely arrested and was embarrassed by that because he could not proceed from the district court to the Central <Col N="570" /> Criminal Court as promptly as he otherwise would because he really had arrested Singer before all the evidence was in the hands of the Gardaí. He told me on a previous occasion that the reason for the delay was the excessive quantity of documents that required to be typed and copied. Either story is true but both cannot be true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that, instead of allowing this undue delay which arose between the proceedings in the district court and the court above, adjournment of the district court proceedings had not been resorted to until the full mass of evidence which the Attorney General proposed to deploy had been ready for deployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into an extensive criticism of all the faults that might be found in the conduct of these proceedings because I think the heart and kernel of them has been conceded by the Taoiseach when he said: &ldquo;Singer was, in fact, convicted but his conviction was set aside on technical grounds.&rdquo;  That is the fault of the Attorney General and he cannot escape it but I do feel bound, in view of the road that has been travelled by the Taoiseach, to go this far: Here were criminal proceedings the introduction to which required 60 days in the district court taking depositions.  The fruit of those 60 days' depositions was a collection of documents, materials and exhibits so vast that to copy them produced an unprecedented delay.  The Attorney General is charged with the responsibility of the prosecution of the criminal law.  The proceedings in the district court were conducted without counsel.  At the end of 60 days of depositions with many exhibits counsel are presented, when they are nominated by the Attorney General for the prosecution in this matter in the Central Criminal Court, with a mountain <Col N="571" /> of material no line or paragraph of which they have ever seen before, all of which has been extracted over a period of 60 days' proceedings in the district court.  Having no knowledge whatever of the atmosphere in which they were extracted and having no opportunity of acquiring that familiarity with the story as it unfolded in the course of evidence given, counsel were required to digest this mass of documents and exhibits, never having sat a single day in the district court where these proceedings were going on.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to say this as Leader of the principal Opposition Party in this House.  I would bear with a great deal of left handedness on the part of the Attorney General before I would think of bringing such a matter as this before the House.  I can conceive of any man making a mistake.  If in a minor case it appeared to me that a slip-up by the Attorney General had resulted in a guilty man going free, I would argue very strongly with my colleagues that it was the last resort to which we should not have recourse unless the matter was one of the utmost gravity.</P>
    <P>Let us not disguise it.  We have discussed this matter between us with the gravest sense of responsibility before deciding on the course which we deem it our duty to adopt.  We took that decision because we believe: (1) that this case was one of outstanding gravity, that there had been a grievous bungling of the whole business; and (2) that so grave a confusion as has here arisen, resulting in the Taoiseach's statement that Singer was, in fact, convicted but that his conviction was set aside on technical grounds, was calculated to create in the minds of our people a wholly undesirable attitude to the administration of law in this country.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach is all wrong when he tries to shuffle off responsibility for this mess from the Attorney General on to the judge or the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I think he admits by his own affirmation that the fault lies with whoever is ultimately responsible for the indictment upon which this man was brought before <Col N="572" /> the criminal court, that is, the Attorney General.  From every point of view, it is infinitely more desirable that we should face the disagreeable duty of fixing responsibility where it belongs rather than leave it in the minds of people that there is something radically wrong with the judicial system of this country.  I do not think there is; I think the courts function well.  I think the guilty are made to answer and the innocent are set free.  We have every reason to be glad of the judiciary and the standards they maintain in the administration of the law.</P>
    <P>We saw how dangerous the facts of this case are to the whole judicial system.  We felt that the proper remedy was to use Parliament for the purpose for which it is designed, to ventilate a public evil, fix responsibility clearly and invite whoever was responsible, however exalted, to take the appropriate course which, I think, the acceptance of responsibility involves&mdash;an acknowledgement that his error has been so great that he conceives it his duty to withdraw into the honourable practice of a profession which he has adorned but in the practice of which his experience manifestly does not fit him for the responsibility of the Attorney General's office.</P>
    <P>We charge the Taoiseach, as head of the Government and as the nominator of the present Attorney General, to inform the Attorney General of what has passed here.  We say this, as we are bound to say it. Just as we repudiate the right of the Attorney General to shuffle off his responsibility saying he employed counsel to represent him, we say to the Taoiseach: &ldquo;You have no right to shuffle off your responsibility.&rdquo;  It is for the Taoiseach to answer to Dáil Éireann for what has happened here. We say that if Singer was, in fact, convicted and his conviction was set aside on technical grounds, in the last analysis, responsibility for that situation is the Taoiseach's and it is the duty of Dáil Éireann to ensure him for his failure to discharge that responsibility efficiently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words not so much on the question of Singer's guilt as upon the question of law costs.  In my opinion, law costs are to some extent extortion. I cannot see how the costs of the Singer trial can amount to £800,000 or thereabouts, unless some people are getting money for jam.  In regard to this whole question of law, there are too many people trying to include others in order to have a &ldquo;cut&rdquo; out of what is going on.</P>
      <P>There are too many counsel engaged where there is no need for counsel at all.  It is my experience that often counsel are engaged where a solicitor could do the job.  The cost of counsel is such that you would imagine this country was the United States.  The Government, the State, is taken for a ride, so to speak, in these excessive demands by counsel for services rendered.  It is the excessive costs which counsel receive that inspire them and induce them to ask for similar costs in private cases.  It is no wonder that big monopolies who engage counsel frighten and blackmail poor prople into taking no action to secure justice in the courts.  Something ought to be done about the whole question of excessive law costs.</P>
      <P>I confess it is a calamity that a man who caused so much distress among people should get away with it.  In Russia, they are shooting people for considerably less.  If I thought I were going to be shot and knew there was a juryman there I could use later, I would let him stay there.  I am not so certain that Singer and those who represented him had not some knowledge of the existence of this juryman.  It is terrible to think that a man could &ldquo;get away with murder&rdquo; on technical grounds as Singer did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say this much about the Government.  While it is not their fault, I think it a shame that they should have allowed Singer out of the country.  Their espionage system was not functioning well enough to let them know that if this fellow got out, he would never come back.  Something should have been done to hold Singer.  He could have been brought <Col N="574" /> to justice in some other roundabout way.  I am more concerned about this matter of fabulous costs and I have put a question down with regard to it. I shall be very anxious to know who is getting all the &ldquo;dough&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I want to say just a few brief words on what is now known as the &ldquo;Singer case&rdquo;.  I think it is my duty to give what appears to me to be the reaction of the ordinary people towards the Singer case.  The confidence of the people has undoubtedly been shaken in this whole affair.  I do not think there can be any doubt about that.  They are not so much concerned as to where specific blame should lie, whether it is on the Attorney General, the law, or those who sit in the courts of justice.</P>
      <P>It is not for us to attempt to criticise the Bench.  The Taoiseach, by innuendo, if I interpret him correctly, without making any specific criticism, apportioned some blame to the Bench.  He qualified some of his remarks by saying that we should not, of course, criticise the courts of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy means by blame.  A judge gave a ruling which the Court of Criminal Appeal subsequently said was not a correct ruling.  The ruling was given quite honestly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, the Taoiseach did not agree with some of the rulings.  Now, what I am concerned about is that the confidence of the people has been shaken and people are saying to themselves that, the bigger the crime, the better the chance of being acquitted by the courts.  That may seem childish.  It may seem simple, but the ordinary mother down the country, whose son is sent away for six months for doing away with £5, or £10, or for falsification of accounts, is beginning to ask herself whether or not there was a fiddle in the Singer case.  I do not believe there was.  I do not believe there was a fiddle to the extent <Col N="575" /> that there was any pulling by this person, that person, or the other person, but I am bound to tell the Taoiseach that a great number of ordinary people believe there was either something phony about the Singer case or the Attorney General did not do his job properly.</P>
      <P>I am inclined to think the Attorney General did not do his job properly. He did not make the case stick.  The fact is 30,000 people invested something like £750,000 in this concern and the gentleman who was accused of being party to the misappropriation of those funds was acquitted, and has now left the country.  It is as simple as that where ordinary people are concerned. They just cannot understand it.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said he did not see any case for changing the law.  I am not competent to say whether or not there should be a change in the law, but it is insufficient for the Taoiseach to say to the people that Dr. Paul Singer was acquitted by the courts on some legal technicality.  They do not know what legal technicalities are; they do not even understand the phrase. All they know about Dr. Paul Singer is that he was accused&mdash;they believe, rightly so&mdash;of being party to the misappropriation of £750,000.  They cannot understand why he is not, like Mr. Shanahan, in gaol.  It is a serious business not alone for the Taoiseach and his Government but for the whole judicial system, the law office, the Bench, and all of us public representatives in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the confidence of the people is shaken to the extent I believe it is, some drastic changes will have to be made.  Whether it is the resignation of the Attorney General or a change in the law, I do not know, but the Taoiseach ought to be aware that the explanation he gave here this evening, whilst given by him in all sincerity, will just not be accepted by the people. They believe justice was not done.  It was not done in that Dr. Paul Singer is now over in Canada or Spain.  That is the only point that occurs to them and, if we are to have any more cases like this, there will be nothing but <Col N="576" /> utter contempt for the decisions given in our courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say very much, but I should, I think, reply to the case put forward by Deputy Dillon in support of the original argument advanced by Deputy Sweetman.  I want to deal with one particular aspect only of that argument. We can sum up the case made here as being that the Government have been guilty of a dereliction of duty because they did not ensure that the Attorney General ensured that Dr. Singer would be found guilty.</P>
      <P>If we examine that case and the arguments put forward by Deputy Sweetman, they harden down to two particular grounds.  There is, on the one hand, the suggestion that the Attorney General was lax or incompetent at the district court level and, on the other hand, that the indictment as framed was ineffective and bad.  No further arguments were advanced by either of the two principal Opposition speakers in favour of referring back this Estimate.</P>
      <P>It is a fair summary of the case put forward that it stands or falls on these two grounds.  The reason counsel was not employed at the district court level is understandable.  The Attorney General took the sensible, logical course at that stage.  The normal rule is not to be represented by counsel at the taking of depositions.  It is only in murder cases, or cases of very unusual character, that counsel are brought in at the deposition stage. Normally, the matter is left, in Dublin to a member of the Chief State Solicitor's staff, and in the country, to the local State Solicitor's Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to that. When the Attorney General began to entertain suspicions, when the Garda began to make investigations, and when the case began to form, the Attorney General had a conference with his advisors, and others, in this matter.  It was decided that the best way to handle the case was for an experienced member of the Chief <Col N="577" /> State Solicitor's office to take the case at the deposition stage.  That was done. Right through the long period of taking depositions, the case was conducted by this skilful and experienced member of the Chief State Solicitor's office and I think there is agreement that the whole process of taking depositions was excellently conducted and the Attorney General's decision in that regard was amply borne out and vindicated.</P>
      <P>When the depositions were ultimately lodged and the accused was returned for trial, the Attorney General again did what was normally logical, reasonable and sound: he saw that the case would be long, difficult and complicated, and he brought in not one senior counsel but two to conduct the proceedings from that point forward.  There was no error of judgment on the part of the Attorney General.  He took exactly the right decisions at both points.</P>
      <P>The drafting of the indictment has been dealt with at some length.  Nobody in this House can argue that it is the Attorney General's job to draft indictments.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, if you like, gives general directions as to how the case is to be conducted.  The drafting of the indictment is a matter simply and solely for counsel appointed to the case.  I have asked myself was the Attorney General correct in this matter of leaving the drafting of the indictment to the counsel concerned.  I immediately ascertained that that was the unfailing practice down through the years.  Not only that, but I checked the position in Great Britain and found that there it is exactly the same. The person appointed to a particular case is in sole charge of the case from the point of view of the technical proceedings, of which, of course, the drafting of the indictment is the principal one.</P>
      <P>As I say, I want to make it absolutely clear that not only did the Attorney General not draft the indictment but he had no duty to draft it. It has never been the practice for him to do so.  Therefore, at any point in this case that you look at where any individual action of the Attorney General is brought to bear upon it, any decision he took was the correct one, and any action he took was in accordance with the usual practice, and no accusation whatever can be made against him in regard to any of these matters.</P>

    <P>There is a further point.  Whereas I argued that the Attorney General was competent, it may be said that he was dilatory and did not pursue the case as energetically as he should <Col N="581" /> have.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that the responsibility lies with the county manager.  The county medical officer, of course, has advisory functions, but final responsibility for discipline and such matters lies with the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is right that the county manager should be responsible, because in many cases a city manager or county manager is reluctant to check or reprimand generally a medical officer or dispensary officer who does not seem to be acting as he should.  There may be many <Col N="584" /> complaints about dispensary doctors or other medical officers and there is great reluctance by managers, who are laymen for this purpose, to appear to interfere in the discharge of a doctor's duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Any cases that have come to my knowledge from a local authority have been dealt with on the authority of the county managers, who have taken responsibility, for instance, for suspending doctors.  Where, of course, clinical judgment in the treatment of a patient is concerned, not even the county medical officer will interfere with the discretion of the district medical officer.  The responsibility for seeing that the district medical officer is available for the service of the patient however rests finally on the county manager, and in fact the medical officer does not come in in a matter of that sort at all. He might come in in relation to the general administration of health services in the dispensary area.</P>

      <P>I really rose to deal with the speeches made on the Estimate, and I am not going to say that I have very much complaint about the tone of the speeches, though there was a suggestion on the part of Deputy O'Higgins that he was reserving his fire for another occasion.  I hope that when that other occasion arises, his fire will be just as ineffective as it was when he brought in his famous motion to condemn the health services, root and branch, on the ground that they were inadequate.  This is a matter, <Col N="585" /> of course, which is under consideration in another place and I do not wish to say more about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to expand on that particular theme at the moment.  The Deputy made the point to-day, however, that the Supplementary Estimate represented an increase of some six per cent.  on the original provision, and agreed that it was due to the fact that under what is now colloquially known as the eighth round, there had been considerable increases in the wages and salaries of officers, employees and officials of health authorities.  Then the Deputy put the point to me that he found it hard to understand why these eighth round increases had not been allowed for when the original Estimate was brought before the House.  The original Estimate was put before the House at the beginning of the last financial year, and the eighth round, as we know, did not begin to manifest itself until, just before the Dáil was about to be dissolved in preparation for the general election.  As I am not a prophet, I could not prophesy six months in advance what would be the trend of remuneration in this country.  Unless I had that prophetic insight, I would not have been able to make the allowance which Deputy O'Higgins suggests I ought to have made some six months before the eighth round started to come into operation and this demand began to manifest itself.</P>
      <P>The Deputy then suggested that, in fact, though the theory was that the central authority bore 50 per cent, of the expenditure upon the health services, in this Supplementary Estimate provision was being made for only about 45 per cent, of the expenditure. He had overlooked the fact that there is a carry-over in each year from the preceding year of five per cent. and that in the end, when the final accounts are adjusted, the central authority does bear 50 per cent, of the expenditure on the health service.</P>

      <P>That is very interesting. The Deputy emphasised how heavy would be the impact of these eighth round increases in wages and salaries on the ratepayers, but what about the impact on the taxpayer if the Deputy's principle were to be accepted, if the taxpayers all over the country had to accept the responsibility for twice the amount which they are at present defraying?  It will be very interesting when the Budget comes before the House next month&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to see what the concern and the solicitude of the Opposition for the taxpayer will be. At present, in order that they might take advantage of current sentiment in the country, the position of the Fine Gael Party would seem to be that they do not give a fiddle-de-dee for the taxpayer.  At the moment they do not give a tinker's damn&mdash;and that is not a curse&mdash;for the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>They do not give a crack of their thumb for the taxpayer, but next month we will hear them bleating if by any chance the taxpayer will have to bear a heavier burden in order to maintain the public services as they are.  At present the policy of the Fine Gael Party appears to be to transfer everything from the ratepayer to the taxpayer.  There is perhaps an ideology behind that, because in the main the ratepayers are either the owners or occupiers of property.  What the Fine Gael Party now stand for is that the burden of taxation should be transferred from property and imposed on persons.  That is the principle which lies behind this demand that the taxpayer should bear the whole cost of the health services. Apparently the present policy&mdash;nobody knows what it will be tomorrow&mdash;of the Fine Gael Party is to shower <Col N="587" /> bounties on a privileged section of the community at the expense of all the others.</P>

      <P>The Deputy says he did not say it.  Then I must have misunderstood him.  But, on the assumption that he did say it and that I did not misunderstand him or mishear him, I want to point out what that would imply.  If the Deputy wishes to reduce the proportion which at the moment is spent upon personnel, it means one of two things: that either we reduce the remuneration of the personnel or else we reduce the strength of the personnel, that we cut down on doctors and nurses and hospital staff of every sort.</P>

      <P>It certainly does arise on the Estimate.  That is what the Minister is dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>How many investigating officers are there in a county? There are very many fewer than dispensary doctors.  They are among the most lowly paid of the personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say fewer than dispensary doctors? <Col N="588" /> I would assert there are more county council employees dealing with health services than dispensary doctors in a county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is again trying to confuse the issue.  He quite forgets a great many of these investigating officers are not under the Department of Health at all but are under the Department of Social Welfare and are investigating for the purpose of home assistance and many other things as well as medical cards. What I am saying still holds true.  If instead of representing 55 per cent. of the total Vote, the amount spent on personnel were to be reduced, it would mean either a general reduction in the remuneration of all those engaged in operating the health services or else we reduce their numbers.  I do not think the Deputy really wants that.  I think he is only trying to make a debating point out of this so that people outside might say &ldquo;We are not spending all this money on health; we are spending 55 per cent. of it on jobs.&rdquo;  But the jobs are those of surgeons, physicians, dispensary doctors, dentists, school medical officers, nurses, mental nurses and of all those others engaged in ministering to the sick.</P>
      <P>Another point raised by the Deputy, and, I think, by Deputy Dillon, and which was touched on by Deputy Esmonde, was the question of smallpox vaccination.  The position is that we have been receiving vaccines from a large number of sources, but most of the vaccine being used throughout the country is that which is produced by the National Institute here.  What is happening is this: a larger proportion of adults have been vaccinated than is customary and the reaction, I am told, of an adult to vaccination is much more violent than in the case of an adolescent; and in the case of an adolescent it is likely to be more violent than in the case of an infant.  For that reason the reaction would appear to be, as I say, more violent than might have been expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do not forget that considerable numbers of people have never seen vaccination reaction before and that many adults are being vaccinated for <Col N="589" /> the first time.  There is not any objective way of measuring the violence of reaction.  The only thing about it is that it is much better to have a reaction when you are vaccinated than not to have any at all.  It is an indication, at any rate, that you have got the minor attack&mdash;and it is an attack of fever&mdash;which is likely to provide you with a degree of immunity against this most dangerous infection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister seen any reports from medical sources that there would appear to be a difference with regard to reaction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I have not received any in relation to any particular vaccine.  As everybody knows, we have had reports that adults react more violently and the process is more painful than it may be in the case of infants, although we really do not know how painful the reaction in infants may be.  I have no reason to believe that anything abnormal or unusual is happening here.  It has been the same experience as in Great Britain where they have had the same sort of cycle: adults coming forward for vaccination for the first time and reacting painfully and violently to it. But, on the other hand, they secure a degree of immunity against what is a very deadly disease.</P>

I am not going to say whether or not <Col N="590" /> that immunity will continue because the situation here has changed, due to rapid transport and therefore we are more open to infection than we were ten years ago, but at the moment, as far as I can see, there is not any need to get panicky.  There are measures we can take, should an outbreak occur in any area.  I will say, however, that it would be prudent for any person going to an area in which there has been a recent outbreak to get vaccinated.  It would be prudent, for instance, for any person going to certain parts of Britain or of the Continent to get vaccinated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £3,200 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Expenses of the Maintenance, etc., of Patients in Dundrum Asylum (8 and 9 Vict., c. 107, and No. 19 of 1945).</P>
      <P>I should at the outset explain that, in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 of the Mental Treatment Act, 1961, the title of the institution to which this Supplementary Estimate relates has been changed to &ldquo;Central Mental Hospital&rdquo; since 1st April, 1961. However, I am advised that as the original estimate for 1961/62 appears in the Book of Estimates under the title &ldquo;Dundrum Asylum&rdquo;, the Supplementary should appear under the same title, despite the fact that it is a misnomer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this Supplementary Grant arises from the fact that expenditure <Col N="591" /> on three Subheads of the Vote will exceed the original provision and such excesses can be met only to a limited extent by savings under other headings of the Vote.</P>
    <P>The major portion of the increase is attributable to the operation of the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo; increases in the remuneration of the staff of the hospital.  Those increases will cost £2,800 gross in the current year, offset by an increase of £700 in the appropriations in aid, leaving the net increase for salaries and wages at £2,100.</P>
    <P>Issues of cigarettes and tobacco to patients account for an increase of £250 approximately.  Cigarettes and tobacco seized by the Customs authorities are made available by those authorities to the Hospital and are used to make up in part the patients' ration of those commodities.  Receipts from this source have been declining in recent years and in the current year declined rather more than had been anticipated when the estimate was framed.  The result has been that greater quantities had to be purchased than had been provided for.</P>
    <P>Increased use is now being made in the Hospital of the newer drugs for the treatment of mental illness.  This, of course, is beneficial to the patients and eases very considerably the strain on the staff who look after the patients; but it has resulted in the current year in an increase of about £400 in expenditure, which has to be got from this supplementary estimate.</P>
    <P>An additional item of expenditure which was not anticipated when the estimate was framed is a sum of £125 involved in the replacement of equipment in the tailoring shop.</P>
    <P>An increase of £400 is also anticipated in the expenditure on the victualling of patients, due in the main to an increase in the average number of patients from 88 to 92.</P>
    <P>The net increases in expenditure which I have enumerated amount in the aggregate to £3,275.  There were other small, casual increases and decreases of a normal character of which account has been taken in framing <Col N="592" /> the supplementary estimate, which, as I have stated, is for a net sum of £3,200.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm 17 Orders made during 1961 under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, which provides that Orders made by the Government under that Act, imposing or amending duties, must be confirmed in the calendar year following that in which they are made.</P>
      <P>Three of the Orders imposed new protection.  Eight amended existing duties which experience had shown were either inadequate or were open to evasion.  Two others provided for new or increased duties which would come into operation in the event of existing quota or other import restrictions having to be removed. The remaining four Orders provided for reductions in the rates or scope of existing duties.  Two of these are consequential on recommendations made by the Industrial Development Authority following reviews undertaken in accordance with the provisions of our trade agreements with Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An explanatory memorandum on the Bill has been circulated to Deputies.  I shall, of course, be willing <Col N="593" /> to give any further information or answer any questions which Deputies wish to ask about the Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been examining the statistical information the Minister has given us in the explanatory memorandum.  There are 17 orders to be confirmed and he gives at the foot of the memorandum particulars of four orders which provide reductions of the rates of duties. All the rest either show increased protection or give protection in a new form.  That I cannot understand.  I heard the Taoiseach recently in a debate explaining it was not possible to help the farmers because it could be done only by way of protecting them against foreign products coming in, or by subsidy.</P>
      <P>We got a solemn warning that out of our application for membership of the Common Market must come the feeling that anything that throttled free trade was dangerous at the moment.  I cannot understand, therefore, why there should be one set of rules for farmers and another for industrialists. We have had the Minister for Transport and Power and satellites in the form of Parliamentary Secretaries flitting around warning industrialists about the serious challenge coming upon them and how they must be strong to meet it.  We have been told that the protective barriers should be lowered to enable industrialists to feel a little bit of the chill wind of competition before it comes on them completely with entry into the Common Market.</P>
      <P>Yet, here we have a proposal for 17 new orders, 13 of which increase the protective barriers.  I should have thought we would be chary in introducing any more at the time when we should be bracing ourselves to face the future of free trade with some sort of hope that we would survive without protection.  The standard is there.  It is laid down in the Treaty of Rome that distorting of free trade will be looked on askance. Yet, here we provide for fresh protective duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell <Col N="594" /> us a little more about the actual commodities on which the duties are being imposed?  They are divided into three sections, those in which duties are newly imposed, those in which duties are amended&mdash;I assume upwards&mdash; and those in which duties are reduced. I assume that, in respect of the articles on which there is a new duty, some firm or establishment in the country is beginning to manufacture them.</P>
      <P>I can appreciate what Deputy McGilligan is saying in that we now seem to be affording additional protection whilst the general idea in the Common Market is to strip ourselves of protection.  I do not think I would disagree with the Minister in what he is doing.  If we join the European Economic Community, whether as associates or full members, it will mean that the industries with protection will have about eight years in which to divest themselves of it.  I assume that what the Minister is doing here is for the purpose of affording such industries protection which they will have to shed in eight years and probably in those eight years they can build themselves up.  I cannot see anything wrong with that.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would tell us, in respect of wheaten breakfast foods, watches and chrome-tanned leather, why the duties have been reduced.  I assume it is because we have no intention or either assembling or making these goods in this country.  Perhaps the Minister would say in what way the duties on the following goods are amended, namely, shot gun cartridges, cider and Perry, spectacles and umbrellas.  I suppose there is the usual reason for the newly-imposed duties on the balance which includes among other products, aluminium ladders, power-driver pumps, material for saw blades, towels and towelling, tinned meat and vegetable soups, wheat products, polyurethane.  I assume it is for the purpose of affording these industries the protection they will undoubtedly need over the initial years during which we may be in the European Economic Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is quite a list of commodities in respect of which duties are being imposed in order to provide for the possible removal of quotas.  These duties are not yet in operation and will not be in operation until such time as the quotas will have to be removed in the event of our accession to the European Economic Community.  The duties that are placed on them are not necessarily the duties that can remain.  They will, of course, have to be negotiated as part of our terms of entry into the Common Market.</P>
      <P>I shall take a general point raised by Deputy McGilligan.  The fact is that we are not yet members of the European Economic Community. He tried to draw an analogy between agriculture and industry.  The fact also remains that agriculture is subsidised to a considerable extent in respect of several items of production of the farmers.  These may be varied upwards or downwards according as appears necessary, pending our accession to the European Economic Community.  Similarly with tariffs on industrial products.</P>
      <P>In most cases in which there have been increases, they have been necessitated by the import of unduly low-priced materials or products of a similar nature to those manufactured here from Iron Curtain countries, in some cases Far Eastern countries, where costs of production for one reason or another are much lower than the costs of production in this country.  I think that applies in particular to one of the items mentioned by Deputy Corish, namely, umbrellas. It would be difficult to go through all the individual items unless I was asked specific questions in relation to them.  As far as towels and towelling are concerned, the purpose of the amended duty is to offset evasions, of an existing Order, that were being practised.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corish also mentioned wheaten breakfast foods and chrome tanned leather.  These two Orders were made to reduce existing tariffs consequent upon the review by the Industrial Development Authority as requested by the British Board of Trade in the light of our agreements with Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not all of them. There is a separate list of duties reviewed or under review in accordance with the British Board of Trade requests.  These have been published. In fact, there is one commodity&mdash;braid &mdash;which was so reviewed and which is not included in this piece of legislation because the Order was made subsequent to the date of its preparation. The duty on this braid was reduced as a result of the recommendation of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other commodities apart from these which are under review and in various stages of review.  These have been published. If I may mention three or four of them at random, they are: tableware of pottery, floor tiles, drinking glasses, boxes, cartons and similar articles of paper cardboard, etc, thread, footwear <Col N="597" /> other than rubber and plastic footwear. That is just a run-through of some of the commodities being reviewed at the present time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; these were published as submitted to the Industrial Development Authority.  Deputy Corish also asked about watches. Along with wheaten breakfast foods and chrome-tanned leather there is a decrease in the tariff.  The reduction on the tariff on watches was made following requests by jewellers and by Swiss representatives who complained that the duty we had imposed was rather too high, having regard to the actual manufacturing cost of the watches concerned.  As a consequence of these approaches, and having examined the situation, the reduction in the duty was effected.</P>
      <P>There is one other Order to which I might refer and that is Order No. 107 relating to aluminium for beer containers.  That is an exclusion order.  There is a duty on aluminium. The purpose of this order is to exclude aluminium that is being imported for the manufacture of beer containers.  Therefore, again, included in the list of seventeen, there is also this exclusion.</P>
      <P>By and large, the number of new duties imposed has been much less in the past year than in previous years. I can inform the House that there were many other applications which were refused and, in the current year, since the beginning of January, no new order upwards, in other words increasing a tariff, has been made.  The position is realistically consistent with our movement towards Common Market conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, quotas are, as I have said before, perhaps the most extreme form of protection and the one form <Col N="598" /> of protection that has completely disappeared among Common Market countries.  The expectation is that we would have to remove quotas almost immediately, if not quite immediately, on our accession to E.E.C., and the tariffs that have been imposed and that are not yet in operation are imposed specifically for that purpose. In the event of these quotas being removed, the duties may be brought into effect so that some protection will remain for goods at present under quota.  I might mention that some of the tariffs that have been imposed may have to be subject to review by the Industrial Development Authority before they become operative.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is, in the main, a consolidation measure and it is, therefore, concerned to a large extent with restating the existing law, which is contained in the Official Secrets Acts, 1911 and 1920.  These Acts were made the subject of somewhat extensive adaptation by an order made in 1928 under the Adaptation of Enactments Act, 1922. <Col N="600" /> Notwithstanding this adaptation, however, it is unsatisfactory to have to rely on these Acts, which were designed to safeguard the military and naval defence of the United Kingdom, to prosecute for unauthorised disclosures of secret or confidential official information.</P>
    <P>This was recognised during the Emergency period by the making of Emergency Powers Orders which set out the provisions of the Acts which appeared at the time to be appropriate in our conditions.  With the lapse of these Orders the position remained as unsatisfactory as it had been although the Defence Act of 1954 re-enacted a number of the provisions of the Acts, such as those relating to sketching or photographing military installations. Apart from the inappropriateness of the Acts and of their terminology, they have proved defective in at least one instance of leakage of official information which related to examination papers.  This particular defect is being remedied by Section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice that the Bill distinguishes between unauthorised disclosure of secret or confidential official information&mdash;that is dealt with in Part II of the Bill&mdash;and the disclosure of information to the prejudice of the safety or preservation of the State, with which Part III of the Bill is concerned. The former category includes both confidential information of the type normally circulating in Government Departments and the confidential information entrusted to Government contractors, such as printers of official reports and other such documents. Part III, on the other hand, is concerned with spying and therefore necessarily contains somewhat elaborate provisions which recognise not only the serious consequences of these activities, but also the difficulty of bringing spies to justice.</P>
    <P>The penalties for disclosure of information under Part II are much less than those applicable to acts which are prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State: these offences are triable on indictment whereas any other offence under the Act is triable summarily.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, I think, be interested <Col N="601" /> in the provisions of subsection (3) of Section 6, which empower the Taoiseach to give directions as to the return or disposal of any original documents which constitute or contain official information and which are in the possession or under the control of any person who formerly held office as a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary. Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries and persons who formerly held these offices are of course bound by existing Acts not to communicate any information of a confidential character which is in their possession by virtue of their holding office, and this obligation continues even after they have ceased to hold office.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no change in the law in this respect and accordingly it will be unlawful for any former Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to disclose, without authority, confidential information which has come into his possession during his term of office.  Subsection (3) of Section 6 is concerned only with the return of documents in the possession of former Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries. It has been the practice for some Ministers at least to retain their copies of Cabinet papers on leaving office and the Government do not wish to disturb this practice, which has not given rise to any abuse.  The Government consider it necessary, however, to be able to deal with a situation where a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary on leaving office would take with him original official documents such as files and subsection (3) of Section 6 will enable the Taoiseach to give directions for the return of any such original documents.</P>
    <P>The other provisions of the Bill are those normally found in official secrets legislation and I do not think it necessary to go into them in detail, particularly as they are set out in convenient form in the Explanatory Memorandum published with the Bill. Should any Deputy require further details about any of these provisions at this stage I shall endeavour to give it in the course of my reply. As is so often the case with these consolidation Bills, where the main <Col N="602" /> principles have been generally accepted over along period, the main discussion will, I think, arise on points of detail relating to particular provisions and these points may be more satisfactorily cleared up in the freer discussion permitted on Committee Stage.  I shall welcome any comments that Deputies may make in the course of the debate towards improving the measure and so far as I can I shall endeavour to meet their wishes in the course of the Bill's passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us that the change under this Bill is taking place mainly because it is regarded as unsatisfactory that we should have to rely on previous Acts, which were designed to safeguard the military and naval defence of the United Kingdom, to prosecute for unauthorised disclosures of secret or confidential official information.</P>
      <P>The Acts were, of course, entirely designed for the protection of the State in respect of anything to do with the defence forces of the country or with any military installátions, but they were practically confined to those.  The situation as explained in connection with these Acts is that they were directed to the punishment of spies and the prevention of the disclosure of State secrets, and the test was whether matters would be useful to an enemy and therefore prejudicial to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody can object to that type of legislation being put on to a new footing but we are getting into deeper water and I suggest we are taking very extensive control which goes far beyond the security of the State.  The first of these Acts was passed in 1911 when there was a considerable panic in England in regard to espionage.  Practically everybody who could not by his name or conduct disclose himself as being a native-born person of the United Kingdom was subject to a certain amount of suspicion.  It was found, however, when people were caught in doubtful circumstances, that it was not easy to bring them to justice.  There was the case of a person who was found in some prohibited area with the usual equipment of a camera and various other items for taking photographs. <Col N="603" /> It was an island where there was a military installation and he said he was there for the purpose of investigating the habits of birds.  Since it was in mid-December he was caught, his anxiety about bird-watching did not strike home.  It was found difficult to bring that person to justice ; hence the 1911 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is the pivotal section of this legislation.  In the corresponding English legislation, &ldquo;prohibited places&rdquo; is the pivotal matter.  There is in the 1911 Act the phrase about wrongful communication of documents or of information which was in a confidential form by one holding office under his Majesty or the wrongful communication of information received by a person by reason of his holding office under his Majesty.</P>
    <P>So far as this legislation relates to defence matters, I do not see any objection to it.  As regards the operation of the Official Secrets Act in this country, the history of what has happened is not very reassuring.  There was one prosecution only which was brought either in the year 1932 or 1933 and I know at least two people&mdash;there may have been three&mdash;were charged.  After a couple of days, the case was taken away from the jury by direction of the judge.  The judge indicated his point of view by saying he thought this prosecution never should have been brought.  He went on to make a court recommendation on certain lines.</P>
    <P>He had discovered during the hearing of the case that these two persons who were charged had been degraded in rank in the particular office they held, had had their emoluments suspended and had, I think, been suspended from office.  He recommended that it should be conveyed to the Government that they should be reinstated and that any loss of emoluments they suffered should be restored to them.  That recommendation was carried out but there is no doubt that that effort smacked completely of political pursuit.  There was a sort of vendetta based on politics and the successful completion of that type of case was stopped by the judicial <Col N="604" /> authority.  That is the only case that was brought in the years since the State came into being.</P>
    <P>I am told now that there has been an instance of a leakage of information in relation to examination papers and therefore we have Section 5 dealing with the disclosure of confidential information in official contracts.  It says that a person shall not communicate to any third party any information relating to a contract and expressed therein to be confidential.  I do not know whether it is necessary to have a phrase in the Official Secrets Bill in order to secure the apprehension and the conviction of people who are given papers for printing.  I can understand the case in which papers are printed by an official press and given then to the masters in a particular school.  It is quite proper not merely that those who give out the information about examination papers but that those who ask for and receive it should be dealt with.  Does the matter go further?  If a master then conveys to pupils the information he has got from the examination papers, are the pupils to be prosecuted as being conspirators or as being aiders and abettors of what has been done in regard to the examination papers?  That, in my opinion, is making a great deal of a small point.  As far as I know, there has only been one case recently of such a leakage of information.  I do not think it has ever occurred on any great scale.  This seems to me to be bringing up something that is completely outside the scope of the Official Secrets Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know what will be the new situation in regard to what is called confidential and secret information. There is a zig-zag course pursued through the Bill that is not easy to follow.  The Definition Section provides that &ldquo;`official information' means any secret official code word or password...&rdquo;  There are a lot of phrases to which no objection can be taken until one comes to this phrase: &ldquo;document or information which is secret or confidential or is expressed to be....&rdquo;  That is a phrase whose first main use was in the Offences Against the State Act.  &ldquo;Matters that were expressed <Col N="605" /> to be&rdquo; which is also in an Article of the Constitution puts the whole Constitution in abeyance when certain circumstances come about. Under this provision, the court has not the liberty to decide that a matter is secret and confidential.  It can be something that somebody expresses to be secret or confidential.</P>
    <P>Section 2 (3) provides that where a certificate is given by a Minister that any official code word or password is secret or confidential, that certificate is to be conclusive evidence that it is secret or confidential.  If the Minister by a certificate expresses it to be secret or confidential, that is conclusive evidence, and the court cannot hear anything against it.  I do not think that is right.</P>
    <P>I look at Section 6.  It is the section which the Minister says is to break in a little bit on a practice which he says is unknown of people retaining documents when they were members of a Government or were Parliamentary Secretaries.  Section 6 is in very general terms.  It is limited by subsection (3). Section 6 (1) says that a person shall not retain any official document or anything which constitutes or contains official information.  Then we go back to the definition of &ldquo;official information&rdquo;. It is something that is expressed by a Minister to be secret and confidential and about which there can be no argument.  It is, therefore, made an offence for a person to retain any official document or anything which constitutes or contains official information when he has no right to retain it.  That means &mdash; I am leaving out Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries&mdash;that if any person who gets a document which <i>post facto</i> a Minister says is secret and confidential, then that person has no way of getting the point of view of the court as to whether there is any secrecy or anything confidential about it.  It is made an offence for the person to retain it.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a person shall comply with all directions issued by a Minister or the secretary of a Department or any person authorised by a Minister as to the return or disposal of any official document which constitutes or contains <Col N="606" /> official information.  The Minister has control the whole time.  He certifies that some document is secret and confidential. When the certificate is given, the Minister then sends out the direction as to what is to be done with regard to it.  The person has no way of complaining that the document is not secret and confidential.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach by the third subparagraph may give directions as to the return or disposal of any original documents which constitute or contain official information.  In the case of a person who formerly held office, if he has documents, notwithstanding a certificate by a Minister that they contain information, so long as they are not originals, those documents may be retained.  Subsection (4) says: &ldquo;Subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply to a person who formerly held an office to which subsection (3) applies.&rdquo;  I suggest that that was pretty well safeguarded by the use of the word &ldquo;original&rdquo;.  I look at what the Minister is providing: &ldquo;The Government consider it necessary, however, to be able to deal with the situation where a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary on leaving office would take with him original documents such as files...&rdquo; Files or part of files could be considered original documents.  I should have thought that in the course of what the Minister provided, files, any part of a file or a broken file would be considered as original documents and could be demanded back.  I do not know of any case where it has been alleged that any harm was done to the State by this matter of documents.  I know there has been objection to people in Government revealing matters they got to know in this House. This seems to be a very extraordinary power to take.</P>
    <P>People who previously held Government office are bound not to communicate any information of a confidential character which is in their possession by virtue of their holding office.  The Bill makes no change in the law about that.  It will be unlawful for any former Minister or Parliamentary Secretary to disclose, without authority, confidential information which has come into his possession during his <Col N="607" /> term of office.  It may be unlawful for a person to disclose any information he has secured when he became a member of the Government but that does not apply to this House.  People are protected in regard to their utterances in this House.  Whatever there may be by way of illegality of a person disclosing information, that cannot apply to any disclosure made in this House.  The right in regard to utterances in the House is a constitutional right and cannot be got rid of except by way of amendment of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Part II dealing with official information might be looked at again.  Here there seems to be one of those bad swings.  Very often, when cases are brought before the courts, particularly where a Government Department is concerned, there is an opportunity given in relation to the plea of privilege. Privilege, in the first instance, was based upon grounds of national security.  Nobody had the slightest objection when privilege was claimed in regard to documents belonging to the Admiralty in a famous submarine case because the national security was at stake.  It was a question of whether some new invention might not be made open to enemy investigation.  There has been a decided swing in recent years since the <i>Thetis</i> case towards claiming privilege on the ground of the national interest.  There is a very big divergence between the two.  Certainly, in England, where claims are pressed very far, judges are showing very definite objections to blanket claims made by Government Departments on the ground that the disclosure of certain information would be prejudicial to the national interest.</P>
    <P>This legislation, which started in 1911 and was carried on in 1920, was based on national security.  There has now been a swing over to the &ldquo;national interest&rdquo;.  Of course, that is a matter of opinion.  When it comes to the second line, there should be more resort to the court.</P>

      <P>It all depends on the way you spell it.  There are a few changes I should like to comment on. One is in Part I under which the receiving of a document is an offence. Is there any protection for the person who unwittingly receives a document? Perhaps, the Minister would explain.  It appears that if somebody came into possession of a document without knowing what it was, he would find himself in very serious trouble.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to Section 5 in which there is reference to examination papers.  I agree with him that that is hardly appropriate in a serious Bill like this.  It is referred to in Section 2 of the 1911 Act.  We know that some years ago there was a leakage.  I understand a 22 year old apprentice printer got possession of some examination papers and thought he would collect a few shillings on them.  No teacher was involved.  Very few pupils were involved.  If it had gone far enough it could have been a very grave scandal.  Presumably some way of dealing with such a situation had to be found and I take it that is why the Minister included it in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There is reference in Section 8 to the forgery or alteration of official documents.  It is an offence to be in possession of an altered official document. It could be tough luck on a person who wanted a birth certificate and someone obligingly procured a certificate altered to suit the individual requiring it ; it would be just too bad if he found he was unwittingly committing an offence.</P>
      <P>There is a new offence here in relation to communicating secrets to members of an unlawful organisation &mdash;Sections 9 and 10 of Part III. Presumably provision had to be made. The law at the moment is that a person is innocent until he is proved guilty.  According to my interpretation of this section, a person is guilty until he can prove himself innocent.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to comment.  We would prefer not to adopt the principles underlying the Offences Against the State Act in ordinary legislation emanating from this House.  That would be a bad precedent.</P>
      <P>Section 12 provides that the prosecution may apply to have a case in relation to official secrets held in camera and, if the prosecution asks, it &ldquo;shall&rdquo; be heard in camera. Apparently it will be mandatory and not permissive.  I do not think that is a good principle.  I think &ldquo;shall&rdquo; on page 7, line 2, should be altered to &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  That would maintain the <i>status quo.</i></P>
      <P>In the 1920 Act, there is a provision which makes it an offence to wear illegally any military, naval or air force uniform.  There is no provision with regard to the wearing of uniforms in this Bill.  Has that been dropped?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill deals with communicating with foreign agents and with an illegal organisation. There should be a distinction made there.  We know that the illegal organisation has decided to dump its guns.  Its members claim that they never attacked the State.  There should be a distinction in relation to the term of imprisonment.  Where the illegal organisation is concerned, there can be no justification for such a savage sentence as seven years, certainly in time of peace.  Whatever mistakes these people made, they think well of their country.  In their own tinpot way they think they are more patriotic than any of the rest of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as foreign agents are concerned, the sentence is not severe enough.  We heard a good deal today about Dr. Singer and the damage he did.  Had he been convicted, he would have served a 20 year sentence and not just seven years.  Consider the agents in America who got possession of the atomic bomb secret.  Peacetime or no peacetime, the Yanks executed them.  Valuable or important information <Col N="610" /> could be communicated to a foreign agent, and that should warrant more than seven years.</P>
    <P>At present there are some groups here known as security groups or private detectives.  I have some questions down for Thursday's Order Paper in connection with these groups. An organisation with its headquarters in Britain is attempting to establish itself here.  Under cover of such groups, valuable information could be obtained by individuals.  Espionage is carried on for the most part by so-called trade agents and people engaged in civilian occupations. Here is a security group endeavouring to establish itself in this city.  I have given the Minister particulars.  Individuals in this group could go around photographing, or obtaining information which might prove detrimental to the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>Can people establish themselves without being licensed or registered? If they have to register, what are the conditions?  I would ask the Minister to deal with the matter which could become serious under cover of this alleged security group.  I should like to know if they must register and what are the terms of registration.  I want some information on that, and I believe something should be included in the Bill to cover the question I am raising.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point about the Bill as a whole which I should like to raise.  I do not intend to go into detail because the remainder of the questions which arise can more properly be dealt with on Committee Stage.  The point I want to raise is the question of attempting to prevent by detailed legislation the disclosure of official information.  The objection is that the Bill attempts to do that in specific detail.  This Bill is likely to fail because in attempting to do that in detail, loopholes will inevitably be left.  For instance, looking at the definition of &ldquo;official document&rdquo; I ask myself whether a copy, not an accurate copy, would be an official document for the purpose, say, of Section 6.  I raise that point because I think that by too much particularising the Bill may defeat itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="611" /> With regard to Section 6, there is no doubt that any Minister who is in office and who is attending to his business must necessarily, for his own protection, keep some kind of record of what he has done.  I think it has been customary on occasion for certain documents to be treated as personal and Ministers leaving office could take them with them.  The point is that no matter how you legislate, any Minister of State who leaves office is in possession of official information which is within the terms of this Bill, and no Act of Parliament can possibly prevent him from disclosing it, if he is so minded.</P>
    <P>If he remains a member of the House and passes across to the other side of the House, he can disclose that information if he so wishes and no one can stop him.  If he is not a member of the House, it would not be very difficult to get a member of the House to do it, again if he is so minded.  The point I am making is whether the section is really worthwhile and whether it effects anything, when all is said and done.  There has been a long tradition here, and by and large, former Ministers from all sides have behaved correctly and honourably in this matter.</P>

      <P>If we still wish to enact Section 6, I think it is high time we considered the definition at line 15 of Section 2 of &ldquo;official document&rdquo;.  It would be very hard to get a watertight definition which would capture all that and if we did get one, I do not know what the Bill would look like.  That is a kind of general comment on the Bill from one point of view.</P>

In a complex organisation like a State civil service, it is not the Minister, and it is not, I am sure, the heads of Departments, who make a Bill such as this necessary.  It is perhaps indiscretion in the long chain through which the actions of the Executive are implemented. The question is: can we really deal with that matter by legislation?</P>
      <P>Looking at Section 4, I rather think we are dealing here with a matter of internal administrative discipline within the Civil Service rather than with a question of legislation.  The question is whether the problem should be considered from the point of view of whether we want a formal Act of this nature to cover all citizens in regard to such matters, or something in the nature of an internal disciplinary code for the Civil Service.</P>
      <P>Having said that in regard to Part II, quite obviously, provision in regard to Part III and similar matters is necessary, and the question is whether or not they go far enough. Details in regard to these matters are best dealt with in Committee so the questions which I should like to raise about the implementation of Section 17 and its enactment in this form would be better dealt with on Committee Stage also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to finish on the note of asking whether in a re-enactment of this nature, there is really any improvement on prior enactments, and whether the structure of the Bill might <Col N="613" /> be improved by taking some things out for what I might call internal administrative purposes, and concentrating on the things that really matter, namely, the things which are really prejudicial to the safety and order of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that for a change I am rather inclined to agree with Deputy de Valera's approach to this measure.  I am rather puzzled as to why the Minister thought it necessary to bring in this Bill at all.  There are one or two aspects of it which could be regarded as new legislation, and possibly it is desirable that those matters should be covered but, by and large, as the Minister mentioned when he was introducing the measure, the provisions of the Bill are already contained in the Official Secrets Acts, 1911 and 1920.</P>
      <P>Some alterations are being made but I am not at all happy that the changes the Minister is proposing are desirable changes with regard to the procedure, in any event, for the administration of justice in this type of offence.  In reply to a question put to him by Deputy Tully, the Minister explained something that he might have explained more fully when introducing the Bill, that is, the fact that a number of matters which were covered in the earlier Official Secrets Acts are covered in the Defence Forces Act at the moment.  I hope I am right in this.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree with me that the 1911 Act, and, to some extent, I think the 1920 Act, gave the authorities power to name particular places and to designate them as prohibited places from which people were excluded in time of emergency and provided for power to deal with the person who endeavoured to enter into those places.  I have in mind military institutions and installations and such things.  There is no mention of such things in the Bill. I am assuming that the reason for that is it is no longer necessary to cover them in an Official Secrets Act because they are covered by the various Defence Forces Acts and regulations and orders that apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an alteration as between the Bill and existing legislation.  So far <Col N="614" /> as previous legislation is concerned, other principal alterations in this Bill are, No. 1, the provision the Minister is making with regard to leakages which might take place in connection with such things as school examination papers and, No. 2, the provisions in Section 6 to which Deputy de Valera has referred, that is, the position of ex-Ministers and ex-Parliamentary Secretaries. Quite frankly, I am not at all happy about that.  I do not want the Minister to regard what I am saying as being personal to him, or indeed personal to the Government, but I am very much afraid that the provisions which the Minister is asking the House to write into this Bill are provisions which can be used in a very vicious way for political purposes.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, the question of what is or what is not to be regarded as secret and confidential information is no longer going to be left to the courts to decide.  Anyone charged with an offence involving the receipt or disclosure of secret and confidential information will no longer be in a position of going to the courts and asking the court, or the judge and jury, as the case may be, to decide that question, as to whether the information was in fact of a type which should be regarded as secret and confidential.  All that is being wiped away by a simple provision which the Minister has written into this Bill, that in future, once this Bill passes, information will be regarded as secret and confidential, if it is so certified by a Minister of State and if the Minister of State gives a certificate to that effect, the courts cannot say anything about it.  It must, under the terms of this Bill, be accepted as conclusive evidence that the information is secret and confidential. It does not matter what type of information it is.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera has referred to Section 6 of the Bill.  It does not matter what type of information an ex-Minister or ex-Parliamentary Secretary may possess.  He may regard it as quite innocuous so far as ordinary standards of secrecy are concerned. The Minister can give a certificate and that certificate must be accepted without question, without yea or nay, by <Col N="615" /> every court in the land, that the information is official information and is secret.  Official information is one of the matters that comes within the definition of secret, according to the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 2, subsection (3).  To my mind, under this Bill, the Minister is being given a judicial function in this matter.  I am not at all happy about it, not at all happy that it could not have very serious repercussions in the political sphere, although neither the Minister nor any Deputy wants that to happen but none of us can see into the future. We can only make the best guess we can and I do not like the door the Minister is opening by reason of that provision.  I am not at all sure that that provision would stand up to a test of constitutionality because it does give the Minister, as distinct from the court, a judicial function in that the Minister is the person who, by his certificate, will decide in future what information is secret and confidential.</P>
      <P>There are other matters in this Bill which, as Deputy de Valera said, might be better dealt with in Committee but it might be as well to refer to some of them now.  Deputy Sherwin might be surprised to learn that under the provisions of this Bill, the penalties are in fact being lowered rather than increased.  The Bill provides for penal servitude or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years and seven years respectively and in the existing legislation the periods are three years and 14 years, so that in fact there is a reduction in the penalties.  Again, the explanation of that might possibly lie in the fact that some of the matters in respect of which it was thought the heavier sentences were appropriate are offences which are now covered by other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Section 4, reference is made to a duly authorised authority, which means authorised by a Minister or State authority and the State authority is defined in the definition <Col N="616" /> section as meaning the Revenue Commissioners, the Commissioners of Public Works and the Irish Land Commission.  I should like the Minister to let us know what is to be the position of the authorities that most Deputies would regard normally as being in the same category as those mentioned in the Bill, for example, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Attorney General and the various Departments that exist in the courts of justice.  I should like to know if, by implication, those authorities are being excluded from the provisions of the Bill and if the Official Secrets Act is not to apply to them or to the staff in those Departments.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention also a matter which has been referred to by Deputy Tully, and that is Section 12 of this Bill which provides that &ldquo;proceedings, including proceedings on appeal, for a contravention of Section 9 shall be heard in camera on the application of the prosecution but the verdict and sentence (if any) shall be announced in public.&rdquo;  Deputy Tully quite rightly commented that all that is provided for in this section is that the prosecution may apply and on an application by the prosecution the court has no alternative but to allow the proceedings to be conducted in secret.  I cannot understand why the section goes as far as that.  It was provided in a section of the 1920 Act that the prosecution could make an application to have the proceedings heard in camera if it was shown that it would have been prejudicial to the national safety to have the proceedings heard in public.  There is no similar provision here.  Under the 1920 legislation the onus is on the prosecution in making its application to show that it would be prejudicial to the national safety to have the hearing in public, and on such an application being made and on the court having decided that the question of national safety is involved it is open to the court to allow the hearing to be in secret.</P>
    <P>That provision is being wiped out, and under Section 12 of this Bill all that will be necessary in the future is that counsel or solicitor on behalf of <Col N="617" /> the State will make an application saying &ldquo;I want this case heard in camera&rdquo; and the court is left without discretion in the matter and must accede to the application.  I do not think that that is an improvement on the existing position.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has referred to the trend which is disclosed in this Bill.  Whether it is good or not I do not attempt to decide.  It is a matter for argument.  He has pointed out that under the earlier Official Secrets Acts the matter which was exercising the minds of the framers of the legislation was the question of the security and safety of the State but, in this legislation we are drifting to another angle completely, and that is what we choose to call the interest of the State, as distinct from the question of whether the security and safety of the State are involved in the omnibus phrase &ldquo;the interest of the State&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping that we are not going as far as that, but that could possibly come.  Section 10 of this Bill seems to me to be going very far indeed, and I should like the Minister to make some effort to satisfy the House that the provisions which are written into Section 10 are necessary.  We should bear in mind when we consider the question of what is necessary under this Bill the fact that in 30 or 40 years there has been I think only one prosecution for offences against the Official Secrets Act in this State.  Yet we have the Minister in Section 10 bringing in some provisions which I think are likely to be extremely dangerous on the question of evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the question of, if a person is found with the address of a person who is a member of an unlawful organisation, the mere fact of finding the address on him without further evidence, as I read the Bill, may constitute an offence under subsection (2) of Section 10.  Under this subsection it is an offence if a person is found with &ldquo;the name or address of or any other information regarding a foreign agent or a member of an unlawful <Col N="618" /> organisation,&rdquo; if that address &ldquo;has been found in his possession or has been supplied by him to any other person or has been obtained by him from any other person.&rdquo; There is no saving provision there.</P>

      <P>Of course Section 9 is, if I may so describe it, the hatchet section in this Bill.  If a person comes in under Section 9 he has had it, and Section 10, as the Minister says, supplies the evidence that if he is found with this information and this address it will be evidence that he was acting prejudicially to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not want to argue that out with the Minister now.  This is a matter which we could discuss in more detail on the Committee Stage.  I appreciate the Minister's point of view that Section 10 is the section that goes to pack in the evidence to catch a person under Section 9.  To take for example the particular portion of Section 10 that I have quoted, the latter part of subsection (2) where the information or the address as the case may be has been supplied by him to any other person or has been obtained by him from any other person, surely that is the type of thing that could be done in a perfectly innocent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take for example&mdash;I think Deputy Tully referred to it jocosely&mdash;the case of a person who is an acknowledged <Col N="619" /> member of an unlawful organisation. Supposing that person is elected as a Deputy to this House and chooses to take his seat in the House.  Supposing a Minister or ex-Minister as the case may be exercises his privilege as a member of this House to give to the House information which has come into his possession while he was a member of a Government.  That may be secret, confidential official information, and he is giving it to the member of an illegal organisation because the member of the illegal organisation has become a member of this House and is entitled to take part in the discussions in this House.  I am not at all sure that having regard to the way in which this piece of legislation is framed an effort might not be made to institute proceedings against the ex-Minister or ex-Parliamentary Secretary who in the presence of a member of an illegal organisation disclosed information of that type in this House.</P>

      <P>I suppose Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan will be able to explain their position, if they discuss this measure.</P>
      <P>I want to pass on to Section 16, again for the purpose of asking the Minister to consider it further.  I have no objection to the general provisions of Section 16 regarding search warrants. I think, by and large, those are the provisions which appear in the existing legislation, with this difference, however.  Subsection (2) of Section 16 provides for the case where a Superintendent of the Garda, acting on his own initiative, considers he has reasonable grounds for believing that in the interests of the State immediate action is necessary and immediately issues a search warrant.  There is a similar provision in the 1911 Act; but there, I think, in its amended form, that Act permits the Superintendent to issue a search warrant only if two conditions are fulfilled: (1) if he regards it as necessary in the interest of the State, and (2) if it is a case of great emergency.  Here again the Minister is taking out the question of an emergency or an emergency situation developing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not really.  It is the same concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think, with respect, it is not, because in both the existing legislation and in the legislation the Minister is proposing to the House, procedure is laid down for obtaining a search warrant from the district court.  That should be the ordinary procedure.  If there is a question of an emergency situation developing, then I agree that the Superintendent should be allowed to issue the search warrant himself, but <Col N="621" /> only if the emergency situation develops. The Minister is nodding his head.  I take it he agrees with me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If so, why not leave the provision there already which made it clear that the Superintendent was only to exercise that authority if an emergency warranted it?  The Minister is taking the idea and concept of an emergency situation developing completely out of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it a little differently&mdash;that is all. Immediate action, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>A little differently to the extent of changing it completely.  In one case, it is laid down in legislation that the Superintendent may do it in a case of great emergency.  Now the Minister says he may do it whether there is a case of emergency or not.  That is the difference.  The Minister thinks it is a little different but I think it goes a bit further than, that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I go back to Section 5 for a minute?  Deputy McGilligan referred to this already.  This might be described briefly as the section dealing with printing, Government contracts and so on.  It is not entirely clear whether or not in the case of a leakage with regard to examination papers the ultimate recipients of the information, the schoolchildren who act on it, will be open under this legislation to criminal prosecution?  I do not think that is intended, but I should like the Minister to confirm the position.  Secondly, it is possible under this Bill as framed for a worker in a printing firm to be guilty of an offence and to be liable to extremely heavy penalties for the disclosure of confidential information.  It would be fair to the printing workers that there should be some provision written into this Bill to ensure that the employer, the person who gets the contract, will have an obligation on him to explain to the workers that the job is one of a secret nature which the workers are not permitted to talk about or disclose in any way.  There should be <Col N="622" /> some onus on the employer to give fair warning to employees whenever there is the slightest danger of this Act being contravened innocently. The Minister will probably appreciate the type of case I have in mind.</P>
    <P>There are a number of these matters we can discuss in more detail later on. I hope the Minister will have another close look at this Bill between now and the Committee Stage and that some of the matters which have been referred to here will be dealt with by means of ministerial amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This could be a most important piece of legislation and yet we are given to understand it is merely a matter of the consolidation, and the expansion to some extent, of statues already in operation.  What occurs to one immediately, of course, is there are many things this House could be doing which are very much more important than consolidating the official secrets legislation.  There are many useful private motions on the Order Paper which the Government do not appear to be able to afford time to discuss.  For that reason, I am puzzled to know why the Government, on the one hand, say we cannot have discussion on what we believe to be important subjects and ask the House to spend its time passing what is alleged to be a piece of consolidating legislation, on the other.  Possibly this is a very technical Bill and I am like a man in the street attempting to understand it to the best of my ability.  But any person has a right to be very careful about any legislation passed by any Parliament which in any way tends to restrict arbitrarily the rights of individuals within its society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, this legislation is introduced at a rather delicate and dangerous time in the life of the State. We all know that great changes are taking place in Europe.  We are part of those changes; we are necessarily bound up in them and we will be carried along by many of those changes. It is in the context of the fears that many of us have that I should like to consider the Bill.  The fear is, of course, that relatively shortly great changes will take place here in relation to our defence position, in relation to <Col N="623" /> our military commitments and possibly even our air force commitments. In those circumstances, assuming that we eventually become members of some great European defence organisation&mdash;NATO or some successor to it&mdash; a Bill of this kind can become particularly dangerous, especially, as has been pointed out by other Deputies, when there has been little or no suggestion that anybody has attempted to betray the State or our society to foreign powers.</P>
    <P>It is, I suppose, a tribute to our people and one which, if circumstances were normal, we could expect would continue&mdash;that there would not be any basic disloyalty among our people that would lead to a betrayal of our State. However, in the new proposed European society of which we will become members, we will no longer be our own bosses entirely.  We might find ourselves becoming subject to dictates which do not originate in the then Government in Merrion Street and we might find ourselves being told, because of our subordinate position in such an organisation, that actions which would be accepted and have been accepted by our own Governments over the years as being perfectly reasonable and normal are, in the minds of outsiders, dangerous, sinister and prejudicial to the whole of the new community of which we will become members.  This legislation is designed to provide for our position in any such society.</P>
    <P>People may think that I am unnecessarily worried or trying to create scares when they are not there.  If the Minister can reassure me I shall be very glad, but at the present moment there are young men and women in jail in Britain for offences against the State under the Official Secrets Act. These people were guilty of what many of us would consider a very fine, courageous and disinterested act&mdash;their determination to try to the best of their ability, tacitly, without the use of force, without in their view trying to disrupt the forces of the State, to prevent Britain pursuing a particular course in relation to its defence policy.</P>
    <P>These people found themselves up on charges before the courts and eventually, <Col N="624" /> as a result of their actions, found themselves in jail.  They had made what would appear to most of us to be a protest in a perfectly democratic way, without violence, but because of the terms of an old law, they were presumed by the courts to have acted in a manner prejudicial to the safety and preservation of the State.  In war-time, many powers are easily understandable, but in peacetime, they could be very dangerous to put into the hands of an irresponsible Minister.  There are circumstances in which I would not exclude the present Minister from behaving in an irresponsible way.  I admit that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.  The Minister has made my point.  On the one hand, you have at the moment the policy of the United States deciding that anybody who becomes a member of the Communist Party intends to overthrow the State and must be kept in jail.  On the other hand, you have Nkrumah of Ghana worried because his political opponents behave in a manner which he says is prejudicial to the safety of the State and he is threatening to imprison them virtually for life.  This legislation in the U.S. and Ghana is regrettably wielded by Ministers who happen to take a particular view.  We have Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal, where jails are full of the people who do not toe the Party line as they see it.  All these people are in jail because, in the opinion of the Government or of the Minister, they behaved in a manner prejudicial to the safety and preservation of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 is the section of this Bill with which I am particularly concerned. I do not know enough about this legislation to say whether it is new.  It would be interesting if the Minister told us to what extent it is new and, if so, why he has introduced it.  It seems to me that any Attorney General or any law officer of the State who wanted to lock up any of his political opponents could use that section as it is at present in a completely irresponsible way and in a manner <Col N="625" /> which would give the person charged virtually no power of reply at all. Subsection (2) says:</P>
    <P>A person shall, unless he proves the contrary, be deemed to have been in communication with a foreign agent or a member of an unlawful organisation if he has (whether within or outside the State) visited the address of a foreign agent or a member of an unlawful organisation or consorted or associated with such agent or member, or if (whether within or outside the State) the name or address of or any other information regarding a foreign agent or a member of an unlawful organisation has been found in his possession or has been supplied by him to any other person or has been obtained by him from any other person.</P>
    <P>I cannot help believing that if the Minister wants some specific power, some reasonable power, it must be possible for his legal advisers to devise a subsection which does not leave itself so wide open to any interpretation a Minister for the time being cares to put on it.</P>
    <P>In Section 9, for instance, we read:</P>
    <P>A person shall not, in any manner prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  obtain, record, communicate to any other person or publish, or</P>
    <P>(b)  have in his possession ...</P>
    <P>What would be the position, looking at it from the pessimistic point of view, when we become a member of the European defence group&mdash;as now seems more and more likely with the shifting of the Minister for External Affairs away from his former position with the United Nations&mdash;if we make available to the Germans, the French, the Americans, for instance, Polaris or nuclear bases in this country?  If protests are carried out by our people, as I hope they will be carried out by our people, against the establishment or the maintenance of these bases, surely a section of this kind can be used quite easily by the <Col N="626" /> Minister to prevent any such peaceful protests?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is conceivable, for instance, that if the police behave badly at these protests, if photographs are taken by press photographers and if the papers or the paper&mdash;is there one?&mdash; that would agree to publish such a photograph of, say, a police brutality, could they be charged with exposing the fact that we had a nuclear base, a Polaris base?  Could that be used as a basis to censure the exposure by the newspaper of any police action designed to prevent any protest being carried out by our people against any of these rather dreadful propositions, which I believe will soon become a reality, in our country?</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister why it is, in relation to this legislation, we seem to have to revert as far as 1911, to the legislation of that time, when conditions surely were very much different from what they are now.  I should like to support, to the extent that I am on all-fours with it, the plea concerning Section 12 about trial <i>in camera.</i> Again, I think that that is a very dangerous proposition.  I wonder whether it should be included at all.</P>
      <P>In relation to this whole question of unlawful organisations, surely the Minister has enough powers under the Offences Against the State Act, unless he intends to get rid of that, which would be a very welcome development, unless he intends to get rid of the arbitrary arrests and trial, trial <i>in camera</i>, trial by military courts, and so on.  Has the Minister not sufficient power already under that legislation to make it unnecessary to expand the powers he already has in this Official Secrets Bill?  I would ask the Minister to be good enough to expand the reasons for Section 10 and the full meaning of that section, of which I, at any rate, have a certain amount of suspicion.</P>

      <P>It is one of the most interesting political novels written since the end of the war.  I believe it would be of very great interest to a number of Deputies and, even better, that it would do them good.  It would open their eyes to a great many things about which they are relatively blind so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> The Minister protests that this is substantially a codification Bill.  There is nothing more dangerous than a Bill introduced into this House under the description of &ldquo;substantially a codification Bill&rdquo; because that disarms the critic.  You are inclined to let the thing go because the Minister says it is a codification and, two years later, he says: &ldquo;I never said that: I said it was &ldquo;substantially'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regard Section 2 (3) as extremely undesirable.  It is certainly a new departure.  It seems to me to be a breach of a very important element in our whole political system, that is, that the independent judiciary are made independent so as to stand as an impregnable wall between the average citizen and an Executive prone to a tyrannical exercise of power.  It is surely undesirable that if an ordinary citizen has recourse to the courts for vindication and protection, he can be met by the Executive in court with a certificate which ends the argument and which sets aside the discretion of the court to intervene.</P>
    <P>Is there any precedent, outside an instrument like the Special Powers Act &mdash;which was specifically designed to deal with an immediate matter of urgency&mdash;where a Minister has power to offer as conclusive evidence his certificate of fact?  There is a danger in this because unfortunately there is a growing number of legislative precedents to the proposition that the certificate of a Minister shall be <i>prima facie</i> regarded as proof of fact.  There is always a tendency to step beyond that &mdash;and that is bad enough&mdash;to the point of making it conclusive evidence.  I do not think the national Executive is justified in making that claim on the Dáil, that we should be party to that decision.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Dr. Browne that sitting in the public street for the purpose of defying the law is a peaceful and democratic way of demonstrating disagreement.  I think it shows a complete misunderstanding of the democratic process.  The democratic process is to come here, as Deputy Dr. Browne has done, and make his tumult here and go out to the street-corner, as he has done, and seek the suffrage of one's neighbours and if <Col N="629" /> he can get it arrive back in the Legislature with the same rights as the Taoiseach or any other Deputy.  That is the democratic process, but to claim that to sit in the public street and hold up the normal functioning of society until the majority yield to the minority is peaceful and democratic is simply fantastic.</P>

      <P>Peaceful agitation in an ordered society can achieve a great deal but it is a very great betrayal of the democratic process to advocate that which is clearly undemocratic as democracy.  Here again there is a danger of behaving like Mr. Khrushchev and his colleagues because that is a technique that is not unknown, adopting the language of democracy and attaching an entirely different meaning to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is consoling.  If they hate you much more than they hate me, we are going places.  I am constantly concerned to reform Deputy Dr. Browne because I have a secret belief that he is not as bad as he looks, or at least as bad as he sounds.  I am opposed heart and soul to subsection (3) of Section 2 and I cannot believe that the Minister will persist in retaining it in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to voice another thought <Col N="630" /> about Section 10.  It is bad in principle to treat on an equal basis communication with foreign agents and communication with unlawful organisations in one's own country.  You may say that the two things are closely analogous from the point of view of the law.  That may be, but in reality, they are not analogous.  There will be a universal consensus of opinion that the person who seeks to betray the interests or secrets of this country to a foreign agent is guilty of high treason and there is no use in pretending, with our history, that we look in the same way on the foreign agent and the illegal organisation, no matter how emphatically we reprobate them.</P>
    <P>No Act of this House is worth much more than the paper on which it is written if it does not carry the feeling and sentiment of the people with it. We could legislate forever to identify illegal organisations of our own people with foreign agents but people will not believe it.  They do not accept it: I do not accept it and I suppose there are few Deputies who reprobate more strongly than I do the activities of illegal organisations and who have a clearer record with which to utter that reprobation.  But, even with that background, I do not look and I did not look upon the Minister's colleagues when they were making war on the legitimate Government of this State in the same way as I would have looked upon a foreign power waging war on the State.  I would reprobate both, and did so loudly and long, but there was a difference and I think it is a difference we should recognise.</P>
    <P>We should not seek in this Section 10 to treat communication with the foreign agent and membership of an unlawful organisation <i>pari passu</i>.  By all means let sufficient provision be made in the law to bring to account persons who participate in the activities of unlawful organisations, but do not seek to identify them with those who communicate with foreign agents because it will not carry the consent and the full and wholehearted support of all our people.</P>
    <P>I understand that one of the sections of this measure goes to the point of making it an offence&mdash;the contractor section&mdash;to publishing an examination <Col N="631" /> paper.  I think I am right in this: The Official Secrets Act ought to deal with what we classify as espionage by foreign agents.  If that is the purpose of the Bill, we shall not have many difficulties in arriving at unanimous agreements as to what the Bill should provide.  I believe we should legislate separately for questions such as the evil of the improper disclosure by a contractor of an examination paper which should be private to the Department of Education. We should legislate separately for offences of that character.  I do not think we should, for the purpose of tidying things up, seek to confound the wholly different natures of offences such as the unauthorised or premature publication of an examination paper and the correspondence of an agent of a foreign power for the purpose of betraying the fundamental liberties of the State.  There is no analogy between the two things.  The people do not understand any analogy you seek to show and you rob the Legislature of any of the support it ought to have.</P>
    <P>We all agree that when we are dealing with people concerned to <Col N="632" /> betray the vital interests of the State to foreign agents, you must have strong powers and we would be prepared to give strong powers, provided they are strictly confined to that particular abuse.  We are all prepared, or the great majority of us are &mdash;if dealing with an illegal organisation, it may be necessary&mdash;to give wide powers but I think that we should do that with due recognition of the ordinary and well-known sentiments of our people.</P>
    <P>We all agree that there are certain confidential documents which no public servant ought to discuss and there are certain documents, such as examination papers, which are in the hands of a contractor and which must be kept secret, but it seems, other than that, to seek to provide in the same piece of legislation for offences of that character and offences of espionage and sending out information on the confidential affairs of the State to a foreign power is not the proper procedure.</P>
