      <P>I move that the Committee <Col N="216" /> agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 4 deleted.</P>
      <P>The Bill, as passed by Dáil Eireann, contained in Section 4 some minor provisions to amend Section 22, subsection (1) of the Pilotage Act, 1913, which would, <i>inter alia,</i> abolish the requirement that statistical returns from Pilotage Authorities be presented to the Oireachtas.  The wish was expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that this requirement might be retained and, since I had no strong views in the matter one way or the other, I undertook to have the section dropped from the Bill in the Seanad. The Bill, with Section 4 deleted, has been approved by the Seanad and is now recommended to the House in its amended form.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 12, line 46, to delete &ldquo;who is a solicitor or barrister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It has been pointed out that sometimes a coroner who is a doctor might assist in the drawing up of a will under which he would be a beneficiary and that, therefore, the prohibition in subsection (2) of Section 45 on &ldquo;legal&rdquo; coroners holding inquests should be extended to medical coroners when they find themselves in the same position. Under the subsection, as proposed to be revised, any coroner or deputy coroner will be prohibited from holding an inquest or inquiring into the death of any person where he has drawn up or assisted in drawing up the will of the deceased person and benefits under it.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 31:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 12, line 49, to delete &ldquo;and is a beneficiary under&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to delete certain words.  The object of this is that a person should not act as a coroner in the case of a death where, prior to that death, he has helped in the drawing up of a will or a testamentary disposition.  The matter is limited to those words.  He is precluded from acting only if he has assisted in the drawing up of a will or is a beneficiary under it.  Suppose a doctor helped to draw up a will under which he benefited and the testator died under peculiar circumstances then the doctor could not hold the inquest. The term &ldquo;is a beneficiary&rdquo; is very narrow.  It would not apply, for instance, if a solicitor drew up a will under which his wife, his family, relatives or friends were to benefit.  I do not see why it should not be extended to cover the complete range of full testamentary disposition.  If a coroner has assisted in the drawing up of a will, no matter who benefits, he should not hold the inquest on the body of the testator.  The phrase is far too narrow. If it were changed to &ldquo;a will under which he benefits&rdquo; or &ldquo;which benefits him&rdquo; that would be a different matter. Being a beneficiary under a will is a very technical matter and I suggest it would be better to say that if a coroner had occasion to draw up the testamentary disposition of the deceased, he should not hold the inquest.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with Deputy McGilligan's point of view in this matter.  This is a new provision and the entire concept of subsection (2) is new to the law.  We want to ensure that there will be no conflicts of interest between the two capacities of the coroner and this concept deals with the case where there is a solicitor-coroner. I think it desirable that the coroner should, as far as possible, have no connection whatever with a deceased or his affairs.  However, we must be practical about this and realise that we cannot put too many impositions on the coroner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="218" /> We can visualise the situation in a country town where the solicitor-coroner has a large practice.  As we all know, there will be an accumulation of wills in any solicitor's office which have been drawn up over the years and left in the solicitor's safe.  We would be putting an undue obligation on a solicitor-coroner if we compelled him on every occasion when he was about to carry out an inquest to go through the accumulated wills in his office and ascertain that he had not drawn up the will of the deceased.</P>
    <P>However, I think the suggestion made by Deputy McGilligan is a good one which would probably meet both our points of view.  I undertake to have another look at the actual wording of the provision and see if we might expand the concept of &ldquo;beneficiary&rdquo; somewhat.</P>
    <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite see that as a procedure for summoning a witness, this is clear enough.  The section states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every summons to attend an inquest as a juror or witness shall be served by a member of the Garda Síochána, either by delivering it to the person to whom it is addressed or by leaving it for him at the address at which he ordinarily resides with a person of the age of 16 years or upwards.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I thought the procedure heretofore was that they went out into the street and stopped the first six men they met.</P>

      <P>Section 38 is in terms of examining a witness on oath. In the pattern of the old statutes, there are certain people who object to taking an oath and then there are provisions so that they can affirm or bind their consciences in some other manner.  I suppose the oath here covers affirmation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 32:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), paragraph (a), page 13, line 37, before &ldquo;, or&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or infanticide&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The situation as between Section 39 and Section 40 is that a coroner may hold an inquest with or without a jury. According to Section 40, he must have a jury to deal with certain matters.  One is if he is of opinion that the deceased came by his death by murder or man-slaughter. It seems to be a peculiar omission to leave out infanticide which was ranked until three or four years ago as murder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that under the Infanticide Act of 1949 a woman cannot be charged with infanticide; she may only be charged with murder.  The initial charge in the case of infanticide is not infanticide; the woman concerned would have to be charged with murder so that for the purposes of paragraph (a) of subsection (1) it really depends on which way you want to look at it.  If the coroner <Col N="221" /> is looking at what the person concerned would ultimately be charged with then we are right in leaving out infanticide because you cannot charge a woman with infanticide, only with murder.  On the other hand, if it is a question of what the accused person will be tried for or convicted of then there is no harm in putting in infanticide. From my point of view I do not think it is necessary to put in infanticide here but if the amendment is pressed I have no particular objection to it.</P>

On a death occurring and notification being given of an inquest or post mortem to be held the coroner may direct that the body be removed to a convenient mortuary or morgue or other suitable <Col N="224" /> place.

      <P>&ldquo;(b) adjourns an inquest at which evidence of identification and medical evidence as to the cause of death has been given, or&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 33 and 34 is fairly simple.  They are being moved to facilitate the registration of deaths in cases where an inquest which has been adjourned may not be resumed for an extended period&mdash;perhaps because the police investigations prove to be unduly protracted or because criminal proceedings which have been instituted are not finally disposed of for a considerable time. It is possible that hardship may occur in such cases to relatives of a deceased by the absence of a death certificate. The amendment makes it clear that the coroner will be able to furnish the Registrar of Births and Deaths with the necessary particulars for registration at an inquest which is adjourned after evidence of identification and medical evidence as to the cause of death has been given.  It is envisaged that in every case before adjourning an inquest at the request of the police, a coroner will, as far as practicable, take evidence of identification and medical evidence as to the cause of death.</P>

    <P>I am moving this amendment because it has been suggested that the prohibition which Section 53 imposes on coroners or deputy coroners who are solicitors or barristers is unduly restrictive as it would prevent them from acting not only in criminal proceedings arising out of the inquest but also in any civil matters which might arise.  The present law imposes no restriction of any kind in relation to civil proceedings of that kind; and the prohibition in Section 37 of the 1846 Act on a coroner acting as attorney in <Col N="229" /> any criminal proceedings against a person who had been charged by a coroner's inquisition has become obsolete because it is no longer possible for persons to be charged with crimes by coroner's inquisition.  I think it is reasonable to restore the prohibition in so far as it concerns criminal proceedings but on reconsideration, I do not think it reasonable to extend it to civil proceedings and the insertion of the word &ldquo;criminal&rdquo; before &ldquo;proceedings&rdquo;, as proposed by the amendment, will give effect to this view.</P>

      <P>With regard to this, fees are to be prescribed by regulation which has to come before the House.  I just want to call attention to this fact.  I am told that there is a practice in the countryside that where people are summoned to assist at a post mortem or an inquest or to give evidence, a local doctor is called in and he gets a rather small fee for attending.  If the inquest is a serious one requiring the State Pathologist, he travels down from the city and, naturally and reasonably, he gets a large fee.  I am told that there are occasions when coroners have decided not to call on the State Pathologist but to get the assistance of a specialist, of the pathology type, from a neighbouring county.  I am told that on those occasions the gentlemen called in are given a very small fee and their attendance is not easy to get.  I suggest some attention should be given to that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second time.  The object of this Bill is to introduce a scheme of free legal aid in certain criminal cases.  It involves a radical departure from the present arrangements which allow free legal aid only to poor persons accused of murder and also in certain cases where a new trial is ordered by the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Supreme Court. Although the scheme is new, and therefore to some extent experimental, it is comprehensive in character and provides not only for legal aid in criminal courts of first instance but also in the various courts of appeal. In this respect we are departing from normal precedent as both the British and Northern Ireland schemes, when introduced, contained no provision in relation to appeals from summary courts by way of case stated or otherwise. In fact, this is still the position in Northern Ireland though a recommendation by the Steele Committee there to extend the scheme to these <Col N="233" /> appeals has been accepted in principle. The Government have considered it advisable to commence with a scheme that is as comprehensive as possible in our particular circumstances.</P>
      <P>Although the provisions of the Bill have necessarily to be formulated to deal separately with all the various cases in which legal aid can be made available and are therefore somewhat lengthy, the main features of the scheme can be stated fairly simply. A person who cannot afford to be legally represented and who is charged with any offence before the District Court may, by reason of the gravity of the charge or of exceptional circumstances, be granted by the Court a certificate which will entitle him to the services of a solictor and, where he is charged with murder and the Court thinks fit, of counsel.  Any person returned for trial for an indictable offence and who cannot afford legal representation may also be granted free legal aid in the preparation and conduct of his defence at the trial and have a solicitor and counsel assigned to him for that purpose.  Such a certificate may be granted either by the district court when the accused person is returned for trial, or by the trial judge.  It will be granted in murder cases merely on the ground of insufficient means; in other cases regard must also be had to all the circumstances of the case, including the nature of any defence that may be set up. In appeal cases, legal aid will be provided for persons of insufficient means in offences of a serious nature or in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant of legal aid is subject to the overriding consideration that it must appear to the court to be essential in the interests of justice, having regard to the factors I have mentioned in relation to the various kinds of criminal proceedings, that the accused should have legal aid in the preparation and conduct of his defence or of his appeal, as the case may be.  It will be seen, therefore, that the court is being given not only responsibility for determining whether the means of a person are insufficient to obtain legal aid but also a wide discretion in determining <Col N="234" /> in what cases it is proper to allow free legal aid.</P>
    <P>I think there will be general agreement on the necessity for having a scheme of this kind.  It is unfortunately true that miscarriages of justice can take place under the present system because accused persons are unable to afford legal representation. It is impossible, in the nature of things, to say definitely how often, or how seldom, a miscarriage of justice occurs for that reason but I believe the number of genuine miscarriages of justice in this country is not substantial. I base my belief on the voluntary contribution which the legal profession has made by supplying proper representation in deserving cases and on the high standards which our judges and justices have consistently maintained in ensuring that accused persons who are not legally represented are treated with scrupulous fairness.  Notwithstanding that the amount of serious injustice arising from the absence of legal aid is not substantial, the present position may entail serious hardship, including perhaps loss of liberty, to individual citizens and for this reason alone it is desirable to have a legal aid scheme.</P>
    <P>The situation does not, however, call for the grant of free legal aid in every criminal case or even in serious criminal cases where, as so often happens, there is no difficulty about the facts or about the law applicable to them.  For example, free legal aid could not be justified in the case of experienced criminals&mdash;and there are quite a few of them&mdash;who have deliberately decided to make a living of crime.  These criminals frequently continue to commit burglaries and house-breakings even while on remand in the expectation, which no doubt is often realised, that their activities may not be discovered or, if they are, that the sentence they will eventually receive will not by any means be proportionately greater.  They are sufficiently well versed in the intricacies of criminal procedure not to require professional legal services at public expense. At the same time I realise that the possibility of some exceptional circumstances which might make it <Col N="235" /> essential in the interests of justice to provide free legal aid even to criminals of this sort cannot be completely excluded.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the scheme provided for in the Bill does not propose to allow the grant of free legal aid in any indiscriminate fashion.  The courts will have the responsibility of examining each case&mdash;except where criminal appeals are permitted to be taken to the Supreme Court and where a point of law of exceptional public importance is bound to be involved&mdash;to see whether having regard to the particular circumstances it is essential in the interests of justice that free legal aid be provided.  I have no doubt that the courts will interpret these provisions in a common sense manner just as similar provisions have been interpreted in Britain and Northern Ireland. In this way genuine miscarriages of justice will be prevented and the grant of legal aid will be confined to serious cases of real doubt or difficulty.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is essentially an enabling measure, I think I need refer particularly only to the provision about regulations in Section 9.  Somewhat elaborate administrative arrangements will be necessary to provide for the coming into operation of the scheme. The forms of the various certificates and the manner in which solicitors and counsel are to be assigned pursuant to them will have to be prescribed.  Details of these administrative arrangements are at present being worked out but I can say that, as regards the assignment of solicitors and counsel, a list will be prepared in each court of solicitors and counsel who are willing to undertake the defence of persons who have been granted legal aid certificates.</P>
    <P>It will be a matter for the justice or judge, as the case may be, to assign a solicitor from the list but he will be required to take into consideration any representations which the prisoner may make.  Any member of the Bar whose name appears upon the list kept in the court may be instructed on behalf of the prisoner by the solicitor who has been assigned.</P>
    <P>Fees will have to be prescribed for professional work done under the scheme and I have received representations <Col N="236" /> from the Law Society and the Bar Council on the matter.  I am giving careful consideration to these representations. I have been assured by the Law Society and the Bar Council of their desire to co-operate in making this scheme a success and I am sure that it will be possible, with the co-operation of both professions, to minimise any initial difficulties that may arise in the early stages of its operation.  I have already had a preliminary discussion with the Law Society and I expect to discuss the scheme with the Bar Council very shortly.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to say a word about another matter which may be present in the minds of some Deputies in connection with this Bill. I refer to the suggestion which has been made from time to time that the costs of defendants who are acquitted should be met from public funds.  The suggestion is not that costs should be paid from public funds in all cases of acquittal because, quite obviously, a dismiss or a verdict of not guilty does not always, or even often, mean that the acquitted person is entirely innocent of the charge but rather that the charge has not been proved.  What is in mind is that there should be discretion vested in the court which dismisses the case or acquits the defendant to award the costs of the defence, it being understood that this discretion would not be exercised except in a most exceptional case, such as, for example, a case of mistaken identity or where it was clear that a prosecution should never have been brought. In my opinion, the suggestion is worthy of serious consideration, but I do not think that, even if it were accepted, it would be appropriate to give effect to it in this Bill and I intend to await some practical experience of the operation of the present scheme before considering the matter further.</P>
    <P>A second related matter is the question of providing a system of legal aid and perhaps also legal advice in civil cases.  This proposal is one that could not be embarked upon without detailed investigation.  Such a scheme would be costly: in Northern Ireland the cost has been estimated to be in the region of £90,000.  Here again it is obvious that we must <Col N="237" /> wait until experience has been gained of the operation of the criminal legal aid scheme here before exploring the possibilities of embarking on a scheme of civil legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>This is a piece of social legislation which will, I think, be acceptable in principle to all sides of the House. Any suggestions that Deputies may wish to put forward for the improvement of any particular aspect of it will be welcomed by me and will receive careful consideration before the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment, at any rate, I think the Minister will concede that this Bill is all sizzle and no steak.  The steak will not be served up to us until the Minister makes his regulations under the Bill, but, in so far as the Bill is a start on the question of free legal aid, I certainly welcome it.</P>
      <P>We should bear in mind that although the Minister speaks of the Bill as being a radical alteration and comprehensive in character, the Bill is nevertheless a very limited one.  By reason of the way it is deliberately framed, its interpretation will be even more restricted than would appear from the Title.  The idea of giving free legal aid in necessitous cases is a good one, which will be welcomed by the House as part of social welfare legislation, but the Bill is restricted purely and simply to criminal matters.  In that we are still lagging very far behind the legislation in England, where there is a comprehenstive free legal aid scheme, both on the criminal and civil side.</P>
      <P>The Minister seemed to be rather nervous on the question of expense on the civil side and referred to the estimate in Northern Ireland.  He may be mistaken in this because my understanding of the position is that in England, when the civil free legal aid scheme was operated there, the net cost to the State was comparatively low.  If my memory serves me correctly, it was something in the region of £1,300,000 a year, which is very small having regard&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="238" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The civil side in England.  The figure I heard was something under £1,500,000 net&mdash;as I said, something like £1,300,000.  That is very small having regard to the fact that there is a very much bigger population in England and that approximately 60 per cent. of the cases which were dealt with on the civil side under the free legal aid scheme were divorce cases.  Accordingly, the Minister probably need not be nervous on the question of the cost in contemplating free legal aid on the civil side here because you must remember it is the net cost to the State that is important to the Minister and, obviously, in any legal aid scheme which envisages both criminal free legal aid and civil free legal aid the brunt of the cost will be borne by the criminal side and not by the civil side because, when a deserving case is assisted by the State by providing legal aid, if the case is a good one the odds are that there will be no costs at all to be borne by the State because they will be borne by the unsuccessful litigant, assuming the successful litigant is what I would call the State-aided one.</P>
      <P>The Bill at the moment is confined to legal aid on the criminal side.  It will be much more restricted than that. The Minister adverted to this and gave some of the reasons.  Under this Bill, legal aid will be supplied only if the court finds two things.  One is that the person applying for a certificate to enable him to have free legal aid is a person of insufficient means.  All of us will agree that that is a provision which should be in the Bill.  It goes on also to say that the court must also find that, by reason of the gravity of the charge or of exceptional circumstances, it is essential in the interest of justice, that he should have legal aid in the preparation and conduct of his defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, as I say, will further restrict the application of this Bill.  It also raises, to my mind anyway, a question of principle.  It seems to me that what we are saying in this Bill is that we are prepared to concede it is necessary <Col N="239" /> to ensure justice provided the charge is grave or the circumstances exceptional but that we are not concerned with how justice is done if the charge cannot be regarded as grave or the circumstances exceptional.  I do not think that is a good principle and I think it also raises, from the point of view of the applicant for a legal aid certificate, this question: that he is virtually put in the position of disclosing his defence in advance.  If we were talking about a free legal aid scheme for civil matters that might be reasonable.  I do not think it is reasonable in criminal cases that you should put the defendant who, after all, is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty, in the position that before he gets any assistance under this Bill he must, in fact, disclose his defence or a substantial part of it.</P>
    <P>If we approach this from the view that all citizens are to be held to be equal under the Constitution or equal before the law, we must accept the Bill as necessary to ensure that people who cannot fend for themselves in legal matters, or who have not got sufficient means to engage a solicitor or counsel, must be given assistance.  The Bill does recognise that and I welcome it for that reason.  It has a number of defects. The first I have already referred to&mdash; perhaps it is unfair to call it a defect &mdash;namely, the restricted character of the Bill and it will probably become more restricted even than appears at first sight.</P>
    <P>Also I notice in the Bill that it is necessary and specifically provided that the applicant for free legal aid must himself apply for the certificate either in writing or appear personally before the court.  I would urge on the Minister between now and Committee Stage to reconsider that provision.  It seems to me that the ordinary type of person who will require free legal aid is most unlikely to be able to make a proper application in writing and it is most unlikely also that he will be able to make a proper case for himself if he has to appear before the court, whether it is the district court or one of the higher courts, to get any of the certificates provided for in the Bill.  I may possibly have read the Bill too hastily, <Col N="240" /> but my impression from reading it is that it is specifically provided that the applicant must do this himself and that he is not given the option of moving through a solicitor or any other agent.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, this Bill, to my mind, suffers from the very grave defect that it does not provide that this scheme should be operated by the legal profession&mdash;either the barristers or the solicitors.  It seems to me that under the scheme as outlined in the Bill this is to be a Civil Service administration and I think that is wrong and I think it is dangerous.</P>
    <P>In matters requiring free legal assistance on the criminal side, very often Departments of State, or the State itself, will be the accuser.  Yet, the administration of this free legal aid is apparently to be put into the hands of the Civil Service.  It is quite clear that if this Bill, or any scheme under the Bill, is to be workable, it can be workable only with the full co-operation of both branches of the legal profession and I think the Minister should take heed of what happened in connection with the health services in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe that a great deal of our difficulties with the health services in this country were due to the fact that the medical profession were not fully invited to give their co-operation to the schemes which were proposed or to co-operate in a way which would make the administration of the schemes workable.  The Minister should be very careful that he does not fall into the same error with regard to the legal provision in this Bill.  Any scheme of free legal aid, if it is to be workable, must, in my view, be worked and administered by the professions, with the assistance of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Steele Committee report in Northern Ireland. It is worthwhile having a look at paragraph 107 of that report:</P>
    <P>All the evidence put to us from both lay and legal sources strongly stressed that it was undesirable that any scheme of legal aid or advice should be administered directly by persons employed by the State, or by any legal or public authority.  We entirely agree with this view.  The <Col N="241" /> fact that the State and local authorities are themselves frequently parties to litigation in civil proceedings is an unanswerable argument against either of them being in control of the administration of a legal aid scheme.  We consider it important that the traditional and long-established relationship, privileges and responsibilities between client, solicitor and counsel should be preserved and it follows from this that any scheme, its organisation, administration and control, must be in the hands of the legal profession, which should itself provide the necessary legal services and be remunerated on the normal professional basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be correct, but I think the same arguments apply.  He will, I am sure, concede that in the Guthrie report in Scotland the same view was maintained in relation to the criminal side. The Minister may be correct in saying paragraph 107 relates to civil matters. I do not think it is really important. All these arguments apply equally to the criminal side, apply with very much greater force to the criminal side than they do to the civil side.  On the civil side, while State Departments and public authorities are frequently parties to litigation, I should imagine that the proportion of cases on the criminal side in which they are parties would be fewer, but in most criminal cases <Col N="242" /> the State will be a party.  It is only in the odd case&mdash;a dispute between neighbours, one neighbour bringing a charge for assault, or something like that, against the other&mdash;that one has a lay person as complainant in a criminal matter.</P>
      <P>The view I am expressing is not new. About 12 years ago, I was a member of the Dublin Corporation.  The question of free legal aid was discussed there.  I have had a look at the reports and I see that I suggested, by way of amendment to the motion in 1948, and the amendment was seconded by the late Alderman Peadar Doyle&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Council is of opinion that there is urgent need for the establishment of a Legal Aid Scheme for the purpose of giving needy citizens free legal assistance, and of aiding at a nominal and scaled charge, persons who are within the National Health Insurance Society's income limit; and that the Council requests the city manager to invite the Council of the Bar of Ireland and the Council of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland to enter into discussions with the City Council with a view to formulating definite proposals on the subject for submission to the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Local Government.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I simply mention the matter to show that I did then&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That principle is not recognised here and that is a weakness in the Bill.  I urge the Minister very strongly, certainly if there is to be any extension of free legal aid to the civil side, that he should ensure that its administration is left to the legal professions.  In some respects, we are in a difficult position discussing <Col N="243" /> the Bill because, as in the case of many other Bills, implementation will depend on ministerial regulations and until we see the regulations, we can have no idea how the Bill will fare.</P>
      <P>There is no provision in the Bill, there is no guide in the Bill, as to how the remuneration of solicitors and counsel will be dealt with.  The Legal Aid Advice Act of 1949 in England lays down a guiding principle and I think the Minister should incorporate a similar principle in this Bill.  The section in the 1949 English Act provides that the Secretary of State in exercising any power to make rules and regulations as to the amounts payable to counsel or solicitors assigned to give legal aid, and so on, shall have regard to the principle of allowing fair remuneration according to the work actually and reasonably done.  It would be no harm if the Minister were to insert a similar guiding principle in this Bill for the benefit of himself and whatever section of his Department will deal with the question of remuneration.</P>
      <P>There is one other point I should like to raise in relation to Section 8 which provides:</P>
      <P>Where a legal aid (trial on indictment) certificate is granted in respect of a person, the Court of Criminal Appeal shall not have jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, or Section 5 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1928, to award costs to the person in respect of court proceedings to which the certificate applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That raises the question that under the 1924 and 1928 Acts, a person was entitled to get complete indemnity in respect of costs.  The Minister is now providing that if the defendant obtains a free legal aid certificate, he will not get the full indemnity which was hitherto provided.  My recollection is that in the explanatory memorandum the Minister explains that.  I think he referred to it in his opening remarks by saying: &ldquo;The purpose of this provision is to obviate double payments of costs by the State.&rdquo;  I would suggest to the Minister that that can <Col N="244" /> be very simply provided for by including in the Bill a provision that the costs paid by virtue of the free legal aid certificate should be offset against the costs which the court, but for this Bill, would be entitled to grant under the 1924 or the 1928 Act.</P>
    <P>If the Bill remains as it is at present, it means that simply because a person was not able to afford his own defence and had to get a free legal aid certificate he will be precluded from getting the full indemnity to which but for that he would have been entitled.  Of course, it is not the defendant who will suffer.  It is his legal advisers.  I do feel that members of the profession who co-operate in trying to make this Bill and the scheme under it workable should not be penalised for doing that. That is, in fact, what it amounts to and I should like the Minister to have another look at that before the Committee Stage and possibly provide that the matter might be dealt with by set-off rather than as suggested by him now.</P>
    <P>With the exception of those few criticisms, which are not intended as nagging criticisms, I welcome the Bill. I hope that the Minister's Department, in the not too far distant future, will go the next step of introducing a comprehensive Bill not only on the criminal side but on the civil side also.</P>

      <P>This Bill will not advance things very much but so far as it goes it is to a great extent welcome. A person who cannot afford to purchase legal aid at the moment will get aid without any out-of-pocket expenses.  Poor people or people who find themselves in restricted circumstances and who are charged with very serious offences on the criminal side nearly always get aid from both sides of the legal profession but as regards the ordinary person who cannot purchase legal aid I do not see that it will make much difference. I have no doubt that before long this Bill will be described as another piece of legislation to give more money to the profession.  However, it means that people who up to now have acted gratuitously without any hope of reward will have some <Col N="245" /> hope of receiving something for their efforts.  It should be recognised that not merely in a serious case but even in quite small cases which are a source of anxiety to poor people, the aid of the solicitors' profession undoubtedly is very much available in the district court and the members of my own profession aid at the higher levels in that grade as far as the individual is concerned.</P>
      <P>There is not very much change as far as the members of the profession are concerned.  They may or they may not achieve very much.  First of all, to repeat very briefly what Deputy O'Higgins has just said, this is restricted entirely to criminal matters. Not merely that, but it is criminal matters where the charge is grave, as put in one case, where the offence is serious, or where there has been a conviction and there is an appeal.  In addition to its being a grave charge or a serious offence it has to be proved that the person's means are insufficient.</P>
      <P>I do realise that there is the consideration that because of exceptional circumstances it may be essential in the interest of justice that we should have legal aid.  Exceptional circumstances will not often apply to the lower levels of trial.  There is the region of cases stated where some point of special importance to the public is in issue, but in this case, of course, the offending person does not worry very much whether the point is worth taking to a higher court as a case stated or as a point of law.  His interest is entirely how he is going to be affected by some kind of fine or some term of imprisonment.  There is not a great deal of advance here.  There is some sign of advance but nothing much to trumpet about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Higgins says about the administrative side.  In the earlier sections the scheme is outlined, the special circumstances of the offence, insufficient means, all the time restricted by the framework of criminal matters.  Then we come to the regulations to be made under Section 9. The whole thing is to be done by regulation and, amongst other things, the regulations are being made by the <Col N="246" /> Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance together or, I suppose, the usual thing, by the Minister for Justice under the control of the Minister for Finance.  He has to decide what rates or scales of fees, and so on, are payable out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas and, secondly, the manner in which solicitors and counsel are to be assigned.  Surely at that point it would be appropriate to say &ldquo;after consultation with the Bar Council of Ireland or the Council of the Incorporated Law Society.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question of the assignment, that is to say, the choice of the individual firm of solicitors and the individual practitioner on the barristers' side, is a very important matter.  There are also the rates of remuneration referred to in the Guthrie Report.  Seeing that this Bill is restricted to the criminal side surely there is great need for taking care with certain things.  In this country all criminal offences must be prosecuted in the name or the suit of the Attorney General.  He becomes a party on one side to all criminal proceedings. It ought to be quite clear that his office should have nothing to do with the assignment of counsel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall wait until we see the regulations.  The only occasion on which counsel are assigned nowadays is in respect of constitutional cases, and if we have got to have a murder trial assignment, it is done by the court.  It is to be hoped that will be the procedure to be followed.  Surely the experience and the reputation of the two councils of the Bar of Ireland and the solicitors' profession are things which ought to be tied in with this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note the expression of view from the two associations that they were favourably disposed and that they will co-operate.  Of course they will but there should be co-operation from the other side.  The co-operation of the other side could be obtained if they were associated even in a consultative capacity with the making of these regulations.  I know the matter of <Col N="247" /> finance was under the control of the Lord of the Treasury and now under the Minister for Finance.  That is all right.  We are gradually getting away from that sort of view.  The fact that moneys are paid out of the Oireachtas need not be regarded as such a handicap as it used to be.  It would not, I think, destroy the effective control of the Minister for Finance in regard to the large resources of the State, it would not to any great extent slacken his grip in these things to have an association with two such reputable bodies on such matters as the emoluments which are to be given and the manner in which solicitors are to be assigned in pursuance of the certificate.</P>
    <P>An interesting thought will certainly occur to people reading this provision about legal aid.  Take a person charged with a very serious offence who has insufficient means and who has to get legal aid.  Supposing a man is charged with a very serious offence in the nature of fraudulent conversion or something like that and is, at the same time, going through the bankruptcy courts on the grounds that he is insolvent.  Could such a person qualify for legal aid?  There has been a notable case here recently which will cost the State an enormous sum of money because at a certain stage the Court of Criminal Appeal ordered that certain charges were to be tried.  It had to be done at the expense of the State. I am sure that expense will be measured in a different way from what the regulations under Section 9 would apply to.</P>
    <P>Deputy M.J. O'Higgins made a certain suggestion which appears reasonable.  We have Taxing Masters. Could the system of remuneration not be put on a basis such as the Taxing Master would pass if it was an ordinary criminal case?  We have these functionaries.  They are in operation. Instead of leaving this to be met by two Ministers, with a regulation to be brought before the House to either take it or leave it, it would be much better to use the machinery available, the two societies and the Taxing Master's Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to congratulate the Minister on his strenuous efforts to bring forward law reform in this country.  Deputies on the other side of the House have indicated that they do not think much of this Bill.  Deputy McGilligan said it was nothing to trumpet about.  It is the first such Bill we have had in Dáil Éireann and considerable credit is due to the Minister for its introduction.  It does not tackle the whole problem, as the Minister made quite clear, but it is a step in the right direction which I think will be welcomed on all sides.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister.  Some of them have already been mentioned by Deputy O'Higgins.  Perhaps I may be permitted to reinforce them?  It is obvious that the success of any scheme of free legal aid depends on the co-operation of the legal profession.  The Minister has been assured of that co-operation in principle and I have no doubt he will get it but, on his side, he must ensure that the scheme is operable from the legal profession's point of view and that it is fair to them.</P>
      <P>The legal profession feel strongly that there should be no incursion by the State into the relation between solicitor and client or between counsel and solicitor and client.  It may be that this scheme will not result in any incursion.  One of the difficulties is that, because we do not know what will be contained in the regulations to be made under the Bill, we do not know to what extent we have to guard against that danger.  I urge the Minister to ensure that the regulations are such that there will be no possibility of its being alleged that there is any incursion into the solicitor and client relationship by the State or by any civil servant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister cannot accept at the moment, for the limited purposes of this Bill, the principle of having the scheme operated by the legal profession I urge him to consider accepting&mdash;and, if possible, to commit himself in public&mdash;that principle for any extension of this scheme which will undoubtedly take place in the future.  It is essential that the accused <Col N="249" /> person who is to obtain free legal aid should have a choice of solicitor from the panel available.  The Minister said the wishes of the accused would be taken into account.  I do not think that goes far enough.  Provided there is a panel available, if the accused selects a particular solicitor or counsel to defend him, and that man is willing to act, he should be the man to act for him and not anybody assigned by the judge or anybody else.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The legal profession has rather bitter experience on the question of the costs paid by the State in criminal matters.  I am speaking of solicitors and counsel assigned in murder cases.  There have been recent increases but the fees are still absurdly low considering the work and responsibility involved.  The members of the profession are apprehensive that, in the regulations the Minister may make prescribing fees, he may to some extent be guided by those scales.  I know the Minister intends to consult with the Incorporated Law Society and, I think, with the Bar Council on this question. I would ask him to consider the suggestion by Deputy O'Higgins that the Bill should provide that such fees shall be fair and reasonable.  If they are <Col N="250" /> not, the Minister will find that very few legal practitioners, certainly not the best ones, will be prepared to act on this panel and the scheme will lose its efficacy.  If the accused person is impoverished, he is still entitled to get the best legal advice available.  I think that is the principle on which the Minister is working in the Bill and he should ensure that it will be carried through.</P>
      <P>I should like to see further details of the method by which solicitor and counsel will be assigned enshrined in the Bill and not in the regulations. Perhaps the Minister would consider whether some, at least, of the steps that will be necessary in this respect cannot be enshrined in the Bill?  It is very important.  The whole scheme hinges on how this operates.  It is important that this House should have an opportunity of considering the machinery which the Minister will be setting up as the corner stone of the whole scheme.  I realise the difficulties involved but I am rather intrigued to know how any justice or judge is to decide that a person has insufficient means and is unable to obtain legal aid.  Far be it from me to suggest the introduction of a means test.  I presume we are to take it that it is being left to the discretion of the justice.  If that is so, is it possible that in one court a man who has a certain amount of income or a certain amount of capital will be deemed to have insufficient means and in another court a man with considerably less means will be deemed to have sufficient?  If anything can be done to clarify that position it will help the whole scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect of this question of assignment which worries me and it is one of the reasons why I urge the Minister to include more details in the Bill.  It is that this free legal aid scheme will not be available to habitual criminals.  I can well appreciate the Minister's reason that the public does not feel it should be called upon to pay taxes for the purpose of assisting habitual criminals to get free legal aid and avoid the consequences of their acts.  How is it to be decided that an accused person is not entitled to free legal aid because, to use the loose <Col N="251" /> phrase, he is an habitual criminal? You can have somebody who&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that there is a certain element of finding the man guilty before he is tried in deciding that he is an habitual criminal. He could, for instance, have been convicted quite a number of times of a particular offence and charged with another type of offence of which he is not guilty.  We know in practice that a person who is an habitual criminal is one of the first people the police will pick on, if a crime has been committed. In 99 cases out of 100, they are right in following up these people and checking on them.  It happens, as a result, that these people are charged on occasion with offences they have not committed and are not guilty of the particular offence.  Very often, they have not much hope of going free because of their record and because they are habitual criminals.  In this case, not only will they have the difficulty which exists at present but it looks as if they will not have any opportunity of free legal aid.</P>
      <P>I realise the Minister's difficulties in this matter.  I am pointing out that there are other difficulties involved and that the Minister should give them due consideration before the next Stage of the Bill.  I again congratulate the Minister not only on this Bill but also on his other effort in regard to legal reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much on this, except to refer to a point which has been more or less dealt with already&mdash;the question of the habitual criminal who is under suspicion for a more serious crime&mdash;I would go further and say an unrelated crime.  The police theory is a natural and proper one.  It is a proper method of operation.  If a housebreaking has been committed, they will <Col N="252" /> investigate it and may find that the method of the crime points in a certain direction.  They will follow up such clues.  That is all very legitimate and an habitual criminal, who appears habitually on the same type of crime, should certainly be excluded from being facilitated in his course of conduct by getting free legal aid every time he is up.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I should imagine &mdash;I think the records will show&mdash;that there is a certain danger that certain serious crimes can be erroneously charged to a man who has a criminal record.  There can be occasions when there will be a circumstantial linking of the two unrelated crimes.  It can go further than that.  You can have relatively trivial cases where an injustice might be worked and might work all the more easily because of the fact that it is trivial.  Therefore, in the case of the habitual criminal, I should like to see a restriction, shall I say, to his speciality.  In other words, such persons should not have free legal aid, if it is a crime they have been guilty of before and is in accordance with their course of conduct.  Any citizen whatsoever, no matter who he may be, if he is charged with a crime, whether serious or otherwise, involving possible imprisonment, should have the full facilities of every other citizen for defence if the circumstances are such as to make that crime a unique thing in his case.  The fact that a man is an habitual housebreaker should not influence in any way a charge of manslaughter.  Everyone will accept that.  It should not influence a conviction for a serious crime like arson or murder.  Apart from serious crimes, even in relatively trivial crimes where an injustice can be done, unless the course of conduct indicates habitual crime with specific relation to the charge in question, then the man should not be denied legal aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise a matter in regard to the question of refusing aid to anybody.  If we are to give it at all, what do you gain by putting in this provision that habitual criminals will not get legal aid?  Not very much because you will have very few cases except in one particular and that particular <Col N="253" /> is on the petty district court level where it will not matter very much.  The question is to find a precise and accurate form of limitation.</P>
    <P>Let me say a word on a matter which is not in this Bill.  It is no doubt important to give free legal aid. I want to take the opportunity of saying this because the opportunity may not offer itself again.  It is not, in my opinion, in the case of criminal circumstances that there is really a need for providing legal assistance to the citizen at a cost that will not make it prohibitive.  In criminal cases, by and large&mdash;in one type of criminal case &mdash;there is already provision.  Extending that is all very well but it is becoming increasingly difficult for the citizen to enforce his legal rights, particularly what one might call his minor legal rights, whether it is against one individual, a corporation or even the State in its various manifestations, local and central.  There is a question there of providing for people who are unable to undertake the risks of cases that they should take. I am convinced&mdash;most of us are&mdash; that a large number of people have been prevented from asserting their rights or from protecting themselves from unwarranted encroachments on their rights merely because of the uncertainty and terror of financial commitments.</P>
    <P>I am not going to make the naïve suggestion that free legal aid should be extended to the civil side.  The costs have gone up from the point of view of administration; court fees and other incidentals of that nature have increased. It is having a serious effect on people who wish to assert their rights, and on a very important element in our social life, our legal profession and our legal system.</P>
    <P>As one who may claim to have a little personal knowledge of what is involved and who cannot be accused of having any particular present interest, perhaps I might be permitted to speak for the two legal professions in this matter without their knowledge or consent.  We have an excellent machinery here, excellent courts and excellent practitioners.  Fundamentally, we <Col N="254" /> have a very good system.  The only difficulty is that the cost of seeking the decision of a court is sometimes too terrorising to enable a matter to be properly determined in court.  I am taking this opportunity to ask the Minister if, when he is considering this matter, he will consider the possibility of aids, whether general or specific, to persons who <i>bona fide</i> wish to have a matter of right or equity determined in a proper legal manner in the courts.</P>
    <P>Some method should be thought out to make that possible where it is impossible at the moment because of the costs involved.  That problem cannot be met by people simply saying that there is too much law.  It might also be said that at times there is not enough law.  I am not suggesting free subsidies all round but I am suggesting a realistic approach to the cost of procedures which would help more than definite subsidies.  I take this opportunity to ask the Minister if he will consider this matter on a future occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea of legal aid is that it should be granted in all cases. I have heard of people committing suicide because they were accused of some charge that might not have entailed a penalty of more than £5. Some people take any form of indictment as a serious matter.  Even a fine of £5 or a week's imprisonment is a serious matter for many people because it is something that damages their reputation and can cause the loss of their employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a case in mind which affected me when I was quite young.  It goes to show that legal advice and support are necessary in all cases.  It happened when I was only six years of age.  A young lad threw a squib up in the air and by chance, it went in through a window and set fire to a curtain.  There were only two young lads in the street and I was one of them.  There was a great hullabaloo and a woman who had some grudge against my mother accused my brother who was not in the street at all.  My people were poor and did not engage a solicitor and my brother was sentenced to a month in Marlborough House.  If there had been a solicitor, he would have inquired <Col N="255" /> into the facts and justice would have been done but because my people were poor and I was only a child, the woman's word was taken and my brother did a month in Marlborough House.</P>
    <P>I hold that in every case where persons have not the means to defend themselves, there should be free legal advice.  It should not be confined to cases of murder or other serious charges.  It should be free to all cases, irrespective of the charge, if the people concerned have not the means to engage counsel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputies who have stated that this measure is limited and restricted.  I also want to repeat what Deputy Colley has said, that it is at least a start.  I do not think it is possible for us to be other than limited and restricted at this stage.  One must have every sympathy with the case mentioned and the views put forward by Deputy Sherwin to the effect that for the vast majority of people, to be accused of any crime is a very serious matter.  Therefore, if possible, the aid which the Bill provides should be made available as widely as possible. However, this is something new and to a large extent will be experimental in the initial stages.  We have got to feel our way and see how the situation develops.  The Bill is offered to the House in that spirit and in that manner.  I am quite certain that every Deputy would favour extending the scope of the Bill both to criminal and civil matters, if that were possible, but we must realise in matters of this sort that our resources are limited.  This is, to my mind anyway, a social service akin to other social services which go to help and assist the less well off sections of the community.  This is an extension of the principle of social service into legal matters.  The amount of money which we can make available in any year for all our social services is limited.  Every reasonable Deputy would agree with that and we must, to the best of our ability, endeavour to distribute available resources to the best possible advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="256" /> The Bill is prepared in the light of that fact.  We feel at this stage it is desirable we should make some of the resources at our disposal available for this particular social service and see how it will work out.  If it is possible to extend it in the future we shall certainly be prepared to do that.  I want to emphasise that we can only make an estimate at this stage as to what the cost will be and, in those circumstances, the Bill cannot be other than limited, as it is.  I also want to point out that while it is limited in some ways, it is comprehensive in others.  When this service was introduced in neighbouring jurisdictions, it was not as comprehensive as ours.  We are providing free legal aid right through the system from District Court to Supreme Court.  In that way it is comprehensive but I admit there are considerable restrictions in regard to cases that will qualify for legal aid. At this stage we have no alternative but to accept those restrictions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins made a point to the effect that in cases where the charges were not grave, where the circumstances were not exceptional, we were not giving free legal aid and, to that extent therefore, we were being unjust or unfair to a certain class or number of people.  That is not quite true because I suppose in any case that comes before the courts there is need for legal aid but surely the need is greater in the case of a grave charge or a case involving exceptional circumstances so that in that regard we are providing the aid where it is needed most.</P>
    <P>We could look on this whole situation in this way.  The court has a duty to be fair to the accused&mdash;I think we can all accept that it is fair to the accused.  As I said in my opening remarks, we have a very fine tradition in that regard in this country.  This scheme, as I see it, is nothing more than an attempt to come to the aid of the courts and assist them in the discharge of that duty.  The court's aim is to be fair to the accused.  We are saying, in effect, in certain cases it is essential in order to enable the courts to discharge that obligation, to provide the accused with the necessary legal <Col N="257" /> aid to assist the court.  That is what we are doing.  We are beginning by supplying that assistance to the courts at the point where it is most needed, in grave cases or exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins seemed to be under the impression that it would be necessary for the individual to make his own application for a legal aid certificate.  I do not think that is so. It certainly is not the intention.  We shall ensure that it will not be so.  It will still be true that the accused will have to apply.  Nobody may come along and give him legal aid whether he wants it or not but the application can be made either by the accused in person or by a solicitor on his behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

      <P>The House may accept that it is our intention that the application may be made by a solicitor on his behalf.</P>
      <P>I am not a little intrigued by the suggestion that this scheme is going to be Civil Service administered.  Let us look at the facts.  In the first case the counsel or solicitors who operate the scheme will be assigned by the judge or justice.  The list in any court will be decided on by the solicitors and barristers practising in that court because they will indicate whether or not they are prepared to have their names on the list and the function of the State in the matter will be merely to prepare the list.  So that there is no effective State control in that respect.  The assignment of counsel or solicitor from that list will be a matter for the judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual defence in court will be operated by counsel and solicitor and, as I see it, the only function the State will have in the matter will be to pay. The Civil Service will not enter into the scheme in any way whatever once the original regulations are prepared except to foot the Bill.  In any social service that is the State's duty but certainly it is absurd for Deputies to <Col N="258" /> suggest that this is a Civil Service administered scheme.  It is a scheme administered by the courts and they are the correct people to administer it.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word about the question of associating the Incorporated Law Society or the Bar Council with the scheme.  Both of these bodies will be fully and completely associated with it.  We have already received from both of them an assurance of co-operation and in return we have indicated to them that any advice or help or assistance they can give in either the preparation or administration of the scheme will be welcomed.  I have already seen the Incorporated Law Society.  We have had full and frank discussion.  I have indicated to them that they are to come back and have further discussions as we progress with our preparation of the Scheme.</P>
    <P>The same situation will apply with regard to the Bar Council.  I have arranged to see the Bar Council and discuss the scheme and regulations with them and anything they have to say or suggest will be fully considered and, if possible, acted upon.  I want completely to disabuse the minds of Deputies on this score.  It is not possible at this stage to hand over the administration of the scheme to the Incorporated Law Society or to any outside body&mdash;I think that would never be possible&mdash;but it is certainly my aim, and I have indicated that, so far as possible, as the scheme progresses, more and more will those two bodies be brought in on its operation.</P>
    <P>At this stage I think we must keep the scheme as it is envisaged in the Bill, namely, that the regulations and so on must be the responsibility of the State, that the Department of Justice in consultation with the Department of Finance will advise and assist to the greatest possible extent in the preparation and thereafter the scheme will, in effect, be worked by the courts.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy said it appeared to him that it would be necessary for an individual to disclose his defence before he could qualify for aid under the scheme.  That is not the intention. We propose that the prisoner should <Col N="259" /> not be bound to disclose his defence as a condition of obtaining aid and I think that intention is given effect to fully in the draft which reads:</P>
    <P>it appears to the District Court or the judge of the court before which the person is to be tried (as the case may be) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case (including the nature of such defence (if any) as may have been or is proposed to be set up),</P>
    <P>I think the two important words there are &ldquo;if any&rdquo;, and I am assured that the particular phraseology of the section ensures that there will be no question of its being necessary for the accused to disclose his defence in advance. I fully agree that it would be undesirable that he should have to do so and that there should be no danger of that arising.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan indicated that the Bill would not really make any particular difference because he felt that free legal aid is already being provided fairly fully, that no one would get free legal aid now who has not been getting it up to now and that the Bill was not really of any great importance.  I think that is an oversimplification of the position.  There is undoubtedly a tradition in law that the services of a solicitor or barrister should be placed at the disposal of a poor person, even though he cannot afford to pay for them.  That is the old tradition, but I think it is becoming less and less relevant to modern times.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley pointed out that solicitors labour under a very real sense of grievance because of the inadequacy of the fees in murder cases.  At least they are getting some fees, however inadequate they may be, and they are presumably labouring under the sense of grievance because the fees are not what they feel they should be.  Surely that is indicative of the fact that we cannot any longer expect either of the professions to provide free services to poor persons. There may have been a time in a more leisurely age when those services were provided as a matter of course <Col N="260" /> on a full and adequate scale.  I doubt if there ever was such a time, but there may have been.  It is certainly unsafe to assume today&mdash;and my inquiries confirm me in my belief&mdash; that poor persons are getting free legal aid on a wide scale because of this old tradition at the Bar.  That tradition is there and is, as I say, as a principle, loyally adhered to by the members of both professions, but nevertheless present circumstances are such that it is not sufficient any more to cope with the problem.</P>
    <P>There is this essential difference also between a poor person receiving the gratuitous services of barristers and solicitors, because of the tradition, and the poor person receiving those services as of right and being able, in effect, to pay for them.  I think that is a very important and very essential difference, and one which is in keeping with our thinking on social matters today.  It would be infinitely preferable and more desirable if this type of service is to be provided in our courts that the accused should be able to avail of the services of solicitor and counsel without having to be, as it were, placed in a mendicant position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley seemed, to my mind, to be unnecessarily anxious about the question of the assignment of solicitor and counsel.  I want to emphasise that I am absolutely optimistic and hopeful that this scheme will be interpreted in a sensible, reasonable and realistic way by the judges and justices, barristers and solicitors, and any discussions I have had with those involved confirm me in that belief.  The discussions I have had with the Incorporated Law Society were on a most reasonable and realistic basis and I have no doubt that will be the situation.</P>
    <P>As I said, the scheme will work broadly along these lines.  A list will be prepared in the courts of members of the professions who are prepared to operate the scheme, and thereafter the assignment from that list will be made by the judge or justice, having regard to the wishes of the accused. Of course the situation will normally be that if the accused indicates that he wants Mr. X from the list, the judge will automatically assign him, <Col N="261" /> but we cannot possibly, from the practical point of view, leave complete and utter discretion to the accused.  The whole work of the courts could be interrupted because the accused might perversely insist on having a particular member of the list who was not available, who was in some other court, or on some other circuit, or unavailable for some other reason.  To attempt to provide for the wishes of the accused as to who would act for him would, without any other consideration, be futile and completely unpractical.  So the suggestion made in the Bill is, to my mind, the only feasible, sensible and fair way of tackling the problem.  In other words, the ultimate decision resides in the person in whom it should reside, and the person best fitted to exercise it, namely, the judge or justice, provided that so far as possible due regard is had to the wishes of the accused as to whom he should have to represent him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley also indicated that he was perturbed about the question of fees.  That is a reasonable matter to raise and if I can assure him with regard to it, I should like to do so. I want to tell him that when the Incorporated Law Society came to me, naturally that was one of the matters they raised.  I asked the Incorporated Law Society to suggest to me fees which they would regard as adequate and suitable.  Admittedly, I did say to the Incorporated Law Society, in effect: &ldquo;Please do not overlook the fact that there is a tradition in law that assistance should be afforded to poor persons, and I think that tradition might operate on your minds to allow you suggest fees other than full scale fees which you would expect in other circumstances.&rdquo;  That is as far as the discussions have gone.</P>
    <P>We may be able to come up with a scale of fees which will be completely satisfactory from the point of view of both professions.  I hope we can but we may not.  I am quite certain, however, that we shall do our best and I am equally certain, from what I know of the Incorporated Law Society and the Bar Council, that if they accept that the offer and approach made by us to <Col N="262" /> this problem of fees is reasonable, and that we are doing as well as we can afford in our particular circumstances, we shall have their full co-operation, even though the fees might not be as remunerative as they might like them to be.</P>
    <P>The question of the habitual criminal was raised and again I think the approach we have to this matter is sensible.  I am quite certain the majority of Deputies would recoil from a proposal that we should spend public moneys in the defence of what I call the habitual criminal.  I said that in my opening remarks and I went on to say that even in the case of the habitual criminal, the person who everybody knows has decided to make a career of crime, there will be the occasional or exceptional circumstances which would make it desirable that he should have free legal aid.  We propose in the scheme that in those cases, even, as I say, in the case of what I might call habitual criminals, they will be entitled in certain circumstances to receive the aid envisaged under the scheme.  But it would be absurd to envisage a situation where the type of person I have in mind would be able, time after time, to receive free legal aid when everybody knew that in fact he was a career criminal.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned that he would like to see the scheme extended to enable persons who wanted to affirm a right in equity.  So would we all. As I said originally, every Deputy would like to see this Bill covering not just criminal but civil matters as well. That may come in the future.  I certainly hope it will and that eventually we shall be able to extend this scheme to cover poor persons in civil matters and achieve a position where no person need ever be in a position of not being able to procure justice because of lack of means.  As I emphasised, we must creep before we walk.  We must see how the initial scheme works out and in the light of that knowledge, consider and examine whether or not we could extend it to broaden the basis of the scheme.</P>
    <P>When Deputy de Valera was speaking, I was thinking of another approach to that problem, that is, that <Col N="263" /> in civil matters, apart from the State coming in and providing the litigant's costs, a substantial contribution could be made if we could reduce the cost of litigation in any way.  Deputies will appreciate in the programme for law reform on which my Department is engaged and which is set out in the White Paper published recently, there is a proposal to set up a committee to examine that very matter.  The setting up of that committee is under examination at the moment and I should hope its establishment will not be too long delayed.  There is a very fruitful field of endeavour there and if we could, by the establishment of that committee and its work, eventually succeed in reducing the cost of litigation we would have done a very great deal on the civil side, apart from any question of extending free legal aid to civil cases.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude by saying that the scheme is the best we can do for the moment and I think it is a fairly good one.  I have every confidence that everybody concerned will approach its administration with commonsense and with a spirit of co-operation and a desire to make it work.  If that is done, I have every belief that in passing this Bill, we shall be doing something worthwhile and achieving a useful and fairly substantial social reform.</P>

    <Title>Short Titles Bill, 1961&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the Bill, which has been prepared in the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, is to assign short titles to certain statutes, principally in order to facilitate their citation.  The statutes in force here fall into four different catagories.  Firstly, there are the Acts of the Oireachtas, secondly the Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament (1800 to 1922) applying in Ireland, thirdly the Acts <Col N="264" /> of the pre-Union Irish Parliaments, and lastly Acts of the pre-Union English Parliament applied to Ireland by specific pre-Union Irish Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that all Acts passed by the Oireachtas have short as well as long titles.  However, the practice by which each statute is provided with its own short title was not generally adopted until the 1880's. Short Titles Acts passed by the British Parliament in 1892 and 1896 assigned short titles to earlier British statutes. The present position, generally speaking, is that all our own Acts and all statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament applying here may be cited by a short title.  No provision has hitherto been made for the statutes of pre-Union Irish parliaments or for pre-1800 English statutes applied to Ireland.  The Six County Parliament passed in 1951 a Short Titles Act conferring short titles on pre-Union Irish statutes in force there.  The present Bill goes further in assigning short titles to the pre-1800 English statutes extended to Ireland and will, therefore, enable any statute applying here to be cited by a short title.</P>
    <P>A secondary but useful purpose which the Bill will serve is to provide a convenient guide to the extant pre-1800 statute law and to the condition in which it stands today on the Statute Book.  This involves a first step in the much needed process of statute law revision.  As pointed out in the White Paper on Law Reform the purpose of such revision is, firstly, the publication of a Chronological Table of all the statutes which affect or have in the past affected the territory which is now the State as well as a Comprehensive Index of all the statutes now in force, and, secondly, the ultimate publication of a modern edition of the entire body of statute law such as was published in the Six Counties in 1956. The most recent edition of the pre-Union Irish statutes is that prepared by William F. Cullinan, Irish Office, Westminster, and published in 1885. That edition reprints from the full and authoritative Folio edition of the Irish Acts printed pursuant to an order of 1762 such of the Acts as were unrepealed and contains a chronological table of all the statutes of pre-Union <Col N="265" /> Irish Parliaments.  The body of statute law in Cullinan has, of course, been since further reduced.  Many statutes have been repealed in whole or in part by subsequent legislation.  Many of them are long since spent.  Many were already clearly obsolete when that edition was being prepared.  Others, for example those relating to the Crown, Parliament, High Treason, and the Courts, are repealed by implication as being inconsistent with the Constitution of Saorstát Éireann or the Constitution of Ireland, or have been superseded by our own Acts.  There remains, however, a body of statute law which, though in some respects archaic, is nevertheless regarded as being in force; and it is clear that its publication in an up-to-date revised edition is a matter of considerable importance.  As I have already said, this Bill is a first step in that direction.</P>
    <P>In this Bill, statutes that have been repealed are naturally not included. Statutes which, although not expressly repealed, are clearly obsolete or which are repealed by implication (as being inconsistent with the Constitution) are not included either.  Where, however, there appears to be any doubt as to whether a statute is obsolete or not it has been listed.  The assignment of a short title to any particular statute should not, therefore, be taken as implying that it is still operative.  If, having regard to subsequent legislation or to the Constitution or for any other reason, the particular statute is no longer alive, its inclusion in this Bill will not operate to revive it.  Conversely, the omission of a particular statute will not affect the question as to whether or not it is still in force. Local and personal Acts are not included.  A further Bill providing for the repeal of such obsolete or unnecessary pre-Union Irish statutes or parts of such statutes has been prepared in the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office, and I hope to be in a position to introduce it later this year.</P>
    <P>The statutes to which short titles are being assigned by the Bill are set out in three Schedules.  The First Schedule contains the pre-Union Irish statutes, i.e., Acts passed by a parliament sitting <Col N="266" /> in Ireland at any time before the coming into force of the Union with Ireland Act, 1800.  I do not propose to comment on the individual statutes which are given short titles; there are 132 of them.  The Second Schedule contains certain English statutes which are regarded as having been applied to Ireland by Poynings' Act, 1495. Perhaps a few words about that Act would be appropriate.  Poynings' Act is one of a series of Acts passed by the Parliament convened by Sir Edward Poynings, Lord Deputy, at Drogheda in 1494-5.  This Parliament was called to assist the Lord Deputy in his task of reducing Ireland to &ldquo;whole and perfect obedience&rdquo;.  The terms &ldquo;Poynings' Law&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poynings' Act&rdquo; have been employed ambiguously both by historians and lawyers.  Sometimes they are applied to the whole series of statutes passed at that Parliament, sometimes to one of those statutes&mdash;Chapter 4 of 10 Henry 7 (Ireland)&mdash;which provided that no Irish Parliament was to be held until the proposed legislation had been sent by the Lieutenant and the Irish Council to the English Council and returned under the English great seal; at other times, they are used to indicate the statute Chapter 22 of 10 Henry 7 (Ireland).  The latter is the statute to which the present Bill refers and to which the short title &ldquo;Poynings' Act, 1495&rdquo;, is assigned, putting an end to the ambiguity so far as legal usage is concerned.  This Act provided for the application to Ireland of all English statutes &ldquo;concerning or belonging to the common and publique weal of&rdquo; England.  The interpretation of the Act has been the subject of a good deal of historical and legal controversy but the generally accepted opinion today is that it had the effect of applying to Ireland all English statutes passed before 1495 which would now be classified as Public General Acts.  In the Second Schedule to the Bill the Acts so applied are classified into those dealing with distress (i.e. the taking, without legal process, of a personal chattel of a wrongdoer by the person aggrieved as a pledge, e.g., seizure of cattle for non-payment of rent), administration of estates of deceased persons, infants' <Col N="267" /> land, forcible entry on lands and fisheries.</P>
    <P>The Third Schedule to the Bill lists the English statutes applied to Ireland by an Act of 1634, now to be cited as the Maintenance and Embracery Act, 1634.  All the statutes in this Schedule deal with maintenance, champerty and embracery.  Maintenance has been defined as &ldquo;an officious intermeddling in a suit which no way belongs to one by maintaining or assisting either party with money, or otherwise to prosecute or defend it&rdquo;.  Champerty is maintenance in consideration of an interest in the subject matter of the action.  Embracery consists in attempting, by bribes or other corrupt means, to influence a juror.</P>
    <P>In addition to Poynings' Act and the Maintenance and Embracery Act, the Act to which we have given the title, the Calendar Act, 1781, in the First Schedule is also of special interest. This Act is often known as Yelverton's Act and it extended to Ireland the provisions of the English Calendar Acts, which rather belatedly introduced the Gregorian Calendar.  Deputies will remember from their history books the agitation concerning the cry &ldquo;Give us back our eleven days&rdquo; which, in fact, led to riots.  Yelverton was a member of Grattan's Parliament and the measure had Grattan's strong support.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw particular attention to subsection (2) of Section 2 of the Bill, which provides that column 2 of each Schedule will not form part of the proposed Act.  Instead of setting out the long title of each statute, we have given the subject matter of the statute as unrepealed, indicating specifically those sections of the statute still on the Statute Book.  This is for information only and will, I trust, be of assistance to practitioners and students.  In many cases the long title would, indeed, be misleading, as will readily be seen by reference to Cullinan's Edition.</P>
    <P>As I have already said the Bill has been prepared by the Statute Law Reform and Consolidation Office.  It is the result of considerable historical and legal research.  I take this opportunity of complimenting the Director of that Office on the high standard of <Col N="268" /> the work carried out and on the initiative that he and his late predecessor have shown in tackling this difficult task of revising the statutes.  I look forward to submitting to the Oireachtas, in due course, the further measures which will be necessary to bring that work to fruition.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.  I trust that Deputies have found the explanatory memorandum of assistance in studying the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are, incidentally, two minor errors in the print of this Bill, which the House can correct at a later stage. On page 5, column 1, the heading 1739 should read 1749, and on page 8 (Part II of the Second Schedule) a similar heading 1257 should read 1357.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not <Col N="269" /> exceeding £170,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of Sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>This business is much more down to earth, in every sense of the word, than the higher realms of Poynings' and Yelverton's Acts.  The purpose of this Estimate is to provide money to assist St. Patrick's Copper Mines Limited over the coming few months when their resources will be unequal to their commitments.</P>
    <P>In December, 1959, I came before the House with an Order amending the Schedule to the State Guarantees Act, 1954, intended to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee additional borrowing by the Company. It was my hope at that time that further State assistance would not be necessary.  It is a matter for concern that I should now have to come to the Dáil for additional assistance and it is necessary for me to explain how this position has come about.</P>
    <P>The State Guaranteed Loan was intended to provide for the provision of equipment and the development of the Company's mine at Avoca.  The expectation was that the development would open up areas where Mianraí Teoranta had located high quality ore. It was felt that, when these areas had been opened up, the prospects for commercial production would be good enough to enable the Company to obtain money from private sources to finance its continued operation.  The Company did, in fact, negotiate in recent months substantial additional private investment but the making of this investment was dependent on the verification by further drilling of the Mianraí Teoranta findings.  The Company's preliminary testing failed to substantiate the figures produced by Mianraí Teoranta in certain areas and, accordingly, the offer of private capital was withdrawn.  The Company found itself unable to meet its commitments <Col N="270" /> and was faced with the alternative of shutting down or securing further Government aid.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, the Company have approached me for a grant of £240,000 to enable them to meet net outgoings to the end of June.  They expect that by that time the major development work which has been responsible for a large part of the drain on their resources, will be beginning to bear fruit.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that this request for such a large sum of money faced the Government with an unwelcome choice.  On the one hand, there must be a limit to the extent to which this undertaking can be kept going by periodical shots in the arm involving actual or contingent liabilities to be met from the public purse.  On the other hand, regard must be had to the importance to the whole surrounding area of the employment given by St. Patrick's and to the necessity of protecting the State-guaranteed investment already made in the Company. On balance, I feel that there is no escaping the conclusion that assistance should be given to enable the Company to surmount its immediate difficulties. With the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, therefore, I undertook to seek the Dáil's authority to make payments in the current financial year of £170,000 and in the early months of 1962/63 of £70,000.</P>
    <P>These sums will be paid against an undertaking that ordinary shares in the Company up to the nominal value of the sums advanced will be vested in the Minister for Finance or his nominee should he at any time so demand.  In this way, if this further injection of capital is successful in placing the Company on an economic footing, the State will be able to ensure a due return on its investment.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that the House be fully informed so that Deputies may appreciate the position at Avoca, a position that is quite serious.  The money which it is now proposed to make available will enable production to be continued for the time being.  If further testing does not produce results nearer to the findings of Mianraí <Col N="271" /> Teoranta, or if copper prices decline, or if the further development work encounters new difficulties, the whole future of the enterprise may be jeopardised. The Company have given me an assurance that every effort will be made to keep the mine in full production as long as practicable but the possibility has to be faced that if losses at the level recently experienced continue during the next few weeks, production may have to be suspended in whole or in part until development work has reached the stage where more economic production is possible.  This would mean the laying off of a considerable number of workers for a time&mdash;probably a few months.</P>
    <P>In the long term, the success of the Company's operations will depend on a number of factors such as those I have listed above, as well, of course, as on the securing of a high degree of efficiency and productivity at all levels of the Company's activities.  While none of these can be guaranteed, I am satisfied that they can reasonably be expected and that the decision to put further capital, which in present circumstances can only mean public capital, into the mine is fully justified.</P>
    <P>I accordingly recommend that the House should approve of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate will have the support of the House because I think it is generally realised that mineral development is a very speculative business.  Nevertheless, as the Minister has said, the information which has been secured from the work already carried out is of a somewhat grave character in so far as the borings that have been undertaken apparently do not confirm some of the earlier borings which were made by Mianraí Teoranta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I should like, if possible, before dealing with that aspect of the matter, to get some information from the Minister to indicate what the actual expenditure has been up to the present on this work.  As I understand the position, the original arrangement was that the mine was being leased for a period of, I think, 21 years to St. Patrick's Copper Mines, on the <Col N="272" /> basis that a sum of, in the first instance, £180,000 would be expended and that within a year after the work started, in September or October, 1955, a further sum of £450,000 would be expended, that subsequently it was intended to spend a further £1,500,000 or £1,750,000&mdash;I am not sure which&mdash; so that there would be a total expendditure of something in the region of £2,000,000 more or less, depending on the actual sum expended in the first couple of years, and that at that stage something like 500 men would be employed.</P>
    <P>We are familiar with the fact that a great deal of that work has been carried out and that very large numbers have been employed there.  What I am anxious to find out now is if the sum which was originally stated to be invested and spent in this work has actually been invested and expended as anticipated originally.  If so, have the borings and work carried out there proved unsatisfactory because the borings made by St. Patrick's Copper Mines do not confirm the earlier work carried out by Mianraí Teoranta, or is it possible from what has been done to differentiate between the work carried out by St. Patrick's Copper Mines and that carried out by Mianraí Teoranta?</P>
    <P>One of the problems which I think Mianraí Teoranta experienced there many years ago was that not merely were there deposits of minerals at Avoca but that these deposits contained not one mineral but a number; that there was a little zinc, pyrites and copper and that the difficulty was to segregate these minerals when they were proved, that that involved a special process which was expensive, that not only had the minerals to be located and proved but that subsequently the process of segregating some minerals from another involved extra expense and extra work in the application of the necessary technique through whatever technical or other equipment was required to carry it out.  I do not know whether that is still the position and I think the House would be interested to know if it is possible to estimate from the borings carried out whether there are <Col N="273" /> sufficient quantities of these minerals to justify commercial operations and, if so, did the work which has been carried out by St. Patrick's Copper Mines entail new borings or was it a continuation of the borings originally made by Mianraí Teoranta?</P>
    <P>Just before the recess, the House passed a Supplementary Estimate to facilitate the development of the project at Arklow for the manufacture of fertilisers and I have no doubt that everyone is most anxious to see that project successful.  As I understood the proposal then brought forward, the success of that project depends on the availability of supplies of pyrites from Avoca.  I have no doubt we would be glad of an assurance that the project which was envisaged for Arklow will not be jeopardised by any doubts which exist about the future prospects at Avoca.</P>
    <P>This whole mineral development has undoubtedly caused anxiety over many years because of its very nature.  It is universal experience that mineral development is always speculative and uncertain.  Very often, chance happenings result in success, while extensive effort does not fulfil expectations or justify expenditure.  It is generally agreed that so far as this country is concerned we have very limited mineral resources.  So limited are they that they are in fact of no great consequence.  It is important, therefore, that whatever resources we have should be exploited to the full and the maximum effort made to develop them.</P>
    <P>Because so much has already been expended on the development of the Avoca mineral deposits, there is sound reason for continuing the work there in order to ensure that no effort is spared in exploiting and developing whatever resources are there to the fullest extent possible.  In addition to that, there are now a great many people dependent upon the Avoca enterprise for employment.  The development work has revolutionised the whole area by providing a livelihood not merely for those directly concerned but also for their families and dependants.  That is a valid reason for ensuring every effort is made to exploit the project to the full.  It is disappointing <Col N="274" /> to learn that the borings that have been made have not proved as satisfactory as it was originally thought they would.  We all share the Minister's view, I am sure, that these further borings and further exploration work, which it is expected will be concluded next June, will prove satisfactory and justify continued development.</P>
    <P>Mineral exploration and exploitation is a very technical matter.  It is a matter for experts.  It may be that the experts have some doubts but, so far as the Dáil and public opinion are concerned, I have no doubt they will support the maximum effort possible to exploit and develop whatever minerals are there.  It is difficult to discover if the work carried out is satisfactory.  I can only hope that the Minister and his advisers are satisfied that the highest possible skills are being used.  It may not be possible to secure value for money in the ultimate sense that adequate supplies of ore will be located and these supplies developed on a commercial basis.  Only time and the expert work done there will prove whether or not that is possible; but the House is entitled to expect that the highest possible skill and technical know-how are used in the exploratory work and that all the necessary equipment is available, so that there will be no limit to the efficiency of the investigations undertaken.</P>
    <P>Subject to these observations, we all, I believe, look forward to successful exploration and exploitation of the Avoca deposits.  It would be interesting to know whether the borings have revealed any new deposits or revealed any different findings from those earlier available.  I mentioned the problem of ores located together and the difficulty of segregation. Subject to that, we would be most anxious to know whether the work undertaken will justify not merely the expenditure, which is considerable, but also, and this is more important still, the high hopes and ambitions of those engaged in this work, plus the employment potential which would guarantee for so many a livelihood for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there will be quite considerable public concern <Col N="275" /> because the Minister finds it necessary now to ask the Dáil for a sum of £240,000 for the purpose of giving another capital injection to St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  If that money were necessary to expand and merchant an assured merchantable deposit, I could understand it and the House would, I am sure, acclaim it because we would then know we were emerging into the main stream and there was a prosperous vista ahead.  In introducing this Supplementary Estimate, the Minister has used language which can only cause disquiet.  It seems the company is now in a very precarious position. The Minister said: &ldquo;The company have given me an assurance that every effort will be made to keep the mine in full production as long as practicable&rdquo;. Naturally, when one hears that, one can only assume that the company has reached a pretty critical position.  One has to face the possibility that, if losses at the present level continue during the next few weeks, &ldquo;production may have to be suspended, in whole or in part, until development reaches a stage where economic production is possible&rdquo;. The question as to whether this mine will close, in whole or in part, for a long or a short period will depend upon the losses that have to be faced during the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anyone will gainsay that this is the first time that warning language has been used and I do not think the Minister will try to conceal that that language is intended to convey that things are pretty critical so far as the heavy expenditure of the company in its efforts to win an economically rewarding type of ore is concerned.  I do not blame the Minister for that situation.  It is one of the hazards which accompany mining in every part of the world.  Mining is a highly speculative business.  Many people who have engaged in mining in different parts of the world have often given up hope until accidentally they found a good strike.  The &ldquo;bleak house&rdquo; of today became the &ldquo;great expectations&rdquo; of tomorrow and they lived to pay very substantial dividends to the pioneers, those who were <Col N="276" /> associated with the development of the projects.  Of course, not all mines are successful and one may well spend a considerable sum of money in endeavouring to exploit a mineral deposit and find that instead of extracting profitable ore from the ground all one has done is to bury one's own good money there.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that will not be the position in regard to St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  The mineral deposits such as we have involve a substantial sum of money in exploring and exploiting them.  The difficulty of exploration and exploitation might be got over if it could be shown that where it was attempted on a substantial scale as at Avoca it had turned out to be a magnificent success.  I would therefore regard Avoca as something in the nature of a beacon light which will encourage further exploitation of our mineral deposits in the belief that there were prospects of success which would yield returns as satisfactory as the successful Avoca exploitation could do.  If, however, Avoca were to come to the wall and it were necessary to close it down it would probably close for all times any hope of large-scale mineral exploration or attempted exploitation in this country.  For that reason, we should help to ward off the possibility of a close down so long as there is a reasonable prospect that ultimately a success can be made of the mine.</P>
    <P>We should get this undertaking in something like perspective.  My understanding is&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;that the company put up about six million Canadian dollars as their portion of the investment.  I do not know whether they borrowed privately in addition to that; perhaps they did but I understood their investment was to be something like six million dollars.  In February, 1958, the State gave them a guarantee, so far as I can recollect, of £1.3 million. Then there was a second loan of £550,000 in December, 1959, a total investment at that stage of £1,850,000. When the £550,000 loan was made the Minister stated, at column 1103, Volume 178, of the Official Report of the 10th December, 1959:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> The Company have expressed the opinion that assuming the price of copper does not fall below £232 per ton (the price ruling at the date of the application for a State guarantee of the additional loan) the carrying out of the new development work envisaged would enable the Company in due time to discharge its liabilities in respect of State-guaranteed loans.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when the Minister was asking the House to approve the guarantee of £550,000 he was then satisfied that, provided copper did not fall below £232 per ton, the company could go ahead with the work then envisaged and would in due course be able to repay the loan.  I do not know whether copper has held always above £232 since then.  I know it has been above it for quite a period but I have not checked it to see whether it fell below that price or not.  At all events, the high hopes held out in December, 1959, just over two years ago, that the company could go ahead with the development then envisaged and pay its way do not seem to have been borne out by results because not only is the £550,000 then voted gone but the Minister is back to the Dáil to-day asking for another £240,000.  If you take the three injections of £1.3 million, £550,000 and £240,000 now, you will find the State is responsible for £2,090,000 as its share of the investment in St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  I quite realise the State has got a mortgage on the assets there that could be valuable and, of course, could be quite useless, because a copper mine that will not pay dividends is a white elephant and is not the kind of commodity that you can dispose of in such a way as to get an adequate return for the assets.</P>
    <P>I come back to my point again.  All this may be necessary and worth while but we all ought to know what we are doing and we all ought to realise that this whole business in the long run might not justify the high hopes that were first envisaged for it.  For instance, I do not understand a phrase used by the Minister in his speech here, that the company's testing failed to substantiate the figures produced by <Col N="278" /> Mianraí Teoranta.  If that is so then I take it that Mianraí Teoranta's figures are not capable of substantiation and Mianraí Teoranta's figures are unreliable. If Mianraí Teoranta made a calculation as to the length and mineral content of the ore presumably that was based on a physical examination of the ore and of course, not only a physical examination of the mined ore but a reliable estimate of the extent of the mineralised ore.  If St. Patrick's Copper Mines, following on Mianraí Teoranta, do not find the ore to contain the mineral content believed by Mianraí Teoranta to be there then it only proves one thing that an assay of the content of the ore did not justify the reports which Mianraí Teoranta made in connection with the deposits there.</P>
    <P>It is hardly possible for people to mistake the mineral content of ore. The specialist can always tell what is the percentage but if one mining company says a certain percentage and the other says: &ldquo;We cannot find it&rdquo; then something is wrong; either those looking for it cannot see it or those who said it was there simply overestimated the lead content of the ore. It seems to be an extraordinary situation that Mianraí Teoranta clear out leaving a report as to what the figures of the mineral content are and their successors come in and say: &ldquo;We cannot find the mineral content you say was there.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that needs explanation from somebody.  Mianraí Teoranta has since been dispersed.  It may not be possible to get any information from it as a body corporate but somebody ought to throw some light on the Minister's speech: &ldquo;The Company's preliminary testing failed to substantiate the figures produced by Mianraí Teoranta in certain areas and, accordingly the offer of private capital was withdrawn.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand the position to be that when St. Patrick's Copper Mines got the £550,000 loan on the last occasion, the intention was to go down underneath the area in which they were mining, to cut under the Avoca River and to mine on the east side of the Avoca River in the hope of finding <Col N="279" /> there ore of higher content than the ore which up to then they had been mining and which had previously been worked upon for exploration purposes by Mianraí Teoranta.  I understand they intended to mix the new ore with the old ore so as to raise the percentage of minerals and that they hoped thereby to be able to produce minerals of a kind which would make them economically self-supporting.</P>
    <P>If I make anything out of the Minister's speech, it is that they have been disappointed in the mineral content of the new ore which they have been working and on which they have spent a substantial sum of money.  Is the frustration due entirely to the fact that the new ore is not better than the old ore and possibly less good or is it due to any subsidence of the old mineral crops on the new area in which the company are now operating or endeavouring to operate?  We ought to get a more detailed explanation of what happened between the time they got £550,000 two years ago and the situation in which they come here to-day saying: &ldquo;If losses are as bad in the next few weeks as they have been in recent weeks, we shall have to close down.&rdquo;  We ought to get a more detailed explanation of what brought about that situation.  These are mining experts and they ought to know the situation.</P>
    <P>What has been the price of copper over the past two years, on average? What has been the value of the production since this company went into operation?  Its production date, I think, was fixed in October, 1948. What is the value of the ore produced and exported since then?  Could we have, as well, some information as to the value of the pyrites exported, what stock of pyrites is on hands and what is its estimated value?  Is there any possibility of realising on that as a means of getting money for the primary task of developing the mines properly?</P>
    <P>Would the Minister also indicate the price of the shares of the parent company on the Canadian market&mdash;say, quarterly&mdash;for each of the past two years?  People were induced to buy shares by the higher prospects originally <Col N="280" /> held out in this case.  I should like to see what the movement of shares is like in the undertaking as it stands to-day.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on some of the points I have raised before this debate finishes. I hope we can get an opportunity of commenting on the Minister's reply, seeing that we are in Committee, because not only is the sum of money very large but the issues involved are critical.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister in having to face the frustration presented to him and to make a case for another £240,000 for this company.  We may well have to invest this in order to safeguard what we have already invested. We may have to invest it in order to safeguard the all-over national position of seeing that we can produce minerals here at a rewarding price.  At the same time, one must be alert.  One must make sure one does not finance a mine emotionally and merely for the purpose of producing an ore here which cannot be sold because nobody in the world wants it. We have to blend our patriotism with a sense of reality.  We must make sure that when we put more money into the mine, there seems to be a fairly reasonable prospect that we shall get it back at some time in the future.</P>

      <P>Coming as I do from the side of the country in which the mine is located, although it is not in my constituency, naturally I am very anxious to see the mine kept in existence.  I would also draw the parallel that as considerable sums of money are being devoted by the Minister's Department or by industry generally to the Shannon area, it is only fitting that the eastern side of Ireland should get its share for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the Minister has been singularly uninformative.  It may be that he has not been able to obtain the necessary details from the St. Patrick's Copper Mines Company. The statement to-day means that this is an insolvent mine which must continue in order to try to reach a degree of solvency.  In other words, the State has invested quite a considerable sum of money in this mine.  I understand <Col N="281" /> that when this sum is voted by the House, it will be a matter of over £3,000,000.  Although it may be desirable that the money already invested by the State should be safeguarded by a further infusion of money, I think this House is entitled, particularly when dealing with a non-national company, to some definite information as to the outlook for the future.</P>

      <P>The Minister has advisers I have not.  I am trying to ascertain the facts.  In effect, the Minister has told us that the prospecting already carried out has not come up to expectations.  Are they mining at present where they presumed minerals to exist which are non-existent and do they want this money to prospect elsewhere to see if they can get the material to carry on and to export?  This House could have been told what they are exporting.  Are there regular exports from this country from the mine?  Are those exports increasing or decreasing as time goes on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the last person in the world who would like to see this mine closing down.  The Minister should definitely give the House some indication of the productive capacity of the mine.  Surely, when a company apply to the Department of Industry and Commerce for a sum of money approaching the £250,000 mark the Department is entitled to get some definite details of what the over-all position is?  I appreciate the Minister's difficulties.  I appreciate the fact that had he not acceded to the wishes of the company in supplying this money they would very likely have to close down.  The Minister's expert advisers could have got from them the over-all picture as to what they are exporting and what they are likely to export in the coming months.  Are they likely to carry on with the same personnel? Can they say that complete solvency lies ahead of them in the future? I am not criticising the Minister.  I am suggesting that whatever information <Col N="282" /> he got from the company seems to have been totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>One regards the matter more seriously because of the fact that this is not a national company.  This is a foreign company.  It may be registered in this country.  It was originally started by non-nationals.  I understand that the parent firm had considerable financial backing.  Has the Minister suggested to the firm that in view of the liberality and generosity of the State they might themselves put money into the firm?  These are perfectly reasonable questions for anybody to ask and I hope that the Minister is in a position to give the House that information.  If he is not, perhaps, at some future date he might be able to do so by means of replies to Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <P>I support this Supplementary Estimate and will not vote against it but I do not think the House has sufficient information.</P>

      <P>I hope that there will not be any question of these mines closing down.  The Minister has done the right thing in coming to the House and asking for this money to ensure that for the present at any rate the operations will continue; that the undoubted good employment which is being given in the area by the mines will continue and that there will be a reasonable opportunity afforded of saving, so to speak, the investment made by the State in these mines.</P>
      <P>Everyone is acutely aware of the truth of what the Minister mentioned in his opening statement, namely, that there is considerable employment arising out of these mines and that it has had its effect on the surrounding countryside.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister&mdash;I hope he is in a position to give it&mdash;that there is no question of the danger which has occurred in connection with the mines jeopardising the plans for the nitrogenous fertiliser factory in Arklow which is to be based on the by-products of the mines.

      <P>We will give it to-day if the Minister says he requires it to-day, but there are a couple of questions which require to be asked.  The information given by the Minister is very restricted.  The time has come, in view of the circumstances, when he should give us the history of this whole transaction. My recollection is that the Government of the day had the advice of one or two distinguished firms of mining engineers who advised on that occasion that this was a heavily mineralised area and recommended that the project should be proceeded with.  That was confirmed by other authorities.  Independent advice of the highest possible quality in the world was called for and secured and recommended this as a desirable development.</P>
      <P>The Minister ought to give us a summary of what has transpired since. He ought to tell us how he comes to the House at almost 24 hours' notice and asks us to deal with this as a matter of urgency.  Surely somebody must have known about this before the House adjourned so that we would have more time to consider this Estimate than the Minister said he would give us.  I should like to ask the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We can with more confidence endorse the lines proposed by the Minister if we have access to all the facts.  They ought to include a review of the history of the mines so that we may satisfy the House and the public that this project was founded on the best possible mining engineering advice that could be got in the world and that we went far afield to get it.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also bound to tell the House what the implications will be.  What will be the implications of the closing of these mines on the £12 million project which the Minister adumbrated for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers from the pyrites in the mines?  It seems astonishing to me that the Government could have contemplated the investment of £12 million of public money in the processing of pyrites from a mine the prospects for which are as problematic as the Minister's introductory statement would suggest.  I am bound to say that the thing comes to me as a complete surprise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton will confirm my memory that when we were in Government, we considered, with almost excessive concern, the prospects of Ballingarry coal mine and Avoca.  We got the best possible advice that could be got, the burden of which, if I remember, was that Ballingarry was not a viable project but that Avoca undoubtedly was.  Are we now facing a situation that, having got this extremely expensive technical advice, it will turn out that Ballingarry is the viable project and Avoca the reverse?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that hard to believe.  I find it hard to believe that the information on which this project was initiated has proved to be illusory.  If my recollection is correct, we were told at that time that the site of the operations then proceeding, four or five years <Col N="285" /> ago, was by no means the most remunerative part of the whole mineralised area.</P>

      <P>My approval was sought for the proposal to restrict tenders for the rebuilding of the Abbey Theatre to selected contractors.  Because of the magnitude and complexity of the undertaking, I agreed that as comprehensive a list as possible should be drawn up of building firms whose capacity to carry out a project of this kind was well known and that the invitation of tenders should be confined to that list.  The question of providing State assistance for the rebuilding, in excess of the sum provided for under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1959, does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main requirements in diversification is to find it possible to make a link with an organisation that is capable of putting your product on that world market.  We have been doing our best in that direction and apart altogether from the financial advantages from time to time of selling dried milk as against butter, diversification is a wise course to take and it is the policy we are pursuing.  We can successfully proceed along those lines only when we are able to link up with some organisation that has the contacts and the means of disposing of our products.</P>

That was generally accepted.  Are we now to be told that circumstances have changed and that what we undertook not 12 months ago we now repudiate?

      <P>The London accountant who was appointed was appointed to make a general review of the whole position of the U.T.A. and not in regard to the operation of the Dublin-Belfast line.  I think the reports in the newspapers were exaggerated in that regard.  We are keeping in touch with the situation and the Minister of Industry and Commerce in the Six Counties is fully aware of our desire to maintain this main arterial link between Dublin and Belfast.</P>

      <P>With the permission of An Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11, 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in my reply of 29th November, 1961, the initiative in amending C.I.E. superannuation schemes rests with the Board.  The extent to which C.I.E. would, however, be prepared to add to their already substantial commitments for pension purposes is a matter falling entirely within the discretion of the Board.  The full cost of any increase in pensions to existing C.I.E. pensioners would fall to be met by C.I.E. in the form of <i>ex gratia</i> payments, unless of course the contributing members were prepared to agree to an amendment of the scheme so as <Col N="300" /> to provide for an increase in contributions to meet all or part of the cost.</P>
    <P>I should again like to point out that C.I.E. wages grade pensioners are eligible for contributory old age pensions under the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1960, and employers and employees including C.I.E. and their workers are liable for the appropriate contributions towards the cost of that pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power (1) what is the amount paid to Córas Iompair Éireann employees under 65 years of age who have been pensioned off; (2) what is the present amount of the Córas Iompair Éireann Pension Fund; (3) whether he has received proposals from Córas Iompair Éireann to increase the pension payable to existing pensioners over 70 years of age; and (4) whether the Pension Fund is invested and the amount of interest earned thereon per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to the C.I.E. Wages Staff Pension Scheme.</P>
      <P>The normal ages of retirement for the purposes of this scheme are 65 years in the case of male staff and 60 years in the case of female staff.</P>
      <P>I am advised by C.I.E. that the total amount of pensions being paid under the Scheme as at 31st December, 1961, was £197,000 per annum.  The amount being paid to members of the scheme who retired for such reasons as ill-health before the normal retiring ages, was £40,000 per annum.  The present amount of the Wages Staff Pension Fund is £3,199,516; these moneys are invested and the interest earned thereon for the year ended 31st December, 1961, was £148,035.</P>
      <P>C.I.E. have made no proposals to me for increasing the rate of pension payable to pensioners over 70 years of age.  Any increase for existing pensioners would have to be met by <i>ex gratia</i> grants by the Board unless the contributing members were to agree to an amendment of the scheme increasing contributions sufficiently to meet all or part of the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen reports of the claims referred to by the Deputy.  The Geological Survey have no independent records which would provide a check on the mineral content of the ores.  The holders of the prospecting licence in the Tynagh area have, however, in accordance with the terms of their licence, kept me fully informed of their findings and, as part of their normal duties, the officers of the survey are in close touch with developments at Tynagh.

      <P>The Geological Survey have not made an assay in the matter.  Their function is limited, or rather their interest in this is limited, to the receipt by the prospectors of a figure of deposits giving the content of the different ores in the deposits.  These are put on record.  I should say that in the journal which is considered to be the most authoritative in these matters, that is the <i>Toronto Northern Miner</i>, publications have been made which confirm the figures deposited with the Geological Survey.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the <i>Irish Press</i> of 13th December gives circulation to the statement made by a company spokesman that the concentration equals a percentage of 40 per cent. lead and that there was a high concentration of silver.  Some other publication said there was about 25 per cent. silver in the ore.  There <Col N="305" /> must not be any ore there at all at this rate: 40 per cent. lead and 25 per cent. silver.  In view of the fact that this company is selling shares in Ireland, could the Minister not take some steps to indicate, from his technical knowledge, the mineral content of the ores there, so that people will not be led to buy shares at very high prices which may not, of course, be justified in the light of subsequent discoveries? The Minister will have noted that the parent company of this Loughrea company has been prevented from dealing in the shares on the London Stock Exchange, and not without good reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <P>I can only repeat that the authoritative journal, the <i>Northern Miner</i> of Toronto has the figures of ore contents of the different minerals published from time to time and these are accurate.  So far as figures published in the <i>Irish Press</i> or other journals are concerned, the prospecting company has no responsibility for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we are discussing an Estimate for another £240,000 for St. Patrick's Copper Mines, and in view of the easy money which other people obtained here recently, does the Minister not think he might be a little suspicious and do something to protect the Irish investor?  If this is a &ldquo;gold mine&rdquo; as such, if there is 40 per cent. lead and 25 per cent. silver, well and good&mdash; we can all rejoice.  I do not want to see everybody selling all his shares to Irish citizens and then discover that it is true there was some lead and silver but not enough to pay a dividend. Somebody will burn his fingers in this and I want to make sure it is not the Irish.</P>

As to the problem of absorbing those who have lost their employment through the closing of the mines, I can only say that the Industrial Development Authority are making every effort to encourage the setting up of new industries in areas where unemployment exists but it is a matter for private enterprise and local development organisations to put forward proposals.</P>

Will he say on what grounds therefore the companies operating down here can justify such higher premiums in the Twenty Six Counties than are demanded in the Six Counties?  An example of what I am saying is to be found in the fact that a car which costs £10 5s. to insure in the Six Counties costs £18 15s. 5d. here.  Does the Minister not consider that if he compels the public as a matter of national policy to insure against motor car accidents, there is an obligation on him especially to ensure that the insurance is effected at the lowest possible price?</P>

      <P>The example given by the Deputy relates only to one type which shows a marked difference in the premium in the Six Counties compared with here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

This scheme can provide adequately for the needs of the Borough only, and the proposal to utilise the same source to serve the Clonmel rural area has been abandoned.

      <P>The local authority are responsible but I would not say they are responsible for anything which they are not doing something about. There has been a joint effort by way of a regional scheme on the mat for the past ten years but it has never come to any advanced stage.  The supply for the two areas would come from the same source.  The borough council decided to augment their supplies <Col N="324" /> and the rural area was also to augment its supply.  It has transpired that the source from which this supply was to be taken for the two areas is not sufficient and the result is that the original project of a joint scheme is not now feasible.  Clonmel Corporation will now proceed to augment their own supply but a separate scheme is necessary for the county council in respect of the area lying outside the borough boundary.</P>

      <P>The existing scheme of old age (contributory) pensions, which provides for payment of pension at age 70, came into operation as recently as January, 1961, and the experience has been insufficient to enable conclusions to be reached as to possible improvements.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will restore to the old age pensioners the fuel vouchers which they received under the Cheap Fuel Scheme, as the increase in pensions does not compensate for the withdrawal of these vouchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Fuel vouchers have not been withdrawn from non-contributory <Col N="328" /> old age pensioners and these vouchers were not at any time issued to contributory pensioners as such.  I presume the Deputy is referring to some persons in whose cases contributory old age pension was substituted for non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>As I explained in the Dáil on the 23rd November last contributory pensioners are not subject to a means test and cannot be presumed, generally speaking, to be in necessitous circumstances. Apart from the question of other means many of them are still in employment or in receipt of superannuation payments from their former employers.</P>
      <P>There were in fact few cases in which the increase resulting from the change to contributory pension did not more than compensate for the value of the fuel voucher.  If any pensioners are genuinely in need they are eligible for home assistance and in that event are entitled to obtain fuel vouchers free of charge.  It is difficult therefore to visualise how hardship could have been caused in any particular case.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I do not consider that any action on my part is called for but if the Deputy will let me have particulars of any instance in which hardship is alleged I will have it investigated by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be possible for anybody to give a list of all the people who suffer hardship because of the change.  The Minister has admitted in his reply that some of those who received contributory old age pensions and who were deprived of the free fuel voucher as a consequence did suffer loss.  I merely asked the Minister if he would consider advising or directing local authorities to revive the free fuel voucher for these particular people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there would not be more than 30 or 40 altogether.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions No. 57, 58 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The latest consumer price index <Col N="330" /> figure available is for mid-November, 1961.  This figure was 151, and showed no change from the figure as at mid-August, 1961.  It represented an increase of 2 points, or 1.3 per cent. as compared with the figure as at mid-February, 1961.  The mid-February, 1962, index figure will not be available until next month.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are, no doubt, aware, rates of payment under the social insurance scheme were increased as from the beginning of January, 1961, in conjunction with the introduction of contributory old age pensions, and rates of payment under the social assistance schemes were increased as from the beginning of August, 1961. The increase in the consumer price index during the twelve months to mid-November, 1961, has, as I have indicated, been not very considerable. If variations of the consumer price index figure is the only consideration to be taken into account, the increase during that period would not of itself require an increase in benefit and assistance rates.  I can, however, assure Deputies that the position is being, and will continue to be, kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that these people are trying to exist on a diet of bread-and-spread?  Does he consider that that situation should be allowed to continue?  Does he not himself believe this is a situation that should be remedied?  Does he not realise the general public believe it should be remedied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>While these figures are, no doubt, true in relation to the cost of living, they appear to have been equally true in answer to the trade union representatives' appeal for an increase in the general level of wages.  But, the case was carried for an increase to meet the increased cost of living.  In the light of that, and in the light of what the Minister for Finance has said, that he will examine the question sympathetically in relation to other State pensioners, would the Minister for Social Welfare not seriously consider ignoring what he alleges is a moderate increase in the cost of living and examining the question of the old age pensioners <Col N="331" /> sympathetically?  Everybody is agreed that these old people have had a hard and lean year and find it very difficult to exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>The major increase in the cost of living has occurred only in the last month, or two, following the increase in wages.  These increases will continue.

      <P>Associations recognised by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service have the right under that Scheme to submit claims on behalf of their members for improved pay, conditions of service, etc.  The Association of Unestablished Agents is so recognised and in exercise of its right under the Scheme submitted a claim for increased pay to my Department in March, 1960.  This claim was the subject of a hearing at the Departmental Council in my Department in June, 1960.  Discussion of the claim was adjourned by agreement to enable the Staff Side to formulate and submit a detailed claim on behalf of the Agents.  This detailed claim has not yet been received in my Department, however, but as soon as it is discussion on the claim will be resumed at the Departmental Council in accordance with the normal procedure followed under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration.</P>
      <P>With regard to other unestablished grades in my Department claims for increased pay from the Associations representing these grades have either been dealt with or are in process of being dealt with at General Council or Departmental Council level&mdash;as may be appropriate&mdash;under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's question is in the negative. Prior to August, 1960, such a person was required to serve three waiting days for which unemployment assistance was not paid.  By virtue, however, of an amendment of the law contained in Section 11 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1960, and operative from the 1st August, 1960, persons on transferring from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance are not now required to serve a three day waiting period.  Unemployment assistance is therefore now payable with effect from the day of transfer provided the unemployment continues for a minimum of three days and the person remains otherwise qualified.</P>

      <P>Regarding the second part of the Question, as I stated already, the Land Commission have decided not to institute proceedings for acquisition of the holding formerly owned by Mr. McCarthy and purchased by Mr. Healy.</P>
      <P>I can say, however, that they are examining the possibility of effecting a measure of rearrangement: an Inspector has been on the ground for that purpose and it is hoped that some remedial measures will eventuate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Hope springs eternal, but as regards this holding of land, the Minister says now that the Land Commission have decided to let the sale go through.  He must realise that there are at least three tenants there who have not a hope of rearrangement, if this land sale is allowed to proceed.  Would he not reconsider the matter?  Members of his own Party have been up on a deputation to meet the Minister in this connection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already informed the House that the question of the migration of some of the tenants from this land slum is under consideration at the moment.  The one man whose land does intermix with the holding which has been sold is being considered by way of a rearrangement.  The Deputy is well aware from his experience that rearrangement entails agreement between the parties concerned. <Col N="337" /> Anything the Deputy says in this House will not stop the arrangement from going through for the relief of the individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not getting away with that.  The fact of the matter is that there cannot be a rearrangement scheme in that area if the sale of this holding is allowed to go through.  The man who purchased this holding says he will have no rearrangements.  There are three or four tenants whose homes are completely surrounded by this man's land. There is only one way to have a rearrangement scheme there and that is for the Land Commission to take over this holding that has been up for sale and to give a chance to the people in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Hilliard)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is no.  The issue of a television licence does not guarantee the licensee satisfactory reception of the Telefís Éireann programmes. Legally, no person in this country may hold an unlicensed television set and the statutory regulations which came into force on 1st January, 1962, do not provide for the issue of licences free of charge or at a reduced rate.</P>

      <P>A licence fee is taken out under Section 3 (1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, which reads:</P>
      <P>Subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned, no person shall keep or have in his possession anywhere in Saorstát Éireann or in any ship or aircraft to which this section applies any apparatus for wireless telegraphy save in so far as such keeping or possession is authorised by a licence granted under this Act and for the time being in force.</P>

      <P>The frequencies and other characteristics of television stations in the European area are the subject of an international agreement made in Stockholm in June, 1961, to which we are a party.  In principle the location and power of the transmitters permitted under the agreement are related to the need to provide a domestic service of good quality.</P>
      <P>As I said in reply to a previous question, viewers in the Six Counties will receive the Irish television programmes but the quality of reception will vary with the distance from the transmitters and other factors and in general reception will be much the same as the quality of external television transmissions received in the northern half of the State.</P>

From the same date, and subsequently, various adjustments in the clerical and sorting force were made which affected a net reduction of two in the staff allocated to non-counter work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> The present weekly number and the figure prior to the revision in 1960 of staff hours allotted to stamp, money and postal order, savings, licence and social welfare transactions at the counter are 375 and 410 respectively.</P>
    <P>Special staff provision for social welfare transactions has not been abolished.  It operates on the days when the payments fall due.</P>
    <P>The revised counter service arrangements have been kept under review since they were introduced 15 months ago and are operating satisfactorily. There is no undue delay in attending to customers and I cannot agree that hardship is being occasioned.</P>

I stated that the numbers of candidates at the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate Examinations this year were 16,217 and 10,036 respectively, entailing the marking of over 300,000 scripts and that it was not easy to see how, with the great and increasing number of candidates at the Intermediate and Leaving Certificate Examinations, it would be possible to have reliable results under the present system issued appreciably earlier than is done now.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given very careful consideration to the position of the children of aliens permanently employed in Ireland.  As a result of that consideration I have already caused a new rule, No. 72, to be inserted in the current school year's Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools.  This new rule, states that such children, if their course of education in Ireland began after their having reached their eleventh birthday, may, provided they have followed a course of study of the required duration in subjects other than Irish, be admitted to the Certificate Examinations in those subjects.  They will be given a special certificate setting out the names of the subjects in which they passed or passed with honours, as the case may be.  I consider that such a concession is proper particularly in the case of children who would otherwise be faced <Col N="355" /> with the requirement of learning two new languages, Irish and English, at the same time, but that, having due regard to the public interest and the policy of reviving Irish as the spoken language of the country, it is the most that the circumstances either call for or would justify.</P>

      <P>The award of increments to national school teachers is governed by the Rules and Regulations for National Schools.  I am not prepared to have these Rules and Regulations amended in order to provide for the award of increments to teachers in respect of any service which is not normally incremental.</P>
      <P>As regards the teachers in question, I might point out that 24 years have elapsed since 1938.  As the incremental scale for national teachers is limited to 20 years the extent to which the award of increments to such teachers would now arise is, therefore, negligible.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals under consideration in my Department for the reconstruction of any of the schools in question.  The present position regarding the erection of new schools is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aughleam&mdash;My Department has <Col N="360" /> sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the erection of a new school and working drawings and a specification have been prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Certain preliminaries have yet to be completed before the Commissioners will be in a position to invite tenders for the erection of the school.</P>
    <P>Kilmore Erris&mdash;The Reverend Manager has been asked to obtain a site for a new school to replace the present building but a site has not yet been offered.</P>
    <P>Corcloch&mdash;A suitable site has been offered for a new school.  The Commissioners of Public Works have been asked to prepare sketch plans for the proposed new school.</P>
    <P>Fishing Station and Shanaghy&mdash; These two schools are to be replaced by a new central school to be erected at Aughaglasheen.  I understand that the Commissioners of Public Works are about to place a contract for its erection.</P>
    <P>Elly Bay&mdash;My Department has sanctioned a grant towards the cost of the erection of a new school at Elly Bay where there is no existing school. I understand that arrangements are being made locally to have a well sunk to provide a water supply for sanitation purposes.  When the Commissioners of Public Works are assured that an adequate supply is available, preparation of working drawings and a specification for the new school will be undertaken.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether in view of the hardships suffered by old I.R.A. men who are now living on home assistance, medical disability benefit, unemployment assistance and the special allowance and the inability of these men to meet the rise in the cost of living, he will consider taking immediate action (a) to lower the age limit for the receipt of the special allowance to 65 years, (b) to increase the income limit imposed on these men from £4 per week for a married man and £2 5s. per week for a single man to £7 10s. per week for a married man and £5 for a single man, (c) to modify the regulations governing the granting of the special allowance generally and (d) to bring to an end the practice of taking increases in social welfare benefits to these men into account when calculating the special allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no age limit governing eligibility for the receipt of special allowances under the Army Pensions Acts.  A statutory condition of the grant of a special allowance is that the applicant be incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of body or mind.  Persons who have reached the age of 70 years are regarded as being incapable of self-support by reason of age.  Persons who are less than 70 years of age and who are found to be incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity of body or mind are eligible for the grant of an allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army Pensions (Increase) Act, 1961, provided for increases as from 6 Eanáir, 1961, in the appropriate annual sums for the purpose of special allowances.  In addition, the means test for special allowance purposes has been modified very substantially in recent times in a number of respects. As regards social welfare benefits, increases granted since 1957 in unemployment assistance and non-contributory widows' pensions, and the increase granted last August in noncontributory old age pensions and in contributory old age pensioners' dependants allowances are not reckonable as means for special allowance purposes. Only half of the disability <Col N="366" /> benefit under the Social Welfare Acts is assessed as means.  Further increases in the appropriate annual sums or general modifications of the means test are not at present contemplated.</P>
    <P>In his reference to income limits, the Deputy may have in mind certain examples which were quoted, when the Army Pensions (Increase) Acts, 1961, was before the House, of what old age pensioners who had no other means could receive by way of old age pension and special allowance combined, namely, £3 2s. 6d. a week in the case of an unmarried man and £4 in the case of a married man.  These, however, are not general income limits. A special allowance is the amount by which the assessable means&mdash;as distinct from the actual means, which may be much greater&mdash;fall short of the appropriate annual sum, and that is the only limit imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether in view of the hardship caused to members of the general public by the uncertain nature of the cost of legal proceedings of any kind he will investigate the possibility of the setting out of a scale of charges to be adhered to by members of the legal profession for normal legal transactions and proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that there is such uncertainty in the matter of legal costs as to cause hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Costs in court proceedings are prescribed by the rules made by the rules committees of the various courts and, in general, refer to the costs which the unsuccessful party may be ordered to pay to the successful party.  Except in the case of the district court, where <Col N="370" /> the prescribed costs may not be exceeded, provision is made for allowing higher costs in exceptional cases. Any costs payable on a solicitor and client basis over and above the prescribed costs can be agreed between the solicitor and his client and in default of agreement may be taxed by a Taxing Master.</P>
    <P>Solicitors' costs in non-contentious business are regulated by orders made under the Solicitors Remuneration Act, 1881 and, in relation to Land Registry business, by the Land Registration Rules.</P>
    <P>Owing to the variety of circumstances affecting even normal legal transactions and proceedings it would be impossible to prepare standard scales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The average person does not know what his costs are going to be.  Surely the time is at hand when some scale should be publicised to enable the public to know to what they are committed in law courts and land conveyancing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there are several different matters involved.  First of all, the question deals entirely with the cost of legal proceedings and the possibility of the setting out of a scale of charges to be adhered to by members of the legal profession.  The Deputy will appreciate that is only one aspect.  In so far as those charges are concerned, they are very well regulated, either by rules of court or otherwise. They are known or should be known and can be made known to prospective litigants.  There are of course other factors which affect the cost of legal proceedings.  Those factors, I may say, are not mentioned by the Deputy in his question but it is very difficult to make known in advance what the cost of any particular legal proceedings will be because one of the factors is the amount of time they will take.  Having said all that, I want to inform the Deputy that the Programme of Law Reform in which my Department is engaged, and as set out in the White Paper published <Col N="371" /> recently, envisages the setting up of a committee to investigate the procedure and practices in the courts, with the view to seeing whether or not the cost of litigation could be reduced for litigants.  I hope that committee will be set up shortly and I think we can be reasonably hopeful that arising out of its work some reduction in legal costs generally may be able to be made.</P>

What steps is he to take if the bill of costs frightens him, as in some cases it does, if he believes it is excessive?  I should like the Minister to make a statement on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two main avenues of approach open to him, if he feels he has been charged in this way.  Firstly, as Deputy Sherwin mentioned, there is the Taxing Master.  A client can always ask to have his bill of costs taxed and there is a procedure set out for that and then the correct fees will be determined by the Taxing Master.  Alternatively, if it is not a matter which comes within the ambit of the Taxing Master, one of the courses open to the client is to refer the matter to the Incorporated Law Society which has general jurisdiction over the behaviour of solicitors.</P>

      <P>Special inquiries were made recently from the Garda Síochána throughout the State in connection with this matter.  These inquiries established that flick-knives are not carried to any significant extent and that where knives have been used in the commission of crime they were almost entirely knives of other types.</P>
      <P>Even in the very few cases in which flick-knives have been used, there is no reasonable assurance that a ban on them would have made a difference as those concerned could have equipped themselves with other knives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, it can be taken that the flick-knife is an offensive weapon and really nothing more.  However, the argument for banning flick-knives is not as strong as it might be because it is almost certain that if the person concerned had not a flick-knife available to him, he would procure another type of knife and really one type of knife is as bad as another.</P>

      <P>Of course, it is not the situation of the station which is the important factor; it is the adequate policing arrangements.  Ballyfermot is policed from Chapelizod station.  The strength of the station has been increased on a number of occasions recently to cater for Ballyfermot.  There are six sergeants and 29 Gardaí as distinct from two sergeants and 12 Gardaí in 1953, so that the Deputy will understand there was a very considerable strengthening of the station in that period.  In addition to the ordinary beat patrols in the area, supervision is carried out by motorcycle patrols and the crime control car at Kilmainham which operates a 24-hour service in the Kilmainham-Chapelizod area.  However, if the Deputy thinks the area is still not being properly policed, I shall ask the Commissioner to make another examination of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy no doubt appreciates, a question of trial by jury cannot arise in relation to summary offences.  Accordingly, I assume that the question relates to persons convicted by the Special Criminal Courts on charges which, had they been heard by the ordinary Courts, would have been dealt with, on indictment, before a jury.  I also assume that the Question is intended to include indictable offences against the Firearms Act, 1925 or the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, that were dealt with by the Special Criminal Court.</P>
      <P>On that basis, the figure asked for is eleven.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions 138 and 139 together.</P>
      <P>All the persons concerned are imprisoned in Mountjoy Prison.  The second Question, therefore, does not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether it is intended to remove any persons imprisoned for offences against the State from Mountjoy prison in the near future and to lodge them in the penal servitude prison at Port Laoise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Minister for Justice if he will consider amending the licensing laws with particular regard to (a) Sunday opening hours, (b) holiday resort exemption during the tourist season, and (c) unfair competition arising from the granting of special facilities to commercial dance halls.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet completed my review of the operation of the licensing laws.  Until I have done so and obtained the decisions of the Government on my recommendations, I shall not be in a position to make any statement in the matter.</P>

      <P>I can only say to the Deputy I hope to conclude the examination at the earliest possible moment. I have no doubt the Deputy will have a very great deal of sympathy with me in this task.  It is a very complicated and complex matter, since there are so many diverse interests and so many different views as to what should be done.  I have had to receive a vast number of deputations and generally it is quite a task to review the entire licensing laws in operation.  I should like to assure the Deputy, however, that I shall endeavour to have the appropriate decision taken at the earliest possible moment.</P>
      <P>Question No. 142 postponed.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.25 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 21st February, 1962.</P>
