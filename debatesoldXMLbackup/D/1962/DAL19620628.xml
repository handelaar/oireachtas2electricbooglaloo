      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was endeavouring to put a point of view which had not already been put in this House, that is, the point of view of a Pioneer. Some people seem to think that Pioneers have no right at all to offer opinions on the Bill because they do not drink.  In view of the fact that we have had the point of view of the publicans and the drinking man, it is only right that we should have the view of the man who does not take a drink.  I am speaking on this matter as an individual because the Labour Party have decided to have a free vote on it.  I want to make it clear that, despite what has been said by one of the speakers, Pioneers are not all kill-joys and people who would like to close down every public house in the countryside.  You get the impression, to hear some people speak, that all public houses should be closed.  We do not subscribe to that view at all. We believe that if somebody wants a drink and enjoys it and can take it in moderation and can afford it, there is no reason why he should not have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we do object to a further extension of licensing hours which would result in people being encouraged to do things which otherwise they would not do.  I refer again to the extension of Sunday drinking hours. Every sensible man and woman will agree that it is not right that facilities should be provided for a person who wants to stand at a public house bar from four o'clock to ten o'clock on Sundays.  The question of whether or not proper facilities are being provided for the country people has been discussed. I believe the Minister is correct in having the closing hour changed <Col N="1099" /> from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. but I do not agree that he is right in putting the opening hour back from 5 p.m. to 4 p.m.</P>
    <P>I believe that the hours of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. are sufficient or, if a good case can be made for it, the opening hour could be put back to six o'clock so that the Sunday evening hours would be from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I believe those hours should be sufficient for any man in the country.  We seem to be interested in the men working in the fields and working with cattle and I agree that the fellow who is working up to five or six in the evening, by the time he would have his clothes changed would find that it was eight o'clock before he could get into a public house. For that reason, the extension until 10 o'clock is reasonable but I do not think that any good purpose would be served by having the opening hour put back to four o'clock.</P>
    <P>The question of people who have to work in public houses has already been ably dealt with by Deputy Mullen.  The hours to be worked by these people have to be taken into consideration. There is also the question of the family public house.  Numerous people running family public houses have told me that they think it unreasonable that they should be asked to stay all day in the public house on Sunday.  They do not think it right that they should have to stay in the public house from 12 noon until 10 p.m. with a short break of from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. in order to give out drink.</P>
    <P>The argument that they are not bound to do that is fallacious.  It has been pointed out by one publican in the House that if there are two public houses in a village and one opens on a Sunday and the other does not, the fellow who gets a drink on a Sunday will go back on the Monday to the house that was open on the Sunday. There is no argument in saying that the publican does not have to open, if he does not want to.  If the case is being made that publicans are entitled to close if they want to, the Minister should see to it that they all close at the same hours.</P>
    <P>So far as the men working in bars <Col N="1100" /> are concerned, we have all heard of the terrific wages they are supposed to get for working on their day off.  I do not think that is any compensation for the loss of their leisure hours.  As a life long supporter of the GAA, I would say that the effect on the Dublin GAA clubs of the extended opening of the public houses on a Sunday afternoon which would prevent young men from going out to play football on Sunday afternoons would be disastrous. It would be a very great mistake.</P>
    <P>I merely intervened in this debate for the purpose of putting the point of view that we are all entitled to have our own opinion and to state it here. Unlike Deputy P.J. Burke, I believe that, having put our point of view here, we are entitled to vote according to that point of view and not according to what we are told to do.  This is not a political Bill.  There is no political kudos in it for anyone.  We should do our best to help those who want to drink in moderation and those who are employed in the trade.  Reference has been made to the tourist.  Tourists come and go and many tourists do not have as long drinking hours in their own countries as they have here.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of hotels where people can have a drink at any hour provided they are staying.  Holiday camps are in a different category. I agree that people staying in hotels should have a drink when they want it. They are inside and even if they have too much they can go to bed and are no danger to anybody.  This privilege is allowed to hotels and not to holiday camps.  The regulation about the holiday camp is that it must close down at the same hours as they have to under the previous Act but if there is an extension provided in one case I believe it should be provided in all cases.  I would like the Minister to have a look at that aspect of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Every licensing Bill debate has this quality, that Deputies on all sides of the House contribute to it very generously.  That is an interesting thing because it shows how much this matter approximates to the daily life of the people.  Whether we are Pioneers or not, we are all familiar with the impact of this kind of legislation on the <Col N="1101" /> lives of the people we represent.  It is a good thing that this should be manifest not only in the House but in the country generally.</P>
      <P>Some people criticise us here in Dáil Éireann because we are not all sitting in the Chamber all the time.  They might learn a lesson from the attendance of Deputies in connection with a Bill such as this rather than in connection with a Bill dealing with some obscure aspect of local government or law amendment.  In such matters, perhaps, only a few Deputies have a specialised knowledge and they will attend constantly and debate the question involved.  When there is a subject with which we are all familiar and which affects the lives of all our neighbours, there is always a very large attendance of Deputies because they know they have something of value to contribute.  I wish some of our less sophisticated critics abroad would observe this distinction and learn a lesson therefrom and try to understand to some degree how Dáil Éireann and the Oireachtas work.</P>
      <P>We put down a series of amendments which I understand we are now discussing&mdash;Nos. 8, 12 and 20&mdash;and which we offer to the House as a pattern to provide for a reasonable arrangement for drinking hours in the cities and in rural Ireland.  We object to the proposals in the Bill because we believe the hours proposed by the Bill of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays all the year round are too long.  That is our sensible, reasonable proposition and I want to recall the mind of the House to the beginning of this story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until quite recently, there was no general opening of public houses in rural Ireland on a Sunday.  But there was a right in travel: if a person were a traveller, he had the right to stop at a seven-day licensed house and get a drink, but there was no right in anybody who travelled in order to get a drink.  But the case was pressed on the Oireachtas that if people were entitled to get a drink during certain restricted hours in the cities and not in the country, it was unreasonable that a person in rural Ireland had not the right to get a drink in a public house at all on a Sunday, unless he was a traveller, and on that basis the House <Col N="1102" /> accepted a completely new departure. The House accepted the proposal to grant an opening period of three hours in rural Ireland on Sunday afternoon.</P>
    <P>Now the Government's proposal in this Bill marks a complete philosophical departure from that original attitude adopted by Dáil Éireann on this matter.  I understand the original attitude was that on the whole we did not want public houses generally open on a Sunday, but we wanted to take up the position that if the people in cities in the country were entitled to have a drink on Sunday, therefore the public houses in rural Ireland should also have a restricted period of opening on Sunday.  The case was then made very strongly that though there are few Sabbatarians among us and that though we do not take the rigid puritan attitude of drawing down our blinds and disposing ourselves purely in religious activities on the Sabbath, we did not think it was a desirable thing unnecessarily to suggest to business people that they should undertake service work on Sunday.</P>
    <P>We are now proposing, in substance, if not in fact, to open all the public houses on Sundays for over seven hours all the year round.  That practically means that we have introduced universal opening of public houses on seven days a week all the year round. We think that is wrong.  I am not suggesting that the Minister is a heretic or a pagan or anything of that sort, but it is, I think, an indication that we have lost sight of the original philosophy with which we approached this matter, that is, that in rural Ireland we should try to avoid turning Sunday into an ordinary business day. We had, of course, been prepared always to sanction the provision of limited facilities in the country, if publicans wished to provide them for their regular customers.</P>
    <P>There is another principle which we laid down&mdash;and there was pretty general agreement all round the House about it&mdash;that the <i>bona fide</i> traffic was an evil because it brought or tended to bring drunken drivers on to the roads and that therefore a sound general principle or an ideal to be aimed at was that there would be no <Col N="1103" /> differential in the closing hours of public houses which would operate to create a regular traffic of persons who had to leave a public house in one place but could repair to a place two or three miles distant, where a different jurisdiction operated, and continue drinking there with the consequent obligation to drive home later.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what amendment No. 12 will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very point I want to raise.  There is no use getting incensed because this is a very pragmatical question and that is the very point I want to raise.  The idea from our point of view was to eliminate altogether the differential.  And listen &mdash;we are not dafties in this House: we have to be practical politicians who realise we are not dealing with boys and girls in monastic institutions or in convent schools and that we cannot set up a rigid ideal and, having worked it and found it does not work, tie ourselves up and say there is nothing we can do about it.</P>
      <P>I believe in the principle of uniformity but if I find that when you put that into operation you are creating a situation to the detriment of the seaside resorts and causing the greatest possible difficulty to the organisers of sports events or the individual in a country town who organises a fleadh ceoil or any other occasion of a good social gathering, and they come and say: &ldquo;Your ideal is grand, we all agree with it but in practice it is not working,&rdquo; I, as a politician, must answer: &ldquo;That is my job; that is what Parliament is for.&rdquo; We all ought to have an ideal but that ideal ought to be examined in the light of practical working conditions and if the ideal will not work, then we must look at the philosophy of the late Mr. Tom Kettle, that far-seeing man, who said: &ldquo;Politics is only too often in our experience not the achievement of the second best but the grateful acceptance of the second worst.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a realistic world and we have got to face that fact.  When the present Bill came forward for discussion I had many discussions with <Col N="1104" /> various interests, and long before the Bill came on the agenda, I was besieged as Leader of the Fine Gael Party with representatives from seaside and holiday resorts generally who said that the Bill Dáil Éireann had passed in 1960 with the best intentions had broken down.  Is that not so?  Our Party considered a policy to lay before the people and we went before the people and announced we were going to change the Intoxicating Liquor Act and we invited public discussion on the public platform.  We said we considered that the licensing legislation which was passed in Dáil Éireann 18 months before had failed and needed amendment and anybody who thought we were wrong was invited to challenge us.</P>
    <P>We said that what we proposed to do about it was face the facts.  The fact is that the legislation is wreaking great hardship on people trying to provide for the tourist industry.  I know of cases in places like Bundoran where a whole section of the tourist industry that had been most remunerative to that town had vanished as a result of the provision we made in the Act of 1960.  There are other localities operating under special conditions where the trade had completely vanished.</P>
    <P>It would be idiotic for practical men and women responsible for the legislation in this House to refuse to come back to Dáil Éireann and say: &ldquo;We made a mistake.  We ought to put that right.  We thought we did what was best but it has not worked out.&rdquo;  When you come to ask yourself how are you to remedy it, the fact emerges that the amendment suitable for Bundoran might not suit Ennistymon and the amendment suitable for Buncrana might not suit Rosslare.  The question then arises how Oireachtas Éireann is to deal with the problem.  The answer is that it is not equipped to deal with it, it.  If it is not equipped to deal with it, how are you to get it dealt with?</P>
    <P>The right thing to do is to give wide discretion either to the district court or the circuit court.  I think I would try the district court first.  If the district court does not seem to show a sufficient appreciation of the obligations of this, we could transfer the jurisdiction to the <Col N="1105" /> circuit court if we thought that was necessary.  Theoretically&mdash;this is where the theorist goes cracked&mdash;you are asking Oireachtas Éireann to give the district justice the right to open the public houses in all areas within his jurisdiction for 24 hours of the day. That is perfectly true.  But theoretically the same district justice could give any one of us six months in jail for spitting on the footpath or for parking our cars in the wrong place.  But if that became his practice, we would come to the conclusion he had gone stark, raving mad.</P>
    <P>We are committing this to the discretion of the district justice, subject to an appeal to the circuit court.  I assume we could provide for that here, if the Minister had any anxiety about the discretion of the district justice.  We commend to the jurisdiction of the district justice not only the absolute discretion to determine what hours public houses will open in seaside resorts, but we commit to his care and to his discretion the question of whether he will put anybody in jail for six months.  Suppose the district justice suffers from a temporary aberration and makes an order that for the months of July, August and September the public houses in Ballydehob should be allowed open an hour longer than we think is reasonable.  Suppose some district justice goes off the deep end and says: &ldquo;Let the public houses stay open for the entire 24 hours,&rdquo; there is now machinery whereby a psychiatric report could be secured to find out whether he has gone off the deep end completely or whether he believes, as I think many rational people could believe, that one of the best ways of regulating the hours of opening would be to have no hours at all and simply let the licensed traders fix their own hours.</P>
    <P>We are not going to do that and, short of doing that, we have to do the best we can.  As I say, the ideal is that we have universal uniformity.  In my considered judgment, and I take full responsibility in public for saying it, we have tried that and I do not think it works.  I want to avoid any departure from the principle of uniformity that will recreate the pattern of the old <Col N="1106" /><i>bona fide</i> trade.  What created that pattern in the past mainly was a significant permanent differential in the hours of closing.  It had to be permanent in order for the persons who sought to benefit out of those who came in search of later drinking hours to organise themselves to receive them. There is no doubt that where you had a permanent differential in closing hours certain persons quite legitimately equipped themselves to cater for that business.  They had the bulk of their staff on duty in those hours, expecting the apex of their trade to be reached with the influx of the migrants from the closed areas.</P>
    <P>We sought in our amendment to retain a unity of closing hours, save for the summer months or for a special occasion.  If you give any rural town like Boyle, Carrickmacross or even a city like Kilkenny a special concession to open the public houses on the occasion of a fleadh ceoil, a football match, a feis or something of that kind, no pattern is created, even though you create a temporary wide differential in closing hours.  It is only for one day and maybe another day later in the year.  But no pattern emerges for which anybody will organise himself to cater regularly.  I fully appreciate and concede to the Minister that in regard to the holiday resorts for the summer months such a pattern may emerge.  I see no escape from it, but it is for a restricted period, for the summer months.</P>
    <P>I admit to the Minister that in so far as that happens, it is a breach of the ideal of uniformity, which I would prefer to maintain if I believed it practicable to do so.  But I ask Deputies on every side of the House if they have not heard from a variety of seaside and holiday resorts an almost universal complaint that the present system does not work and that a wider degree of flexibility is necessary.  Have Deputies from every side not heard different sorts of complaints from different sorts of holiday resorts?  That is the problem. I know of no way in which it can be satisfactorily disposed of except by the courts.  We proposed the district court because resort to the district court is cheaper, more expeditious and <Col N="1107" /> more convenient.  But if somebody expressed the view very strongly that a higher and more prudent discretion should be invoked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We usually grade the judiciary into the court of first instance, the circuit court, the high court and the supreme court.  I am advocating the district court.  I believe it would provide adequate protection.  The district justice is intimately familiar with the conditions of the people he habitually serves.  The district justice's court is cheaper and the procedures more expeditious. As a rule, because of his intimate contact with the people, he enjoys their confidence and understands their problems.  On the whole, I think we may safely leave it in the hands of the district justice to control.</P>
      <P>I do not think we should lightly turn our minds away from the deep and, I think, legitimate offence given all over the country&mdash;I shall not say universally but very widely&mdash;by a proposal to open the public houses in rural Ireland on Sundays.  The effect of the proposal in this Bill would be that the public houses would effectively be open from 12.30 in the morning until 10 o'clock at night.  I doubt if any Deputy wants that.</P>
      <P>The plain truth, when it comes down to tin tacks, as the Minister himself has probably experienced, is that when an alternative is asked for, there are plenty of people who will stipulate their objection to any proposal the Minister makes but when he says: &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; are not so ready to put it down in black and white.  We have put down something in black and white.  I make no apology and no pretence about the fact that what we are advancing are compromise proposals.  There are various views in our Party but we sat down and discussed this at length and we tried to arrive at what was as close an approximation as we could get to the general feeling of the Party, and it was on the basis of that joint and general proposal that this Party put down these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> I understand Deputy Tully's difficulty. He says that every man must vote according to his conscience, but that is a strong argument against the existence of political parties.  I take the view that if Parliament is to work, we should sit down and consider things in our Party and, as a general rule, in order to make the Dáil work, we should come in here and act and vote as a Party.  These are the fruits of our joint wisdom and we believe them to be a fair and reasonable compromise between all of the interests involved.</P>
    <P>Some of us would prefer to adhere to the hours of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the winter, and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. in the summer all over the country, uniformly, but the case has been made, and we have had to listen to it, that if there is a GAA final in Cork or a final in Dublin, the crowd may be leaving the field at 4.30 p.m. or 4.45 p.m. and if the public houses do not open until 6 o'clock, they would have to stand around in the streets for an hour, or an hour and a half, before getting any refreshment and getting themselves ready for the road home.  Therefore, we have to try to meet their convenience.</P>
    <P>Other sporting occasions or social occasions may arise in the country towns and the other cities, and in particular in the cities where matches are ordinarily scheduled to begin at 3 o'clock and finish at 4.30 p.m. or 4.45 p.m.  We had to recognise that and we met it by saying that in Dublin the opening hours should be from 5 o'clock to 10 o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that there should be legitimate regard for everyone's rights in this respect. Deputy Tully referred to the ordinary small country publican who with his wife is running a bar, and who has no grown-up children in whose care he can leave the premises.  We are now effectively providing that from this day forth such a person is chained to the counter for the rest of his life, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</P>
      <P>It is nonsense, and any of us who have experience of the business know it is nonsense, to suggest that if there are three small publicans in one town or village, one fellow can put up the shutters and say to his customers: &ldquo;You can go to blazes.&rdquo;  If he did, he would be out of business in a month, and quite rightly.  Every publican in rural Ireland has his own <i>clientele</i> who expect to be received with civility, and to have a place where they can park their horse and cart if they go into town on a Sunday, and no compliment about it.  If a publican is living out of his <i>clientele</i>, he should be prepared to accommodate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nonsense to suggest that in the ordinary practical atmosphere of rural Ireland, it would be possible for a publican, if he had neighbours who open from 12.30 p.m. until 10 p.m., to put up his shutters and refuse to take them down until 6 o'clock and for the rest of the day say: &ldquo;You can go home or go to my rivals.&rdquo;  If he went once or twice to a rival, the rival would be very quick to say to him: &ldquo;Oh, what brought you here?  I am surprised to see you.  We are greatly flattered to see you coming in here on a Sunday.&rdquo;  Either he would have to stand for such jeers and jibes or he would have to transfer his custom.  Is that not true?  It is a fact.  It would operate to see that the self-employed publican would never have a free day again.  I think it is <Col N="1111" /> foolish and wrong and shows a complete lack of familiarity with the ordinary conditions of rural life in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say to me: &ldquo;But you have just said a case is to be made for abolishing all closing hours and letting the publicans settle it themselves. The funny thing is that if you did that, the thing would settle itself, and the publicans would fix their hours to suit themselves and their <i>clientele.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We have attempted to provide a reasonable opening time in rural Ireland for public houses, that is, from 6 to 10 p.m. in summer and 7 to 10 p.m. in winter.  Over and above that, we have deliberately proposed in two separate amendments, Nos. 12 and 20, that it should be vested in the district justice of the area under Section 10 that if the majority of the licence-holders of a holiday resort area make application and the justice is of opinion that the locality is one which, by reason of its being a holiday resort, will be likely to attract a considerable number of persons during such period, the justice, if satisfied that it is desirable to do so for the accommodation of those persons, may, after hearing the officer <Col N="1113" /> in charge of the Garda Síochána, make an order subject to such conditions as the justice may think proper, exempting the holders of licences in respect of premises situate in that locality from the provisions of the Licensing Acts relating to prohibited hours in respect of those premises at such times and on such days and subject to such conditions during the period as he thinks fit.  The period for holiday resorts that we envisage is June to September inclusive.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 is designed to permit the district justice for any particular area, without restriction of the months of the year, to make an order exempting the area for a certain occasion from the usual restrictions on Sunday drinking which operate in other areas.  That is a tripartite proposal in that it maintains the generally uniform closing hour as ten o'clock; in that it recognises the special conditions of cities as opposed to rural areas in regard to opening hours; in that it acknowledges that the ideal of uniformity is one of value but that in practice recognition must be given to the special case of the rural town or city and that the special circumstances of the holiday resort must be acknowledged and that in catering for them we are not constructing a pattern of such character as is likely to evoke again the evils of <i>bona fide</i> drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We believe that our proposal is a better proposal, mainly because it corrects what we regard as the really grave defect in the Bill as it stands at present, that is, the altogether unjustified&mdash;in our judgement&mdash;extension of drinking hours on Sunday.  Our proposal seeks to restrict those hours back approximately to the hours provided in the original legislation of two years ago, subject to the exceptions I have indicated. I urge the Minister to look on this proposal which we put forward in its triparite form and, having considered the arguments, at least to give it a trial.  He is in the position of having to come back two years after the previous Bill was enacted, a Bill which was thought by the Government to be the complete answer to all our problems. He may have to come to the <Col N="1114" /> House again to review whatever is now decided but I think the proposal we submit is well worthy of trial.  It avoids the evils I described, not the least of which is the condition of the self-employed publican who is entitled to have some life of his own and who will be denied it if the Bill passes in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure every Deputy will agree when I say this is a difficult problem.  I have propounded a certain solution to it and I honestly assure the House that nothing I have so far heard in this debate has convinced me that my solution is not the right one or that a better one could be evolved or, in particular, that the solution put forward by Fine Gael is even workable.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental difference between my approach to this problem and that of the Fine Gael Party.  The difference is, of course, that I have no belief at all in the efficacy, or even the practicability, of the area exemption order or any particular variant of it.  It is absolutely clear that the solution propounded by Fine Gael relies entirely on the area exemption order. Both of us face the same problem.  The Fine Gael Party and most Deputies and myself agree more or less precisely as to what the problem is.  We differ completely in our solution to it.  The Fine Gael Party propose, in effect, to resurrect the old area exemption order system to cater for the problem.  I suggest the problem should properly be tackled in a different way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to the House that the area exemption order system broke down completely before and, in effect, caused more or less administrative chaos.  As I mentioned, there was a case where a district justice granted an exemption on the ground that a number of people went for a walk in a particular direction on a Sunday evening.  I do not suggest for one moment that that district justice was not absolutely within his rights in interpreting the provisions of the Act in that way, but I just quote the case as an example of what could happen and can happen under the area exemption order system.  I object to the area exemption order system, <Col N="1115" /> first of all, because it tears the whole system of uniformity to shreds.</P>
    <P>I am asked what is my view about uniformity.  Deputy Michael O'Higgins was very insistent yesterday that I should give my view and, funnily enough, my view on this point is largely in agreement with that of the Leader of the Opposition.  I think our objective in this matter should be to ensure the greatest degree of uniformity possible.  I want to make it clear that that view is not arrived at on the basis of some abstract principle; it is just simply my conviction that there are enormous advantages flowing from the system whereby the intoxicating liquor law is the same in every part of the country.  Those advantages are obvious and I need not repeat them.  It is my objective, therefore, to adhere as closely as possible to the principle of uniformity and in so far as we can do so to ensure that in all parts of the country the general hours of opening are the same.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared to depart from uniformity if it could be shown to me that it is absolutely necessary to do so and that there is some particular situation where the only possible solution is to breach the uniformity principle.</P>
    <P>That is my simple view about it.  I think the idea of uniformity has enormous advantages and that it should be our objective to adhere as closely as possible at all times and in all parts of the country to that idea but if it is ever clearly and unequivocally demonstrated that there is no solution but to depart from it, then I would be prepared to consider departing from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael approach to this matter is to shorten general hours of opening on Sunday to some extent and then, by means of amendments Nos. 12 and 20, to introduce a system of exemption orders for different localities so that in different localities we could have different opening hours and different opening hours in the same locality at different times. It is a solution, but my first objection to it is that it would recreate a position where on a very large scale we would have different hours in different parts of the country and Deputy Dillon himself is the first to admit that a pattern would emerge in certain areas, seaside resorts, for instance.  I want to point out to him that closely adjacent to Dublin city there are a number of seaside resorts.  Is it not obvious to us all that the system which is proposed by the Fine Gael Party would recreate the old pattern with regard to these seaside resorts?  I am taking, for instance, Malahide, Bray, Skerries, or any of these.  A definite pattern of opening for the summer months would emerge in these areas and we would in effect be recreating the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.</P>
      <P>The other difficulty I see about the Fine Gael approach is the difficulty of defining a holiday resort.  In this connection everybody immediately thinks in terms of seaside resorts but, of course, the amendment could not ever possibly be drafted to confine its operations to seaside resorts.  There are inland towns&mdash;&mdash;</P>

So that the difficulty would immediately arise as to the definition <Col N="1117" /> of a holiday resort and the pressure on the district court to recognise more and more areas as holiday resorts would become irresistible and the term would become interpreted more and more widely until ultimately it would be very difficult to establish that any one part of the country could not in some way qualify as a holiday resort.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael solution, to my mind, just will not work for those two reasons.  First of all, it would certainly recreate a pattern of extended opening hours in certain areas and that pattern would slowly spread all over the country.  It would cause a complete collapse of the licensing code which we have been endeavouring to establish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My idea is that we are trying to establish a code which would be as nearly as possible uniform throughout the country, which would be consistently and impartially enforced and which would not in any circumstances create a situation where people would be able to get drink by travelling from one place where drink is not obtainable at a particular time to another where it is.  That is, I think, the situation which the Oireachtas bravely and courageously faced up to in the last Bill and to a large extent solved.  The system we created then has begun to creak a bit at the seams and I just want to do a repairing job in time.</P>
      <P>As I said, the Opposition Deputies and I recognise where the problem exists and where the danger spots are. My proposal is to try to extend the hours generally throughout the country so that by and large all areas will be satisfied and at the same time the general hours of opening will be kept uniform throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael have a completely different approach.  They say, on the contrary, the thing to do is to keep the existing hours or restrict them a little <Col N="1118" /> and then let special areas have, in effect, whatever hours they want.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to venture into this dangerous country of the area exemption order if I thought it were necessary.  I received deputations from all parts of the country from hoteliers, publicans, all the various interested organisations, and I was assured by practically everybody I met that the hours of closing on weekdays were generally satisfactory but most people suggested what is incorporated in the Bill, namely, that the longer opening in the summer period should be extended to coincide with summer time.  Apart from that, the consensus of opinion was that in seaside resorts, holiday resorts and elsewhere the half-past eleven closing on week-nights in the summer was late enough.  All were practically unanimously agreed that the Sunday hours might be extended.  There was a very substantial agreement that 10 o'clock on a Sunday night would be late enough, and that measure of agreement is here in this House.</P>
      <P>Here we have a situation where almost everybody is agreed on the main essentials, on the half-past eleven closing on week-nights for the period of summer time and on the 10 o'clock closing on Sunday night.  What problem are we left with?  We are left with the question of Sunday afternoon, at the most, a question of one hour.  Some people suggest two hours.  Some people suggest 6 to 10 p.m. Deputy Sherwin says 5.30 to 10 p.m. and Deputy Byrne suggests 5 to 10 p.m. I am suggesting 4 to 10 p.m.</P>

The fact that they are open, but people do not want to go into them, is no disadvantage to the public.  We are back then to the publicans and the workers.  I will readily admit that there is a problem, but I suggest that there is no way that problem can be better faced and solved than in Dublin and Cork cities where, by and large, you have strong trade union organisations and bigger and wealthier publicans.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am perfectly happy about the situation of the Dublin barmen because I know they have a very effective, very efficient, very strong, capable trade union organisation and I am confident that organisation will be able to protect the interests of its members.  We are left, therefore, with the Dublin city publicans.  I have told them that I agree I am imposing some element of inconvenience on them.  On <Col N="1123" /> the other hand, I have told them they are people who have been a long time in this business.  They are skilled at it. They have great experience.  They have managerial capacity and ability and they will just simply have to solve this problem in their own way as they have solved other problems before.  That is what I told them.  One line of approach I suggested to them was that they could decide they would not do any business between four o'clock and five o'clock or between four o'clock and six o'clock. I asked them, if they did not want to do any business during those hours, could they not so organise their houses in such manner as would enable them to operate with a skeleton staff, or something of that nature, during that period?</P>
      <P>In approaching this matter, I have another factor in mind.  Deputies will realise that I thought it would be both good and desirable to abolish the early morning opening in the dock area.  I was immediately besieged with all sorts of legitimate pressures to retract from that position.  I was approached by workers, trade unions, and so on.  I discussed the matter with the barmen's trade union.  I asked them what their view was in the matter.  I explained the situation in which certain licensed premises were open for three hours&mdash; three-and-a-half in some cases&mdash;in the morning every day in the week.  I asked them if they had any view about that.  The barmen's union assured me they had no problems.  It did not create any problems for their members because, they said, they had taken the view that they would not work this period anyway and, if any particular publican wants to open in the early morning, he can make his own arrangements.  &ldquo;Our trade union members will not,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;work in that period.&rdquo;  That is the position taken up by the trade union concerned with relation to not one or two hours on Sunday but three hours every day in the week.  When I see a trade union legitimately taking up that position and dealing with the matter in that way, I find it very difficult to accept that they will not be able to evolve some similar solution for one hour on Sunday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has put the problem of keeping open from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m. on the licensed vintners in Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  Did he take into consideration the fact that this period of six hours represents practically a full working day during which the publicans must keep open?  There is no break allowed for tea in that period of six hours.  I do not think this six-hour opening on Sunday evening is called for.  Secondly, I think the Minister should have provided a break, at least, for the publican.  Several of them have told me&mdash;I use their own words&mdash; that they have absolutely no privacy at all now in their houses on Sunday or any other day of the week.  With the exception of the two-hour break on Sunday afternoon they are open from noon until 10 p.m.  If the Minister will not accept the amendments to limit the opening hours on Sunday, he might at least provide a break of one hour or an hour-and-a-half both for the publican and his staff either from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m., or 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.  It is only common sense to ask for that.</P>
      <P>In extending the hours, the Minister has, I think, lost sight of one point. A man has only a certain amount of money to spend on drink.  If he spends it on Sunday, he will not have it to spend on the other days of the week. From that point of view, opening from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. is quite uncalled for and quite unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has taken a very definite stand on uniformity.  I am all the way with him there, but he said&mdash; I think these were the words he used &mdash;there would be a complete collapse <Col N="1125" /> if the Fine Gael amendment to allow district justices to grant occasional exemptions were accepted.  I cannot agree with him in that because there are special occasions on which uniformity must be broken.  I refer to a fleadh ceoil or a pilgrimage.</P>

However, I would also ask the Minister to reconsider the Sunday opening from 4 to 10 p.m. Without labouring the point, it is too long a period.  I am not going into the question that it is turning Sunday into a weekday, which it is, for the public. The 4 o'clock opening is too early.  If the Minister insists on the 4 to 10 p.m. opening, he ought to give the publican and his staff at least an hour or a half-hour <Col N="1126" /> break for tea about seven o'clock.</P>
      <P>Here is another point as far as rural areas are concerned.  Evening Devotions are held there from 6 to 7.30 p.m. A closing during that time, in town and country, would be a good thing.  I think nobody would disagree with it.  It is a reasonable suggestion.  I put down an amendment to that effect but, between now and the Report Stage, I would ask the Minister to consider that side of the matter.  If he feels the public houses must open as early as 4 p.m. and close as late as 10 p.m., then I would ask him to bear in mind the two points which I have raised in regard to the Evening Devotions and a break for the publicans and their staffs. Surely they are entitled to get even a short period for their tea and to a little bit of privacy in their houses on Sundays?</P>
      <P>Comments were made about Pioneers.  I am a Pioneer.  I have never taken a drink.  I have never yet heard of a Pioneer who has taken up the attitude that nobody should take a drink.  As a matter of fact, what the Pioneer organisation set their face against is the excessive use of drink. Disparaging remarks in this House about such an organisation are to be deplored and should not have been made.  The Pioneers are doing very good work.</P>

      <P>I have been very impressed by the Minister's various statements. I am sure that, with his analytical ability, apart from representations he has received, he has sought to do the best job possible in this case. I am a Dublin Deputy.  I know rural Ireland very well, also.  I think the Minister omitted to say that the barmen <Col N="1127" /> agreed that there would be no difficulty about the 4 o'clock opening on Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>I have received representations from barmen.  We must bear in mind that, for barmen who are raising a family, Sunday may be the only day on which they have the privilege of seeing their children at lunch time.  The Minister is a Dubliner and I am sure his experience in this connection is the same as mine.  I am sure he realises the position as regards the opening of public houses at 3.30 p.m. on week-days.  I pointed out to the Minister's predecessor that one could walk into a licensed premises any week-day between 3.30 and 4.30 and he would not have to wait one moment for service. Therefore, if his intention was to cut down the hours, he had a very easy way of doing it.</P>
      <P>I also agreed with the Minister's predecessor on the question of uniformity. I do not see any reason why I should change my viewpoint now. However, that question arose when we were considering allowing some places to remain open later than other places, not earlier than other places.</P>
      <P>The various needs are being catered for by the Minister in the Bill.  However, it will come down to a question of voting for a 4 o'clock opening on Sunday.  The Leader of the Opposition stated that Fine Gael, as a Party, met and discussed this point; that they were not quite uniform in their views but that eventually they came to a decision and decided to vote as a Party.  That procedure, I am sure, is applicable not only to the Fine Gael Party but equally to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want the Liquor Bill or the 4 o'clock opening to be a factor, so far as voting against the Minister or the Government is concerned.  In my view, this Bill could be deferred. There is no immediate need for this legislation.  It should not be brought forward until such time as possibly the Government or the Whips would agree to allow a free vote of the House so that the matter would not be a political issue.  It is being made a <Col N="1128" /> political issue, as it was made a political issue at the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish this matter to be a political factor.  From the point of view of the barmen, every aspect has been submitted for consideration. I think Deputy Mullen has put the position regarding the workers before the House.  The Minister countered by saying that the workers of Dublin are so well catered for that there is no need for him to worry about their problems.  Surely he would not wish to be responsible for bringing about a strike in the trade?</P>
      <P>The licensed premises in Dublin have created an all-time record mainly by virtue of the greater consumption referred to by the Taoiseach.  However, I repeat that one can walk from here to the north side of the city and find that the premises are virtually empty between 3.30 and 4.30 p.m. Possibly the barmen are doing some useful work then which they would not be able to do when things get busy.  Mention was made of Britain and other places.  Do the public houses in Britain open at 3.30 p.m.? They do not.  They close at 3 p.m. and open at 6 or 6.30 p.m., according to local custom.  However, I am not concerned with that but with the Sunday question.</P>
      <P>Usually, the only difficulty I have ever noticed about the Sunday question is that, possibly, if he went to Navan with a football team, and so on, a person might be anxious to go into a public house after the match or the function.  I agree that 5 o'clock is a reasonable time.  People are coming away from sporting fixtures and venues of amusement around that time and are possibly in need of some beverage, and so on, which can be obtained only in a public house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister can assure me that <Col N="1129" /> the representatives of the barmen are in favour of a 4 o'clock opening, I will unreservedly give him my support but I cannot believe it because people have come to me about this. Apart from that, there is still the question of family life, the question of the rushing involved, even for those who may be off at 5.30 p.m., which might suit the barmen but it would not suit the public.  They want 5 o'clock.  It could have been made 4 o'clock for the seven days of the week as suggested for Sunday and an equally good job would have been done.  There appears to be general agreement between the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister on this with the exception of the exemption laws.</P>
    <P>Why should it be 4 o'clock in Dublin?  I will not speak for Cork. There is talk about uniformity but when we were talking about uniformity before we were thinking in terms of the publicans in Dublin closing at 10 p.m. and the people going out to the <i>bona fide</i> houses until 12 o'clock. Now we are in reverse so there is no question about uniformity being a reason for considering the opening on Sunday.  It is in complete reverse. Heretofore, they closed at 9.30 p.m. or 10 p.m. as the case might be and the boys went out to the <i>bona fide</i> houses. This, however, is completely different. The Minister says that this relates to the seaside resorts.  If they want to go to the seaside they will go anyway and they will not be going in at 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock in Dublin.  The 4 o'clock opening is completely ridiculous, with all respect to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak because of a statement made by Deputy O'Sullivan last night and a challenge he issued regarding rural Deputies and rural areas.  In my opinion, Deputy O'Sullivan is talking through his hat. He must not have travelled much in his constituency or he would know what the feeling is.  The vice-chairman of the Cork County Vintners Association, Mr. Michael Murphy, lives in his constituency in Fermoy, and he came on a deputation looking for the 4 o'clock to 10 o'clock hour without <Col N="1130" /> any break.  That puts the thing in a nutshell.  I do not think there should be any closing hours at all.  You have no closing hours in the restaurants in Dublin city.  People have been talking about the barmen but if they travelled around the restaurants in this city they would find that they are open until 12 midnight or 1 a.m.  I see no reason why the public houses should not remain open the same way.  The value of a public house compared to a restaurant is in the ratio of three or four to one so they must be making money and able to pay their staff.  We heard a lot of nonsense talked about barmen.</P>
      <P>I should like to warn the Minister in regard to one aspect of this.  We have heard a lot of noise about exemptions and &ldquo;breaks&rdquo;.  The more &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; you have, the more work the Guards are going to have and, of course, the more money the lawyers are going to get.  That accounts for a lot of the noise I have heard in the past few days.  If we are to take the amendments you are going to have the Guards watching the public houses at 12.30 for fear anybody would open at 12.15.  Then they would have to come along again at 5 to see they were closed, or come along at 3.45 and again at 6.  They would have to come along at 7 p.m. and then again at 10 p.m. to see that they were closed. I suggest that would mean a wholetime job for the Garda Síochána without looking after anything else.</P>
      <P>I remember a time in this House when the majority of the Deputies, rural and city, thought the rural community should not have public houses open on a Sunday.  That was voted on here in this House.  The same people voted for the retention of the opening of the city public houses on Sundays. I do not want to disgrace them altogether by reading the division lists but they did that here and they kept that barrier here for the past 50 years and the result was that everybody laughed at the licensing laws and nobody obeyed them.  That was the state of affairs until the last Act was passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A man may go for a walk with his wife on a Sunday evening and he might <Col N="1131" /> like to bring her in for a drink.  There is nothing wrong with that and there is no reason why he should not.  Young people and old go to matches and they like to get a drink afterwards.  I have seen funerals of 200 to 300 cars coming to rural villages.  The burial is generally at 3 o'clock.  The public houses are closed and the people have no opportunity of getting a drink.  That could amount to a 12 months' loss for the publican but that is not considered here.  Only the Dublin barmen are considered.  If you put up a twopence-halfpenny public house here for auction, it will fetch between £20,000 and £40,000.  I never heard such nonsense in my life to think that a man is prepared to pay £20,000 or £40,000 to buy that public house and then he is not prepared to pay sufficient help to get all he can out of that public house.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all alike.  Put up the small one and see what it fetches.  The restaurants in the city can keep open from 10 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock the following morning.  If they can do that with far less income and far less profit than the publican and pay helpers and staff, there is no case at all for the city publican on that basis.</P>
      <P>The only complaints I have got about this are from two publicans in Youghal who complained about the 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. closing.  They said that should not be there.  We have a condition of affairs now where there is plenty of employment in my constituency. You have men coming off work at mid-day on Sunday and going to work on Sunday evening in Irish Steel Ltd. where the foundries have to be kept going.  Those men want some provision for them since they must work on Sunday at harder work than the filling of a pint.  Those people are entitled to as much consideration as any Dublin person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thing that is preventing the House from doing the sensible thing, which would be to open when you like and close when you like and give every man a drink when he wants it, is the <Col N="1132" /> legal profession.  They would lose too much.  Now they have appeals from decisions of the district justices regarding exemption orders and there are nine different sets of circumstances in which a publican can be caught on Sunday. Under the proposals from the other side they can be caught if they open before 12.30, if they do not close before 2.30, if they open before 4 o'clock, if they do not close at 5.30 or 6, if they open before 7 o'clock and if they remain open after 10 o'clock.  This list of penalties and clauses is the most nonsensical thing I ever heard of.  Any unfortunate publican who tried to live under them would want to be a genius and have the tamest customers that ever existed.  And you usually do not find these in public houses.  That is the sole reason why we have not done the sensible thing, which is to give every man a drink when he wants it.</P>
    <P>I would not have intervened in this debate to-day except for the speech made by Deputy O'Sullivan.  The licensed vintners in his constituency came up to Dublin, saw the Minister for Justice and put up the case for opening from 4 o'clock to 10 o'clock.</P>

      <P>Early on this discussion, Deputy Mullen posed a very important question.  Now, at this late stage and after the Minister has spoken, that question remains unanswered. He inquired as to where the demand came from for these extended hours of opening in the Dublin area.  Deputy Noel Lemass would have us believe that these proposals for extended opening had the support of Father Dargan and the ecclesiastical authorities but I would say it was more or less for fear that something worse would be imposed on them.  Deputy Meaney said that he was in favour of these hours, that he represented the people and that, therefore, they wanted them.  Deputy P.J. Burke who represents the same constituency as I do found himself in a difficult situation.  Having listened to him for some time, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that would solve his problems and mine would be that the Minister would allow us to make the licensing laws and administer them for his constituency and mine.  If he did that and left it to us, we would do a first-class job.</P>
      <P>I feel that there has been no demand for these extended hours.  I have met many publicans in the city and county of Dublin and they do not need the extended hours.  I have met many of the people who work in the public houses and they do not want them.  I believe that the vast majority of the people in these areas do not want extended hours and I think the limited few who would be anxious to have them are the people whom the Minister should protect against themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the last person who <Col N="1134" /> should come into this House and look for extended hours for drinking is the Minister for Justice.  At the present time if a man is caught in a public house at 9.15 p.m. on a Sunday evening he is heavily fined and the man who has opened the premises has his licence endorsed.  If he does it a few times, he loses his livelihood and the value of his house is reduced to practically nothing.  Therefore at the present time it is regarded as a serious matter to open after hours and now the Minister who believes that is telling us that it would be a good thing if we had a couple of hours extra opening on Sunday.</P>
    <P>Personally, I believe that there is now too much opening for drinking on Sunday.  I am wondering what the Minister is worrying about.  Does he feel the publicans are not making enough money and that if he gives them these hours it means they will make a living?  I do not know any poor publican in this area and if there are such people I suggest the best way for the Minister to go about improving their lot would be to restrict the issuing of licences.  I think we have far too many licences.</P>

      <P>I thought that when the Minister was on his feet, he would deal with the effects of the proposed new drinking hours on Sundays.  He did say it was a problem and I think Deputies generally are in agreement that these hours are completely unnecessary for Dublin city and county.  I can see a case for the seaside resorts, but as far as Dublin is concerned, there is general agreement that the new hours are unwanted.  The Minister as much as admitted that.  In fact he practically threw his problem over to the trade union movement by saying: &ldquo;I cannot deal with it, but, perhaps, you can and then the lack of uniformity that would exist is the <Col N="1135" /> responsibility of the trade union movement and not mine.  If you refuse to allow the men to work, then the public houses will not open for the hour or two extra provided for in the Bill.  In other areas, there will be public houses open for the extra hours and then you will have lack of uniformity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister also failed to deal with the possible effects on the price of drink.  My information is that the pint will rise in price by 2d. to make up for the overtime that must be involved in working these extra hours.  That is a very serious aspect of this matter. In fact, I see no excuse whatsoever for these extra hours.  If people were free to have a drink after Mass, and then if they had three or four hours after their evening meal in which to have a drink, that should be enough for them.  The hours proposed in the Bill for Sunday will lead to excessive drinking on the part of certain people; it will lead to more accidents and it will increase the price of drink.  I cannot see the point of harping on this question of uniformity.  Why do we need uniformity for a people so far from uniform in their habits or pursuits? There is no uniformity about how our people make their livelihood.</P>
      <P>It is right to say that the seaside resorts have only one harvest, lasting during the holiday months.  They should be allowed special consideration so that they can reap that harvest. It is unfortunate their harvest depends so much on drink because I think we have far too much drinking and that far too much is spent on drink.  Many sins have been blamed on tourism. Personally, I should hate to see our tourist industry built on the type of singing lounge depicted in our tourist advertisements.  We have a lot more to offer to people who come to this country than just public houses and it would be a shocking impression for visitors to think that all we have to offer is the facility of drinking.  The Minister has admitted there is absolutely no necessity for these extra drinking hours on Sunday and I would appeal to him to reconsider the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the <Col N="1136" /> Minister, I formed the opinion that, while he did make a case for these new hours in rural areas, he did not attempt to make a case for them in Dublin. He suggested it was only a matter of one hour.  That is not correct.  It is a question of two hours in the summer and three hours in the winter.  It involves a long spread-over and most workers do not like a spread-over. They want to have their working hours put together.  If these new hours are allowed, it will mean a spread-over of nine and a half hours working hours and that, added to the time it takes a barman to get to work from his home and to get home after work, is far too long.  We can compare that with the present eight and a half hours in the summer and seven and a half hours in the winter and we will find a strong indication of a worsening of conditions at a time when we hear so much about the five-day week and shorter working hours.</P>
      <P>These new hours would also interfere with the barmen's family lives.  It is very important to take that into consideration. Consequently, there is no point in the Minister or anybody else saying this is a matter for the trade unions and the employers to discuss among themselves.  I am telling the truth when I say there will be no staff available to work these extra hours. If there is no staff available how can the Bill be worked?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take some from the Deputy.  There are two unions looking after the barmen &mdash; the National Union of Vintners and Allied Trades Assistants and the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, of which I am an official.  The two unions, through the offices of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, accompanied by representatives of <Col N="1137" /> other unions who look after bar staffs in other parts of the country, went to the Minister and made the plea not to interfere with the present hours on Sundays.  I have already said that there will not be staff available to work these new hours and that, therefore, you are asking barmen to work longer.  Nobody wants to do that on a Sunday.  Freedom of pursuit on a Sunday is something everybody cherishes.  Deputy Lemass said they worked only every other Sunday and that they got £3 for it.  That is incorrect. They get only £2 12s. 6d.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. N. Lemass Mr. N. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>They pay £3 to supervisors.  Surely the Minister can devise some code that will satisfy all interested people.  The Minister has reasoned that on one side you have the employers and employees and that on the other you have the public, and he intimated that no problem existed in relation to the public.  As I understand it, the public do not want these new hours in Dublin.  I should say that the barmen's union and my own are exploiting the possibility of conducting a canvass of barmen, public house proprietors and customers with a view to getting a general opinion on these new hours. Would that type of evidence satisfy the Minister?</P>
      <P>I was pleased to note the Minister indicated he would be prepared to depart from the principle of uniformity if it could be clearly demonstrated it was necessary to do so.  It is our intention to set about procuring that evidence, not with a view to scoring off anybody but with a view to satisfying the Minister that so far as Dublin is concerned there is not a demand for the 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. opening.  I have already referred to the representations made to the Minister. While the union representatives said they wanted the hours left as they were, if that cannot be done I believe they would accept the hours of 7 p.m. to 10 p.m.  I would ask the Minister not to impose the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on the employers, employees and consumers in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1138" /> Deputy Corry admonished us for making submissions on behalf of Dublin.  He referred to restaurants being open until 1 a.m.  That shows he spends little time in Dublin.  Few restaurants are open until 1 a.m.  A couple are open until much later, but they are not desirable establishments and I do not imagine Deputy Corry would be found in them.

      <P>If this section is passed, it means that the hotel bars will remain open until 11 p.m.  There will be the &ldquo;spread over&rdquo; I have already referred to.  I have not mentioned the time that must be spent preparing for opening and clearing up after the closing hour.  I hold that this is requiring people to work an impossibly long day. Most workers have their Sunday off and many of them have Saturday as well.  Under this Bill people employed in bars in Dublin will have to confine themselves to the bar every Sunday and simply wonder what is happening to their wives and families at home.  They cannot have Sundays off for the simple reason that staff are not available.  If Deputy Lemass produces his apprentices, they may be available in five years' time.  It is possible to verify they are not available at present.  I propose producing such verification and, by the Report Stage, the Minister may be in a position to do something about it.</P>

      <P>Last night, Deputies got an invitation and a challenge. There was an invitation from the Minister to discuss this Bill with all its various problems and difficulties and, if possible, present for his consideration the means of dealing with the various difficulties and ensure that the cure is not worse than the disease. One of the leading Opposition speakers challenged the Deputies on these <Col N="1139" /> benches to get up, one after the other, and show there was no demand for 4 p.m. opening on Sunday.  Both the invitation and the challenge can be dealt with together.</P>
      <P>First, we ought to remember we are legislating for a self-respecting people, trying to cater for their various interests and the ways in which they spend their leisure.  It has been said that some people break and evade the law and that we are legislating for them.  But the prohibitions imposed by the general interests of the country should be sufficient to deal with those who behave in that way.</P>
      <P>It has been admitted by all that the Act of 1960 was generally accepted, but with a few reservations.  One was that there was some difficulty in the rural areas on Sunday mornings, but the Minister has dealt with that neatly and adequately.  The other concerned a later opening on Sunday evenings, mainly to suit the rural population. I agree with the Minister's reservations concerning Cork and Dublin.  Those engaged in this trade, so important for both town and country, have failed to bring up a suggestion that would be satisfactory to everybody concerned. Consequently, our problem is to decide what is best in the general interest.</P>
      <P>So far as Sunday opening is concerned, there has been a request from various villages and isolated public houses on the main roads to the seaside and holiday resorts for a 4 p.m. opening.  The reason for this is simply stated.  An opening hour of 5 p.m. would be too near tea time, and tourists and others on the road would not stop.  But tourists like the atmosphere of rural public houses and like to stop and have a chat, perhaps, with the local people.  That is one case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other case put forward is of much wider implication.  It concerns the big sporting events which take place in the bigger centres on Sundays. When 80,000 or 90,000 people come to Croke Park on a Sunday, not all the restaurants and hotels in Dublin could cater for one-tenth of them. During a big rail strike one summer I, as a very interested party, made a <Col N="1140" /> survey of the attendances at these games.  If it is a hurling match, of the 90,000 who attend 30,000 will be from Dublin city and environs, and if it is a football match, from 35,000 to 40,000 will be from Dublin city and environs.  But the remainder will come from various parts of the country. They have to start off early in the morning after Mass and often find no catering available on the trains.  They leave in the evening after the match with a long journey facing them.  Were it not for the fact that many of them bring some food with them, and have facilities in the public houses for an hour or so before their train leaves, they would not be catered for from early morning until they returned late at night to the outlying counties. Consequently, the opening hours should in some measure suit those people.</P>
    <P>Matches generally finish at 5 o'clock in the summer time, but in the winter time in order that the players and spectators may follow the ball&mdash;and particularly the hurling ball&mdash;matches have to be played earlier.  They start at 3 o'clock or a little before, and end at about 4 o'clock.  There is the problem during the autumn, winter and spring of the 4 o'clock opening.  The answer is that these people must be catered for because, after all, a few thousand people would attend at a local championship match, and a match in Thurles or Limerick attended by 50,000 or 60,000 people is as important to the local people as are the bigger games in the bigger centres.  If we wish to cater for those people the 4 o'clock opening is certainly necessary and advisable.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that Cork does not want the 4 o'clock opening in the summer.  Perhaps, Dublin is the same.  I cannot speak for Dublin.  The point is that if we are to accept the principle of uniformity as the real basis for this Bill, how can we get away from those considerations without making special provision for them? The making of special provision for special occasions has been mentioned. It is undesirable that they should be made general.  I have had experience in the past of occasions when applications <Col N="1141" /> of this kind were made and the decisions were very varied.  The hours in many cases led to abuses of various kinds.</P>
    <P>It is far better to have uniformity. Usually, the people who go to these big venues and fixtures must get their train at 6 o'clock and there is no abuse, but they require some facilities at any rate.  They travel long journeys.  They are attracted to their native pastimes and sports, and it is only right that their interests should be catered for in some way.  Many of them, of course, have cars and can quite easily go to a nearby town if the town they are in is over-crowded, but the people who cannot afford cars have to travel by train.  They are numerous and their interests must be considered too.</P>
    <P>It is not for the purpose of drinking that they go into these establishments. They go in for a little refreshment, to discuss the affairs of the day and coming events.  A sporting friend of mine, Slieve Rua, who is known to some people in the House, used to say that they go in for a drop of conversation water and to talk about who played well, the events of the day, and the prospects for the future.  It is not for the purpose of taking a drink as such that these facilities are provided.</P>

      <P>Yes, but it is a well-known fact that in introducing the Bill the Minister said it was for a trial period of a year or two and could then be reviewed to see where it was falling down.  That is what we are now doing. There is nothing inconsistent in my attitude either then or now.  I am raising the question of the 4 o'clock opening because representations have been made to me.</P>
      <P>Members of the House have spoken again and again on the various aspects of the case and there is no need to stress them any further.  There are certain fundamentals to be done.  In my judgment the Minister has gone a long way towards solving the difficulties that have arisen.  I am with him to the fullest extent in what he proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that all these discussions arise from the mistaken approach of the Government to the question of uniformity.  I believe the efforts being made to impose uniformity are causing all these difficulties because when we try to bring in a Bill based on the principle of uniformity we immediately find ourselves in a position where exemptions, exceptions and alterations are required to suit local needs.  That is why I consider the Government are making a very great mistake in trying to impose uniformity instead of bringing in legislation which is flexible to the needs of the particular time, the particular day and the particular occasion.</P>
      <P>It would be quite possible for the Minister to bring in a Bill making provision for flexible arrangements in relation to hours in the various areas. The Minister himself on one occasion said that there is nothing divine about the principle of uniformity.  He should pay greater attention to that expression of his own.  If he approached the Bill and the various problems which will arise from whatever hours are finally determined, having examined those words and tried to follow them, he would be doing a better day's work for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can now see that it was a mistake, in the opinion of many people, to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> trade.  Quite <Col N="1143" /> a number of decent publicans, particularly in the vicinity of Dublin, were ruined in their business by the 1960 Act.  Not alone that, but the people who tried to enjoy the facilities made available by these publicans were deprived of these facilities.  Business premises were left worthless with their turnover down to less than one-sixth in some cases.  Efforts have been made to remedy that but these people had to face that situation.  At that time, the question was raised as to whether they should be compensated when legislation was introduced which had the effect of putting them out of business. Under the Transport Act, arrangements were made to compensate certain traders whose business was ruined by that Act.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that uniformity is really the cause of the problem in this discussion, we have two different areas to consider, the county boroughs and the areas outside them.  The Minister has tried to produce some special legislation in respect of county boroughs. Generally speaking, hours that will suit the city will not suit rural areas and that must be considered. If we could introduce a flexible type of legislation to deal with the question of opening in any area with regard to special functions there, whether festivals or football matches, I believe it would meet the situation more effectively. That could be done through special area exemption orders obtained through the courts.  Providing by legislation hours which will apply all round is a mistake.  One aspect of this problem is to provide hours for all-the-year round operation and the other is to consider legislation for special occasions.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacCarthy mentioned football matches but we do not have 35,000 people from in or around Dublin every Sunday at football matches and the balance of 60,000 coming in from other areas.  If we do not have them, why put in hours in legislation which will apply every Sunday?  Can we not have a flexible arrangement leaving hours to be determined by the court? We can rely on them to be fair, to decide whether the occasion justifies a special exemption.  If that were done, <Col N="1144" /> we would not have the proposal to have hours from 4 to 10 p.m. whether in the depth of winter or the middle of summer every week for the 52 weeks of the year.  Normal opening hours on Sunday could be from 6 to 10 p.m. or 7 to 10 p.m. and when we have these football matches with extra thousands coming into the city, we could go to the court for a special exemption and rely on the courts to provide the hours they consider fair both to the visitors and those giving the service to them.  It is foolish to legislate for 52 Sundays in the year on the basis of opening at 4 o'clock in the afternoon just because the case has been made that people at a football match require a drink before they start for home.  I hope the Minister will consider that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a situation in which the public house must be open from 4 to 10 p.m. in the city, with a tea-break of one-and-a-half hours, we must envisage the price of drink going up.  Deputy Mullen mentioned that a barman gets about £2 10s. for coming in on a Sunday afternoon when he is entitled to be off.  The consumer must pay for that.  Obviously, the publican must collect it and he has to put up the price in order to do so.  The supervisor, apparently, gets between £3 and £4 and somebody has to find his wages and again it is the consumer who will have to put up that money.  The publican would be foolish not to recover it from those for whom the service is provided. Obviously, if these hours are imposed in the county boroughs, the price of drink must go up immediately that service begins to operate.</P>
    <P>The proposal here is to have seven-and-a-half hours drinking on Sundays. Instead of calling it the Sabbath day, I think we shall have to call it the drinking day, because, in addition to the seven-and-a-half hours opening, the workers must come in for an hour beforehand to prepare the premises and they must stay an hour afterwards to clean up the premises and get ready for the next day.  It is a terrible prospect to think of licensed premises being open for seven-and-a-half hours on a Sunday instead of having the opening time in accordance with the <Col N="1145" /> requirements of the situation existing on any particular Sunday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest, first of all, that there should be a special exemption for a special occasion where a large number of persons are brought into the town.  Secondly, the exemption for holiday resorts must be considered and, as has been mentioned earlier, that consideration applies only to a few Sundays of the year.  There are only a few Sundays when Malahide is crowded.  The Minister is familiar with the situation there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnRooney" hpid="Mr. Rooney Mr. Rooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one day. That is where the special exemption comes in.  Otherwise, I think it is only in July and August that big crowds are there.  I doubt if it happens in June.  This is one of the nearest seaside resorts to Dublin.  The best part of 5,000 or 10,000 people go by bus and bicycle and train to Portmarnock from the city on a very fine Sunday. That happens mainly on Sundays. You will scarcely get a crowd of that size there even on a fine Saturday afternoon.  That does not happen on 52 Sundays in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case I am making to the Minister is that he does not want uniformity of hours from 4 to 10 p.m. for 52 Sundays in the year.  The Minister has asked me to state my view.  I consider that there could be uniform hours, from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. or 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., for 52 Sundays of the year and special exemptions for the couple of Sundays on which there would be crowds of people in any area such as Malahide, which the Minister has mentioned, or Dublin city.  The case I am making is that opening hours of from 4 p.m. to <Col N="1146" /> 10 p.m. on 52 Sundays of the year would not be justified.</P>
    <P>The question was raised of having an hour's closing in the course of the afternoon.  It is a very great mistake to depart from the principle of having a drinking pause from 2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.  It is a very effective arrangement.  The vast majority of people are not interested in being on licensed premises during the hour when they are not supposed to be there&mdash;2.30 p.m. to 3.30 p.m.  Unfortunately for themselves, there are the few who do not want to stop drinking and who want to stay on the premises as long as possible and to get drink by hook or by crook.  That is where the drinking pause comes in.  It should be retained.  At that time, those who have been in the public house for a drink can go home for lunch and have a chat with their families, perhaps, for once in the week, and discuss domestic affairs and other matters.  They can have tea at home and go out for some refreshment and a chat in the &ldquo;local&rdquo; after 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.</P>
    <P>I agree with the suggestion that has been made during the course of the debate that, normally speaking, even on weekdays, it is only in the last couple of hours or last 90 minutes that a large number of people are to be found in licensed premises.  A football match could be played in some of the large public houses most of the time but at a certain hour convenient to the consumers large numbers go in and have their drinks and their chat before closing time.</P>
    <P>A Deputy yesterday evening referred to the fact that people stand outside public houses and do not go in until half an hour before closing time.  That is quite true.  It is a tradition in many places.  There are people who like a drink but who are not interested in being on licensed premises except for the purpose of having a drink before retiring for the night.  Although the public house is open all the time, they do not go in until 10 p.m.</P>
    <P>There is another suggestion which I want to make, in fairness to the consumers.  Instead of the price of drink being increased all the year round in order to cover the extra cost <Col N="1147" /> of providing service on Sundays, I would suggest that publicans should be allowed to charge an extra price for that service rather than charge an extra price to people who are not interested in drinking during the Sunday hours of opening but who do require a drink on occasions during the week.  I do not think it is right to ask the weekday consumer to pay for the extra expense devolving on publicans in providing staff to cater for consumers between the hours of 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The main point I wish to make to the Minister is in regard to uniformity. The case has been made by many speakers that uniformity is not suitable, for many reasons.  Uniformity will involve an increase in the price of drink; it will upset the normal staff arrangements; the publican must demand services of staff who normally should be on a day's leave.  He must engage them in order to ensure that his business will be preserved and carried on; he must provide service for the public.  In order to meet the expense involved, publicans will be compelled to consider putting up their prices.</P>
    <P>The question of the tea break was mentioned by Deputy Mullen who knows the problem very well.  The tea break is the real problem so far as Sunday opening is concerned.  The tea break could be catered for if we had a system whereby special exemptions could be available in areas where it is considered desirable and necessary to have public houses open at an hour before, say, 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.</P>
    <P>One Deputy made a statement which should not be allowed to pass.  He said restaurants which are open until 12 midnight or 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. are undesirable places.  It is wrong to say that.  There are very desirable places in the city of Dublin, which provide good service, which are run very properly and well, which remain open until 12 midnight or 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. They cater for very few people, for instance, those who are enjoying some special occasion.  They are not places to which people go regularly.  It should not be stated in this House that any restaurant owner who keeps his <Col N="1148" /> premises open until 12 midnight, 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. is running an undesirable business.  Dublin is the capital city and visitors could take a poor view if they found it was not possible to get a bite to eat in this city after 12 midnight. Most restaurants in the city close at 10 p.m.  There are a number of restaurants in the city which cater for those who want to have a meal after 10 p.m.  They should not be described as undesirable places because they provide this amenity.</P>
    <P>Having heard the views expressed by Deputies, I hope the Minister will reconsider the hours of opening proposed for Sunday.  It would be a great mistake to provide for a 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. opening.  It was suggested that an application for a special exemption would require the approval of the majority of the licence holders in an area.  That would be a very good idea. The majority of licence holders in any area would know what service was required for any particular occasion and their views should be sought when application is made to the court for an exemption.  I would certainly rely on the courts to interpret the needs of the consumer in any area at any particular time of the year.  That is the right way to do it, instead of having fixed hours for the 52 Sundays in the year which will cause many of the difficulties which have been mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening, having listened to Deputy Burke from County Dublin, I completely reversed the first views I expressed on amendment No. 4.  However, today having listened to the two Fine Gael Deputies from County Dublin, I am afraid they have not only been contradictory in their speeches but they apparently are not aware of the situation in County Dublin at all.  Deputy Rooney, in 1960 as well as on this occasion, said that the situation that existed before the 1960 Bill in relation to Sundays was more desirable than the situation that exists now.  The situation that existed before 1960 was that when the public houses opened, they stayed open all the afternoon and on top of that, particularly in places like Malahide, Donabate and Skerries which the Deputy represents, there was a demand <Col N="1149" /> for later closing on Sunday.  I think that 10 o'clock closing is generally accepted here and the only point at issue is the opening hour.  If the Deputies from County Dublin are consistent about the differentials they mentioned both in 1960 and on this occasion, they want the public houses open all day on Sunday.</P>
      <P>I stood up to deal particularly with one point.  I am on the branch committee of a trade union that is affiliated to Congress and therefore I am particularly interested in the trade union attitude to the various provisions in this Bill.  I listened with great interest to Deputy Mullen and other Labour Deputies and I have now come to the conclusion that in speaking here they are misrepresenting entirely the situation so far as barmen are concerned. On the Second Stage of this Bill, Deputy Corish, the Leader of the Labour Party, at column 1640, Volume 195, No. 12, of the Official Report of the 29th May, 1962, quoted a resolution passed by the Irish National Vintners', Grocers' and Allied Trades' Assistants which read as follows:</P>
      <P>That we, the Executive Committee of the Irish National Union of Vintners', Grocers', and Allied Trades' Assistants, view with alarm the proposed extension of hours under the new Intoxicating Liquor Bill to be introduced in the National Legislature next month, and we call upon the Labour Party to oppose strenuously any extensions which would tend to impose hardships and slavish conditions on the workers engaged in the trade.</P>
      <P>I am afraid that Executive are not aware of the protection which their members have and which is laid down already by legislation passed in this House.  I should like to quote the former Minister for Justice, who said at column 945, volume 177, of the Official Report of 11th November, 1959:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade unions have been stressing the hardship on the barmen and porters which later working hours would entail.  But the conditions of employment for barmen are already safeguarded by the Shop <Col N="1150" /> (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938 and these safeguards would apply just as much when licensed premises keep open for a 70-hour week as in the case of an 80-hour week.  Under the 1938 Act, barmen may not be required to work for longer than 11 hours in any day or for longer than 48 hours in any week &mdash; 56 hours, including overtime.  The employment of persons under 18 years of age between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. is prohibited.  Barmen may not be required to work for more than six hours without a meal interval.  There are provisions for annual holidays and for compensatory leave for work on half holidays or Sundays.</P>
    <P>If there has been any change in that situation, I am quite sure it is to the betterment of the conditions of the barmen.  That Act of 1938 protects the barmen and if the public house were open 24 hours a day, it would not mean half an hour's extra work for the men employed in the public houses. That puts paid to the political slant the Fine Gael Party are trying to put on this.  They say that prices will go up if this Bill is implemented.  That is all nonsense.  Furthermore, we have been sent here a memorandum by the Irish County Vintners' Association demonstrating the way they can buy up licences without increasing the price of drink.  It is a well-known fact that the gross profit in the licensed trade is higher than it has been at any time before.  Perhaps we in this Party made a mistake when we decontrolled the price of drink.  I do not think we did.</P>
    <P>I believe we should try to do away with as much restriction as possible and it is with that in mind that I changed my view on amendment No. 4.  The more we restrict, the more we leave the matter open to abuse. In 1960, Fine Gael put down a similar amendment to amendment No. 8 in the name of Deputy O'Higgins.  The best they could do on 29th March, 1960, when that amendment was put to a division, was to get the support of 18 Deputies.  I doubt if they will do much better on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I come back to Deputy Rooney.  He <Col N="1151" /> considers that extra hours are required for two months in the year, that for St. Patrick's Day and such other days special exemptions should be granted. But the Fine Gael attitude was quite different in 1960.  It was propounded by Deputy O'Donnell who put forward the same view here last night.  I quote what he said at column 998, Volume 180, of the Official Report of 23rd March, 1960:</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Palmer's amendment which is to extend the late opening during the months of June, July and August for the period of Summer Time.</P>
    <P>He went on to speak about the may-fly, hunting in the autumn, and so on. Let us have a little consistency about this.  I am sorry Deputy Mullen has gone out of the House because, having studied the actual protection that has been laid down by this House, I am now convinced that the arguments of the Labour Party are dishonest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to this debate from the commencement and to the Minister's speech.  Just as he said he was not convinced, I am not convinced. I am not concerned with what some organised body says because the organised body's policy is decided and dictated by a few people at the top and the other fellows have to say &ldquo;Aye&rdquo;.  I am more concerned with what the individual thinks and what I conclude in my own heart is best for the individual.  We are told, for instance, that the organised bodies want the hours 7 to 10 o'clock.  I am satisfied that the Minister would not accept that I am trving to be a realist and to nail the Minister down to some differential of an hour or an hour and a half.  He favours uniformity as against a differential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had a good case for that where the closing hours at night are concerned because of the dangers inherent in a differential then.  When there was a differential we had regular tours of the <i>bona fide</i> premises.  Many of these premises were patronised by objectionable types of women.  I do not say that all the women who frequented them were objectionable, but there <Col N="1152" /> were women to whom exception could be taken.  These women picked up men in these premises, as often as not both of them being drunk.  That immorality was there when the differential existed.</P>
    <P>Now that the <i>bona fide</i> public houses have been done away with there are really no good grounds for uniformity in the opening hours.  We have uniformity in the closing hours.  That is all to the good.  Where the opening hours are concerned, people are not in a mood for revelry at three or four o'clock in the afternoon.  If the public houses opened at four in the rural areas and at five-thirty in the city there could be no abuses.  Only a very small percentage might journey to the rural areas to start drinking at four o'clock in the afternoon.</P>

      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that Deputy Seán Dunne, who represents the County Dublin publicans, has framed his amendments exclusively in their interest; he is very keen to get this differential because he knows it would mean there would not be such a great influx as the Deputy says.</P>

      <P>What harm could evolve from the nearness of these seaside resorts?  Would it not be a good thing if thousands of people went out to the seaside for a breath of fresh air? What special problem would that create?  No harm could be done, even from the moral aspect.  Remember the cinemas are filled to capacity on Sunday afternoon, even in the suburbs; the cinemas do not close until five-thirty. Matches are not over until five o'clock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no risk in a differential as far as opening is concerned. The reason why I differ from the Fine Gael Party in relation to 5 p.m. or 5.30 p.m. opening is because there are 4,000 or 5,000 people employed one way or another in Dublin <Col N="1153" /> public houses.  On my way here this morning, an elderly man, a grocer's porter, jumped off his bicycle and told me that his son had heard what I am advocating; he said he was delighted because he would now be able to take his children out on Sunday afternoon.  This argument about the thousands for which public houses are sold does not hold water since it applies to only about five per cent. of them.  There are hundreds of little public houses run by families. The convenience of these people must be considered.  It is no answer to say they need not open.  Competition will compel them to open.  Self-preservation will dictate their opening.  I made the case for 5.30 p.m. opening because that would give some three-and-a-half hours to these thousands of people to go to a cinema, attend a football match, and get home in good time to open.</P>

      <P>I do not think there should be a time lag during which people would have to stall for 15 or 20 minutes before they could get a drink.  That is why I am against 6 p.m. opening.  What organisations and Parties say is something dictated from the top.  The proof of that is the statement made by Deputy Dillon this morning when he said that, despite any differences they may have outside the House, when they come into the House they support the majority view.  That is an admission that some people say things they do not really mean here.  I do not mind what organisations say.  I am speaking for everyone. I know what the people of Dublin want.  They do not want 4 o'clock opening on Sunday.  A break of two hours is useless; all one can do in the time is have one's dinner, take a quick look at the paper, and have a smoke.  One cannot go out anywhere. I see no risk in opening at 5.30 p.m. in Dublin and at 4 p.m. in the rural areas.  The Minister should think it <Col N="1154" /> over between this and the Report Stage.  He knows now that no one in Dublin wants 4 p.m. opening.  If he has a talk privately with his own Party members they will tell him that Dublin does not want 4 p.m. opening.</P>

      <P>The theory was that if you had extended hours it would interfere with industry.  The most industrialised <Col N="1160" /> people in the world are the Danes and they are very much alive to what the tourist industry means to them.  They are out to catch the British tourist and the tourists from other countries and they are catering for them from 9 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock the following morning. The same can be said for the United States which is also a highly industrialised country.  There they have 23 hours a day.  I do not advocate such long hours here but I do say that if you close the front door the Irishman will come around to the side door.  If there is not a side door he will go around to the back door but he will get in anyway.  I have heard it said that the extended hours lead to less drinking because the Irish in us makes us &ldquo;agin the law&rdquo; when the doors are closed.</P>
      <P>There is a lot to be said in favour of closing after the 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. period on Sundays.  Some people do not know when to stop drinking.  They will drink while the money lasts and there is a lot to be said for ensuring that a man goes home to the best dinner of the week.  It is galling in the extreme for a housewife to have a fine dinner ready and for the husband not to turn up on Sunday.</P>
      <P>With regard to the extension of hours in the evening, I feel that I can speak for the major tourist centre in this country.</P>

      <P>Question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is beyond question. I speak for Salthill and Galway city when I say that an extension to 10.30 o'clock on Sunday evenings would be fitting.  Seaside resorts have to exist for twelve months on what they can make in three.  They have nine months during which what they take would hardly pay the electric light bill.  They are not keen on winter opening and what you take off them in the winter you can give them in the summer. There is also the question of bad weather in the tourist resorts when the older people have no place to go.  They must stay inside and look out of the windows.  The cinemas are packed and they will not go to dances.  It would be unfair to lock them up and <Col N="1161" /> deprive them of what they feel they are entitled to.</P>
      <P>With regard to drinking in the seaside resorts, it is not the amount of drinking in the hotels that does the harm at all.  The hotels are jealous of their good name.  They will not tolerate drinking to excess.  They feel it is important that their good reputations should be preserved and they will not tolerate anything questionable.  The danger is that you will have bottle parties.  I saw it last year.  They went to the beaches and that is where you will find danger caused by broken bottles and everything else.  You are going to encourage that if you do not meet them on this request.</P>
      <P>I feel that the the extension in the tourist areas is justifiable.  I would even go so far as to say that summer time should start in June.  I would even say that there would be justification for starting it at Easter.  With all the talk there is of extending the tourist season, we should extend the summer drinking time to the beginning of that season.  This would help to a degree.</P>
      <P>A matter to be frowned at is the failure in this Bill to provide for closing of public houses during evening Devotions.  There is a lot to be said for a short close-down during evening Devotions.  This is supposed to be a great Catholic country and something should be provided in our legislation in this respect.  I suggest there is also a case for further extensions of the opening hours in the peak holiday period of July and August.  Business people in seaside resorts have to pay heavy rates and I must say that the people of Salthill in Galway are paying their share, particularly towards the big improvements and renovations there.  They have only three months of the year in which to make their livelihood and they should be given every facility.  We all know that no Bill the Minister could put through the House will please everybody, but one general aspect of this Bill to which I should like to refer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister said this morning that he wanted to ensure the greatest degree of uniformity possible throughout the country.  I do not think he is aiming at that in his provision in respect of the four county boroughs.  He told us that nothing we on this side of the House had said had convinced him.  He should have as much regard for the organised licensed trade of Waterford as he has for Dublin.  He said he must have regard to the views of the well-organised licensed trade in Dublin&mdash;both licensees and barmen&mdash;and I agree with him in that.  But why should he not have the same regard for the well organised body of people in the trade in Waterford.  We had hoped the Minister would meet us on amendments Nos. 8, 12 and 20 in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister again, in those weary watches of this Bill's progress through the House, that I <Col N="1163" /> did not come up here on my own and put my case to him in respect of Waterford.  I brought him a petition signed by 80 per cent. of the licensed trade there asking for a very small concession&mdash;to leave Waterford in with Dublin and Cork in the matter of this midday closing hour.  Conceding that would not have upset the Minister's Bill.  In fact, it would have improved it by making for more uniformity in so far as the county boroughs are concerned.  Of course I have nothing to say for Limerick.  But the Minister took no notice.  I can tell him now that I intend putting in later&mdash;I am told that I can&mdash;an amendment on this question.  My original amendment was defeated, but I can assure the Minister my next one will be differently worded.</P>

      <P>There is no ingenuity. It is as clear as print.  I wish, however, that the Minister would appreciate my ingenuity by saying he is prepared to meet me.  If he did that, he would not see me in this House again till the Bill had gone through.  The Minister is reported as having said he could not meet me on this point because some force or some organisation in Waterford greater than the publicans, who are behind Deputy Kyne and myself, had convinced him not to.  I should like the Minister to say what that force is or what is this organisation that prevailed on him to adopt this attitude.  I do not believe any such representations were made to the Minister from Waterford.  Throughout the morning, I have been inundated with messages and telephone calls from irate people in Waterford.  As I said yesterday, the majority of these people are very staunch supporters of the Minister's Party and it might be good politics for me to say nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated last night I was opposed both to the amendments and the section because in both cases there is an extension of the drinking hours.  Therefore, I want to say now that under no circumstances could I support a section of the Bill providing for such an extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also opposing the section.  Again, it postulates a worsening of conditions for the employees and provides for something that is unnecessary. The present hours provide for opening until 11.30 p.m. from June to September.  It is suggested now that that be changed to Summer Time, and this year Summer Time is from 25th March to 28th October. That would mean that the bar attendants would be called upon to work a long, &ldquo;spread-over&rdquo; duty of 13 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must not forget also that the bus services in Dublin cease at 11.30 p.m. and that would affect not only the employees but the consumers.  In many cases, the consumer drinks in the city centre or in areas, not necessarily the area in which he lives, in which he has become accustomed to <Col N="1165" /> drink.  Consequently, he has to use the bus services.  If the public houses remain open until 11.30 p.m., it will mean the consumers will miss the last bus.  At present, if you go into a public house, you will find that at 11 o'clock or a few minutes afterwards, it is practically empty.  That is because people are chasing the last bus.  The only one who has to remain back is the barman and very often he has nobody to serve.</P>
    <P>There is no use saying this will benefit the tourist.  By that time, most of the tourists have gone to bed or, if they are staying in hotels, they can get their drink there.  It is unnecessary to impose hardship of this kind.  The argument against this is somewhat similar to the case made against the Sunday hours.  I was surprised at the Chair's ruling in connection with the amendments.  I understood each amendment stood on its own.  I do not want to appear to have voted for the hours of 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays&mdash;far from it.  I should also like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that the employers, the employees and the publicans do not want opening to 11.30 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise mainly to put something on record.  I think I misled my colleague, Deputy Mullen, on the last vote.  While I must bow to the rulings of the Chair on the question of arranging how the amendments are taken, I feel there was some slight unfairness in the last vote.  As the vote was taken, I had to vote for 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. openings for the country, tied in with the city opening, although I would definitely, if I had the opportunity, have agreed with my colleague, Deputy Mullen, on a different hour for the city.  Because of the way the vote was taken, Deputy Mullen and I were compelled to vote in a certain way.  It was a choice of whether we should open at 4 o'clock or 5.30 p.m.</P>
      <P>That was the original amendment and tied in with that were the various other amendments.  Deputy Mullen did not want to vote for a 5.30 p.m. opening. He wanted it as it was.  I did not want 5 o'clock or 5.30 p.m. opening in the country.  I was in favour of 4 o'clock but we found ourselves with different ideas and for different reasons in the same Lobby.  I do not think that is a good procedure.  As I say, I am tied by the rules of the House.  The Ceann Comhairle is the judge and we must accept his rulings. I want that on record, not for my sake but for the sake of Deputy Mullen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incidentally, tied in with that, I should like the Minister to know that I, like Deputy Lynch, received a protest from the licensed vintners in Waterford taking exception to the statement he made the day before yesterday, and published in yesterday's papers, implying that a demand to <Col N="1169" /> have the closing hour retained in Waterford did not have the support of the publicans of that city.  I do not know what strength it has but the licensed vintners assured me in that telegram&mdash;as they did Deputy Lynch and possibly Deputy Ormonde&mdash;that they represent 80 per cent. of the licensed trade of the city.  I think the Minister should accept that.</P>
    <P>If he said something that implied&mdash; I did not read his statement&mdash;that that was not correct, I suggest to him that when he is concluding, he should gracefully accept the fact that the licensed vintners of Waterford do represent 80 per cent. of the licensed trade.  I suggest that unless he has proof to the contrary, he should accept that statement by most responsible people in Waterford city.  They are the leading innkeepers of that city. I know them and I am quite sure they would not send me a telegram stating a thing to be true which was not true. I have no personal knowledge of it but I have received a telegram which emanated from those people and I think it must be true.  It would be easy for the Minister to say whether he meant any offence in any shape or form, and I do not believe he did, and make amends by saying that he accepts it as a fact but is not prepared to alter it.</P>
    <P>There is one other point.  As I say, most of what I am saying is for the record.  I spoke only once on the amendment.  I was asked by a colleague of the House, not of my Party, Deputy Dunne, to move an amendment in his name because it coincided with my own views in general.  With the permission of the Minister, it was agreed that I could move it.  Unfortunately, a few visitors came in at an inopportune moment before the <Col N="1170" /> Official Secrets Bill was concluded and I was absent from the House for about five minutes and the amendment went.  It dealt with closing throughout the year at 11.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>I want to say that if I had been here, I would have moved that amendment. I do not intend to argue in its favour now.  The time has gone for that.  I want to put on record the fact that it was unfortunate that I was not here to move the amendment.  I would have used the same arguments as Deputy Mullen used for closing at 11 p.m.  He raised the question of transportation. We have not that problem. In the country, time means a different thing altogether from what it means in Dublin.  Everyone walks, or cycles or has his own transport to the local public house.  In most cases, they walk because it is only a couple of yards away.  It is probably a walk of ten or 15 minutes.  When it is 11.30 p.m., in the country, it is 10.30 p.m. most of the year, because most of rural Ireland does not recognise Summer Time. They just work away.</P>
    <P>I have always advocated that you cannot have licensing legislation to suit the people of Ireland without having a differential in the county boroughs or the urban areas.  They have different problems.  I am willing to agree with the Minister on the Bill as a whole.  I think it is an excellent Bill. It tries to meet most of the people most of the way.  So far as I can see, it suits my own constituency as well as it possibly could.</P>

      <P>It is simply to enable licensed premises to open for unlicensed business at 7.30 a.m. instead of at 9 a.m.  A licensed premises which has a mixed business, that is, which sells both intoxicating liquor and ordinary goods, at the present moment may open at 9 a.m. for the purpose of transacting unlicensed business.  The proposal now is to make it 7.30 a.m. instead of 9 a.m. for unlicensed premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this section as it offers to hotels and restaurants an opportunity of remaining open half an hour after midnight as compared with the present position, all the year round.  The view of the people who are employed in hotels and restaurants, in Dublin, at any rate, is that they do not want to work any longer hours than they are working at the moment. Indeed, they contend that an increase in the hours of working would impose grave hardship on them.  As I have already said, the hours of working proposed would mean that hotels and restaurants would be open for an extra half-hour after midnight on weekdays all the year round and until 11 p.m. on Sundays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> The view of the people concerned, who work in this business, is that their hours should be the same as those for public houses.  The argument is made about the difficulty they will experience in getting home after work.  That would apply not only to bar attendants but to other types of workers.  As we know, in the operation of a hotel, if the bar hands are working other members of the staff are engaged in work in conjunction with the bar.  For instance, porters and washers-up would be working later than usual, beyond the time of the last bus.</P>
    <P>There is no point in suggesting that trade unions and employers could get together to provide compensation for that extra work.  If they were given overtime pay, even double pay, the money would be expended in paying for transport home.</P>
    <P>The suggested hours for hotels and restaurants would impose an extremely long day on workers.  The day is found to be long enough at the moment.  It is considered that if they were asked to work any longer hours they would have to say no in no uncertain terms. Quite recently, they have succeeded in having their hours of work reduced by trade union negotiation and the proposal in the Bill means that the hours of work would be lengthened by Government legislation.</P>
    <P>One noticeable feature is the absence of reference in the Bill to treatment of operatives.  If it were proposed in the Bill that a worker who was obliged to work these hours should be treated in a certain fashion, should get so much time off, should get so much pay, that, perhaps, would be worthy of consideration. There is no such provision and we are inclined to think that the worker is taken for granted.</P>
    <P>I should also like to point out that not every hotel or restaurant worker is organised.  The hotel and restaurant workers who are not organised have nobody to act and make representations on their behalf.  That applies to Dublin as well as to other parts of the country.  There is a considerable number of establishments in Dublin the workers in which are not organised. That being so, these people would be thrown to the wolves.  That is the main <Col N="1174" /> reason why we object to this section.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the length of time hotels would be open after the closing of public houses would be increased as compared with the present position.  If my reading of the section is correct, the existing position is that hotels can serve drink for one hour after the closing time for public houses.  This section suggests that hotels could serve drink for an hour and a half after the closing time for public houses.</P>
    <P>What kind of people are we catering for in that regard?  Who are they? What is the demand for that extension? If they are tourists, whether from Ireland or from outside Ireland, if they are staying in a hotel they can get a drink and it is not necessary to keep the bar open so that they can get a drink.  Then we must say to ourselves that they are people who come from the public houses, who go elsewhere for a drink when the public house closes.  These are the kind of people we were concerned about when we were attempting to abolish the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  These are the people who seek an opportunity to go into a hotel or restaurant late at night until 12.30 a.m.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I have accepted generally the recommendations made to me by the Food Advisory Committee regarding the presence of preservatives and colouring matters in food intended for human consumption, and draft regulations had been prepared to give effect to this decision.  Before submitting them to the other Government Departments <Col N="1175" /> concerned and the National Health Council, the draft regulations had to be further examined as some doubts arose as to the legal authority for the implementation of some of the recommendations of the Committee.  These matters have now been disposed of and amended draft regulations are being prepared, which, at the request of the Food Advisory Committee, will be submitted to that Committee for its further consideration.  In the meantime the earlier regulations remain in operation.</P>

      <P>The latest information available in respect of populations of dispensary districts is that extracted in connection with the 1956 <Col N="1176" /> Census and is contained in Table No. 10 of the Volume in relation to that Census presented to the Oireachtas and Presentation No. 3983.  The boundaries of a small number of these dispensary districts have been changed since 1956.  The corresponding figures obtained in the 1961 Census are not yet available.</P>
      <P>The Table mentioned also shows the area of each Dispensary District as it was on the 1956 Census date.</P>
      <P>While the total number of persons covered by medical cards in each Dispensary District at the end of October last is available in my Department, information as to the number of issued medical cards in each district is not available.  I propose to ask health authorities to indicate the number of medical cards current on the most recent convenient date in each district and the total number of persons covered by these cards.  When that information has been obtained, I shall have it tabulated, along with the best available information as to population and areas, and will forward it to the Deputy and also to the Select Committee on the Health Services.  The Deputy will appreciate that this table will take some time to prepare as there are over 600 Dispensary Districts in the country.</P>

In regard to the second part, disagreement has been recorded on the claim by the General Council under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the civil service; the claim has now become referable to the Arbitration Board and further action is a matter for the association.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance, further to a reply of 7th June with regard to an official guide or list of the national monuments under the care of the Office of Public Works, at what date the official guide referred to by him went out of print: at what date the officers of the National Monuments Branch began the preparation of the up-to-date guide referred to by him; at what date <Col N="1179" /> approval in principle for the publication of this guide was given by his Department; at what date Bord Fáilte made their offer to contribute to the cost of publication; and at what approximate date does he expect that the guide will be actually published.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Dr. Hillery) (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>The guide referred to by the Deputy has been out of print since 1953.  The preparation of an up-to-date and more attractive guide was begun in 1952 and proceeded intermittently as opportunity offered, having regard to the pressing demands on the time of limited staff available.  Approval in principle to publication of the guide was given by the Department of Finance on 26th April, 1962.  Bord Fáilte agreed in December, 1960 to contribute towards the cost, and the text of the guide has been settled in consultation with them.  Arrangements are being made with the Stationery Office for publication.  I cannot say precisely when it will be published, but it will be available before the next tourist season.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether, following the unfavourable comment made by Mr. Krishna Menon at the United Nations Security Council on 22nd June on Ireland's action in putting a resolution on the Kashmir dispute, he has received any other representations on the matter from the Indian Government; and if he will outline Ireland's policy in putting this resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>The comment referred to by the Deputy in the first part of his question was contained in the concluding Indian speech of the debate at the <Col N="1180" /> Security Council on the question of Kashmir.  The vote upon the matter followed almost immediately.</P>
      <P>In answer to the second part of the Deputy's question I may say that when the India-Pakistan question was put on the agenda of the Security Council it soon became very clear that the majority of members favoured the tabling and passing of a Resolution which would mark their deep concern at the continuation of the dispute, and strongly urge both parties to enter into negotiations at once in order to arrive at a peaceful settlement.</P>
      <P>All the non-permanent members of the Security Council, with the exception of Rumania, entered upon discussions with a view to drafting an appropriate resolution.  The Resolution which we finally tabled attracted only two negative votes out of eleven. In our opinion it went as far as possible to meet the preoccupations of India and Pakistan while fulfilling the duties and responsibilities imposed by the Charter upon members of the Security Council.</P>
      <P>The speeches made by our Permanent Representative in the debates on the matter last week and the text of our resolution will be found in the Dáil Library.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As shown in the Company's accounts full depreciation on the fleet of Irish Shipping Ltd. for the eleven months ended 31st March, 1962 was £691,472.  This compares with the figure of £491,472 shown in the Profit and Loss Appropriation Account for the same period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite well aware of those figures.  In the course of the comments made by the representative of the Minister for Finance who attended and spoke at that meeting, he referred to the different appearance that would be presented by the accounts, if the normal year's depreciation were provided by the company. I want to know what is a normal year's depreciation within the meaning of those words which presumably had some informed meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>A normal year's depreciation is the depreciation declared by the company on each vessel for which in respect of all the days in the year on which it made voyages its profit or loss is calculated.  The depreciation of the vessel for that voyage is included in the account and the total of all the voyages and of the depreciations arising therefrom, after calculating the profit or loss, are added together for the full year and worked out on a percentage basis in relation to the life of the ship.  That is the full year's depreciation.  I cannot explain it to the Deputy any more clearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's endeavour to clarify this matter. I understand there has been established <Col N="1184" /> through centuries of experience a regular percentage of depreciation appropriate to a merchant fleet and that figure must be known to Irish Shipping, and every other shipping company in the world.  Whether it is ten per cent., or 15 per cent., or 20 per cent.  I do not know.  What I want to find out is what the figure is.  Is it five per cent., or two per cent., or ten per cent, or what is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage in most cases is five per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not want to make this discussion more complicated than it need be, but Irish Shipping work out the depreciation on the basis of a separate valuation for each ship, and in relation to its voyages during the year, and then the totals are added together.  There is no one figure applied to the whole fleet.  There is a separate figure calculated for each ship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us then the capital value of the fleet so that we may compare, for our own information, the difference between depreciation calculated in the customary way and the depreciation provided as a result of the special calculations made by Irish Shipping?</P>

      <P>A proposal by Mayo County Council to raise a loan of £55,000 to finance an extension of the Council's machinery yard, including the erection of new buildings, stores, workshops, etc., was received in the Department on 13 June, 1961.  After detailed consideration of the financial and engineering aspects of the proposal, the Council were requested to consider a modified and less costly scheme which would cater for actual and immediately prospective needs, and be capable of future extension, if needed.  The Council's further views and proposals are now awaited.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary)</i> asked the Minister for Justice the number of dance halls licensed for dancing in the Republic, (b)  the number of such dance halls which secured special permission for the sale of intoxicating liquor on at least one occasion during dancing hours in the last available year, and (c)  the number of special exemptions given to dance halls for the sale of intoxicating liquor during dances in the last available year.</P>

      <P>Figures have not been compiled on the lines set out in the Question and, while it would be possible to obtain them by special enquiries throughout the country, the compilation would take some weeks and, since I assume that the information is sought in connection with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, it may be preferable if I give the information that is already available and that gives the general picture.</P>
      <P>First of all, may I refer to the figures given, in a tabular statement, in a reply by my predecessor on 18th May, 1961.  From that table and some later figures obtained by my Department, the following may be taken to be a broadly accurate picture of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 1,200 premises licensed for public dancing in the State, not including places in respect of which a temporary licence valid for a period of up to a month may be granted.  The total number of Occasional Licences granted for dances runs from about 1,000 to 1,300 in a year, of which roughly two-thirds would be in respect of dances in dancehalls, the remainder being in respect of dances held under a temporary dance <Col N="1207" /> licence.  It will be seen that on the average this works out at about two such licences each year for every three dance halls.  Generally, such a licence covers only one dance.</P>
    <P>However, the average figure alone would be misleading.  In recent years some dance halls have been getting one or even two Occasional Licences each week-end for ordinary &ldquo;house&rdquo; dances, whereas others seldom seek one.  The position as it was two years or so ago was that the number of dance halls that got Occasional Licences as frequently, or even nearly as frequently, as this did not exceed half a dozen in the whole State and the total number of Occasional Licences granted for &ldquo;house&rdquo; dances to these and other dance halls was of the order of 400 per year.  The latest figures show an increase of 50 per cent.  on that figure, largely accounted for by doubling or more of the number of halls that have been applying for and getting those licences regularly.</P>
    <P>I have no specific figures about Special Exemption Orders over and above those given in the reply of 4th May, 1961.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of registered clubs is approximately 270. A club may obtain not more than 12 extensions in the year by application to the Court but, except as authorised by such an extension on a particular occasion, no club is entitled to serve drink outside the ordinary licensing laws.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Registered clubs do <Col N="1208" /> not require any special authorisation to run dances or other social functions for the members and their friends and accordingly no statistics on these matters are available.  I assume, however, that the great majority of such clubs have some social functions on their premises from time to time, but they are not entitled to serve drinks, either at such functions or otherwise, to anybody other than a member or a <i>bona fide</i> private guest of a member.</P>
      <P>There is no record, either, as to whether any club happens to have a premises licensed for public dancing and I do not think that the making of special enquiries in the matter would be justified, not merely because it seems to be extremely probable that there are very few if any such premises but because, in any event, such a club, if it existed, would not be entitled to serve drink to the patrons generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the evidence to which the Deputy refers. The object of setting up the Ground Rents Commission was to provide an opportunity for the various interests concerned, either as ground landlords or tenants, to put forward their views and to enable the commission to reach an informed conclusion on the ground rent problem.  Landlords and tenants have full access to the Commission for the purpose of commenting on or rebutting any allegations made in evidence given before it.  It is established practice that commissions of this kind are left free to regulate the procedure to be followed in investigating the matters referred to them and I see no reason for departing from that practice in the present case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking before Question Time who were the people for whom it is necessary to provide these hours of drinking.  I submit it is not the ordinary hotel residents.  The ordinary drinker in hotels or restaurant bars is the kind of person who usually has gone home before the present hours of closing.  They are not looking for longer sessions.  This can well be described as class legislation introduced to afford people who have more money than brains opportunities to drink after the normal times.  It is introduced to afford facilities to the well-heeled gentlemen who were usually well-oiled and who caused all the trouble and difficulty that was complained of when we were trying to get rid of the <i>bona fide</i> traffic.  Why should this be done to facilitate such a set of people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is a case where we are departing from the principle of uniformity. We are increasing the hours now being allowed for this kind of drinking.  At present it is an hour after the public houses close.  Now it is suggested that it be extended to an hour and a half after that.  I am thinking of the employee who has to put up with these people who come in well lit up and cause trouble.  He has no protection <Col N="1212" /> against them.  The hotel employers were reluctant to implement the present Liquor Act.  They did not want it; the employees did not want it and there was no great demand for it from the regular customers.  The Act was in existance for some months before it was availed of, and in some hotels and restaurants even up to the present they do not operate the hours allowed under the present Act.  I hold that the hotels should not be allowed to open for any longer than at present.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there are very few licensed restaurants in this country.  In Dublin they are so few that you could count them on the fingers of one hand, so where is the demand for these extra hours?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>What is mainly concerned in this section is an extension of half an hour.  At the present time hotels, licensed restaurants, restaurants with wine licences or with the limited restaurant certificate, that is the new type of restaurant created by the 1960 Act, can all serve drink up to 12 o'clock at night with a meal all the year round.  The simple proposal in the Bill is to extend that time to 12.30 a.m.  I do not think that will create any real problems for anybody.  It can solve a very large number of problems and difficulties for the members of Deputy Mullen's own union and they have said as much to me.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the proposals were published, the waiters in one of the more prominent city hotels where I was having lunch came over to me and said how grateful they were for these proposals.  They indicated to me that, when serving meals up to 12 o'clock, it was difficult to have the tables cleared and drinks removed on the dot of 12 o'clock.  That indicates this half-hour will make all the difference from their point of view.  It will enable them to keep everybody satisfied and at the same time obey the law as it should be obeyed.</P>

      <P>Just one point on this matter.  This is an amendment of section 13 of the Act of 1927. Section 14 of the same Act makes provision for certain circumstances where Section 13 will not apply and it lays down certain paragraphs from (a) to (e) inclusive.  Among the provisions are that drink be served with a substantial meal to residents but there is no provision whereby a resident in a hotel may have a drink after hours.  I should like the Minister seriously to consider putting down a short amendment for Report Stage, possibly to add a subsection to Section 14 of the 1927 Act in terms something like this:</P>
      <P>The sale of intoxicating liquor to a person who is for the time being a <i>bona fide</i> resident of a hotel at any hour.</P>
      <P>I suggest this because I think there have been two successful prosecutions against residents in hotels who were found drinking in their own hotels outside the prescribed hours.  The most recent case was published in the <i>Evening Herald</i> of Friday, May, 18th, 1962.  Justice Johnson dismissed the summonses on the merits against the licensee and against four people found on the premises.  It is reported that Garda Moloney visited the hotel at 10.56 p.m. on Good Friday and found a group of people around a fire.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 6 to 22, to delete subsection (1) and to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) For the purposes of the Licensing Acts and the Registration of Clubs Acts a meal served in any premises after the commencement of this Act shall not be deemed to be a substantial meal unless&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the meal is such as might be expected to be served as a main midday or main evening meal or as a main course at either such meal, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the meal is of a kind for which&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  having regard to the prices charged for meals in the premises at times other than prohibited hours, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  if meals are not normally served in the premises, having</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1217" /> regard to all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to charge a sum that is not less than&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I)  the sum (if any) that for the time being stands fixed under subsection (2) of this section, or</P>
    <P>(II)  if no sum stands fixed for the time being under the said subsection (2), five shillings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment deals with the definition of a substantial meal.  During the Second Reading a number of Deputies expressed doubts about whether any definition would prove effective in practice.  I accept there is no guarantee that there will not be some evasion, but I feel that a definition such as I have proposed is far better than nothing at all.  I believe also that that would be the view of even the most sceptical member of the licensed trade.  The amendment I am proposing does not make any fundamental change in the definition set out in the Bill, but there are a couple of drafting changes.  Apart from those the amendment proposed sets out to do one thing: to admit within the definition of a substantial meal what most of us would refer to as a high tea or a meat tea.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, a person would not normally have a drink with such a meal.  In the normal course of events, they would have it either before or after.  However, most of us would agree that there has been a practice up to now by which a bowl of soup, a cup of tea and maybe a sandwich or a pork pie have been used as a cover for the supply of drink on the basis that it constitutes a substantial meal.  The definition which I put forward was to deal with that situation.  It specifically excluded both the bowl of soup and the cup of tea and sandwich.</P>
    <P>That matter was dealt with in subsection (1) of Section 7, Paragraph (b). That paragraph is specifically designed to get at the pseudo-meal, which would consist primarily of a bowl of soup or a cup of tea and a sandwich. I propose to delete paragraph (b) for <Col N="1218" /> two reasons.  First, I do not think it is an essential part of the definition as it stands and I think the remainder of the provisions are adequate in themselves. Secondly, the definition is to apply not only to those provisions of the law covering the serving of drink with meals in hotels and restaurants during prohibited hours, but is to cover the granting of exemption orders for special functions such as the annual dance or socials of particular organisations.  Deputies will realise that the substantial meal definition has an important bearing on that type of function.  At these functions it is customary on occasions to have a high tea.  For one reason or another, many organisations do not have a full dinner at that type of function but have something more on the lines of what is commonly known as a high tea.</P>
    <P>Now the present definition is in the Bill.  I do not think it would be sufficient to enable the courts to grant special exemption orders in the case of social functions of that nature which were not a full dinner but merely a high tea, a meat tea, as we known it. For that reason, the main purpose of the amendment is to delete paragraph (b) of subsection (1) and there are a couple of minor drafting matters as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible that a sandwich can still be a substantial meal?  The Minister says no, but as I see it, there is nothing in the section to prohibit a sandwich from being a substantial meal, provided it costs more than 5/-.  Paragraph (a) provides that it shall not be a substantial meal unless:</P>
      <P>the meal is such as might be expected to be served as a main midday or main evening meal or as a main course at either such meal,</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) provides that it is not a substantial meal unless:</P>
      <P>soup, tea or coffee is not served as part of the meal except as a subsidiary course, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand this matter was tested on one occasion and a sandwich was held to be a substantial meal.  Prices have <Col N="1219" /> risen since then and I can conceive of an expensive sandwich costing more than 5/-.  I do not say it would happen very often, but it is conceivable that it could happen.</P>

      <P>If there is doubt about it, is it not better to leave out the definition altogether than put in one that could be the subject of doubt in the future, and possibly unnecessary litigation?  In at least one previous case, a sandwich was held to be a substantial meal.  The section, as amended, or indeed in its original form, provides that it must cost not less than 5/- or whatever appropriate sum is fixed.  As other Deputies have said, at present an expensive sandwich such as the one which was mentioned could cost more than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think this question of the substantial meal has the same importance in the Bill now as it had when the Bill was originally drafted.  I think Section 7 was put into the Bill primarily to deal with the licensing of restaurants under Section 15 as it was originally proposed. I think I am correct in saying that on a previous occasion when this House was endeavouring to get a definition of &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo;, the general view was that it would be quite impossible to get any kind of watertight definition which would avoid all sorts of litigation, and possibly a situation arising where one court might take one view of what constituted a substantial meal, and another member of the judiciary might take another view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister at all for endeavouring to get a definition and to put it in the Bill, but I am very doubtful as to whether his definition will work, and whether it will be a watertight one, and not give rise to the complications referred to by <Col N="1220" /> Deputy Cosgrave.  I think it is unlikely that the Minister has succeeded in getting over that hurdle.  I do not blame him for trying.  I do not know whether I am correct in saying that the amendment which the Minister has moved is, in effect, for the purpose of taking out paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 7.  Its effect is to take out the reference to soup, tea or coffee.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether there is any significance in the fact that the amendment is proposed following the Minister's announcement to the House that Section 15 is to be dropped.  It seems to me that the Minister is modifying the definition as originally proposed by him of &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo;.  In other words, he is modifying it now when it will, in fact, have reference only to dance halls and extensions of licences to dance halls, and hotels for that matter, for dances in hotels.  It seems to me that on that basis the Minister has now decided that the definition which he originally proposed in respect of restaurants should be modified.  I do not know whether or not I am misreading his intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take this in conjunction with Section 9 which deals with the ordinary small dance halls.  Usually the town hall is available to a sports club or to someone who promotes a dance in aid of a sports club or a charity.  There is provision in Section 9 that they must be charged a certain amount, that a substantial meal must be available and the price is payable on admission.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in those halls in certain rural areas there are no facilities even for high tea?  These are occasional dances held in halls which are converted into dance halls and licensed under the Act, and very often there are no facilities for the provision of high tea.  If the Minister intends to persist with Section 9 in its entirety and make a substantial meal part of the application, it means that a local hurling club or athletic club will be deprived of it.  I should like to draw his attention to that.</P>

      <P>So long as the Minister knows what he is doing.  I am against that because I think it is wrong.  As I said on Second Reading, that is class legislation.  A hunt club can charge 35/- admission and bring down Mrs. Lawlor of Naas or some other well known caterer, who can set up his or her own equipment.  They will hold their dances and the Minister will not be able to stop them because he cannot.  I suggest that is class legislation of the worst kind.  I am sorry if the Minister is doing it deliberately; I thought it was by accident.  I am surprised and shocked that it is being done deliberately.  I can assure the Minister that he will deprive the people in the rural areas, not only of enjoyment but of a reasonable means of carrying out their activities.  The Minister may well say: &ldquo;Oh, well if they want to support anything, they do not have to have a bar.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree I am, but I must take Section 7 in relation to Section 9.  The clause &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo; is in Section 9.  If I agree to this amendment, it will be difficult for me to vote against that clause in the second next section.  I agree with this amendment and I will vote for it, but it will appear that I am voting against it on Section 9.  When we come to Section 9, I shall appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have missed the purpose of the section.  Let us go back over the history of the restaurants.  Under the 1927 Act, any publican who served meals could procure a restaurant certificate which enabled him to supply drink with meals during prohibited hours.  Under <Col N="1222" /> the 1960 Act, a number of publicans, particularly in County Dublin, were going to lose what was then known as the <i>bona fide</i> trade between 11.30 and 12.  The Minister's predecessor threw a sop to them and said: &ldquo;Instead of giving them a restaurant certificate, we shall give them a limited restaurant certificate.&rdquo;  That certificate enables the publican to supply drink with meals in a limited portion of the premises, the portion licensed as a restaurant and nowhere else.  When that certificate is granted, the justice defines the room or rooms in which meals may be served.</P>
      <P>Naturally, these publicans were not going to allow the business to filter away and began serving meals in this limited space and drinks with meals. The Minister saw that things had developed in such a way that possibly meals which would not otherwise be described as substantial meals were being used as a camouflage for the purpose of supplying drink and he has now come in with this amendment which puts a premium on the price of a meal to the working man.  That is what it does.  It fixes the price which a working man must pay for a meal, if he wants to have a drink with it.</P>
      <P>The Minister talks about the main course.  Take the farm worker or the farmer.  How many courses does he have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Because all we are dealing with here is when the ordinary licensing hours are ended and when people are having a substantial meal. There is a special concession, if you like, in the law and certain restaurants are able to get this advantage over the public house in that they can serve a drink with a substantial meal for roughly an hour after closing time.  All we are doing is ensuring that when we say &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo;, we mean a substantial meal, so that these restaurants will not be able to cheat by serving sandwiches or pork pies after the public houses have closed.</P>

      <P>I am trying to prevent money being wasted, money being spent foolishly.  If there is a prosecution, leave it to the Guards, first of all.  He comes in and he says: &ldquo;What are you having.&rdquo;  The person replies, &ldquo;I am having a course of bacon and cabbage.&rdquo;  I see Deputy Cunningham smile.  He is an applicant for a licence and, I assume, for a restaurant certificate.  I am trying to protect the like of the Deputy but I am also trying to protect his future customers.  I am really worried about this because a man must pay 5/- for a meal after 11.30 p.m. if he wants a bottle of stout with it.  The Minister has thrown the argument to me that the working man is not going to Jammets. <Col N="1230" /> I know he is not.  Most of us can afford to go there to take a glass of stout or glass of champagne with a meal in Jammets, the Shelbourne or the Gresham.  We can afford to pay 5/- for a dozen oysters and a glass of stout after 11.30 p.m. but why should the working man of the city of Dublin not be entitled to go into the restaurant to which he usually goes and which has a licence attached and have what may be his main meal, which may be a very substantial meal, with it?  Why should he have to pay 5/- for it?  It is setting a premium on the price of a meal that was never intended.  In 1927, when the late Kevin O'Higgins introduced his Bill, he said &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo;. Again, in 1943, when the Minister for Justice brought in his Bill, he said &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo;.  In 1960, when the ex-Deputy Traynor brought in his Bill, he said &ldquo;a substantial meal&rdquo;. This Minister goes further.  He says a substantial meal is to cost nothing less than 5/-.  Is that right?  I do not think so.</P>

      <P>But the point here is that if we are going to make laws and have restricted hours of drinking and if we give a special concession to people who are having a meal at night, I think the Minister is perfectly right in tightening up the legislation in order to prevent abuses of that concession. That is exactly what he proposes to do here.  There are very few places that I know of where you could get a substantial meal for less than 5/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this amendment on completely different grounds from those expressed by Deputy O'Donnell.  I am opposed to it because I believe that when the pubs are closed, they should be closed.  I happen to know rural Ireland.  I am sure there is not a great deal of difference between rural Ireland in the south and in the north-west.  Deputy O'Donnell seems to forget that this provision would give an opportunity to people who felt they had not enough drink up to the closing of the public house, who may have young girls with them, to go into a restaurant and pay 5/-, not for the meal&mdash;they will have to take it, of course&mdash;but for the opportunity of having another hour of drinking.  I am opposed to the amendment and I am naturally opposed to <Col N="1232" /> the section itself.  I consider that the hours for drinking are sufficient.  The people who advocate longer drinking hours should realise that restaurants are places where one can have a meal, a cup of tea or coffee and things like that and not mainly places for drink.</P>
      <P>Dublin has been mentioned.  I am not interested in what may be the case in Dublin.  Fashionable places and other places that would not be charging the same high rate have been mentioned.  However, I do not want to see creeping into rural Ireland the habit which has developed in Dublin and, perhaps, in Cork city that certain people can enjoy a drink at hours when others cannot.  There is talk about the turf worker, the farm worker, and the road worker.  From what I know of the majority of those workers, when it comes to closing time they realise it is time for them to go home and that if they want a meal at that hour of the night the place to have it is in their own home.</P>
      <P>I have no sympathy with this amendment or with the section.  It is simply catering for people who want to have a good time, people who believe that there are no other amenities to enjoy in rural Ireland except the public houses and who on the pretext of having a meal whether it costs 5/- or 10/-, want longer hours for drinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals solely with the definition of a substantial meal.  The Deputies who are discussing trading hours on this matter are drawing a red herring across the issue.  I agree with this amendment.  I do not agree with my colleague Deputy O'Donnell's suggestion about meals. Boiled bacon and two vegetables in the restaurant here in Leinster House, which is subsidised to the extent of £2,000 a year, will cost each diner 4/7.  There is very little difference between 5/- and 4/7 and I think 5/- is a proper figure to have adopted in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think the Minister is wrong in deleting paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of Section 7 &ldquo;where soup, tea or coffee is not served as part of the meal except as a subsidiary course&rdquo;.  He should also include in <Col N="1233" /> that &ldquo;all sandwiches&rdquo;.  As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out here earlier, the Minister and myself can go into a restaurant.  I could have a beef sandwich because I would prefer it to a smoked salmon sandwich, but the Minister might have a smoked salmon sandwich.  I will pay a shilling and he will pay 6/- and he will qualify for a drink and I will not.  There I see a weakness in the amendment.  As Deputy O'Donnell said you could have a caviare sandwich which might cost 10/-or 12/6.  I pose that question to the Minister and I think he should reconsider the deletion of paragraph (b) and add to paragraph (b) &ldquo;all sandwiches&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the matters on which I spoke on the Second Reading of the Bill.  It will be very hard to administer this section.  I realise the Minister is anxious to raise the standard of food and drink in public houses and any public house that is worth its salt should be anxious to give a reasonable meal with drink.  Nevertheless, this provision will raise considerable doubt as to what is a substantial meal.  What one person might consider a substantial meal might not be good enough for another person.  One type of meal might be substantial for a person who is on a diet.  I am not too happy about what will be the interpretation of this provision by the Gardaí when it is in operation.  Recently, in County Dublin a Garda prosecuted a publican because he was not serving the drink with the meal.  The customer had the meal almost eaten when he ordered the drink.  The Garda summoned both the customer and the publican.  Under this provision one would nearly want to have a receipt for a meal in order to satisfy the Guard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy Belton in regard to sandwiches.  Many people might prefer sandwiches for a main meal and people who do not care about eating meat might want cheese sandwiches.  I would like the Minister to have another look at this between now and the Report Stage.  I believe the interpretation of a substantial <Col N="1234" /> meal, which is a matter I have raised with the previous Minister as well as with this Minister on the Second Reading, should be left reasonably wide.  The price will, I am afraid, cause a great deal of confusion.  A great deal of misrepresentation may go on and the possibility is that the Minister, so long as he remains Minister for Justice, will have a chronic headache.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that is all right. I believe the value of the meal should be increased to 10/-.  We should not encourage people to drink after 11.30 p.m.  I am not impressed by Deputy O'Donnell shedding tears over the worker.  Ninety per cent. of the workers, if not 99 per cent., will be at home and in bed at that hour.  We certainly hope they will.  I am sure, in the case of the remaining few, the boss would not object to some little arrangement to get in a few bottles before the public houses close.</P>
      <P>It must be remembered that last year we got £47,000,000 from tourists. We must encourage tourists.  If they have the money, we should not object to their having a drink and, if they can afford it, paying 10/-.  As one Labour Deputy said, I am afraid this will only result in giving rise to undesirable incidents.  We should make that kind of thing very costly for those who engage in it.  The tourist will not object to 10/- or 15/-.  Whenever I go on the Continent I have to pay £1 for every meal.  Five shillings is nothing.  If the Minister leaves it as it is, he will only encourage people who should be in bed, who cannot afford it, or who have had enough. We should do everything to discourage drinking.  For the tourists, the price should be 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his courage in trying to define a substantial meal. <Col N="1235" /> I am not opposed to this amendment, or to the section, because I think this type of provision is long overdue.  I do not agree with the comments made by Deputy Burke, but I certainly endorse everything Deputy Sherwin has said.  I am dealing with this purely from the point of view of what constitutes a substantial meal.  If nothing else, this provision will deter undesirables and prevent undesirable things happening.  In the city of ours in the past, many subterfuges were adopted to obtain drink.  The Minister has now defined a substantial meal and a hot dog or a bowl of soup will no longer meet the provision.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Belton's suggestion about including sandwiches.  It would be necessary to do that having regard to increased costs.  We have been told how the Minister intends to operate this section.  He has made provision for altering the price, if necessary.  Concern has been expreseed about the working man drinking late at night.  Concern has also been expressed that the working man should have that opportunity.  I submit the ordinary working man is very well satisfied to finish his drinking at 11 p.m.  There is no point in inducing him to spend money he can ill afford by giving him the opportunity of going in and having a meal unless it is of the kind prescribed by the Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Sherwin says: &ldquo;Make the price 10/-.&rdquo;  We know that the people to whom Deputy Sherwin referred will not care what they spend.  They go out for a certain purpose.  They are well heeled with money.  They do not come in the main, from the working class.  They can well afford to pay 10/- or 15/- for a &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo;. This is an attempt&mdash;I regard it as a serious one&mdash;to define a &ldquo;substantial meal&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This issue has lost considerably in importance having regard to the fact that Section 15 has gone.  In so far as an effort is being made by the Minister to give a definition, the point at issue was pretty well pinpointed by Deputy Sherwin when he spoke on this subject on the occasion <Col N="1236" /> of the last Bill.  Deputy Sherwin posed a query to the then Minister.  I should like to put it to the Minister again now.  Speaking here on 29th March, 1960, at column 1314 of Volume 180, Deputy Sherwin asked:</P>
      <P>Does a substantial meal mean the size of the meal or the cost of the meal?</P>
      <P>The Minister has now answered that by saying both; it is partly the size and partly the cost.  Continuing, on 29th March, 1960, Deputy Sherwin said:</P>
      <P>A fish and chip meal is a substantial meal, you can get it for six-pence in some places, but in other places it might cost 6/-.  Fish and chips is a substantial meal to a lot of people.</P>
      <P>That is the kernel of the Minister's problem here.  The Minister means a substantial meal, but, as Deputy Sherwin pointed out, it is possible that for some people fish and chips is a substantial meal and might only cost, in the normal course, anything from six-pence to 1/6.  Under the provisions of the Minister's amendment a substantial meal of fish and chips at a normal price is excluded.  On the other hand, if someone decides to charge 5/-, or more, for fish and chips, the person ordering will be entitled to get a drink.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition is important in two ways.  It is important in relation to the serving of meals after the ordinary licensing hours in hotels, licensed restaurants, restaurants with limited certificates, and restaurants which are normally referred to as licensed to sell wine.  At the moment, this type of establishment is able to serve a meal up to twelve midnight. The Bill proposes to extend the time to half-past twelve.  It is an important privilege for that type of establishment to be able to serve intoxicating liquor after the ordinary closing hours.  It is a privilege allowed to them because they are serving substantial meals and the theory is that an establishment of that kind should be entitled to serve intoxicating liquor with a substantial meal up to midnight or half-past twelve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> It is important from a number of points of view that we should make that concession.  The stipulation in regard to the concession must be a real one and not one capable of being abused or got round.  It is important, first of all, in order to be fair to the publican because he has, after all, to close his premises at the stipulated time &mdash;at eleven o'clock, or half-past eleven, <Col N="1238" /> or ten o'clock on Sunday &mdash; and, in order to be fair to him, we must insist that the stipulation we lay down with regard to the serving of drinks after these hours is a real one.</P>
