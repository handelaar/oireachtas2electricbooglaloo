      <P>The debate on this Committee Stage has taken some considerable length of time.  As I said yesterday, I am at a loss to know why it should have taken so long to get through the House or why, in particular, such opposition should have been expressed to this proposal by two members who, as I said, represent a minority group.  It could not possibly be the amount of money because the amount of money involved is, in terms of our budgetary position, infinitesimal, so that if one rules out that aspect of it, then one becomes more and more puzzled as to why there should be this opposition.</P>
      <P>I mentioned yesterday that I felt Deputy Dr. Browne and Deputy McQuillan should be even more concerned than I about the prestige and the position of the judiciary and that they should be concerned along with me to ensure that that position was safeguarded.  I think Deputy Dr. Browne was less than fair to me in the manner in which he interpreted my view.  He seemed to think that I had said that Deputy Dr. Browne himself and his colleague, Deputy McQuillan, should be careful because the judiciary would take it out on them at some stage.  That is absurd and is in no way related to what I actually did say.</P>
      <P>My point was that the institution of the judiciary is a valuable safeguard of our democratic rights.  It is an essential part of our Constitution.  I think that minorities in a democracy should be more concerned to ensure the integrity and independence of the judiciary than the majority because, after all, in certain circumstances, one could envisage a situation where the judiciary would be the only ultimate protection a minority could have.  That was the proposition which I was putting to Deputy Dr. Browne and his colleague.  I think it is a valid one.  I feel that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not a bit.  I am concerned to put my position on the record and explain exactly what I meant because I do suggest to the House that Deputy Dr. Browne, possibly mistakenly, misinterpreted my point of view.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan raised again last night, just before we rose, the question of referring the matter of judicial salaries to a Select Committee.  I should like to reiterate my reasons for not invoking that procedure on this occasion and why I am not suggesting to the Government or to the House that this Select Committee should be set up.  In the first place, I do not think the time was opportune for the sort of fundamental re-examination the Select Committee would carry out. That was done in 1953.  It was gone into very thoroughly at that time.  I do not think that any factors have entered into the situation which would necessitate a further fundamental re-examination at this stage, particularly having regard to the fact that the Select Committee in 1953 did advert to and take account of the proposed reorganisation in the district and circuit courts.  In fact, their recommendations were based on the assumption that the reorganisation and the extra sittings would take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing all that in mind, I think that on this occasion there was no need to go through the elaborate machinery of setting up a Select Committee and having it report to the House and then taking a decision on the report.  Particularly am I of that view because there is no doubt that even if we did have a Select Committee, despite the fact that Deputy Dr. Browne would promise that he would accept the report of such a committee, we would still have a debate on whatever report the Select Committee <Col N="480" /> might make.  The Labour Party would not be prepared to participate in such a Committee and we would have a debate in the House on the recommendation.  So I think we are justified in not establishing a Select Committee.</P>
    <P>If we do not decide upon a Select Committee, what alternative have we? Deputy Dr. Browne has said that this Bill was brought into the House frivolously, that no thought was given to it, that it was just rushed in here without preparation or consideration. That is simply not true.  We had cognisance of the situation which obtained in 1961 when the majority of the salaried classes in the country moved ahead and procured greater or lesser increases in wages and conditions. They were participating in a general increase in the national income which was approximately about five per cent. in 1961.</P>
    <P>We then had to examine the situation in the light of our obligations to the judiciary and I explained to the House last night what those obligations are and how they arise.  There is an onus on the Government, and on the Minister for Justice in particular, to protect the institutions of the State and in particular the constitutional institutions of which the judiciary is probably the most important.  That is the duty of the Government and it would be dereliction of duty on the part of the Government not to fulfil that duty.  In the light of that obligation we examined the situation and decided that the proper thing to do was to give the judiciary an increase on their 1953 basic salaries which would be proportionate to the increases given to those sections of the community with which they are traditionally related and compared.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat that in 1924 when judicial salaries were first established they were consciously related and tied to the Civil Service salaries, to the salaries paid to the higher civil servants.  We examined what increases the higher branches of the Civil Service had procured and we prepared, very carefully, a suitable scale for the judiciary <Col N="481" /> which would be as closely as possible related to the increases which had taken place in the Civil Service. If Deputies go through the table of salaries which is now before us, the increases which are proposed, the percentage increases in relation to the different branches of the judiciary, they will find that there is a logical pattern running through the proposal and that that pattern is very closely related to the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>How can the very bitter complaints arise in this regard?  It cannot be the money.  No Deputy can suggest that the amount involved, £21,000, reduced to half at least by taxation, can be of great importance in this regard.  Therefore, is it that they want the judiciary to fall behind the other sections of the community?  That is what would happen. If we do not do this now the civil servants and executives of the semi-State bodies will all move ahead of the judiciary and the position of the judiciary will worsen to that extent. Why should we allow that to happen? If the amount of money were important and we could not afford it there would be some case for holding that opinion. When one considers the exceptional position of the judiciary it would be negligence to let that happen, to have a judiciary which felt dissatisfied and aggrieved and left under a sense of injustice.  I cannot see the reason behind the attitude expressed here by the Labour Party and by the National Progressive Democrats.</P>
    <P>I said that it seemed to me that it could only be explained as an attempt to achieve political advantage over the Government, that it was felt that the proposal to increase judicial salaries would be unpopular with the general public.  As the debate has gone on I have heard nothing that would indicate to me that that is not so.  I have listened very carefully for one solid, concrete argument which would establish that that is not so but I have not heard it.  There has been a great deal of criticism of the proposal to pay the Chief Justice a salary of £6,000.  I want to point out that in very many sections of our economy salaries and wages have increased by 200 per cent. since 1924.  The salary of the Chief Justice <Col N="482" /> in 1924 was fixed at £4,000.  It will be £6,000 if this proposal is adopted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point that where incomes and wage rates generally have increased over the whole economy by something like 200 per cent. since 1924, the Chief Justice, if this proposal of mine is accepted, will be in receipt of a salary which is 50 per cent. more than was paid to his predecessor in 1924.  I do not think it can be seriously argued that we are being excessively generous in that regard.  In 1953 the Chief Justice was one of 451 persons with incomes exceeding £4,000.  In the same year, 776 persons had incomes of £5,000.  At present I estimate that about 300 people are in the same income category as the Chief Justice, with between £5,000 and £6,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that salary or income?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Salary, but I shall not be dogmatic about that.  Certainly, at least 300 people in the country at present have incomes of between £5,000 and £6,000.  At least 700 persons&mdash;probably slightly more&mdash; have incomes exceeding £6,000, so that the Chief Justice is in the company of approximately 1,000 persons as regards income bracket.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="483" /> I suppose it is difficult to measure the worth of any job but it is very unlikely that there are 1,000 persons in the country performing more valuable service than the Chief Justice.  I mention the Chief Justice in particular because the main criticism in the debate seemed to be directed at his salary and what is proposed in regard to it.  I feel this is a consideration I should point out to the House, that there are approximately 1,000 persons who have incomes equivalent to, or greater than, that of the Chief Justice.  In these circumstances the figure assumes its proper perspective.  In my opinion it is certainly not extravagant when rates of taxation and so on are taken into account.  This is settled policy by the Government and by myself and put to the House on the basis that it is reasonable to try to give this small but very important section of the community a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We voted against the Second Stage of this Bill and it is really a Second Stage Bill.  The Minister has sought to establish that the opposition to it is unreasonable in consideration of the comparisons that can be made between the rates of salary payable to other persons in the State and the rate of salary prescribed for the judiciary in 1924.  He has sought to make the case that rates of salary today in other walks of life are approximately 200 per cent. higher than the corresponding rates in 1924. I believe that is the thread of the argument. All those considerations applied two years ago when we had this matter under review.  The rates appropriate to the judiciary were fixed by Dáil Éireann in 1960 and it was expressly stated then, and stated with general approval, that the Oireachtas should not make a practice of reviewing judicial salary scales at frequent and capricious intervals but that from time to time the Oireachtas should take the matter under review and determine scales of salary and then allow those scales to operate for a reasonably protracted period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put it to the House that it is wholly illusory today to seek to <Col N="484" /> justify this Bill in relation to conditions obtaining in 1924 when in fact the Minister's duty is to justify a departure from the scales fixed so recently as two years ago.  The Minister stultifies himself and the Government for which he speaks when he introduces into the discussion manifestly invalid arguments which can be demonstrated to be invalid by reference to his own and his predecessor's speeches on a Bill identical to this which the Oireachtas disposed of as recently as two years ago.</P>
    <P>That deals with one aspect of the unsuitability of this legislation but there is another aspect to which the attention of the House should be directed and it is a grave aspect.  Of course it is unreasonable to compare the scale of salary to be paid to the Chief Justice or to High Court or Supreme Court Judges with a scale of salary to be paid to somebody engaged in a very much less significant occupation outside.  One does not expect him to receive the same salary as a junior barrister practising in his first term at the Bar; one does not expect him to receive the same salary as a public servant charged with far less responsibility than that which devolves upon a judge.  It is reasonable and right to relate remuneration to the responsibility and status of the public service that any person gives. But if we are to act rightly we must regard every section of the community with equal solicitude for their legitimate claims and it is to me no less than a shocking position that, when we are revising, for the second time within two years, salary scales for the judiciary which are in a relatively high bracket, we make these salary scales retrospective by seven months to 1st November in the same year as we increase old age pensions by 2/6d. a week and make the increase prospective, conditional on the old age pensioner living for six months more before he qualifies for the extra 2/6d.</P>
    <P>I am not comparing, and I do not believe any rational Deputy wants to compare, what is fit and proper as a monetary measure of what should be paid to an old age pensioner and what should be paid to the Chief Justice <Col N="485" /> but there is a basis of equality of treatment between the most exalted in the State and the most humble.  If that be violated by this Oireachtas, then we do a very real injustice and we cause a bitter resentment for which I know no answer.</P>
    <P>I do not know how to answer an old age pensioner who says to me: &ldquo;If the Oireachtas gave us half-a-crown, why were we told we would get it only if we lived to next August when you are giving a very large sum to the judiciary and not only giving it to them from the date of the introduction of the Bill where under they were to get it but backdating it to last November, a wholly arbitrary date which operates to give the recipients of the increase, over and above the increased salaries scale they will enjoy in the future, a very large sum which in some cases will be more than the entire old age pension that I will collect for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How do you answer that?  Why is it proposed we should do that?  I have heard no word from the Minister at any stage of this debate to justify that differentiation in treatment of the different categories of persons for whom we in the Oireachtas are responsible.  Nobody has asked for this.  Nobody has attempted to justify it and I say quite deliberately that if I were asked to explain it by any old age pensioner in the country, I would be wholly unable to do so.</P>
    <P>It is therefore right, when the Minister seeks to disown all comprehension of the attitude adopted in regard to this Bill, that these simple facts should be restated: When we reviewed judicial salaries two years ago, it was stated, with the unanimous approval of every side of the House, that this was a matter that should not be undertaken frivolously or unduly frequently; that we should weigh up all relevant matters, fix judicial salaries and leave them be.  We are prohibited by the Constitution from reducing the salary of any judge.  Therefore, we approach this matter with circumspection and it always seems to give rise, if there is not unanimous agreement amongst us <Col N="486" /> all as to what should be done, to the very doubtful advantage of a discussion of an acrimonious character in this House of the judiciary.  In my judgment, that is a bad thing, and one of the most powerful reasons for dealing with judicial salaries once and for all and approaching the matter thereafter with reluctance is the knowledge that legislation of this character can give rise to acrimonious discussion and the intervention of individuals like Deputy Corry making shocking suggestions and disgraceful suggestions, to prevent which little or nothing can be done.</P>
    <P>That is one reason why we have opposed this Bill.  We believe there is no reason for this proposed change so soon after the last and the Minister's reference to 1924 this morning is irrelevant and a manifest attempt to sidestep the objection I have just mentioned.  The second objection is that if there is to be deferment for the old age pensioner, who can justify retrospection for the judge?  These are the grounds on which this Bill is being opposed, and I see no argument advanced by the Minister to meet either of the grounds I have put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at the end of this debate, the Minister still appears to be surprised that there is so much objection to the proposals to increase these salaries.  He says he has not heard any sound argument to justify this opposition. Surely at a time when there are people living at subsistence level, he must appreciate that asking the public to pay the judiciary these salaries must create great resentment particularly amongst the poorer sections of the community. The Minister should understand that he is not handing out this money from his own private purse. This money is coming directly from the people we have mentioned, the old age pensioners, the unemployed, everybody who pays indirect taxation in the many ways in which they have to pay it now in our society.  It does create resentment amongst people who have to look for free fuel vouchers, to wait at a dispensary for the type of medical care they can get there, who are finding it difficult to give their children food, to pay their school fees, and so on.  They <Col N="487" /> constitute the mass of the people, who are finding it difficult to live at present with the increasing cost of living.</P>
      <P>The Minister has tried to suggest that we should relate like with like and justify these salaries because of those paid in other countries.  However, there is no comparison between the type of society here and that in other countries because there is not the great gap between the very poor and the very wealthy which we have in Ireland. Until that gap is narrowed, until there are fewer people existing at subsistence level, as are the old age pensioners, the widows and the unemployed, it shows a very serious lack of understanding of the society in which the Minister is living and for which he is asking us to legislate to put forward such a proposal.</P>
      <P>The Minister suggests one should be concerned for the minority.  That is an interesting academic point in which he knows there is not much validity, because, in our society, it is a minority which is particularly well able to look after itself.  The members of the judiciary do not really need to be assisted by us.  I do not think anybody seriously believes that the judiciary, above all, need anybody to look after them.  If we were to accept the Minister's suggestion that the granting of these increases was, in effect, to protect the integrity and independence of the judiciary, to ensure they would be just in their decisions, then, of course, we would have to accept the Minister's whole thesis that, if these people are not paid excessively high salaries, they cannot be trusted to do their work in a just manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our difficulty is that the Minister, on the one hand, makes this case; then, when we accuse him, as I think we can with justification, of suggesting that the judiciary will not stay straight unless they are paid to stay straight, or stay honest, or stay honourable, and give just decisions, the Minister immediately says he does not make any such case at all.  Yet he wants us to join with him in giving these increases in order effectively to ensure that the judiciary retain their independence. It is astonishing to us <Col N="488" /> that the Minister should have the slightest difficulty in seeing how he must inevitably, with these extravagant propositions, exacerbate in our society the great feeling of resentment which already exists because we have the Government, in one direction, worried about inflation and inflationary trends, lecturing the workers on every possible occasion about wage restraint, admonishing them that they cannot possibly expect increases in wages unless they give increased production to justify any increase they get.</P>
    <P>This comes at a time when it is proposed to bring in legislation to restrict the worker's right to take industrial action if he does not feel satisfied with whatever income he happens to be getting from the company employing him; and this comes at a time when we had just fortunately got rid of legislation threatening people with jail sentences because they looked for increases in wages.  The Minister must understand that in this way he highlights his own extravagant approach to the attitude of mind which divides society up into the greatly privileged class, on the one hand, and the underprivileged classes on the other.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Dillon pointed out, the final insult above all others is the Minister's suggestion that this money should be given retrospectively at a time when he has decided that the Exchequer is not sufficiently in funds to give the old age pensioner his increase for some months yet.  I do not believe the Minister has any difficulty at all in understanding the position we outline here.  The people we are speaking for are the vast masses who seriously resent, and rightly resent, these propositions.</P>
    <P>Nobody objects to people being fairly remunerated for any job they do.  Judges have great responsibilities but they have, at the same time, as the Minister said, a certain prestige and a certain standing; they have security of employment.  Their employment is pensionable.  These are all great benefits which most people in industry do not have.  They are benefits most people at the Bar do not have. Consequently, I do not think it is fair <Col N="489" /> to compare the salaries of the judiciary with what the ordinary barrister earns. The ordinary barrister has a very much tougher time and a much shorter earning life.</P>
    <P>Even if that were not so, it seems to me that people in a democracy such as ours should be ready to make some contribution to serving society generally. I do not see why the judiciary should be outside that.  I do not think anybody in this State, including the President, has a greater responsibility than the Taoiseach has.  He has very important problems to deal with.  He has very difficult problems to meet; he has to make decisions of far-reaching importance from the point of view of the whole of our society and from the point of view of the historical development of the nation.  Yet successive Taoisigh have done the job to the best of their ability for a relatively tiny salary compared with what is proposed for the judiciary and compared with what is paid to the President.</P>
    <P>I do not see why a similar attitude should not be adopted in relation to the judiciary.  Pay them well certainly, but surely we should expect a certain modicum of public service?  Surely we should give them some credit for being prepared to make some contribution to the general public to further the interests of the people generally and help develop our State.  Surely they are not so completely materialistic and mercenary in their approach to service to the community?  Politicians and many other groups in our society give a certain amount of their time to serving and helping the public.  Why cannot the members of the judiciary be given a fair salary and then, after that, have the satisfaction of knowing that they are doing a good, important and valuable job for society as a whole?</P>
    <P>We have no hesitation at all in asking the Minister to reconsider this whole Bill and to withdraw it.  We have no hesitation in asking him to <Col N="490" /> realise that he has made a very serious and fundamental blunder in now relating these people in their salary payments to the general salary increases paid to the rest of the community.  The Minister is now giving them a vested interest in inflation.  For that reason, he can no longer call on them, as he suggested he could in the past, to help resolve difficult arbitration cases of one kind or another because from now on, knowing that the faster salaries and wages increase, the faster their own salaries and wages will increase, they will be happy in the knowledge that their salaries are dependent on percentage increases elsewhere; and their <i>de facto</i> increases will be fabulous compared with the increases given to the old age pensioner, the civil servant, the industrial or the agricultural worker.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious mistake on the part of the Minister.  It is unwise of him to do this.  The original proposition put forward by the Taoiseach that these people should be remunerated at periodic intervals fairly generously, and entirely independent of other salary movements, was a very much more desirable proposition indeed.  It did not lend itself to the serious possible weaknesses which I foresee in the new development introduced by the Minister.  The Minister has made the case repeatedly&mdash;I do not subscribe to it&mdash;that these people are subject to the influence of salary increases.  His suggestion is that, unless the salary goes up regularly and substantially, they cannot be expected to retain their independence.  That clearly means that they are subject to any compulsion there may be as a result of a general desire for bigger salaries and more money.  They will now be put in the position of being asked to arbitrate on their own case.  In all the circumstances, I think the Minister should reconsider the Bill, and withdraw it.</P>

    <Title>Official Secrets Bill, 1962&mdash;Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>7.  To delete subsection (3).</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy McGilligan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) of Section 2 declares that a certificate given under the seal of a Minister that any document, and so on, is secret or confidential shall be conclusive evidence of the fact so certified.  I want to put to the Minister that that is an <Col N="495" /> outrageous provision.  I do not believe for one second that anybody would introduce that section if he really adverted to what it means, not even the Minister.</P>
      <P>Let us take a specific example&mdash; the day before a Budget, when a Minister for Finance is preparing many documents.  They are all marked, and properly so, &ldquo;Secret,&rdquo; because a Budget leakage would be tremendously serious.  The Budget comes in the next day.  The documents immediately thereafter cease to have any secret effect, cease to be secret, in fact, though they are still marked &ldquo;Secret.&rdquo;  Then, the Government go out of office.</P>
      <P>A Minister for Finance in that Government, when perhaps sitting on this side of the House or if outside the House altogether, discloses, as he is entitled to disclose, that in introducing that Budget, the Government were thinking of doing this or that but that their reason for introducing it was such and such and produces and quotes from his own minutes of the time.  It then remains within the power of his successor, as Minister for Finance, under the way this section is drafted, to certify that the document was secret.  The court has no power, no right, to investigate the matter at all.  The court must convict the former Minister, even though the matters disclosed have no secret effects any more and do not in any way involve the safety of the State&mdash;do not, in fact, amount to more than what is an appropriate political discussion at a later stage.  That is quite outrageous. It is the obvious way and the only way in which the section and this subsection in particular can be construed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe for one instant that any responsible Minister or any responsible Government would introduce a section with that implication with their eyes open to its implications&mdash;or certainly they should not.  The implication, as I say, is there.  It is the only interpretation that would be open to the courts on the subsection.  The courts are, by this subsection, given no discretion whatsoever and in those circumstances they must convict.  I do not <Col N="496" /> believe that that is what this House wants and that that is what the country wants.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree that, in relation to matters that affect the safety of the State&mdash;and that is really what one means originally in relation to secrets &mdash;those matters should properly and thoroughly be protected.  The way to protect them is to have the fact that the document was marked &ldquo;Secret&rdquo;<i>prima facie</i> that it was and still is at the time of its publication a secret document the disclosure of which would be contrary to what everybody desires.  It would be an easy matter then for the court to determine whether the prosecution or defence was correct in saying that this is no longer, and was no longer at the time it was published, a secret document.  As the section is drafted now with this subsection, the court's hands are completely tied.  They have no option but to convict a person, no matter how innocent he may be and no matter how much the prosecution in the court and the judge and the jury may feel that such a conviction would be an abuse of the judicial process and entirely and absolutely unfair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that it seems to me that the manner in which the section is drafted is the only way in which we can make the Bill work.  As I said, the proposal is a practical and reasonable one.  I want to point out that I am accepting amendment No. 8.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of some significance. The effect of it is that the certificate must be given by the Minister personally under a seal and not just departmentally.  The fears expressed by Deputy Sweetman and others are unreal.  It is always possible in relation to matters of this sort to visualise all kinds of imaginary situations, but as a practical proposition I do not think the type of thing Deputy Sweetman mentioned could ever possibly arrive in this country.  If we ever got to that stage, we could throw our hats at democracy anyway.  I have <Col N="497" /> explained that the reason for this proposal is that we are dealing here with a document which is confidential or secret.  The prosecution would rely on that sort of document.  Would it not be absurd if, in order to prosecute somebody in relation to a document of that sort, you had to produce the actual document in court?</P>
      <P>My defence of the proposal is based on the fact that this is, in effect, a continuance of the existing situation and tradition.  The courts have always accepted the word of a Minister of State that it would be contrary to the public interest to disclose a particular document, and there the matter has ended.  The courts have imposed that voluntary discipline on themselves. They have said: &ldquo;We do not like this sort of thing but we appreciate that Ministers occupy special positions and have special responsibilities.&rdquo;  If a Minister of State gives a certificate that disclosure of a document would be injurious to the public interest, the courts have never gone behind it.  We are merely writing that particular principle into the Bill.</P>

I am putting it to the House as a proposal <Col N="498" /> which is necessary for the practical working of the Bill.  I am not persuaded by the instance which Deputy Sweetman has given me.  That is so farfetched and unreal as to be not seriously worthy of consideration in relation to this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This has now been brought down to case law, the Camell Laird case.  The Minister brings that forward as an answer to Deputy Dillon, who asked about criminal cases.  The Camell Laird case was a civil action.  It is one where the non-disclosure of a document can easily be justified.  It concerned a case of a submarine that sank.  A number of lives were lost and the dependents of one of the officers lost on the ship took an action for negligence against the constructors of the submarine. They asked for documents which would show the type and construction of the submarine and, naturally, during the war period, it was considered that to disclose what was put forward as a secret construction and new improvements to a ship would, of course, vitally prejudice the safety of the State. Notwithstanding that, the courts were very reluctant to accept the fact that the State claimed the privilege.</P>
      <P>That rolled on to a few other cases. There is a very well-known one of a man called Ellis against the Home Office.  Again, it was a civil action. The man had been put on remand and sent to one of the English jails.  He found himself assaulted and very violently assaulted by another prisoner, a man who was a convict.  He discovered that this convict had been under medical treatment and he naturally made a complaint that a person who was under restraint as a prisoner should not have been allowed to wander around a jail and certainly should not have had access to the weapon with which he hit Ellis.  Again, the State claimed privilege for the disclosure of the medical documents in that case.  Again, it was a civil action.  There are a couple of matrimonial cases.  Broom is one and I cannot recall the name of the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country, the whole matter was discussed in great detail in a case <Col N="499" /> taken against a person called Simpson in connection with what was called an indecent play.  It was sought to put a police officer into the witness box and to ask him what his instructions were in going down to see this play.  The matter of privilege was raised and was claimed.  In the course of the judgment of the President of the High Court, which is the most detailed of the three judgments given, very definitely attention is called to the fact that occasionally an effort is made to get disclosure prohibited in connection with criminal matters.  That was left open as a moot point.</P>
    <P>There is a great difference between what the Minister is talking of and what is proposed here.  The matter the Minister is talking of is simply where the State claims privilege, either on the ground that the disclosure of the document would prejudice the safety of the State or that it was intended to facilitate administrative action so that those who belonged to Departments of Government might write minutes freely without any belief afterwards that they would be disclosed to the public.  Surely that is an entirely different matter from bringing a charge of a criminal type and founding it on a document and then saying to the court: &ldquo;We will not let you look at that document?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The case will be made under Section 4, if it is enacted, that a person shall not communicate any official information to any other person unless he has been authorised to do so.  To get the gist of the proposal, you have to look back to earlier sections.  According to the definitions, &ldquo;official information&rdquo; is information &ldquo;which is secret or confidential or is expressed to be either and which is or has been in the possession, custody or control of a holder of a public office.&rdquo;  The holder of a public office includes a person of ministerial rank or the rank of Parliamentary Secretary, so in order to prove an offence, all that has to be shown is that someone ranking as a public official had a document and that the Minister certified that the document which was secret and confidential was communicated to someone else.  There is no <Col N="500" /> question of what is called a guilty mentality.</P>
    <P>There is the case which Deputy Sweetman talked about of the matters which will come to the hands of a Minister for Finance a few days before he makes his Budget Statement, but that is a special type of document.  So far as my memory goes, every Cabinet document that comes to the hands of members of the Government is labelled &ldquo;Secret and Confidential&rdquo;.  Supposing one of those documents was very much out of date.  During my time in office, a departmental committee considered a television service.  They submitted a big report marked, &ldquo;Secret and Confidential&rdquo;. That report was completely out of date a couple of years after, but it was still a secret and confidential document.  If I, being a member of the Government, communicated that document in the sense of throwing it into a wastepaper basket, or sending it to a wastepaper merchant, all the Minister has to show is that he certifies that the document is secret and confidential. The courts need not look at the document, according to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I turn to the penalty section, Section 13, in which certain penalties are laid down.  According to subsection (2):</P>
    <P>A person shall be triable summarily for any offence under this Act and on conviction shall be liable to a fine not exceeding one hundred pounds or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both.</P>
    <P>How is the judge to determine the penalty, if he has not seen the document? According to the Minister, all he has is a statement from some member of the Government that it is a secret and confidential document.  How will he determine between a fine of £5 and a fine of £100, and a term of imprisonment of a week and a term of imprisonment of six months?  How can he understand what is the gravity of the offence, unless he looks at the document?  The two things are completely distinct.</P>
    <P>The State claims privilege for documents and it wants to safeguard information, but it does not base a prosecution on that.  It is a vast extension of <Col N="501" /> that.  That is a procedure which has been very seriously criticised by judges in England.  It only came under real consideration in the Simpson case because there was a very definite acceptance of the line laid down in the Camell Laird case with reservations in regard to criminal matters.  It is the gravity of the offence that decides the penalty, and yet we are told that the judge will decide in blinkers.</P>
    <P>In the penalty section, it may be summary trial before a district justice, or else it may be trial on indictment. If it is trial on indictment, a jury will have to try the matter.  How will a jury decide whether or not the offence is serious, unless they get a look at the document or get some disclosure?  I have a later amendment down to the effect that a person shall not &ldquo;in any manner prejudicial to the safety of the State&rdquo; communicate any official information.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be looked at in its proper framework.  The two Official Secrets Acts in England are based on preventing spying and prohibiting the taking of maps or plans of dockyards and such places which are official secrets.  We have no such guardianship here.  The Minister just signs a document saying that it is secret and confidential and the judge has to take that.</P>

      <P>I want to point out to the House and to the Minister that the requiem of the individual's liberty is enshrined in the words: &ldquo;It is not practical.&rdquo;  There was never a man railroaded into jail by a tyrannical Executive whose incarceration was not justified on the grounds that it was not practical to make exceptions to the general rule, and if an individual suffered, administration required that that should be so.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is right.  I think we must make it practical to protect the individual liberty of every citizen of the State.  Deputy Sherwin's individual liberty is just as important as mine or the Taoiseach's, and it does not in the least reconcile me to the fact that Deputy Sherwin should be trampled upon that it is not practical to take proper precautions to see he cannot be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not informed as to the subject matter of the case to which the Minister refers which he describes as a case of the Queen's Bench of 1960 in Great Britain.  I am dealing with the situation as I know it in Ireland.  It is not my function&mdash;it should not be thrust upon me&mdash;to rewrite the Minister's legislation but there is another amendment on the Order Paper, No. 10, which seeks to substitute the words <i>&ldquo;prima facie&rdquo;</i> for &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;.  I would be prepared to meet the Executive by a corresponding provision if argument were to ensue as to whether the <i>prima facie</i> evidence was valid and that argument could be held <i>in camera.</i> I see some force in the proposition that the Executive claims the whole subject matter of the charge is the unauthorised revelation of a confidential document. The defence says: &ldquo;We say it is not a confidential document.  If it were at one time it constitutes no threat to the State today to publish its contents.  We <Col N="503" /> are prepared to prove that.&rdquo; Under this section, as drafted by the Minister, the judge must say: &ldquo;You will not get the chance.  The Minister's certificate ends argument.  The law does not allow me to hear your argument.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would suggest to the Minister that, instead of providing that, it would be reasonable to say that the Minister would be entitled by certificate to divest himself of the obligation of proving that the document was confidential and his assertion that it was would establish the <i>prima facie</i> evidence of that fact.  It would then devolve on the defence to rebut that and, if necessary, that part of the pleadings would be held <i>in camera.</i></P>
      <P>So far as I know, in Great Britain today the most secret and confidential matters have been tried out in the courts <i>in camera</i> but in the presence of a judge and jury and the facts argued at great length in several of the spying trials that have taken place there.  This Official Secrets Bill covers a much wider field than the restricted one envisaged when the first of these Official Secrets Bills was introduced and which were primarily concerned with spying and foreign espionage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case we know it is a regular procedure.  A part of certain proceedings relating to matters dealing with official secrets has been thought proper for <i>in camera</i> hearings. I assume that the Minister for Justice sustains the ordinary proper view that justice ordinarily should be done in public.  I agree with him entirely that there are certain exceptions to that general rule and this could be one of them.  I suggest to him that a reasonable <i>via media</i> here would be, if you retain subsection (3), to provide that the Minister's certificate under seal shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts so certified and introduce on the next Stage of the Bill a further subsection to provide that the argument should be conducted with the courts sitting <i>in camera.</i> That seems to be a reasonable compromise.  It is one which I <Col N="504" /> think the Minister ought to try and if it does not work he can come back to the House and say he tried it but it did not work.  He can then seek further and stronger powers but certainly today he has no case to make for these wide powers when we have not even given a reasonable middle course a trial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words.  Having listened to the arguments of Deputy Dillon, I agree that there should be some form of protection.  The Minister may argue that certain things are not practicable but there should be some form of protection.  It is not impossible that while a document may have been secret and a matter of official concern at some stage, it might at some other stage be of no official concern or danger and be obsolete.  Nevertheless a political person could use it against an opponent in certain cases.  It is not impossible.  That has happened. There ought to be a little protection. I admit the Minister's point that certain things are not practicable but there should be some proviso against an individual being victimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the present position clear and I want to point out to the House that, on balance, we are not making any significant change.  At the present time it is an offence for a person to communicate without authority information which he has obtained as the holder of a public office.  There is no need for the prosecution to establish that the information is secret or confidential. That is the present position. Once the person procures the information as the holder of a public office and discloses it without authority, the prosecution does not have to establish that it is secret or confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are we doing?  We are now providing that the certificate of the Minister will be sufficient to make the thing secret and confidential as far as the courts are concerned but we are restricting official information in relation to which a prosecution could arise to information which is secret and confidential.  To that extent, we are introducing a new restriction.  At <Col N="505" /> the moment, information does not have to be secret or confidential.  The prosecution does not have to prove that.  We are now saying that there can be no offence unless the information is secret or confidential.  To that extent, we are not worsening the position of the accused by one iota.  It will still be open to the accused to argue what he can argue at the moment and that is that the information was not information which he got by virtue of his office.  That is one defence the accused in this sort of circumstance has at present.  The accused can argue that he did not get the information as the holder of a public office.  It will still be open to him to put up exactly the same defence under these provisions.  In effect, we are making no change in the present position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the 1911 Act with me.  I did not know we would get into this detail.  Accordingly, I take what the Minister says with a grain of salt until I get the whole framework of this Bill.  The Minister says that all that has to be proved is that the document is secret and confidential.  That is not so.  The words are: &ldquo;expressed to be secret and confidential.&rdquo;  I thought that sooner or later we would get to the law of conspiracy.  Every criminal law text book quotes with enthusiasm the warning of a famous Irish judge.  Let me quote from one:</P>
      <P>The law of conspiracy is a branch of our jurisprudence to be narrowly watched, to be jealously regarded and never to be pressed beyond its true limits.</P>
      <P>There is an article written in a publication in December of last year.  It is to be found in the Journal of the Society of Public Teachers of Law. It is written by the Professor of Common Law at Liverpool University whose name is Davies.  I will quote one piece of it at page 111 of this volume for December, 1961.  He speaks of conspiracy.  This is the quotation:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some other great modern systems of law get on very well without the crime of conspiracy.  In the course <Col N="506" /> of our legal history, it has been a device used for much dirty work. It is still too frequently the lowest resort of desperate prosecutors.  It has to be kept, and I am ready to admit the possibility that it may very occasionally be useful, it should be under strict restrictions and not with this amplitude of arbitrariness now sanctified by the judicial custodians of our morals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggested a reasonable <i>via media.</i> It is fantastic that the Minister feels this does not create a bigger burden on the defendant than the existing law.  We say it does.  I cannot see why the courts should not inquire into the matter which the Minister has certified as confidential. That inquiry could be <i>in camera.</i> How does that jeopardise the secrecy of the document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to visualise a situation where, say, the defendant's counsel or solicitor might want to get at confidential police reports and that might be prejudicial to the security of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be open to the Minister or the Attorney General to go into court and argue that this is a confidential document and that a report of this character, if published, might cause the whole system to break down.  It would be possible to argue that the contents of the document are so confidential that the police could not carry on if the court allowed it to be opened.  The Minister will remember that that case has been made by the police on occasion and that the courts have refused to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in this context, must think of himself as the enemy of individual liberty.  Otherwise, the whole sense of the judiciary disappears.  Our society is based on the principle that we must have an Executive, that there is a tendency on the part of every Executive in the world to expand its <Col N="507" /> powers over the individual to the point of tyranny and so we have invested the courts with absolute independence so that the humblest citizen of the State can meet the Executive in the courts in the belief that the court will defend his fundamental rights against the Executive in the knowledge that the Executive cannot vent its rage on the independent judiciary.</P>
    <P>All we are asking is that if the Minister instructs the Attorney General to claim that police reports are of such a nature that it would be prejudicial to the welfare of the State to have them put in evidence, the defendant should have the right to say that this is an extravagant claim on the part of the Executive and is an attempt to railroad him into jail, and if the defendant is to have a fair defence to the charges, he should have access to the documents.  It is then for the judge on the Bench to say yea or nay. If the Attorney General comes to the conclusion that in no circumstances could he make the document available, he always has the right to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> and tell the court that the prosecution has no further grounds on which to press the charge and ask to have the prisoner discharged.</P>
    <P>It would then be open to the Minister to say that a situation has arisen now in which a certain type of crime is becoming rampant and that we cannot put an end to it because our sources of information are such that we cannot open them in public without jeopardising our sources of information and breaking down our administration and we have got to come back to Dáil Éireann and tell them our difficulty.  I do not believe that any such possibility exists but it is the spectre of its existence that is being invoked to ask us to give to the Executive powers they should not have.</P>
    <P>Surely the whole State will not fall down if we provide now that the Minister's certificate under seal will do no more than inform the Bench that a certain document is confidential and then the defendant will have to satisfy the judge that he is making a reasonable case and if he can so satisfy the <Col N="508" /> judge, that the Executive shall fail. If the Executive cannot subscribe to that view, they should then drop the prosecution.  In those circumstances, the Minister can come back to Dáil Éireann and inform them that the enforcement of the law has become impossible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, or Irish.  If the Minister comes back to the House and tells us that a series of events has arisen that he cannot control if he has to meet in court a demand for this type of revelation, that a particular evil cannot be abated unless he is given the right to withhold certain documents from the court, then we could consider the matter on its merits.  I am not suggesting that if a man is acquitted of a crime, we should alter the law so as to put him twice in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>It would be no harm for the Minister to remember that in a very great democracy not so far away an Executive recently came to the conclusion that the court which did not bring in the verdict he thought it should bring in should be dissolved and that a new court should be constituted and new charges brought against a prisoner in respect of whose conduct a verdict had already been given.  It is wonderful what Executives can do when they feel strongly enough about something.  I am concerned to provide that the Executive in Ireland should not have that power and that they will have to satisfy a judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see that in this case they might reasonably have to ask for <i>in camera</i> proceedings.  That system ought to be given a trial before the Oireachtas is asked to provide that a defendant has no right of appeal, once the Minister has given a certificate under his seal. That is a horrid principle which this House would never be justified in accepting and I would want far more <Col N="509" /> convincing arguments in its favour than any the Minister has attempted to produce here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I can visualise the Minister finding himself in a difficult position if he accepts the amendment but that is the essence of freedom, that a citizen can embarrass and inconvenience the Administration.  This provision is indicative of the trend of the times.  Things are being made easy for the Executive and for the Minister. I do not see any reason why a Minister should be able to give a certificate and say to a defendant: &ldquo;You be damned; I say so and that is conclusive&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned with what the Minister can or cannot do at the moment, but it is only right that the Minister should realise that it is dangerous for him, or for some of his successors, or for some Minister of the future, to be able to say by giving a certificate that a certain thing is of such a type that heavy penalties <Col N="510" /> can be imposed on a citizen because a Minister says that it is secret and confidential.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  It might be inconvenient for him to do so but the principle involved is very important. It should be as precious to the Minister as it is to the House.</P>

The Minister says: &ldquo;I cannot envisage any conceivable circumstances in which such a situation could arise and if it did arise, we might as well abandon democracy.&rdquo;  I do not want to go rambling back over the history of this country but I have lived through periods in this country in which this kind of thing could happen and did happen.  I well remember two distinguished citizens of this State, one a high Army officer, being charged in court with what I am satisfied were wholly frivolous charges.  Fortunately, they were so framed that the persons concerned were in a position to defend themselves and did defend themselves. I heard with my own ears in this House the head of the Executive point to a colleague of mine on these <Col N="513" /> benches and say that he had confidential information that he was seen travelling in a motor car in the streets of Dundee with a British Minister.</P>

      <P>Yes, the Minister for War.  Strange things can happen in a democracy.  So long as the institutions of democracy are maintained sacrosanct, they can be put into operation and the extravagances of an angry Executive can be brought under control.  I have seen the institutions of democracy strained to their limit and strained to a point where they would have broken in many other countries than this.  I often think we do not give ourselves sufficient credit for the fact that under the immense stresses that were undergone in this country, we maintained the institutions of democracy successfully and made them work.  I do not want to be driven now into the position of recalling all these lurid interludes in my personal memory, and there were even more violent interludes in the five years before I became a member of this House.  Many of these participants in these events look back on them with, I think, some dismay.  In fact, I have heard certain participants in these events state from those benches where the Minister is now sitting that if they had known as much at the time as they now know, they would never have done the things they did.  But they did them, and it was only because the machinery of democracy was functioning that we were able to control the situation then and get through without irretrievable damage being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is always wise for a legislature to envisage the circumstances in which some individual finds himself face to face with the Executive in defence of his own individual liberty.  I ask the House to remember that in 90 per cent. of such cases, the individual who is defending himself is sometimes unpopular.  Popular opinion is probably against him.  He is charged with a crime that commands no sympathy and there is a kind of presumption in the public <Col N="514" /> mind generally that, if a person is charged with such a crime, there cannot be all that smoke without some fire, and he is therefore unpopular, and alone.  He might have considerable difficulty in any event in getting solicitor and counsel to represent him. Far from the State depriving him of any right effectively to defend himself before the judiciary, our concern ought to be that the more unpopular he is, the more solicitous we should be that justice should be done; and we ought clearly to see that justice is done, even at great inconvenience to the Executive. That is the test of a free society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes; it is.  I am claiming that the person who stands in the dock shall be entitled to say to an independent judge: &ldquo;The certificate given by the Minister is bad because it is certifying what is not true.  I want to argue that before an independent judge and, if I cannot argue that, I have no answer to this indictment.&rdquo;  It is, I think, quite shocking that we should create a situation in which a man can stand in the dock and say to the court: &ldquo;If I can penetrate the veil of secrecy which the Minister has thrown over the really relevant document in this case, I can prove that the Executive is wrong, that I am right, and that I am entitled to go free.&rdquo;  Then the judge from the bench must reply: &ldquo;You cannot penetrate the veil of secrecy.  There is no power in this court to give you that liberty.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask one question: If anybody is so affected will any Deputy feel easy in his conscience?  The more we reprobate the action in respect of which the person is charged, the more unhappy we must be that he is in a position to say: &ldquo;If I could have the <Col N="515" /> real fact of this issue tried by an independent judge, I could not be convicted.  The only way they could succeed in convicting me was by depriving me of the right to get the evidence examined by an independent tribunal.&rdquo;  If that is the case, and if such a defendant and his counsel throw in their hand and say: &ldquo;If we have the right to argue our case, we will succeed, but if we are denied that right by the Minister's certificate, we cannot succeed and we cannot successfully defend our liberty&rdquo; will there be any Deputy satisfied to see that man go to jail?  I certainly would not be.  But I should be quite prepared to say this man is asking too much if he says: &ldquo;I want the document examined by an independent judge and the opportunity afforded me to establish that it is not of the character certified by the Minister under his seal and, further, I want to argue that in public.&rdquo;  I should be quite prepared to say then that that is an unreasonable stipulation.</P>
    <P>We have an independent judiciary which has ample constitutional safeguards to protect it from any apprehension that the Executive could wreak vengeance upon it.  There must be reasonable regard for the fundamental safety of the State as well as for the integrity and freedom of the individual, and these two things must be reasonably weighed.  We are prepared to lean over backwards to vindicate the integrity and liberty of the individual, but not to the point of prejudicing the whole safety of the State.  Accordingly, if the court decides these documents require examination, then the State replies that that examination must be conducted <i>in camera.</i> I think that would be a reasonable stipulation.  Bearing everything in mind, I put it to my colleagues in Dáil Éireann, would that not be a reasonable stipulation?  Would we not all agree that if a man has the opportunity of making his case before a judge&mdash;I would be prepared to say, if needs be, for the purpose of that argument, the jury should withdraw and the matter should be one to be determined by the judge&mdash;that would <Col N="516" /> be a safeguard?  I am prepared to go a long way to meet the Minister in the matter of secrecy in relation to matters of this kind, but we should not go the length of saying that a defendant charged with a grave crime under this official secrets code is denied the right of arguing the merits of his case, once the Minister has given his certificate under seal.</P>
    <P>I do not believe any responsible member of the Minister's Party agrees with him in that.  I very much doubt that the Minister himself believes in what he is now trying to sell Dáil Éireann.  I suggest to him that it is a salutary thing on occasion to say: &ldquo;Very well; this case is very strongly pressed upon me by the Opposition on the ground of safeguarding the principle of the protection of individual liberty.  As Minister for Justice, that should be my prime concern.  I will give yield to this demand, but I want it clearly understood that, if the administration of the official secrets code breaks down under this demand, and I find myself in the position that I have to instruct the Attorney General to seek a <i>nolle prosequi</i> because I cannot reveal the contents of a document, I shall come back and seek thereafter that this obligation upon me will be removed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If such a situation arose, which I cannot imagine arising, then I could imagine the Minister getting a very much more sympathetic hearing from Dáil Éireann, as he certainly would from me.  But, on the facts as we know them to-day, no valid case is made for the retention of the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; and therefore we ought to substitute for it the words <i>prima facie</i> or omit it altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to remind the Leader of the Opposition that, on a previous occasion here, when he put a case to me regarding the rights of an accused person, I saw the force of his argument and accepted the proposition which he put to me.  I merely remind the Deputy of that to prove that I am capable of such persuasion but I am not persuaded in this case. I am absolutely convinced that Deputy <Col N="517" /> Dillon has the wrong end of the stick in this instance.</P>
      <P>First of all, let me deal with the suggestion that we should give this a run and, then, if it does not work, come back here with an alternative proposal.  I think I could be criticised very severely, and rightly criticised, if I were to attempt anything of that nature.  Last night in this House it was argued very trenchantly by Deputy Dr. Browne that it would be a grave dereliction of duty on my part if I were to propound certain proposals in a Bill and then subsequently to withdraw them.  Surely, if Deputy Dr. Browne's argument is valid and if that criticism is being made in this House, then I am entitled to think it is not a very desirable practice to bring in a Bill here and to say: &ldquo;This is only experimental.  If it does not work, we shall try something else.&rdquo;  That is not the right approach.  We should try to make this Bill as sound as we can; we ought not to try to put in something and salve our conscience by saying: &ldquo;If it does not work, we can always change it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let us come to the actual merits of the case.  There was this flaw in Deputy Dillon's argument.  I have pointed out here that what is being done in this Bill now is nothing more or less than what exists at present.  Deputy Barrett admits that.  He says he does not care what happened in the past and that he is interested only in what we are doing here and now.  Deputy Dillon has reminded us of certain turbulent times through which this country has passed. If the present situation obtained in those difficult, turbulent times and did not give any grounds for abuse, are we not entitled to assume that, in the comparatively calmer times that we are in at present and which presumably lie ahead, there will not be any particular ground for anxiety?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that a Minister's certificate be regarded as <i>prima facie</i> evidence and that then, if necessary, the case could be held <i>in camera</i> is no solution.  As I said, it is not very difficult at all to visualise a situation where a disclosure to the defendant or to his legal advisers could be <Col N="518" /> prejudicial to the safety of the State. Hearing a case <i>in camera</i> does not get you out of that difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the nature of things, it must be a Minister.  You could have a document which, on its face, is a perfectly innocuous one.  But the Minister&mdash;maybe the Minister for External Affairs or the Minister for Justice&mdash;aware of all the circumstances, knows that if some seemingly innocent piece of information in that document is disclosed, it will mean something to somebody else, to somebody not in court, maybe, but to somebody who will use it to the detriment of the public interest.  The judge could not possibly be in a position to know that, unless the Minister came into court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What guarantee is contained in the Bill that the Minister, knowing the circumstances, will not act politically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that in a moment.  As I said, it is very dangerous to suggest that the judge should be the ultimate arbiter in this case.  He cannot be.  Only a Minister, having his responsibility for his Department, and, as often as not, for the security and welfare of the State, can decide whether or not a particular piece of information can safely be disclosed. It does not require much imagination to visualise a document which, to a judge or jury, would appear perfectly innocent but which, to some <Col N="519" /> outside persons, would be of particular value.</P>
      <P>What are we dealing with here? We are dealing primarily with a public official who discloses confidential information.  I think the real defence of that person should be directed along two channels: either (1) proving he did not disclose the information, or (2) disclosing that he did so but was authorised.  Once he is a public official at all, and discloses information which he is not authorised to do, is he not, <i>prima facie</i>, guilty of an offence?</P>
      <P>This is a situation where we have a public official who has disclosed information that he was not authorised to disclose or disclosed otherwise than in the normal course of his duties. Now, Deputy Dillon wants to direct the whole weight of the argument to whether or not the document is secret or confidential.  That has, in practice, little to do with it.  It is an official's job to keep secrets and not to disclose information in an unauthorised fashion.  Therefore, as I said, I think Deputy Dillon, Deputy Barrett and others are concentrating their fire in the wrong quarter.</P>
      <P>The key point in a prosecution of this kind would not be the confidential nature or secrecy of the document. That is a matter of degree and opinion and, indeed, the only person qualified to say ultimately whether or not the matter is properly secret and confidential is the Minister himself, and that is what we are saying.</P>

      <P>I do not think the Minister really appreciates what he is doing or the problem he is posing to the House.  It seems to me that this matter, which is dealt with in amendments Nos. 9 and 10 in the names of Deputy McGilligan and myself, is of vital importance.  I do not think the Minister, on his statement just now, has shown that he appreciates in any way the importance of what he is asking the House to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister is suggesting in subsection (3) of the Bill that any Minister may, by a certificate, declare any document, or the other matters, codes or seals mentioned in the section, to be secret or confidential and that once that certificate is given, no one can dispute it, not even the Minister's colleagues.  Not even the Taoiseach, the President or any judge in the land can dispute it. All that is necessary is a certificate given by any Minister, no matter how irresponsibly given, no matter how irresponsible the Minister may be. Once that certificate is given, there can be no further argument from any source as to whether or not the information or the document is secret or confidential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister thinks that is necessary to safeguard the security of the State and he argues that only a Minister is in a position to judge, that it would be dangerous to suggest that any member of the judiciary should be allowed to adjudicate on the matter.  That is going altogether too far.  I think the Minister does not appreciate what he is doing.  Remember under a later section&mdash;I think it is Section 6&mdash;the Minister endeavours to deal with the situation where ex-Ministers or ex-Parliamentary Secretaries are in possesson of official information.  Official information by the definition section of <Col N="521" /> the Bill is classed as secret and confidential information and as I see it, all the Minister has to do is to declare that such information is secret and confidential and that is the&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 refers only to handing back documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It refers to handing back documents and it is an offence if the documents are not handed back.  It does not only extend to the requirement of a Minister, it extends to the requirement of a secretary of a Department to hand back documents.  If in a perfectly <i>bona fide</i> way there is a dispute as to whether the documents are such as to be handed back or not, the Minister is asking the House to declare that simply by a certificate of a Minister dubbing them to be secret and confidential, any question in dispute is to be taken out of dispute and arbitrarily settled in that way.  That possibly is only a minor aspect of it, looking at it from the most obvious political point of view; but as Deputy Dillon pointed out, this section, if allowed stand as drafted, is one which can completely take away the rights of the individual as against the Executive.</P>
      <P>I cannot see any sound case and I do not think the Minister has endeavoured to make any strong case, for standing over the wording of the section.  We have gone to the trouble and expense of setting up an independent judiciary and the Minister, and if I remember aright, the Taoiseach, came to this House and urged increases in the salaries of the members of the judiciary on the basis that we are proud to have an independent judiciary and that it is essential to keep them independent.  We all admit we have an independent judiciary but what is the Minister doing now?  He is telling the House that as far as this Bill goes, he will have no confidence in them whatever.</P>

      <P>If it is no good, then the Bill is no good.  If the court decides the document is secret and confidential, is it not quite clear that everyone who has obtained that information and who obtained copies of the documents is liable to prosecution by the State, if after the court hearing, he divulges it to anyone else? The Minister put forward an argument which is extremely dangerous and which possibly he did not intend to make.  If he did, it shows the mind <Col N="523" /> that is operating behind this Bill.  He suggested it might even be dangerous to allow the information, or copies of the documents, into the hands of the defendant's solicitor or counsel. In other words, we have a situation envisaged by the Minister where not only will the Minister be entitled to decide whether or not a document is secret and confidential, or whether or not by virtue of that fact an offence has been committed, and he is going to remove that completely from the judge to decide, but to put a man in the dock and say to him: &ldquo;No matter what your defence is, your legal advisers are not going to be allowed access to this information or to see this document.&rdquo;  That is the Minister's attitude in standing over this section as it is worded.  It is a very dangerous attitude for him to take up. This is a very dangerous section to insert and the Minister would do a better day's work for the State if he departed from his present attitude and agreed to discuss this in a reasonable manner and accepted one or other of these amendments.</P>

I want, however, to bring to the Minister's attention another aspect which I should like him to consider.

      <P>I am, because under this section the Department would be handed on a plate a procedure by which a person&mdash;an individual as in the case of the retired officer about whom we have made an issue&mdash; could be refused all information.  It raises a number of interesting considerations with which I do not want to delay the House now.</P>
      <P>My point is to ask the Minister whether he would in any way consider restricting the operation of a section such as this where routine, or what I might call ordinary matters of State procedure are concerned.  I think the Opposition have gone far too far and are spoiling any real case that could have been made on this section by, first of all, falling into the political temptation themselves for the political reasons they impute to the Minister. In all-round fairness, when they were in Government as when we were, there were equally valid grounds for fearing there would be partisan abuse of a provision like that.  But so far we have had no evidence of justification&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>You had, in effect, such a provision.  The Opposition will not help such arguments as they have by making such accusations, any more than it will help them to make accusations of personal lack of faith or suggestions of ulterior motive.  In the 40 years' history of the House, we have discovered that that kind of thing gets us nowhere.  However, it is legitimate for us to raise with the Minister in a constructive way the question of the operation of such a section outside the field for which it was intended. There is clearly a field in which such a provision is not only desirable but necessary and in present circumstances <Col N="525" /> it is probable that the existing provisions need tightening up in that respect. In that, we must be with the Minister.</P>
      <P>But there is another side of the thing&mdash;the danger that a provision like that will be used simply to certify.  In that connection I want to take one specific case where the proceedings of a court of inquiry were material to a claim.  The Minister for Defence, first of all, based his argument on the fact that a court of inquiry had fixed responsibility on an officer and when it was attempted to press that allegation, all the regulations that could be called upon were used to hide behind and the officer in question would not be given the information which he should have been given.  He was charged in this House, where he had no reply, with certain things and the authority for that was the finding of the court of inquiry.  As I have said, he was refused the finding of the court and every effort made by Deputy Booth and myself to elicit that finding came to nought.  We could not even establish whether the court of inquiry had not found that the officer was not responsible in any way.</P>
      <P>Any information we have been able to get has been by a process of attrition. They cannot prove he was responsible. How simple it would have been for the Minister for Defence in all such cases to certify such a document was a secret document and that would be the end of it.  I am thinking of this in terms of court procedure through which this officer or anybody else had to establish a claim.  I know this is utterly inapplicable to the Minister for Justice at this stage and I think it would be wrong to carry on the line the Opposition have taken in this matter.  It is natural some things would be overlooked in the drafting of a Bill, but in the case I mention, £486 is being withheld from a retired officer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think the Opposition have helped any case they could have made by their more or less extravagant allegations in another direction.  I know there will be cases where different people differ as to whether or not certain claims come into one category or another, but, being realistic in these modern times, one must give a certain amount of power of discretion to a Minister.  On the face of this Bill, I do not think so much heavy weather should be made of that point, but on the smaller technical point of the handling of the claims of individuals as against groups, I should like to suggest the inclusion of some safeguard.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera happens to know a case and happens to be intimately acquainted with it and he is all ablaze with indignation at the point of view taken by the Minister behind a forest of regulations which, taken all together, amount to something closely corresponding to the certificate the Minister here seeks to make conclusive evidence.  Consequently, Deputies de Valera and Booth find themselves ablaze with indignation against their own Minister because they feel a very vulnerable individual is denied simple justice which, they believe, would be readily available to him but for the fact that the Minister for Defence has in effect made the very kind of certificate the <Col N="527" /> Minister for Justice seeks to get through this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When they sought to get a certain record they ran into a forest of regulations which up to now have proved impenetrable.  Every attempt made has been successfully hedged by the production of a new regulation, dredged up out of thousands of defence regulations accumulated over the years.  The Minister for Justice, in this section, is not to have the trouble of searching the whole forest of regulations to find an appropriate existing regulation to short-circuit the person in difficulty.  All I am saying is that if the Minister feels a certificate requires to be made, the case should be heard <i>in camera</i>, before the judge only, to argue whether such a certificate has been capriciously made, and that there are no valid grounds, as Deputy de Valera is at the moment trying to argue with the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy de Valera and Deputy Booth are trying to argue is that you should not be dredging up these regulations to prevent access to information which they consider vital for the vindication of a relatively comparable person's fundamental rights.  He feels a bitter sense of resentment at being frustrated by this sort of regulation. If Deputy Booth and Deputy de Valera found themselves in the position that they could go to the person to whom they refer and say: &ldquo;You have a right to sue the Minister for Defence,&rdquo; they could go into court and say to the judge: &ldquo;All these blooming regulations notwithstanding, the document which I know exists goes to the root of this whole business and, if I could bring its substance before the court, the justice of my claim would be manifest for all to see.  The only thing that stands between me and the vindication of my reputation and my rights are the Minister's regulations which forbid the relevant evidence to <Col N="528" /> be submitted.&rdquo;  That is the right the Minister says we ought to confer on him by statute to do by order.  All we are asking at this stage by these amendments Nos. 9 and 10 is to say it will be open to the defence to argue before the judge <i>in camera</i> that the Minister's order is improperly made and to call evidence to demonstrate that there cannot be a document which would prejudice the safety of the State but that there is much in it vital to his safety and his vindication <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Executive.</P>
    <P>I can conceive of a case of wild extremity in which a judge of appropriate jurisdiction, having heard the Attorney General argue against that proposition, would say: &ldquo;I have come to the conclusion that the Attorney General is wrong, that due consideration was not given to this matter before this order was made, and I am prepared now to hold that this document is not secret within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act and so its contents must be made available for the purposes of the defence.&rdquo;  I can see the Attorney General in such a situation seeking an adjournment in order to consult the Minister for Justice, returning to court and saying: &ldquo;Very well, my lord; in that event, we present no further evidence.  We simply cannot proceed,&rdquo; and letting the fellow go.</P>
    <P>If that situation arose&mdash;and I do not believe it ever will arise because I believe if there were legitimate ground for making such an order, the court would sustain the Minister&mdash;but if such a dilemma were precipitated as I envisage and the Minister came back and said: &ldquo;This is not an isolated case; this is an organised conspiracy and a succession of carefully designed activities which constitute a menace to the State and it is now demonstrably impossible for me to bring these people to justice unless I have that power,&rdquo; I believe the Oireachtas would take another look at it.  I believe it is in anticipation of a dilemma that will not arise that we are asked to withhold from a defendant a very vital and essential need, a need which Deputy Booth and Deputy de Valera themselves have experienced the want of <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Minister for <Col N="529" /> Defence.  It must be pretty exasperating for them to get up in the House and charge their own Minister with the extremities of dredging up archaic regulations to constitute a barrier between them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Dredging up regulations which deprive the Deputies of access to the findings of that court of inquiry.  The Deputy feels a deep sense of grievance on behalf of a man who he considers is suffering an injustice because he cannot have access to the contents of a document which the Deputy feels ought to be made available to him.  In a case where it is not a person's money that is at stake but his good name and his freedom, a question of whether he is going to Mountjoy or to Portlaoise on penal servitude, surely he ought to have a right to go before some judge and say: &ldquo;There is evidence in existence and, if it is laid before the court, my innocence is established.&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was merely a matter of money in the case to which Deputy Booth and Deputy de Valera referred. I am thinking of a case in which a man is faced with incarceration in Portlaoise on penal servitude, a man with a wife and family.  It is a terrible thing to be incarcerated by your own Government on penal servitude.  It is a terrible thing to be convicted of a crime for which this Oireachtas prescribes penal servitude in your own country.  The man I am thinking of is in a much worse position than the person with whom Deputy de Valera is concerned, who is merely claiming £486 worth.  He says that sum should not have been withheld from him and that if the findings of the court of inquiry could have been produced, it would have been manifest that it should not have been withheld.  It is merely a matter of £ s. d.  But the man I am thinking of is saying: &ldquo;I <Col N="530" /> stand in peril of penal servitude.  I can prove that the grounds on which I am being threatened with penal servitude are invalid and that I am entitled to go free, but the Minister's certificate says I may not.  I may not even argue.&rdquo;  Surely that is wrong? Surely we should not at this stage go beyond the limit of saying that the Minister may claim that the obligation to do justice in public must be suspended until the nett issue as to whether this is a confidential document on which the safety of the State depends is argued and determined by an independent judicial process?</P>

We should not do it because it is adminisstratively necessary to do it.  No administrative <Col N="532" /> convenience should justify us for injustice to an individual.  We should be proud of that fact and have regard to it.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not mistrust his own capacity for conceding something to reasoned argument.  If Deputy Dr. Browne does not approve of that procedure, he does not understand the purpose for which he was sent here.  If Parliament ceases to be a place where argument can sway opinions we are wasting time very largely in discussing Bills.  Far from denigrating the Minister for meeting reasoned Opposition amendments, I would applaud him.  I think from his own experience he knows that one consequence of meeting reasonable arguments is the expedition of legislation. It is when Ministers are prevailed upon by a variety of influences to stick their heels in and show how tough they can be, that legislation becomes difficult, and very often unsatisfactory. I do not know if the Minister regrets, or has any reason to regret any of the Opposition amendments which he has so far seen fit to meet, but I am certain he would not regret meeting this&mdash;and think of the peace of mind it would bring to Deputy de Valera.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the arguments here I am satisfied that right is with the Minister.  I think that in his last contribution Deputy Dillon allowed the discussion to be diffused and taken away from the point which he himself put so well the first time he spoke. To some extent the problem in which Deputy de Valera and Deputy Booth certainly have the right really is a problem of the bureaucratic cotton wool which can be produced in enormous bales by the bureaucrats.

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was quite a long time on his feet.  I am talking about bureaucracy and I am perfectly entitled to do that.  I am not in any way taking away from the fact that the Minister is responsible for the decisions taken in the Department and in the House.</P>
      <P>If I may come back to the point at issue.  I think the case made by the Opposition falls on the speech made by Deputy O'Higgins.  When he says we spent two days here talking about the judiciary and come along today and say they are not competent, he is completely missing the whole point at issue, in my opinion.  This matter is political, and we have to face the fact that it is the State and it is political considerations that are involved in this matter.  The Minister is perfectly right when he says it is his responsibility to make decisions when it is a political matter on which there can be no discussion because it is secret and therefore must not go any further.  If he says it may not be discussed in court I think he says so rightly, because if it is of that nature then it should not be discussed anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must base our deliberations here on the premise that Ministers will not exercise their powers irresponsibly.  A good deal of the discussion here has been directed to the consideration of the position that would arise if Ministers were to exercise their authority without responsibility.  I do not think we should discuss it on that basis.  I <Col N="534" /> would go further and say that if by any chance the Minister, or any Minister, should exercise his powers without responsibility, so long as Parliament is here and individual Deputies are able to make representations and pursue their claims for justice with the same single-minded devotion as Deputy de Valera and Deputy Booth have shown in the case which was mentioned today, we will still have sufficient safeguards against the indiscreet exercise of a power which I am convinced, having listened to the debate, the Minister must have.</P>
    <P>I should think this is a sort of situation which would arise very frequently across the Channel.  I am very interested to know from the Minister what is the power which his counterpart in Britain would have in a like situation.  What is the wording of the Act?</P>

      <P>If the power is used in Britain, who claim to be the founders of the type of democracy which we enjoy, they had very good reason for giving the Minister this power in a political matter, in a matter which concerns the political welfare of the State and its people. I think that must be the overriding consideration.  If we begin to argue here a matter of fundamental importance like this on the basis that the Minister will exercise his rights irresponsibly we will never get anywhere at all.</P>

      <P>This is not the responsibility of the House of Commons or of any British MP.  It is the responsibility of Dáil Éireann and the responsibility of every Deputy here including the Minister.  I agree with him when he says that he is open to suggestion and that he is open-minded but he seems to overlook the fact that this is more important than any part of the enactments we will be discussing on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter of the fundamental rights of the individual <i>vis-á-vis</i> the State, the Minister, the Executive and the Administration is at stake here.  The Minister proceeds on a false premise <Col N="535" /> when he tells us that, because in times of stress similar powers enjoyed by Ministers in the past were not in any way abused, we must assume that in future calm times there will not be any abuse.  The Minister is not entitled to assume that we will have calm times ahead at all times.  One of the things we must safeguard is that if there are times of stress again the individual is still safe from any capricious or evil or misinformed Minister who may wish to give a certificate which would prove something conclusively against such individual.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera is quite wrong when he suggests that we have fallen into any political temptation.  We are not making any suggestion against the Minister or any of the Minister's predecessors, or his successors if there could be any such thing as a Fianna Fáil successor to the Minister, but what we must legislate against&mdash;and Deputy de Valera should know this and Deputy Flanagan should know it&mdash;is the worst possible Minister you can imagine on the front benches of whatever Government are in power. We must guard the citizen against that.  The Minister says that only the Minister himself can decide this.  No judge, no court and no number of judges are competent to deal with this matter.  Only the Minister can decide whether a document is secret. He is the only person qualified to do it.  That is the hallmark of dictatorship and a negation of democracy.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to think twice over the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; and to realise that whatever may take place elsewhere it is his responsibility. He should not put a coercive section of this nature into the legislation passed by this House.  I am glad to see that at least some intimations have reached Deputy de Valera that there is some danger in this measure.  I did not quite follow what he meant in everything he said.  I think Deputy de Valera does agree there is some danger in this section.  If so, he should not walk in behind the Minister and vote in favour of a section manifestly dangerous. Deputy de Valera and every other Deputy sitting behind the Minister should realise they should not support <Col N="536" /> any legislation which contains the slightest scintilla of danger to the freedom of the individual.</P>
    <P>I appeal, therefore, to the Minister once more not to take an obdurate pigheaded attitude to the suggestions made from this side of the House, not in any political sense.  I can assure the Minister that if I were sitting behind a Fine Gael Minister for Justice who tried to enact a section of this nature, I would not walk into the lobby behind him and I am sure Deputy O'Higgins would not do so either.  I am horrified when I find two Deputies who have vast legal experience and who sit behind the Minister saying that while they passionately uphold the rights of the individual the Minister is right.  The Minister is not right.  I am quite certain that the Minister knows he is not right but for some reason&mdash;some bug has got into his head&mdash;he refuses to accede in any way to the suggestions we make. I would ask the Minister to give this matter second thoughts.  I should like Deputy de Valera to remember, as Deputy Dillon pointed out, that the difficulties which he and his friend in the Army experienced are nothing compared with the difficulties and the real danger which some citizen could experience under this section if Deputy de Valera and the other Deputies sitting behind the Minister let it get into the statute.</P>

      <P>We are wandering, perhaps, from the precise point at issue.  This Bill deals with safeguards in regard to official information.  With regard to the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;, there must be some protection.  It must be perfectly obvious to all of us in this modern world that where a matter such as is contemplated in this Bill is involved the decision of the Government must be conclusive.  There are Parliamentary procedures and safeguards which can be invoked here but that is a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much as many of us would desire, it is not practicable to go the whole way and expose everything in court or to judges or anywhere else under certain circumstances.  Therefore, for the purposes for which this Bill is drafted, for the contingencies which are directly <Col N="537" /> foreseen and which are the object of this Bill, no other way can be found of dealing with them than to provide generally as this Bill provides.  Perhaps, we will all go that far.</P>
    <P>The question arises as a matter of fact at what stage something is or is not a secret document.  When I was in Opposition, I often adopted the attitude of defence of the individual as against the machine but conscious of all that let us ask ourselves a question.  We have something like the safety of the State.</P>

      <P>These matters&mdash; and I use the term in a general way&mdash; must be matters which for the good of the community must be preserved secret while they are in train, very much as occurs in ordinary business whatever the business may be.  There are certain things which prudence demands should be kept to oneself for a certain period.  The question arises as to where you will have the conclusive authority.  The Minister proposes that the certificate be conclusive.  The Opposition suggest that it be disclosed to a judge or someone like that.  In the first instance, I do not think that is the function of the judiciary. Secondly, there is the real stumbling block that no person outside can assess a whole situation in the same way as the person inside.  It boils down to trusting the Administration in charge provided there are certain safeguards. I believe that the safeguards are here in this House if they are used and that we have got to trust the Administration in charge in these things. Forty years' experience show us that we can trust the Administration.</P>

When one examines it the conclusiveness of the certificate must be allowed to stand.  What I am more concerned with is whether one could restrict the field and I would suggest adding the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this Act&rdquo; in order to do so.  If we do this I cannot see that the dangers which have been hypothetically raised will come into the Bill at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is purpose number one.  Purpose number two is that if such information should become disclosed it will be possible to restrict the damage that will be done and have sanctions visited on anyone who has disclosed it.  Those are totally different things.  The purposes of the Act are pretty clear and I can only invite the Deputy to read the Act because I do not suppose I would be permitted to read it section by section. The purposes of the Act are pretty clear and I think that in our hearts everyone realises the necessity for some such Act and would be reasonable in his approach to it.</P>
      <P>What the Deputies are afraid of, and what I am afraid of, is the application of the Act outside the purposes of the Act for purposes which are not foreseen.  It is the legislative duty of the Opposition to devote its attention to that aspect of the matter.  I think that if the Opposition withdrew the opposition to the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; it would help the Minister somewhat. If there were some restrictions on the application of the certificate to the purposes of the Act then the points we are all making would be met and the Bill would be safe enough after that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few things on this section because it does appear to me, having listened attentively to the debate, that there is a very serious issue involved in this proposal.  Certainly the subsection as it stands smacks of draconian legislation in the extreme.  The Minister has said that there is no real change in the law.  Even if that were so that would be no reason why we should not examine afresh a measure of this kind.  That examination is often necessary even where a Minister, in relation to any particular matter, tells the House &ldquo;that <Col N="540" /> has been the law up to this&rdquo;.  I always feel that approach is unsound.  We know that in the past there has crept into legislation certain provisions which would not have been contained in it if the members concerned had examined it fully.  One wrong, repeated, does not add up to a right.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that in this subsection he is seeking to legislate to maintain a position which already obtains.  I wonder is that correct.  I have looked at the legislation which obtains at the moment and I do not see in the Acts of 1911 or 1920 any provision similar to that contained in this subsection here.  The Minister at some stage might indicate where that power is and what the actual legislative provision is that he has in mind, where he is given a power which can affect every one of us in this House and every individual outside whether he is a public servant or not.  The Minister is quite wrong, and I rather feel that he made the statement to stop a gap, in saying this can apply only to civil servants&mdash;</P>

      <P>Primarily or not, the Minister knows well that this Bill can extend or apply to any citizen or non-citizen.  From my own point of view, I have upstairs in a locker a number of copy documents which I feel I was perfectly entitled to put into my brief case when I left the Department of Health.  I have them and I stated here quite openly that I have such documents, as has many another former Minister.  The Minister will find himself one day no longer Minister for Justice &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be retiring anyway.  Is the situation to be, as has happened in the course of debates here recently, that accusations may be made by the Government in relation to an ex-Minister <Col N="541" /> on this side of the House when he proceeds to refer to the fact of the existence of a document and to the contents of a document?  The accusation was made: &ldquo;That is an official secret.&rdquo;  That happened here in the recent past.  Are we to stand idly by and give a power now to a member of the Executive to certify that fact and, having done so, proceed to arrest the person concerned and deprive him of any possibility of defending himself?</P>
      <P>As the section stands, the Minister's certificate ends the matter.  The Minister becomes both prosecutor and judge in the same case and then the Minister says: &ldquo;That is the law at the moment.&rdquo;  I assert it is not the law and I should be interested to hear the Minister refer to his authority for that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is the Common Law.  Glory be to the Lord&mdash;to hear the Minister for Justice, who is supposed to have acquired some knowledge of law, making a statement of that kind! That is absurd.  I now believe what I felt before is a fact, that the Minister was bluffing in this respect.  There is no similar provision that I can find in either British Statute Law or our law here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister came in here and made a statement irresponsibly that he was merely providing for the reenactment or repetition of the law up to this.  It is indicative of the mind behind this provision.  I have grave suspicions that this is an effort on behalf of the Minister to get a convenient power into his hands, a power which undoubtedly could be abused. The Bill does not apply only to civil servants.  It can apply to anyone who has, or who has had, a document in his possession which can be the subject of a certificate by the Minister. That person is then amenable to a criminal prosecution and is deprived of all defence.  Let us realise how deep this goes.  If this section were passed the Minister would have the <Col N="542" /> power to certify not only a document that now exists but any document back in the distant past to be a secret document.  He can, if given this power, go back into the past and any certificate he gives could have retrospective effect.  That is a very serious power. It is no use saying it will not be abused.  Deputy Dillon and Deputy Barrett were perfectly correct in saying one should test these powers by the possibility of abuse.</P>
    <P>This is a political measure.  By reason of the object of the Bill it is inevitably bound to deal with politics or political matters and matters of concern to the State defined, as they must be, by the opinions of the Government in office for the time being.  Therefore, as a political measure, it is highly susceptible to abuse.  Being a political measure and being decided on political considerations, it is more than possible that any power contained in a Bill of this kind could be irresponsibly exercised.  Therefore, we should not give this power to a Minister unless we are clearly satisfied that there is no new departure, that it is not a new power and that it is absolutely essential in the interests of the State.  In my view, having listened to the debate, the Minister has made no case whatever for getting this power and I regret to say he has tried to deceive the House by asserting that this, in fact, is no change in the law. When he finds this power is not already in Statute Law he goes further and says: &ldquo;You will find it in the Common Law.&rdquo;  I should like to find a principle of our Common Law which lays down, or could permit, a person to be charged with an offence and deprived of the possibility of defending himself.  If that is the Minister's view of the ordinary conventions or rules of this State it is highly uncommon law.</P>

      <P>It is here. This is a very extreme power sought by the Executive.  If we had here a Minister who was prepared, in a reasonable way, to take the House into his confidence and make a case for the power he sought I have little doubt that on this side we should have gone a great distance with him. Instead, we have a Minister, in a cocksure boasting way, saying: &ldquo;This only applies to my servants and I should be in a position to certify in relation to my servants whether a document is secret or not.&rdquo;  Of course it transpires that that is not so.  It applies to a whole variety of people who may never have seen service in the Civil Service, and the Minister says: &ldquo;There is no real change in the law.&rdquo;  It transpires that is not so and here is a new power to be put covertly into a Bill to be exercised on political considerations by the Minister for the time being.  I assert we cannot afford to give that power on the case made to any Minister and least of all to the present Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall make my own case.  I shall not be expelled from the Party or anywhere else.  I take a <i>prima facie</i> case in the concept of something that is ultimately to have effective sanction, to be one that requires an answer.  Therefore, whoever the suspect may be, once the Minister is in the position that he has a case to answer, he has achieved the purpose of bringing into the arena the problem of whether or not somebody has abused an official secret or an official document. It would be well for people like Deputy de Valera, who, I believe, has a conscience in relation to such legal considerations, to consider the difference between &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that, no matter what present circumstances may be, if this measure reaches the statute book in its present form, it could be open to the most violent abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suggest there is something esoteric or sinister in the power the Minister seeks.  What is wrong is that the Minister deliberately refuses to see the potential danger.  It is well known in our experience of this House that Ministers do not like to see the spoiling of the child they christened.  However, I am asking the Minister for Justice who is trained in law and, I understand, highly qualified in other fields of <Col N="545" /> general public administration and knowledge, to sit back and view this in a calm deliberate way and not on the basis that we are trying to thwart him or create unreal opposition.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do is to get the Minister to realise that once the necessity for an answer to a case has been established, the normal line of evidence and the normal circumstances surrounding any criminal or quasi-criminal prosecution will come into being.  The Minister is as well aware as I am, from our experience of the criminal and common law in this country, that wherever a <i>prima facie</i> case is established, 95 per cent. of the subsequent prosecutions ultimately lead to a conviction in relation to the crimes named.  I would much prefer to see the odd percentage go free completely than have vested in some Government who might subsequently come into office an arbitrary authority whereby they could certify all kinds of documents in a situation of expediency or political difficulty and in that way cause the elimination of political opponents and others.</P>
    <P>We have a tradition that we guard fearlessly in this country of being unquestionably fair to the individual. Let us for a moment examine the principle behind the type of certificate that this Bill purports to give authority to the Minister to issue.  If there is any unscrupulousness, not necessarily in the Minister but behind the scenes in any senior officers of the public service, we might find a Minister influenced wrongly by some officer who is advising him because of rivalry between people who are his servants, so that this Bill itself could be used for the purpose of eliminating one of them.</P>
    <P>I am all in favour of giving any Government the right to control the type of information that is vital, the type of document that is germane to the wellbeing of the State.  That can be done by proper safeguards within the law rather than the transfer of an arbitrary power to an executive authority.  We have had too long an experience of that type of legislation and I can tell the Minister that in another code, where this certificate of <Col N="546" /> the Minister is to be taken as conclusive, all kinds of difficulties arise because sometimes it is patent on the face of these certificates that they are dishonest and we find ourselves involved in <i>certiorari</i> or <i>mandamus</i> to get orders quashed.</P>
    <P>I hope my former circuit colleague, Deputy de Valera, will persuade the Minister that once he has got the situation that he can insist on an answer and a defence being raised to the issue, he has enough authority to have the full implications of such a breach of secrecy dealt with.  It would be better that in the normal way this type of legislation should be non-controversial, that we should try to achieve the type of legislation that weighs the scales of justice very fairly.  I have very serious doubts whether this Bill, enacted with this section as it stands, will bear the light of the test of constitutionality because it is a complete infringement in its present form of the ultimate right of the individual.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have a second look at the impact of the section.  It is part of the training through which we go, and the type of life we have to lead as lawyers, that we very often have to take a second and a third view of a situation.  I appeal to the Minister not to close his mind to rational, logical submission.  I appeal to him to ensure that this piece of legislation will enshrine in the statute book the principles for which we are all presumed to stand.  One of those principles is the right of every man to be deemed innocent until he is proved guilty.  In this case, the Minister is arrogating to himself the power in certain circumstances to say to a man: &ldquo;You are guilty.  I say it.  I say it conclusively, and that is an end of it.&rdquo;  I ask the non-lawyer Deputies behind the Minister to search their consciences to see if this is in keeping with any of the principles basic and common to all our beliefs.</P>

      <P>I am surprised the Minister has not made another effort to meet the House on this.  It must be clear to him by now that we on these benches take a very <Col N="547" /> serious view of this proposal.  When this matter was raised by Deputy Dillon, myself, and others on the Second Reading, the Minister gave an assurance that the views expressed then on these benches were worthy of weighty consideration and would receive that consideration from him. When these amendments were moved today, the Minister's attitude was simply to inform the House that he was not accepting the amendments, without giving any explanation whatsoever, and without making any defence whatsoever of the section as it stood.</P>

      <P>The Minister informed the House that he was not accepting these amendments.  These amendments are, of course, narrower than amendment No. 7 which was to delete the subsection.  The Minister later intervened, after Deputy Dillon had addressed the House on the subject, and gave his reasons for upholding the section as it stands with the inclusion of the word &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; in relation to the Minister's certificate.  I suggested before&mdash;I suggest it again now&mdash;that the Minister has not made any strong case as to why this extraordinary power to be vested in the Minister under the subsection should be retained in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister fully understands what he is asking the House to do.  I do not believe that either he or his advisers, when this section was being drafted, fully realised the extent of the field they were opening up.  I do not think the Minister realised, until it was pointed out to him here in the House, the various consequences which a misuse of ministerial power under this subsection could have.  I want to point out to the Minister that, having heard the discussion here, he is now left under no illusions whatever.  He is now aware of the consequences which could ensue from an abuse of the powers he will be given under this subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="548" /> It is, I think, reasonable to ask the Minister now, having heard the discussion in the House, having heard the views put forward from these benches, having heard the strength of the arguments put forward, that he should pause and reconsider the matter further. So far as I am concerned, this is a vitally important matter which affects, or may affect, the security of the freedom of individuals when up against the decisions, as they would be, of the Executive&mdash;the decision of a Minister to declare a particular document to be secret and confidential.  In the course of his remarks, the Minister adopted the attitude of saying that these are documents which belong to the Minister, ministerial documents, and he, and he alone, is the person who should have the right to decide in dealing with his servants&mdash;even allowing the phrase as intended to apply to civil servants&mdash;what should be done with these documents and what should not be done with them.</P>
    <P>In arguing in that way, the Minister over-simplifies the situation.  It is not as simple as that at all.  In the arguments the Minister has made, he has not had any regard to the fact that this power could be used retrospectively; he has not had any regard to the fact, which is abundantly clear from the wording of the Bill, that the Minister, or any of his colleagues, could immediately, on the passing of this Bill, declare to be confidential by means of a certificate any document which passed through the hands of any ex-Minister or any ex-Parliamentary Secretary since the State was first established.  The Minister overlooks the fact that it would be open to him under the terms of this Bill to declare the passport of any individual in this State to come within the terms of a certificate issued by him, or any licence, or permit.  The subsection as it stands may go a great deal further than what would ordinarily be regarded as confidential documents in the sense that they deal, in some way, with the safety or security of the State.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out to the Minister, and this is an argument to which he must have regard if <Col N="549" /> he approaches this in a reasonable manner, the danger is not so much in the case of a Minister who exercises these powers in a reasonable and judicious manner, but rather the danger is that these powers may be abused.  It is proper that we should have regard to the fact that that danger exists.  Whatever legislation is passed here does not apply merely to existing Ministers.  It applies to the Ministers who will be in office after the next general election and to those who will be in office following that again, down through the years.</P>
    <P>If there is danger of abuse, if there is danger of a serious situation arising and serious consequences for individuals if those powers are abused, the Minister must take that into account.  He has not done so. His attitude has been that it might be dangerous to leave it to the judiciary to decide whether or not information should be regarded as confidential or documents should be regarded as secret.  I think his phrase was that it would be dangerous to allow a judge to be the arbiter in these matters, if they dealt with the safety of the realm and that the Minister is the only person who would be in a position to come to a decision by reason of facts within his knowledge.</P>
    <P>As I said before, that is an extremely dangerous attitude for the Minister to adopt.  The whole subsection, so long as the Minister includes in it &ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; in relation to evidence, is a bad subsection.  The Minister challenged Deputy Seán Collins as to whether or not the phrase <i>prima facie</i> had any meaning.  I do not know whether the Minister was serious in that interjection. If he was serious, I suggest that he ask his advisers to look up some of the other pieces of legislation where I think that phrase is actually used.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear, I think, to the Minister and to everyone else what the phrase means and what it is intended to mean in this particular context.</P>

      <P>I want to comment on what has been said.  Hearing what has been said, I am inclined to agree somewhat with the Minister.  It is suggested here that a document which could be dangerous if the contents became known should be allowed to be known to a court, <i>in camera.</i> I am satisfied it would then no longer be a secret.  There is an old saying that what is known to two people is no longer a secret.  Whatever excuse there might be for suggesting the judge ought to know, there is no excuse for suggesting that anyone else should, as it would be dangerous.  The Minister is correct and there are counsel who may not be trusted. There is plenty of evidence that people in high places are actually spies and that they talk and that their wives let it be known what their husbands have said.  Anybody who examines how the Russians got confidential information about the atom bomb will discover that the information came from very high and reliable quarters.  During the last war, one high and mighty individual in Japan was a spy, although he was actually in the confidence of the Japanese Cabinet.  I am satisfied that once a thing is known to a number of people, it is no longer a secret but there might be a point that the judges should be made aware of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether in the event of Ireland becoming a member of the European Economic Community it will be necessary to repeal (a) the Control of Manufactures Acts and (b) the provisions of the Finance Acts imposing rates of stamp duties on the purchase of land by non-Irish nationals at a higher level than that imposed on Irish nationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 7 of the Treaty of Rome prohibits, within the sphere of application of the Treaty and without prejudice to the special provisions mentioned therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality.</P>
      <P>Articles 52 to 58 contain special provisions which, in general, require that existing restrictions on rights of establishment of nationals of a member State in the territory of another member State be progressively abolished in course of the transitional period, which expires in December, 1969.</P>
      <P>These provisions are to be implemented in detail by means of measures to be taken by the Council of the Community.  I understand that, while some progress has been made in this work, no binding decisions have yet been taken.  It is, therefore, not possible, at this stage, to say precisely what modifications in the legislation referred to in the Question would be required in the event of our becoming a member of the European Economic Community.  It is clear, however, that in principle, membership would involve the eventual elimination of any provision discriminating against nationals of other member States.</P>

      <P>Is it not also abundantly clear there is nothing in the Treaty of Rome to restrict or control our domestic legislation in respect to land acquisition for such purposes as the relief of congestion or the other social purposes for which we have been so utilising our land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is correct. There is also included in the Articles of the Treaty of Rome a qualification which makes that right subordinate to the principle of agricultural policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is it a fact that the Council of Ministers and the legislation that will be enacted when the Common Market comes into operation will override certain aspects of national legislation and in view of that, in the matter of land legislation is it not quite clear the intention is to allow the people of these European countries to purchase land here on the same basis as Irish nationals, and in view of that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the national average retail prices of the food items included in the Consumer Price Index at mid-February 1957, at mid-May 1961 and at mid-May 1962, and the actual increase or decrease in each case and (b) the percentage changes in the price of all items entering into the Consumer Price Index between February 1957, May 1961 and May 1962.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report, a statement showing (a) the national average retail prices of certain items of food at mid-February 1957, mid-May 1961 and mid-May 1962, and the actual changes in the two periods involved, and (b) the percentage change in prices of all items entering into the Consumer Price Index between these periods.  In the case of items, other than certain food items, no attempt is made to obtain quotations for an identical quality of the different articles in all areas and, therefore, any average prices computed would not be meaningful. The correctness of the relative price changes is ensured by the fact that at each source the identical article is priced at successive enquiries.  Price quotations in respect of some items of food are not available from all centres at each inquiry and the figures for the percentage changes in these prices as given in (b), computed in such a way as to eliminate the effect of differences in coverage, may differ slightly from the percentages calculated from (a).</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate in the Official Report a statement giving the particulars requested by the Deputy in respect of the year 1956, which is the most recent year for which a complete Census of Distribution was carried out.  The analysis included in the final report of that census, recently issued under the title &ldquo;Census of Distribution 1956-1959&rdquo; (Presentation Number 5760), contains a section dealing with sales per head of population, from which the particulars given in the statement have been abstracted.</P>

The general question has, however, been under consideration and a particular approach to the problem is at present being tried out. In the meantime, I would again direct attention to the fact that, as I intimated in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 22nd February last, there is no legal barrier to obtaining, for the very meritorious purpose of restoring sight to the living, the eyes of deceased persons if the consent of the next-of-kin is forthcoming.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons injured in accidents form only a small minority of those whose <Col N="574" /> treatment in hospital is the responsibility of health authorities and I do not accept that the relatively insignificant impost on the ratepayers and taxpayers involved would justify a departure from the present position.</P>

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company Limited transferred, with effect from 1st January, 1947, its entire business to <Col N="577" /> the Irish Assurance Company Limited. As part of the assets of the Amalgamation Company, the statutory deposits were transferred to the Irish Assurance Company in accordance with the merger agreement.  I understand that the transfer of the deposits took place in 1948 and that the consent of the policy holders of the Amalgamation Company was not obtained as such consent was not necessary.</P>
    <P>The annual accounts of the Amalgamation Company, presented to its shareholders in accordance with its Articles of Association, were also made available to the Minister for Finance under these Articles.  As, however, the Company did not carry on business in 1947, the accounts for that year were merely the closing accounts of the company and were not available until after the transfer of its business had taken place with the consent of the Minister for Finance given pursuant to paragraph 10 of the Agreement scheduled to the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company Ltd. assigned, or purported to assign, all its assets to the Irish Assurance Company Ltd. there were then 43,866 policy holders who were fully paid up policy holders, and entitled as creditors to claim against the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company, and that their interests were ignored by the Minister for Finance who allowed £40,000 that was deposited for their protection to be handed over to the Irish Assurance Company Ltd.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>I think the Deputy had better put that question in specific terms to the Minister for Finance.  In order that the public may be made aware of the true position I want to say that these policy holders were protected by the Minister for Finance, who in the year 1942-43 paid out a sum of over £1,053,000 to meet the deficiency which forced the amalgamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the 1938 agreement guaranteed to the <Col N="578" /> policy holders in the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamated Company, Ltd., that they would have a right to share in the profits of that company, and that an independent actuary has assessed that by reason of the fraudulent action of 1947 those people have been deprived of something like £1½ million?

      <P>In examining claims for the refund of Income Tax the Revenue Commissioners, before they disburse public moneys, have the duty of obtaining all reasonable proofs of the claimant's title to repayment.  It has been considered necessary, in claims arising out of annuities payable to individuals under deeds of covenant, to require, in the generality of such cases, proof of the claim in the form of affidavits by the parties concerned. <Col N="579" /> It has been the general practice in recent years to ask for production of the affidavits in a specified form from both the covenantor and the beneficiary in support of the claim.  In a small number of cases the parties concerned have replied to the request for affidavits by supplying statutory declarations instead, and in some of those cases the Revenue Commissioners have deemed it essential to insist on their original requirements.</P>

      <P>The publication entitled &ldquo;A Register of Administrative Law in Saorstát Éireann, including the Statutory Rules and Orders from December 6, 1921 to December 31, 1933&rdquo; was published by the Stationery Office in November, 1935.  Subsequently the Stationery Office published three volumes of indices to Statutory Rules, Orders and Regulations for the periods 1922-38, 1939-1945 and 1946-47.  A consolidated index to the Statutory Instruments for the period 1948-60 is being prepared.

These were omitted because they would be costly and because it appeared to be Mr. Coughlan's personal responsibility to provide them.  On the assumption that all the landholders concerned now wish the scheme to proceed I will arrange to have a fresh estimate prepared.</P>

Apart from considerations of the orderly and efficient conduct of the business of the United Nations and the fact that decisions on the critically urgent problem of Ruanda-Urundi must be taken before the 1st July if they are to be effective, we have also in mind that the question of Southern Rhodesia has nothing like the same urgency and could, in our opinion, be more appropriately and fruitfully dealt with at the Session of the General Assembly which is to open early in September.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some delay is occurring, mainly in the eastern and northern counties.  This unusual situation is caused by a recent increase in demand, combined with the temporary closing of one factory for renovation and with the development of exports. I believe that the position is a temporary one and that manufacture will be adjusted to meet the demand.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputies are referring to an accident which occurred on the 9th October, 1961, at Westland Row Station.  The circumstances of the accident have been reported to me following an investigation instituted by CIE.  The investigation has not been concluded pending the outcome of legal proceedings which, I am informed, have been entered for hearing in the High Court.</P>
      <P>The engine in question was a General Motors B type engine with cab at one end only.  The engine was travelling light at the time of the accident, and was being operated cab in rear.</P>
      <P>As the matter is <i>sub judice</i> I do not propose to add to the foregoing information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The safety of these engines was questioned, as the Minister knows, by me in the past.  In the light of these accidents, would the Minister consider either withdrawing these engines from use or else adapting them in the way I understand it is proposed to adapt the new ones in order to increase their safety margin?</P>

      <P>No provision was made in the Hire-Purchase (Amendment) Act, 1960 for the control of sound advertising of hire-purchase terms as it was considered that its impact is not as great as that of visual advertising and furthermore that it might be more difficult to control the spoken than the written word.  As far as I am concerned these considerations are still valid.</P>
      <P>Freedom in the matter of radio advertising is not confined to the Electricity Supply Board; all advertisers are in the same position in this respect.</P>

      <P>The transfer of the business of the Industrial and Life Assurance Company Limited to the Irish Assurance Company Limited was provided for in the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938. I have no reason to believe that the settlement provided for in the Agreement of 14th December, 1947, has not been properly executed.  I am satisfied that a re-examination at this stage of the matters referred to in the questions would not be warranted and for that reason I am not in a position to supply the Deputy with the detailed information requested.</P>

      <P>May I express my admiration of the manner in which Ministers are able to avoid embarrassing supplementaries by grouping three vitally different questions together? Question No. 41 was avoided.  Is the Minister aware that under Section 14 of the Assurance Act, 1909, it was obligatory in 1947 to file particulars of the alleged amalgamation of the Industrial and Life Assurance Company and the Irish Assurance Company but that in 1954, that is seven years later, those particulars had not yet been filed with the Registrar of Companies at the Castle?

Is the Minister aware that the agreement of 1938 laid down that the rights of policyholders to a share in the profits would be and should be protected in the event of the amalgamation of the two companies but that since then, under the amalgamation of 1947, the policyholders in the old company have been deliberately deprived of the rights to shares in the policies which were guaranteed by an Act of this House and contained in the Memorandum and the Articles of Association of a former company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether in view of the fact that, in some recent cases involving pedestrians who were knocked down while crossing the street, the motorist was found guilty but fined only a nominal small amount he will investigate the legal position with regard to pedestrians crossing the street; and whether he will take steps to publicise widely the legal position and duties of both pedestrians and motorists in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subject covered by bye-laws made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána with my consent.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the bye-laws on the subject have been widely publicised in the &ldquo;Rules of the Road&rdquo; and in leaflets issued by my Department, while a film specially devoted to &ldquo;zebra crossings&rdquo; has just been made. This film is intended for showing in the cinemas and on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the respective rights of way are regulated by the bye-laws, they do not affect the overriding duty of both pedestrians and drivers to take care. The exercise of care, consideration and <Col N="629" /> courtesy by all road users is perhaps more important than any legal rule, and I take this opportunity to impress this maxim again on the public.</P>
    <P>I may mention that officers of the Garda, in consultation with officers of my Department, are working on the preparation of new, comprehensive general bye-laws on traffic and pedestrian control under the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  I cannot say at this stage that these bye-laws will involve any change affecting the rights and duties of pedestrians, but I can say that this, with all other aspects of the subject, will be fully examined and that the new bye-laws will also be widely publicised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether in view of the fact that examination of the recommendations contained in the Report of the Commission on Workmen's Compensation and the making of any decision on these recommendations is likely to take some considerable time, and that both wages and the cost of living have risen considerably since 1955, he will, as an interim measure, introduce legislation to raise the maximum level of workmen's compensation <Col N="631" /> from the present figure of £4 10s. Od. per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland) Kevin Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As indicated in reply to a question by the Deputy on the 7th of June, the Report of the Commission on Workmen's Comprensation is at present under examination and until this examination is completed, it is not proposed to take steps for the introduction of legislation for the purposes suggested.  As I intimated on that occasion in reply to a supplementary question by Deputy Norton, this Report was a considerable time in preparation and now that it is available, it would, in my view, be a mistake to embark on a piecemeal revision of the workmen's compensation code.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  It is being examined in my Department and in other Departments.  It is under active examination.  I hope that examination will conclude in a few months' time.  If it is decided that changes are needed, it would then be necessary to bring in proposals and I could not hope to have any such proposals before early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not admit that, from what he said, it is possible that new legislation in connection with workmen's compensation may not be introduced for approximately 12 months?  Does he still consider it fair that the maximum workman's compensation payable should remain at £4 10s. per week, the figure at which it was fixed approximately seven years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KevinBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very long report, in fact, a majority and minority report, each containing a big number of suggestions or reservations, and obviously many decisions must be taken.  It would be silly to bring in any hurried legislation now which would obviously involve upward revision of insurance premiums when <Col N="632" /> eventual decisions that may be taken will affect the scheme or are likely to affect it in a fundamental way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will appreciate that all these problems of which he speaks existed in 1955 and he will also remember that at that time, while a commission was set up to report on these problems, the Government realised that workmen's compensation needed to be increased and increased it with a very short Bill. May I, therefore, respectfully suggest to the Minister and the Government that they should do what is obviously needed and bring in this short Bill to increase the maximum payable because these people are being done an injustice, in view of the fact that practically all sections of the community have received increases&mdash; many, in some cases&mdash;since 1955?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together. The principal regulations governing the appointment of subpostmasters and subpostmistresses are unchanged since 1957.  They are that the person must be 21 years of age or over, be of good health, character and financial standing and be able to offer suitable premises for the office.  In assessing suitability of premises, the location of the premises and its adequacy in relation to the needs of the community to be served are taken into consideration.  Other factors taken into account are the applicant's standard of education, ability to provide any assistance necessary for conducting the business of the office and likely aptitude for the work.  The weight attached to these latter factors depends on the size of the office.  A good knowledge of Irish is required for suboffices in the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Persons engaged in certain occupations are not normally eligible for appointment as subpostmaster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>A letter was sent to the Subpostmasters' Union on 8th June about some matters that need to be cleared up before a meeting of the Consultative Council can be arranged to resume negotiations on current pay claims.  The letter was acknowledged by the union and a reply is now awaited.</P>
      <P>It would be contrary to practice to disclose the contents of Departmental communications to individual subpostmasters.</P>
      <P>As I have stated repeatedly in reply to previous Questions, it is not proposed to provide arbitration machinery for subpostmasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say whether or not he intimated to the executive of the Subpostmasters' Union, through a third party which included four members of the Fianna Fáil Party, that there would be an immediate meeting at which the subpostmasters would be offered a substantial cash increase, that arbitration would be given to them within 12 months or two years, and that he had no knowledge of the circular that was sent to the subpostmasters the day after the strike?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies I gave to Questions in this House.  In regard to the supplementary question the Deputy has asked, he would need to be much more specific.  If he puts down that question for answer next week, I shall answer it. <Col N="640" /> To expect a long statement here in reply to the Deputy's supplementary question is asking too much.  However, I should like to tell the Deputy that I did not give the assurance that the Deputy has just quoted here, if I understand him correctly.  I did not ask anybody to see me in relation to this matter.  I did not send for anybody nor did I request anybody to see the Subpostmasters' Union executive for me.  I decided for myself and I made up my own mind that I would not victimise or use any discrimination against any subpostmaster because he closed his office and engaged in the strike.  I think the subpostmasters were given to understand that they could make immediate contact with the secretary of the Consultative Council with a view to a meeting of the Consultative Council as soon as it could be arranged.  There was no question of any offer being made.  The subpostmasters were given to understand, I presume, that they could resume negotiations on their pay claim with the Consultative Council at the point at which they were broken off.  I understood that the official side on the Consultative Council had given them to understand then that if they produced data and substantiated a claim, the percentage offered would be increased and that the outstanding claims that had not been discussed up to that point were still open for discussion.  I hope that if the Subpostmasters' Union resume negotiations on their pay claim, the Consultative Council will deal fairly with the pay claims that are outstanding.</P>

However, the Deputy also asked me about a notification which was sent to the subpostmasters that I knew nothing about. That notification was issued from a number of head offices to their respective districts by the head postmasters. The head postmaster was quite within his rights in issuing that notification.

The head postmasters of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have certain obligations to discharge to the public and in discharging those obligations to the public they are entitled to take certain action.

In addition, within 12 months or two years, they would get an independent arbitration.  Is the Minister aware that these statements were made by a person who claimed, <Col N="642" /> according to the Subpostmasters' Union, to be an intermediary between them and the Department, and to have contact with the Minister?  I should like to ask the Minister had he any contact directly or indirectly with this Mr. Shannon?</P>

      <P>My attention has been directed to an editorial in the June, 1962, issue of the Journal of the Irish Medical Association regarding the Army Medical Corps.  I do not propose to comment on it beyond stating some facts about the conditions of service in that Corps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Promotion: Doctors are appointed <Col N="649" /> initially in the rank of Lieutenant; on completing three years' service in that rank, they may be promoted to the rank of Captain; on completing nine years' service in the rank of Captain, they may be promoted to the rank of Commandant.  They may, however, be promoted earlier if there are vacancies in the establishment.  Promotion to the ranks of Lt.-Colonel and Colonel is normally regulated by the occurrence of vacancies in the establishment. At present the medical officers in the Army Medical Corps are 1 Colonel, 5 Lt.-Colonels, 25 Commandants and 7 Captains.</P>
    <P>Pay: There are single and married rates of pay, but for the sake of convenience I shall confine my remarks to the married rates as single medical officers are rare.  Also, I shall include the uniform allowance of £39 in the standard emoluments.</P>
    <P>The standard emoluments (for officers appointed after 1st December, 1938) by reference to length of service and rank are:</P>

    <P>In addition to the foregoing, children's allowances at the rate of £20 per annum for each eligible child are payable.  There is also provision for specialist pay at the rates of £78 and £154 per annum for medical officers filling hospital appointments as junior and senior specialists.</P>
    <P>Taking the promotion and pay <Col N="650" /> conditions together, it will be seen that every doctor joining the Army Medical Corps is assured of promotion to the rank of Commandant after 12 years' service and of an income of at least £1,790 after 20 years' service.  He also has prospects of additional advancement which are by no means negligible and which compare very favourably with those available in other corps.</P>
    <P>Pre-1938 Rates of Pay for Medical Officers: These rates by any standard were excessively high and new rates more in keeping with the standards of remuneration in the Army and in the country generally were introduced in 1938 for officers appointed to the service after 1st December, 1938.  The old rates have been continued for those officers who were in the service before that date.  The Irish Medical Association eventually acquiesced in this development.</P>
    <P>Comparison with rates of pay for Medical Officers in the British Army: No section of our Defence Forces has its remuneration regulated by the standards obtaining in the British Army.</P>
    <P>Medical Officers for the Congo: My Department advertised recently for two doctors to serve temporarily as commissioned officers with the 37th Battalion in the Congo, as a sufficient number of medical officers of the Army Medical Corps had not volunteered for this duty.  The total period of service, including about five months in the Congo, was to be seven months.  I considered that the conditions offered were very attractive and a number of applications were received.  The applicants were interviewed and appointments were offered to two of them, but I regret to say that they have now declined the offers.  I cannot but think that the editorial and the &ldquo;Important Notice&rdquo; in the June issue of the Irish Medical Association are not entirely dissociated from their decision. I would have hoped that whatever grievances the Association had over conditions in the Army Medical Corps generally, they would have supported this particular effort which involves the national interest and prestige.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 13 is a minor one.  I do not know what the <Col N="656" />&ldquo;State authority&rdquo; means.  First of all, as the section stands, it creates one of these offences known as &ldquo;absolutely prohibited matters,&rdquo; that is to say, that, generally speaking in the criminal code which we have inherited and built up, there is something of the nature of a guilty intention.  A number of statutes have been brought in, increasingly in recent years, where a thing is prohibited completely.  It does not matter whether the person had the best intentions in the world, something has been done which should not have been done and that finishes the whole matter.  As this section stands, it is of that type:</P>
      <P>A person shall not communicate any official information to any other person unless he is duly authorised to do so or does so in the course of and in accordance with his duties as the holder of a public office or when it is his duty in the interest of the State to communicate it.</P>
      <P>I want to import a <i>mens rea</i> into this, that there should be a special intention of a guilty type before an offence would be committed and therefore I am moving to put in &ldquo;a person shall not in any manner prejudicial to the safety of the State communicate&rdquo; certain of these documents.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Notice taken that</i> 20<i> Members were not present; House counted and</i> 20 <i>Members being present,</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is to insert a particular phrase which imports a special <i>mens rea</i> that a person shall not in any manner prejudicial to the safety of the State communicate certain information, with the usual reservations, unless he is duly authorised or does so in the course of his duties or in the interest of the State.  I want to add on certain other points to which I shall come later.  As the matter stands, the mere communication of what is called &ldquo;official information&rdquo; constitutes an offence. One has to turn then to the definition section to see what is official information. &ldquo;Official information&rdquo; means any secret official code word or password, and any sketch, and a whole lot of other things, &ldquo;which is secret or confidential or is expressed to be <Col N="657" /> either,&rdquo; and for the purpose of manufacturing a new offence the Minister has given power to say, by a certificate, that something is secret and confidential and that ends that matter.</P>
      <P>There is a second leg to it that the information &ldquo;which is or has been in the possession, custody or control of a holder of a public office by virtue of his office or to which he has or had access, and includes information recorded&rdquo; by a tape recording device or any matter of that kind.  We then turn to &ldquo;public office&rdquo; to find the limits of this.  The phrase &ldquo;public office&rdquo; means :</P>
      <P>an office or employment which is remunerated out of the Central Fund or out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, or an appointment to, or employment under, any commission, committee or tribunal set up by the Government or a Minister for the purpose of any enquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think I am doing any wrong to the section by paraphrasing in this way, that a person in any office paid for out of the moneys voted by the Oireachtas or out of the Central Fund, is a person who may get information and if he communicates that, no matter what his intention is, or how good his wishes are, it becomes an offence.  I regard myself as a person who is in that category.  I have been, and still am to some extent, remunerated from moneys voted by the Oireachtas.  Judges, too, are remunerated from the Central Fund.  The whole section goes wider and says &ldquo;any commission, committee or tribunal&rdquo; which we appoint from time to time and if people are appointed to serve on tribunals or commissions set up by the Minister, they are also brought into the categories covered by the section.  If any of these people, say, an ex-member of the Government, or an ex-Parliamentary Secretary, an ex-Deputy, an ex-Senator, or a sitting member of the Seanad or Dáil, or a person serving on any committee or commission established by the Government, gets information and communicates that to anyone else, then unless he gets inside the scope of the reservations, he commits an <Col N="658" /> offence.  Whether the matter is secret or confidential will be declared by the Minister.</P>
    <P>When this matter was discussed on Second Reading, Deputy Dillon drew attention to the fact that the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill was guilty of an error by omission certainly, if it were not deliberate, and that the various things we discussed in subsection (3) of Section 2 were regarded as something that were always there.  Deputy Dillon drew attention to the fact that the White Paper simply referred to that part of the Bill which contained the following words:</P>
    <P>Part I contains the definitions and provides for the repeal of the 1911 and 1920 Acts</P>
    <P>and that this was definitely new and was not put into the explanatory memorandum as being new.  When replying, the Minister, at column 690 of the Official Report for 28th March this year, and dealing with this matter of the certificate, said:</P>
    <P>The public interest would be prejudiced if the information were disclosed but, if the accused denied that the information was confidential, the prosecution would have to disclose it in court.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>That would be an impossible situation, especially where the safety of the State would be involved, and this provision is in the Bill to meet such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>I took that to mean, as I read it, that the Minister agreed that this idea of certifying a matter to be secret and confidential, in a conclusive way, would be used only if the safety of the State were concerned.  Because of that, I put down this amendment to say that if the communication was made, it was an essential part of the proof that the communication had to be made in any matter prejudicial to the safety of the State.  I think the House would be agreeable that where information in documents, plans or maps with regard say, to secret weapons, or even ordinary warlike materials, was of a secret or confidential nature, and where <Col N="659" /> the disclosure might be prejudicial to the safety of the State, it should be certified as secret and confidential. There is no such limitation in the section.</P>
    <P>That will be a matter of fact.  There will be a certificate from the Minister to say whether a matter is secret and confidential or not.  Another question is added to that&mdash;whether a person, because he was in an office described in the definition section, did communicate with somebody without getting authorisation.  That includes absolutely prohibited matters which, of course, are growing under modern legislation, but this is the creation of a criminal offence which, under Section 13, can be marked on summary prosecution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or both.  These penalties may be imposed under that section for the simple passage of a document, declared conclusively to be secret and confidential by a Minister, to somebody who does not come within the meaning of the section.  My simple request is to add to the end of the section the words &ldquo;or when such communication is required in the interest of justice or in connection with court proceedings&rdquo;.  As far as my memory goes, I have taken that phrase from what one of the judges said in the <i>Rose Tattoo</i> case where they called attention to the fact that they took a serious view of the situation where a man might be charged with an offence and that it might be in the interests of justice that certain documents could be disclosed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what the Minister may decide by certificate, supposing I am in possession of a document to which I have had access because I held an office which was remunerated by moneys provided by the Oireachtas, and somebody is charged under the third part of that section with obtaining information from me, I think I should be entitled to go into court and tell how I got the information.  A person might say it was got accidentally. Supposing he was discussing a matter with, say, a Deputy and the <Col N="660" /> Deputy gave him certain information which was retrospectively declared by a Minister to be secret and confidential, I think that person should be entitled to parade himself as a witness, to go into court and say to the court: &ldquo;Here is a record of the document of which I took a note.&rdquo;  I think it is in the interest of justice that such a person should be able to say to the court : &ldquo;I gave that man certain information and I documented it from certain information, certain papers I have.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of falsification of history in this country from the period 1916, and certainly from 1918, and the only way that can be corrected is by the other side being put.  I know there are certain people engaged in the preparation of papers to have memories written.  These may be worth something in the minds of the authors but they will not be of any public value unless they are documented.  That, in terms of this Bill, is a definite communication and perhaps it is contemplated that the Minister could stop it. I do not say a Minister will stop it, but if one communicates this to anybody one is guilty under Sections 1 and 2 of the Bill and the person to whom he gave the information, say a person who was preparing his memoirs, will be guilty of obtaining the information. Surely the public and the judges should be able to say whether there was anything prejudicial to anything in the country in that.  I shall refer again to the Minister's statement last March about disclosing the information.  He said:</P>
    <P>That would be an impossible situation, especially where the safety of the State would be involved, and this provision is in the Bill in order to meet such an eventuality.</P>
    <P>I read this and conclude that it refers to cases where the safety of the State is involved As far as the safety of the State is concerned, we had the old British Act which defined such places as dockyards, places where submarines were made or where airships were made.  The provision here goes far wide of that.  There is no limitation with regard to &ldquo;prohibited places&rdquo; or with regard to anything that is prejudicial to the safety of the State.  The thing <Col N="661" /> would lose its dangers if the judges were able to investigate the nature of the documents, but more particularly if they were able to investigate whether what was being complained about was in any way prejudicial to the safety of the State.</P>
    <P>The provision here goes far beyond that and I think it should be limited in the way I suggest in my amendments. I am quite aware that under the 1911 Act, where a breach of the ordinary run of the law was made, a person's known character as shown from his movements could be brought in to aid the court in deciding whether a particular activity was or was not prejudicial to the safety of the State&mdash;one could go back on a man's record in order to give the court an easy way of determining whether a particular activity was prejudicial to the safety of the State.  It is therefore administrative law gone to the highest point of excess that we should say it does not matter what the document or what the intention was.  The result, so long as there has been communication of certain information, is that an offence has been committed and under subsection (2) of Section 13 this may involve a fine of £100 or imprisonment of six months or both such fine and such imprisonment. There should be some limitation on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenDBarret" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McGilligan that it is highly important. There should be some limitation of that nature inserted somewhere in this section.  The Minister seems determined to take as much power as he can so that he, or some successor, can use it.  I do not say the Minister would do that, but there is always the question of his successor.  He seems determined to push administrative law to its furthest limit.  I do ask him to undo the harm he has already done, despite the most solemn warnings from this side of the House, in pushing the obnoxious and outrageous sections of this Bill through the House.  I would ask the Minister to do something of the nature suggested by Deputy McGilligan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept either of Deputy <Col N="662" /> McGilligan's amendments, not just because they were put down by Deputy McGilligan.  The effect of the first amendment would be this.  A disclosure of information by a civil servant could only be an offence if it were done in a manner prejudicial to the interests of the State.  Surely that is not what we want?  Civil servants are persons in responsible positions who have access to all sorts of information. Would there not be chaos if they were free to disclose that information at will?  It is their solemn duty to respect the information which comes to them in the course of their official duties and not to disclose it in any unauthorised fashion.  Do not forget it must be secret and confidential information.</P>

      <P>The Minister is entrusted with the care and management of his Department.  All information inside that Department is under his jurisdiction and care.

The Minister is the person to decide whether it is perfectly all right to disclose a document or not.  That is a reasonable and valid approach.</P>
      <P>I want again to make the point that in this respect under the present law, both here and in Britain, there is absolutely no necessity to have a <i>mens rea,</i> as suggested by Deputy McGilligan, or that information should be confidential or secret.  The very fact of communicating official information is, in itself, an offence at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second amendment proposed by Deputy McGilligan suffers from this defect.  If we were to adopt it as it is put down, it would certainly mean that a civil servant could go along to any court of law and at his own discretion, disclose any information he wishes.  Surely that is not what is required?  The situation that now prevails is perfectly satisfactory.  If the court requires the production of any official documents or evidence as to some official business, then the appropriate head of a Department authorises a particular officer to attend the court and give whatever information or evidence the court requires.  If Deputy McGilligan's amendment were adopted here as such, it would mean that such a person who had special information would not have to seek the permission of his Departmental head to give it in court and that he would be freed from all obligation in that regard.  I suggest that would be ridiculous.  The question of the Minister's <Col N="664" /> certificate as to the secret and confidential aspect of the document being conclusive has nothing to do with the particular subsection with which we are concerned here.</P>

      <P>Surely it has?  Because there are no limits on that, we must put limits somewhere else.  The Minister's argument is puerile foppery, and he knows it.  He has deliberately taken unto himself an unlimited power.  Now that some limit is proposed to what is suggested, he is afraid the child he is trying to christen will be spoiled.  The purpose of these amendments is very simple.  There is no use in the Minister complaining in an airy-fairy manner that he is being rudely interrupted by me and making verbose utterances without coming down to the basic principle.  The basic principle as put forward by Deputy McGilligan is very simple.  He wants a limitation on what the nature of the communication must be.  It must be inimical to the safety of the State before a charge will lie on the basis of an arbitrary decision by the Minister as to whether he thinks it secret and confidential or not.</P>
      <P>I have had the privilege of serving on Government commissions.  I have had the privilege of being born into a family where you have a lot of documentation that will put right the falsification of history.  I might be in the position tomorrow that, if I communicate that to somebody who wants to do an historical analysis of the situation, some Minister &mdash; I am not suggesting it will be the present Minister&mdash;who might find the revelations hurtful to his political background may declare these to be secret and confidential documents because they were obtained by a forbear of mine when he was in the position of negotiating with a foreign power.  That is the kind of thing that can be done. I am not going to say this behind doors.  I shall say without any hesitation that Fianna Fáil have whitewashed history and distorted history to try to justify themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to the Chair that it does, for the simple reason that the information I am discussing now could be declared retrospectively under this Act to be confidential.  As such, it must arise.  I make that submission with respect.  Once anything obtained in an official capacity is in the possession of somebody, under this Bill it is quite at the option of the Minister to declare it to be confidential and secret, even though the event may have occurred years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> That must be relevant to this Bill because this Bill fundamentally deals with the freedom of the individual in that respect.  The Minister is deliberately trying to shed words over a basic principle as simple as this: that it is not right that an executive authority should try to obtain a global freedom in relation to what will constitute an offence, particularly when he has already taken to himself powers without reference to anybody and has given himself the right to declare conclusively that something is secret and confidential.</P>
