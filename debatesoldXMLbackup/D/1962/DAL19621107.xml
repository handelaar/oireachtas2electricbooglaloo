      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Finance whether it is a fact that under Articles 73, 108 and 109 of the Treaty of Rome the power of protecting the balance of payments in a crisis situation does not rest with the responsible government; and, if so, if he is satisfied that, where Ireland is concerned, decisions taken in such circumstances will be more likely to be advantageous than if taken by the Irish Government as at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Treaty of Rome the power of protecting the balance of payments in a crisis situation rests with the responsible Government and is exercised in accordance with the arrangements set out in the Treaty.  I am satisfied that these arrangements are such as to permit of the taking of more advantageous decisions in a balance of payments crisis as a member of the Community than as a non-member.</P>
      <P>I should add, of course, that the aims of the European Economic Community in relation to economic policy generally, and the provision made to achieve those aims, are such as to minimise the risk of balance of payments difficulties in the member States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The deciding authority is the member state in the case of a crisis.  But the member state, if it takes the initiative without consultation, will have to notify the case to the Commission. The Commission will then examine it and may make recommendations to the member state.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, this is the second occasion in the last week that a suggestion has been made by members of the Government that Deputy Dr. Browne has some association with Communist Russia.  Last week we had the Taoiseach telling him to go back to Khrushchev and this week we have the Tánaiste suggesting he should consult the USSR.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a disgraceful misuse of the privilege of the House to have the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste trying to smear the name of a Deputy when they have no other means of defending themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, Sir, you have ruled on another occasion that, where a Deputy has declared he is not and never has been a Communist or associated with the Communist Party in any way, it is disorderly to impute by any suggestion, as has been made by the Tánaiste and by the Taoiseach on another occasion, that the Deputy is a Communist.  I hope you will give me your protection from slanderous remarks of that kind.</P>

      <P>I do not see that the Deputy has to be protected from anything.  I do not see what the imputation is.  The Tánaiste asked &ldquo;What do they do in the USSR?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the last day in this House, when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands, Deputy Lehihan, described Deputy Dr. Browne as a &ldquo;Red&rdquo;, you said you did not hear him?  The implication was that if you did hear him, you would ask him to withdraw.  We have insinuations being made every day by the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil that Deputy Dr. Browne is a Communist or associated with the Communist Party.  Deputy Dr. Browne, as a Deputy of this House, is entitled to your protection from any such smear campaign.</P>

      <P>Certain improvements for passenger traffic have been carried out at Rosslare at the instance of Bord Fáilte and my Department, but the scope for expansion of facilities at the pier for the transport of motor vehicles is very strictly limited by the physical characteristics of the terminal.  This has not, however, prevented an increase in the number of tourists' cars coming through Rosslare, which in 1961 was some 30 per cent. above the 1960 figure, and more than 75 per cent. above the figure for 1957.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The objectives set for the European Economic Community in the preamble to the Treaty of Rome include the harmonious development of the economies of the Member States &ldquo;by diminishing both the disparities between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions.&rdquo;  In Article 2 of the Treaty it is stated that it shall be the task of the Community to promote throughout the Community a harmonious development of economic activities and a continuous and balanced expansion.  Article 92 provides that certain kinds of State aid including the following may be deemed to be compatible with the Common Market:</P>
      <P>Aid intended to promote the economic development of regions where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment;</P>
      <P>Aid intended to facilitate the development of certain economic regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuance of the objectives set by the Treaty, the Community is studying techniques of promoting regional development and means by which the efforts of the individual <Col N="601" /> countries may be supplemented by Community action.  In the formulation of the common policy for the various economic sectors, including agriculture and transport, and for the social sector, account is taken of the regional implications of such policy.</P>
    <P>At an EEC Conference on Regional Economies held in Brussels in December, 1961, and reported in the Official Bulletin of the EEC in February, 1962, it was indicated that the view of the EEC Commission is that whenever possible industry should move to the worker and that the converse should only occur in exceptional circumstances.  The Commission, in co-operation with the Governments, is pressing forward with studies for the creation in less developed regions of poles of industrial development which it is hoped will in time transform the economies of these regions.  One such project to be located in Southern Italy is in an advanced stage of planning. Accordingly, there is reason to believe that membership of the Community will aid rather than impede efforts to promote the economic development of less developed areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if he has any idea from the development of EEC up to the present whether this trend has in fact taken place, that industries have moved to the workers or have workers moved to the industries?  Which trend has taken place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the trend has been one of industries going to the workers.  In Italy, where there is practical experience of this policy, that is what has happened.  As I said, as a result of the special study made, the vice-president of the Commission said that would be the policy of the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, Sir, I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>Article 125 of the Treaty of Rome provides&mdash;subject to specified conditions&mdash;that a Member State shall be reimbursed, from the European Social Fund, 50 per cent. of the expenditure incurred for the purpose of:</P>
      <P>(a) ensuring productive re-employment of workers by means of:</P>
      <P>&mdash;occupational retraining,</P>
      <P>&mdash;resettlement allowances;</P>
      <P>(b) granting aid to workers whose employment is reduced or temporarily suspended, whether wholly or partly as a result of the conversion of a concern to other production, in order that they may maintain the same wagelevel pending their full re-employment.</P>
      <P>
      </P>
      <P>Resettlement allowances would naturally be payable only where resettlement is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has already been announced, an inter-Departmental Committee is studying the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and the various Community regulations relating to the European Social Fund, with a view to drawing up a scheme which would qualify for assistance from the Fund.  The Committee is examining the schemes of retraining and resettlement of the member countries of the Community and is keeping in close touch with such bodies as the Industrial Development Authority, the Committee on Industrial Organisation, the Apprenticeship Board, etc., as regards employment and redundancy forecasts.  When the necessary <Col N="604" /> background information has been assembled, the Committee will discuss with representatives of trade unions and industry what form of scheme is most suitable to conditions in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of redundancy, the Government have given an undertaking to industrialists that they can expect compensation for whatever changes are made now in anticipation of going into the Common Market.

The number of pensioners at that time was nearly 118,000 and it will be appreciated that in the issue of the new payment vouchers to that number isolated instances of delay will occur.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will indicate why An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have invited proposals from commercial concerns for the acquisition of three fish-processing establishments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan) Brian (Snr.) Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's Programme of Sea Fisheries Development published in April last announced in paragraph 18 that, &ldquo;where factories are held or provided by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, efforts will be made to induce private or co-operative interests to lease or purchase them.&rdquo;  The recent advertisement by the Board is merely aimed at implementing that part of the development programme: indeed, as the White Paper mentioned, offers had been invited for one of the factories even before its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that there is no question of closing down factories which are in operation: the object is to transfer them, as going concerns, to private or co-operative enterprise if acceptable proposals are received.  The underlying idea is to <Col N="612" /> relieve An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, as far as practicable, of direct participation in commercial operations which can be effectively handled by private or co-operative interests and thus enable the Board to concentrate more intensively on development activities for the expansion of landings and sales of fish.  On the processing side it is encouraging that a number of private firms have already proceeded with the construction or extension of fish processing factories.</P>
    <P>I should also like to take this opportunity of making it clear that the fish meal plant advertised at Killybegs is a small pilot plant associated with the Board's processing establishment: it is not the fish meal factory which has already been leased to a Danish firm which is, I understand, operating very satisfactorily.</P>

I understand that the Broadcasting Authority considers that the speculative forecast it contains of the outcome of the first year's operation of Telefís Éireann is too pessimistic.  It is too early yet to make a reliable forecast and in any event the position for this year would not be representative as the Authority's provincial transmitters are not yet in operation.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 115 together.</P>
      <P>(a) The estimated overall cost of the extension of Bolton Street College of Technology is £500,000, but the final figure is not yet available.  (b) The estimated cost of the new College of Technology at Kevin Street is £1,500,000; as no contract has yet been entered into for the building, I am not in a position to give a firm figure at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Bolton Street project was financed by loans raised by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee and no State grant was involved; while no proposals have yet been made for the financing of the Kevin Street project, it is anticipated that it will be financed in the same way.</P>

Repayments, which will amount to <Col N="626" /> about £40,000 yearly over 25 years, will be met by the Committee from its ordinary revenue.  Based on the proportions in which the State and the rating authority contribute to the Committee's funds it can be said that about £24,000 annually will be paid by the State and £12,000 annually by the rating authority.</P>
      <P>No proposals have yet been put before my Department for the financing of the new college in Kevin Street or the replacement or extension of Rathmines College.</P>

      <P>Whilst his special allowance was under annual review in November, 1961, it came to light that the person to whom the Deputy refers had a portion of his land let for several years, which fact he had not previously disclosed.  He was accordingly in receipt of a special allowance at a rate in excess of his entitlement during those years and an overpayment of £82 5s. 5d. occurred.  By withholding his special allowance entitlement and military service pension, the overpayment will be recovered by the end of December, 1962 and payment will then be resumed.</P>
      <P>In cases where there has been a deliberate concealment of means, recovery of the amount overpaid cannot be foregone.</P>

      <P>Is it not important that Ireland should put forward the best possible team available?  The army jumping team at the moment are operating under very difficult circumstances in so far as they are meeting joint teams.  Because of that, through no fault of their own, they lack a large number of personnel to choose from and it is not now possible to choose from the standard which was once available.  Would it not be desirable, in the interests of Irish bloodstock, to restore our position in equitation centres generally in the world by establishing a joint team?</P>

      <Col N="637" /> The investment of Court moneys, including moneys awarded to minors, is governed by section 3 of the Trustee (Authorised Investment) Act, 1958, which prescribes the sole investments in which such moneys may be invested.</P>
    <P>Among these investments are British Government securities inscribed or registered in the State, which include British War Loan.  I understand, however, that in practice no investments have been made in British War Loan for a number of years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point whether there is any redress against a Court in respect of loss through depreciation in the market value of such investments, I understand that there is no redress in law in such a situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to query the whole basis on which money is now to be spent under the Fisheries legislation which is covered by this Bill and its amendment of the previous legislation.  I have heard repeated references in this House, no later than today, to the proposed sale by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara of certain installations at Schull, Galway and Killybegs. I want to make it perfectly clear that when I was Minister in charge of Fisheries, with Deputy O.J. Flanagan as my Parliamentary Secretary at the time, the Schull ice plant was installed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> If I were Minister for Fisheries again tomorrow, I would do exactly the same thing.</P>
    <P>One of the great difficulties in facilitating the small fishermen on our coasts has been that, where the capacity to land fish shows a tendency to expand, the absence of ice facilities has very frequently aborted such an expansion at its initiation.  It is perfectly true that a cautious, conservative Minister in charge of Fisheries, if his attitude is that the first and primary consideration must be commercial success, would say to any group of fishermen on our coast: &ldquo;If you cannot pay for it, do without it.&rdquo;  I never took that view and I do not take it now.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that the small fishermen on our coasts should be made the bond slaves of the wholesale fish merchants of this country.  I always took the view that the wholesale fish merchants were the servants of the fishermen.  Now we are being brought around to the position that the fishermen are being converted into the servants of the wholesale fishmongers. I believed it was the function and duty of the Minister to provide facilities for fishermen where they wanted them&mdash;and one of the essential requirements they wanted was ice.</P>
    <P>I remember the occasion of the installation of the facilities that are now to be sold at Schull.  There was a boatyard in Baltimore.  Our predecessors in office had apparently made up their minds to let that boatyard close down. I myself went down to Baltimore after consultation with Deputy O.J. Flanagan and personally inspected it. The boatyard was operated by a quasiindustrial school, administered by the diocesan clergy of the Diocese of Ross.</P>
    <P>I entered into negotiation with the Bishop of Ross to sell to the Fisheries Branch that part of the premises which included the boatyard and in that I was facilitated in every way by the ecclesiastical authorities.  I re-opened the boatyard because I believed it was a desirable means of providing more employment and as a training ground for young fishermen.  I think I was right; I would do it again if I had <Col N="640" /> to.  I did the same thing at Fanad Bay in County Donegal.  In association with that, we were building boats in Baltimore. We hoped that the existing landings of fish at Schull would expand. We were approached by the local clergy and by a number of representative persons in that area who assured us that the existing landings showed a tendency to expand but that their prospective expansion was gravely prejudiced by the fact that ice was not available.</P>
    <P>I directed that supplies of ice be made available at Schull, as we did at several other centres around the coast &mdash;at Baltimore, Ballycotton and Galway.  I want to ask the House: are we to lay down the proposition now that the Fisheries Branch are to provide no facilities for the fishermen, unless and until it can be demonstrated that there will be a permanent profit in the operating of those facilities?  If that is the line, then you may hand the whole business over to the wholesale fishmongers and they will do it a damn sight better than the Department can do it for them.  They will simply go down to the fishermen and tell them: &ldquo;You boys are too well off.  If you want the profit necessary to provide the facilities in this area, you must sell your fish cheaper to us at our price and when we have made enough profit out of it, if we think you are worth keeping in existence, we will spend part of the profits in providing you with the facilities without which you cannot survive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that is to be the new policy of the Fisheries Branch, let us hear it. It was not our policy, and I will not for one moment sit here in silence and let some&mdash;I could use strong language here&mdash;of the new authorities on fisheries get up and tell me that the ice plant at Schull was one of Flanagan's white elephants.  If it is anyone's white elephant, it is Dillon's.  I want to make it clear that I put it there for the fishermen and that I did not put it there for the benefit of the wholesale fishmongers.  I ran the Fisheries Branch for the fishermen; I did not run it for the wholesale fishmongers.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, but this Bill amends practically every section of the Principal Act and I suggest it provides the finance for the administration of a very large part of the Act.  My case is that under this Bill, and the policy enunciated by the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister, the fisheries of this country are hereafter to be run for the wholesale fishmongers. I say they ought to be run for the fishermen.  Part of the propaganda is that some of the facilities we provide, such as the ice plant at Schull, are now to be sold.  I do not know to whom.

      <P>I want to submit to this House that the whole trend now is that the fisheries of this country are to be run for the benefit of the wholesale fishmongers.  I want to reiterate <Col N="642" /> that, when providing these facilities, we did so deliberately and will do the same again tomorrow when the responsibility for the Fisheries Branch returns to us.  Let everybody know that is what our policy will be and let there be no misapprehension hereafter that we sought to get power on any misapprehension.  That is our policy&mdash;to run the fisheries for the fishermen, not for the wholesale fishmongers.</P>
      <P>It has also been suggested that the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash;I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary had the indecency to second him&mdash;referred to the Galway installations as white elephants.  If they are white elephants, they are Dillon's white elephants.  I put them there deliberately and for the purpose of reviving the fishing industry on the Connemara coast.  Was that right or was that wrong?  The situation was that there was a splendid fishing tradition on the Connemara coast.  It threatened to die out.  We provided boats for the Connemara fishermen and our best technical advice was also provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the announced intention to sell the plant in Galway which I put there.  I want to demonstrate to the House the purpose for which that plant was put there. From the technical advice we had, there was no doubt left in our minds that it was no use providing fishing facilities in Galway, if we did not provide supplies of ice, because the more fish you bring into Galway, the more the fishermen are in the hands of the wholesale fishmongers.  I provided the ice and I provided boats but it is true that since we went out of office, for reasons I do not fully understand but which may be explicable, the development of fisheries in Connemara has not gone ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>We operated the Gaeltacht Boat Scheme and even the Minister will agree with me that if there was to be a revival of fishing on the Connemara coast, the provision of ice in Galway was a <i>sine qua non</i>. Very well; we provided the ice.  I admit the fishing potential of Connemara has not developed.  The Minister says to me now the reason for its failure was that seven years ago we were supposed to have scattered the boats all over the coast of Ireland. He has had seven years to put that right and his remedy for the situation which he says we created is not to bring back the boats to Connemara but to sell the ice plant.  Is that not a nice contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>He says fishing did not revive in Connemara because I scattered the boats.  That was seven years ago.  He has had seven years. He agrees with me there cannot be fishing in Connemara, if there is not ice in Galway, but in the next breath, he says he is about to sell the ice plant in Galway so that the Connemara fishermen may now depend on whatever facilities the wholesale fishmongers will provide for them.  We do not agree with that policy.  We want to make the fishermen independent of the wholesale fishmongers and therefore we not only want to provide the facilities of ice and the disposition of surplus fish stocks, but we also say that it would be useful to give them their own sales machinery which would help to sell fish in the interests of the fishermen and not in the interests of the wholesale fishmongers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to dispose categorically of the typical red herring which has been dragged in by the Leader of the Opposition in connection with the whole fisheries policy.  It is untrue to say that the ice plants are to be closed down and got rid of.  In fact, Deputies will be aware that it is the intention to provide ice in other places where it is necessary for the development of the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon suggests that these processing factories are being closed down.  The position was made quite clear in the White Paper to which my Parliamentary Secretary referred as to what was the policy in this connection. The White Paper on the industry set out at paragraph 18:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where factories are held or provided by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, efforts will be made to induce private or co-operative interests to lease or <Col N="649" /> purchase them.  The fishmeal factory at Killybegs was leased to a Danish firm shortly after its acquisition by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara in 1961 and offers have been invited for a letting of the fish processing factory at Schull, County Cork.</P>
    <P>The fact is that there was a processing or freezing plant established at Schull by Deputy Dillon or by Deputy Flanagan, whichever of them did so, and that outfit has not worked since. It is the policy of this Government to see, where possible, that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will lease or sell these processing units so as to get them working in the same way as we have got the Danish firm to get that factory working, and working successfully, in Donegal.</P>
    <P>We are not prepared to leave these factories idle.  Considering that these plants are up for sale or leasing, I do not think I should say anything further about their past history but it is my sincere wish, and I am sure the sincere wish of the House, that co-operatives or people concerned in the business, no matter who they are or from what country they come, will be interested in these processing factories that are now for sale or leasing, and that we shall have the same activity as is now provided under the same policy in Donegal in the factory to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It is no use having these factories there idle; it is no use having these factories there serving no purpose.  If people who are expert in this business are prepared to operate them on a commercial basis and thus provide a market for the fishermen who land their fish, then I think we should all rejoice.  It is a complete absurdity to suggest that we expect the fishermen to take a cheaper price for their fish, and in some way to enrich the merchants. In fact, no Government since the foundation of this State have gone as far to provide inducements for the resurrection of the Irish fishing industry as this Government have under this White Paper.</P>
    <P>There were never such inducements given for the provision of new boats. There were never such inducements given for the training of young fishermen. <Col N="650" /> There was never such an attempt made on a broad national scale to provide for the reorganisation of this industry, for the marketing, export and processing of fish and to deal with every other aspect and development of this industry.  I will not allow the Leader of the Opposition to get away with this red herring, that this new policy is designed for the purpose of enriching those involved in the commercial side of the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has mentioned Galway. I want Deputies to throw their minds back to a few years ago when the Coalition were in power and when he put the plant in Galway.  What happened?  Under his Department, there were supposed to be eight boats given to Connemara fishermen in order to ensure a continuity of supply for that factory in Galway.  The result was that with Deputy O'Donnell in Donegal pulling this coat tail and Deputy Somebody-else in Kerry pulling the other coat tail, all these boats were scattered around the whole coast and the poor Connemara fishermen, who were waiting for these boats in order to provide the fish for this factory, had to take to the emigrant ship.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why Galway failed.  Under this new policy, I can assure the House we are now providing ways and means for the boats to be given under most favourable terms to our own fishermen in order to supply places like Galway.  If we are successful in getting a sound commercial undertaking to take over Galway and run it as the Danes are running the one in Donegal, then there will be more employment and there will be a new life for the fishermen on the west coast of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care who was touchy.  The Minister seems to be the touchiest person in the House.  However, he talks about all the inducements given to encourage fisheries in recent years.  If there are all these inducements, there must be a failure because last year the Parliamentary Secretary, <Col N="651" /> if I remember correctly&mdash;again I speak from memory&mdash;indicated to us in his speech on the Estimate for Fisheries that there were fewer employed in the fishing industry last year than there were the year before.</P>
      <P>It is not my purpose in this debate to make a speech such as one would make on the Estimate for Fisheries.  I feel it necessary to refute the allegation of the Minister for Lands that there are many more employed in the fishing industry at present and that it is a booming industry.  It is nothing of the sort.  I do not want to apportion blame either to Deputy Flanagan or to Deputy Lenihan for the failure to attract more men into this industry. As far as these three factories are concerned, I merely repeat the warning I gave to the Parliamentary Secretary at Question Time today.  I should hate to see these three factories&mdash;and I trust the Parliamentary Secretary when he says to me that these will not be disposed of at a give-away price&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has given that assurance and I am prepared to accept it, but I qualify these remarks by saying I am not satisfied that we should fall over ourselves in inducing Danes, Germans, British or Americans to take over these factories that have been established by Irish Governments.  This may be the thin end of the wedge which the Minister for Finance appeared to be wielding some time last year when he suggested that many of our State or semi-State companies should be given over to private enterprise. I agree with the principle that underlies what Deputy Dillon, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, has put forward when he inferred that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara or some State or semi-State concern would have much more regard for the interests of the ordinary fisherman than would private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the advancement of the fishing industry were left absolutely to private enterprise, I do not believe there would be greater prosperity for the ordinary fisherman.  If it is felt by this <Col N="652" /> Government, or if it is ever felt by a Fine Gael Government, that this should be handed over to private enterprise at some future stage, when the industry is much more prosperous, that is their business, but as far as we are concerned in this matter of the development of fisheries, we believe that some State or semi-State organisation could and should run these three factories for the benefit of the fishing industry and particularly for the benefit of the fishermen engaged in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appalling to come in here and listen to a Minister of State indulging in the clap-trap we have just heard from the Minister for Lands.  He said that when the Galway factory was built, and from the time the Galway factory was built, the boats were scattered over those various ports in Ireland.  That was dishonest and untrue.  The Galway factory was not built until the Minister for Lands was put in charge of Fisheries.  His predecessor just had time to open it, the man who is now Minister for Transport and Power, and he was in complete control.  What might not have been noticed was that when he was talking about the scattering of the boats and about Deputy O'Donnell pulling somebody's coat-tails and somebody else pulling somebody else's coat-tails to get the boats scattered, his Parliamentary Secretary was trying to prompt him and trying to tell him that I had been pulling somebody's coat-tails.  The only place to which I would have a boat sent is the port which catches more, Dunmore East.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about the money.  I have here a famous headline from <i>The Kerryman:</i>&ldquo;Three months employment in Killybegs for 30 people.&rdquo;  It cost £233,000 per head to employ 30 people for three months. That is money.  That is doing away with money and shovelling it down the drain.  I want to be parochial about my own constituency and to point out that for eight years, I have been telling various Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers for Lands that more fish were caught in Dunmore year after year.  At the same time, none of the money we voted here for Fisheries went to Dunmore and I shall prove it.</P>
      <P>I propose to quote figures from the Dáil Debates, for the benefit of the Minister, on 31st May, 1960.  The amount of money spent by his Department by way of grant to various ports was as follows: Killybegs, £102,000; Galway, £67,000; Schull, £36,000; Dingle, £21,000; Baltimore, £21,000; Castletownbere, £13,000; Caherciveen, £11,000; and Dunmore East, £19,000. How does this add up?  The place which got £19,000 caught 296,000 boxes of fish and a place called Greencastle, for which £100,000 had been voted the year before, caught 2,454 boxes of fish&mdash;2,000 boxes of fish were caught in a place on which £100,000 had been spent.  A sum of £19,000 was spent on Dunmore East when they put up the famous lollipop factory there. Is that a policy or is it idiocy?</P>
      <P>I do not want anybody ducking his head or jumping out.  That was done by this Minister and this Government. A sum of £100,000 was spent on Greencastle which brought in 2,000 boxes of fish.  That would be caught in a bad day at Dunmore.</P>

He &ldquo;blew&rdquo; and left office and left it to this Minister.  I want to know what the future policy of the Department of Fisheries and of Bord Iascaigh Mhara is to be.

      <P>I am very glad to hear the Parliamentary Secretary saying that because I have put down a question for him, and I should not be giving him notice of it, but I had my doubts until he said so, because very prominent men attached to, or employed by, Bord Iascaigh Mhara have visited the most out of way places and they are reporting back and it could be possible that if they report back from some of these places, we might see ourselves with piers being built as the old Congested Districts Board built them out in the middle of a field. Mark you, it would be better to build a pier out in the middle of a field than to build it in some of the places in which the Parliamentary Secretary has built them because nothing ever pulls up there and no fish are ever landed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the Parliamentary Secretary credit for wanting to make a <Col N="656" /> success of the jungle handed over to him.

      <P>They were landing fish at the rate of 7,000 cran a day in this port.  They landed so much they had to stop.  The installations were everywhere else, but they were not where the fish were.  It was not a case of the fish being there for that period only.  This happened for years before and years afterwards.  The people who know, the professionals in this job, have all the levels at Dunmore East covered with barrels and boxes in anticipation of the herring harvest. Many of the much-vaunted fishing ports are very picturesque to look at but I do not see the professionals pouring their barrels and boxes in there.  They put them in the place where they know the fish are being caught.</P>

      <P>Really, I do not want in any way to press the Parliamentary Secretary, but he does not make clear to me what the purpose is.  This is an amendment of the definition section of the Bill.  It sets out that the Principal Act is the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  There is then a series of amendments introduced into the Bill all of which refer to the Moville area, No. 4 being for the purposes of subsection (1) of Section 14.  It says: &ldquo;The Moville Area shall be deemed to be a fishery district and the Foyle Fisheries Commission shall be deemed to be the board of conservators therefor.&rdquo; Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would find it easier to explain the significance of the amendment, if we were to adopt the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's proposal and take the group of amendments together?</P>

If we do not insert the Moville Area in this section and the associated sections, there is a doubt as to whether the legislation applies to the Moville Area but, if we insert in Section 1 that &ldquo;Moville Area&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by the <Col N="661" /> Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, it then becomes clear that those provisions of this measure do apply to the Moville Area as defined within the meaning of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952.</P>

I want to indicate to him that the amendment is designed to ensure that the provisions in the section brought in in this legislation apply to the Moville Area.

This amendment is designed to apply these provisions to this entire State in order to make it <Col N="663" /> quite clear that the Foyle Fisheries Act and the administration of the Moville Area are not excluded from the total administration of the Bill.  It is important to bring in this amendment to clarify the matter and make certain that the provisions which we intend to apply to the whole State do in fact apply to the Moville Area, which is a special area, the area under the care of the Commission within the Republic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is advised that it is necessary to legislate specifically for this part of the country, lest it be assumed that the Foyle Fisheries Act excluded it from the consolidated fisheries legislation?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does it not?  In fact, I brought in the Foyle Fisheries Act, and I was never conscious of the fact when we took over the Foyle Fisheries with the Government of Northern Ireland that there was any provision which excluded that part of the fisheries which lay within our territory from the regulations applying to other parts of the country.  Perhaps my memory is playing tricks on me but my recollection is that the Foyle Fisheries Act was primarily an Act to implement the bargain we made together with the Government of Northern Ireland to take over the Foyle fisheries from the London company.  I do not remember that there was any provision in that Act excluding that part of the fishery which lay within our jurisdiction from the general operation of our fishery laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the governing Act in regard to this matter.  Section 325 of that Act specifically excepted the Foyle fishery area from the operation of the Consolidation Act.  This is a legislative amendment of the Consolidation Act and it is therefore necessary to adapt the provisions of this amending legislation in regard to the Moville Area, the part of the Foyle Fisheries Commission area which is within the Republic.  I shall quote the section for the Deputy.  It is Section 325 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act of 1959. It says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Moville Area&rdquo; means the Moville Area as defined by subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Act of 1952.</P>
      <P>(2) Save as provided by subsection (3) of this Section, this Act shall not extend to the Moville Area.</P>
      <P>So, the Consolidation Act does not extend to the Moville Area unless adapted to it.  This is an amendment of the Consolidation Act and, if it is to apply to the Moville Area, as to the rest of the country, it is necessary to bring in the amendment before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it, a certain fishery area is operated under the terms of the 1952 Foyle Fisheries Act and all along in the case of any changes or amendments of the 1952 Act similar changes were made by both Parliaments at the same time. These amendments here and the provisions of the Bill do affect the Foyle fishery which is owned by both Governments and, therefore, is it not logical that there should be similar legislation on the other side because the fishery area administered by the Commission is not divided up in any way?  It is one complete block where fishermen wander all over the place from both sides?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy refers to is necessary only in the case of legislation amending the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, when such legislation affects the whole area administered by the Foyle Fisheries Commission lying on both sides of the Border.  This measure is designed to extend only to the area within the Foyle Fisheries Commission's area which is affected by the laws of the Republic, that is, the Moville Area. Therefore, there is no need for any dual legislation such as the Deputy mentions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that heretofore we have kept in step, that if there was a restriction put on fishing in the Foyle by our Government there was a corresponding restriction put on by the Northern Ireland Government so that the even balance would be maintained between fishermen coming from both jurisdictions?  Now we have in Section 27 a very material reinforcement of the law in relation to the sale of salmon.  That is the effect of Section 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a reinforcement of the law, of which I approve, a good reinforcement of the law, but I should like to be <Col N="666" /> reassured, if we are going to tighten up the law in order to prevent the illegal disposition of salmon by our fishermen, that there will be a corresponding obligation on the fishermen on the other side of the fishery to act up to the same high standards as we are setting for our men.  It would be very unfortunate if in our legitimate and proper desire to protect the Foyle fisheries we imposed a whole series of penalties for certain acts on the part of the fishermen only to discover that if you had been fortunate enough to reside on the other side of the Foyle you could go on doing all the things we propose to prohibit.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that aspect of the situation has presented itself to the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary and I think what Deputy Cunningham suggested is reinforced by the fact, which had escaped my memory, that the Foyle fishery, or what is called here the Moville Area, was excluded from our Consolidation Act because apparently we thought to get the Moville Area in a category to itself so that the legislation affecting it would march in step with the corresponding legislation on the other side of the lough in Northern Ireland.  Here we are departing from that principle and introducing, as I say, commendable restrictions on our fishermen for the preservation of the resources of the lough but it is a new principle if we are to tighten our regulations west of the lough without a corresponding tightening on the east shore of the lough.</P>
    <P>That is a matter that the Parliamentary Secretary should have regard to. I appreciate his difficulties.  It is not always easy to get agreement about these things but the situation in Lough Foyle has been one of delicacy for many generations.  Much of the difficulties were removed once we got joint control of the lough by the two Governments but I think the relative calm that has been established there is very largely dependent on the knowledge amongst the fishermen that hereafter all the fishermen, whichever side of the lough they come from, are treated on a basis of absolute equality.  That is a principle we ought to be careful to preserve in this legislation.</P>

I agree with Deputy Dillon when he says that, even if they are for the benefit of the fishermen themselves, any restrictions envisaged in this Bill should be applicable to all fishermen because, as I see it, all the fishermen can fish anywhere in the Foyle.  For that reason it would be a bad thing at this stage to have varying regulations in that unit of fishery controlled by the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  It does seem to me that this is the first departure from co-operative legislation by both Governments.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to have a second look at these matters because it would be bad for us here to start something which creates a difference of regulations in what is regarded by all sides as a complete fishery unit operated under the same regulations for all fishermen from all sides.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get this matter into certain perspective. The position at the moment is that on each side of the Border you have a separate corpus of fisheries legislation, a code of fisheries legislation here and a code of fisheries legislation on the other side.  Since the enactment of the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, it has been consistent policy in any amendments to our general fisheries code to segregate the Moville Area under the Commission's administration as being subject to new fishery laws applicable in this State.  There is nothing new or unique in regard to this.  The amending Act passed by this House last year&mdash; the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1961&mdash;notwithstanding Section 325 in the 1959 Act &mdash; has brought the Moville Area within the Commission's administration entirely into line with the administration of fisheries legislation in the rest of the State and the present amending Bill before the House is merely a continuation of what has been the policy underlying successive fisheries enactments passed here since 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that under the Section I have mentioned a distinction is drawn <Col N="668" /> between the Moville Area and the rest of the State but, by the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1961, also, a number of provisions under the Consolidation Act of 1959 were made applicable to the Moville Area.  I shall read subsection (1) of Section 10 of the Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1961:</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, indicated in the Table to this section shall, notwithstanding section 325 of that Act, extend to the Moville Area with the substitution, for references to boards of conservators, of references to the Commission and, for references to a fishery district, of references to the Moville Area and subject also to the modifications mentioned in the Table.</P>
    <P>The effect of that amending legislation passed last year has been to bring the Moville Area into line with the general fisheries administration of the Republic.  We are now seeking by these amendments to ensure a continuance of that situation.  The joint co-operative legislation to which Deputy Cunningham refers arises only when both Parliaments enact legislation dealing with the administration of the Foyle Fisheries Commission&mdash; for instance, the amending Act of 1961 to which I referred along with the Act Deputy Dillon brought in in 1952. The amending Act of 1961 was brought in in just such a manner; it was brought in by way of parallel legislation on the part of Parliament here and Parliament in Belfast because these Acts referred specially to the Foyle fisheries area.  At no stage was the Moville area, within the Foyle area, excepted entirely from the general fisheries legislation of this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Parliamentary Secretary to say a couple of minutes ago, not seven minutes ago&mdash;he rather rebuked me, I thought, or did my ears deceive me? &mdash;that the Moville area had always been excluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said it was a defined area excluded under Section <Col N="669" /> 325 of the Consolidation Act of 1959, but, apart from that Act, enactments subsequent to 1952, particularly the amending Act of 1961 in relation to the Foyle fisheries, have ensured, for the purposes of new fisheries legislation, that the defined area of Moville has been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as I understood the law, but I thought the Parliamentary Secretary to be somewhat amazed that I did not know the Moville area was excluded from the consolidation Act, and he was shocked that I did not know that, I having been associated with the Foyle Fisheries Act.  In fact, Moville has been brought within the general ambit of the fisheries legislation of this country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That appears to me to be the exact opposite of what the Parliamentary Secretary said seven minutes ago.  But it is of no consequence.  It could happen to a bishop.  It is established now in any case that the Moville area is now subject to the general fishery code operating throughout the Republic.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Parliamentary Secretary is not giving due regard to the point raised by Deputy Cunningham and myself that, where we are introducing in respect of this Moville area further restrictions on the fishermen resident in the Republic, it is eminently desirable that corresponding restrictions should be accepted by those fishing in this fishery by residence in Northern Ireland.  It is vitally important to the successful operation of this very significant co-operative effort between the two Governments that a full measure of understanding <Col N="670" /> and goodwill should be maintained in very difficult circumstances, because there is a long-troubled history behind this fishery with the fishermen of the Six Counties jealously watching the fishing from the Six County shore and <i>vice versa</i>.</P>
      <P>We are not only, I take it, to assume the Moville area to cover the lough itself; it also covers the tributary rivers running into the lough and you have, therefore, a number of rivers in the exclusive jurisdiction of Northern Ireland and a number of rivers in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Republic. I am apprehensive, looking at Section 27, of which I approve, that if it is applied in all its rigour to all fishermen in the Republic who fish on the lough or to lough fishermen who fish in the river, and there is no corresponding provision in the Northern Ireland legislation, grievance will tend to accumulate. I think this is a matter into which the Parliamentary Secretary ought to look and I suggest to him that, unless he has had this matter under consideration already, between now and the Report Stage, he should consider whether some discussions with the Northern Ireland Government are not required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate the difficulty of bringing into line with our fisheries code the fisheries code operating in the Six Counties.  That is not a difficulty likely to be resolved between now and the Report Stage of this measure.  I agree with the Deputy on the desirability of Governments more or less moving together in such a matter, particularly as it refers to these contiguous areas under joint administration. But it is a matter for the Northern Ireland administration to bring in legislation on lines similar to ours and, while it is eminently desirable that that should be done, the Deputy will appreciate that this applies not alone to this particular measure but to the entire field of fisheries legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that when the Foyle Fisheries amending <Col N="671" /> Act of 1961 was brought before the House, certain regulations, which are now in this consolidation Bill, were embodied in it?  Could we not have that now in reverse?  Could we not exclude the whole Foyle fishery area from this and further amend the Act of 1961 to bring it in line with the regulations in this consolidation Bill?  That was done before in advance.  Could we not do it now <i>post factum</i>?  For example, the regulations about the illegal sales of salmon or trout were last year embodied in the Foyle fishery legislation. That is now being dealt with for the rest of the country in this consolidation Bill.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary not say: &ldquo;We will exclude the Foyle area from the provisions of this measure but, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Government, we will bring the Foyle fishery legislation into line with what we are doing here now&rdquo;?  That would get the Parliamentary Secretary out of the difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it would not be practicable to do what Deputy Cunningham suggests.  Under the Foyle Fisheries Act of 1952, a number of provisions were enacted for the administration of that area.  All of these applied to the Moville area and general provisions under separate fisheries legislation were applied to the Moville area for the purpose of maintaining parity in relation to the provisions of the fisheries code applying within our State.  After the Foyle Fisheries Act of 1952, there was the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act of 1959 which defines the &ldquo;Moville area&rdquo; as being the area to which certain of the provisions then being repealed continued to apply by reason of the Foyle Fisheries Act of 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Foyle Fisheries (Amendment) Act, 1961, applied to the Moville area the corresponding provisions of the 1959 Act, thus ensuring that, where there had been a disparity between the old provisions and the modern fisheries code, Moville area and the rest of the State were made uniform. We are maintaining that uniformity in this piece of legislation.  Within the Foyle Fisheries Act, 1952, parity was maintained between certain provisions <Col N="672" /> for the Moville area and the overall fishery legislation then applying to the rest of the State.  That parity was maintained in the Foyle Fisheries Act of 1961 which again ensured that there was parity between provisions of the 1959 Act operating outside and inside the Moville area.  These amendments seek to bring that parity further.  What Deputy Cunningham referred to would bring about a rather drastic change of principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a long history behind this whole story.  I was making speeches about the Foyle fishery in Donegal in 1927.  It was a long troubled history.  I think the Leas-Cheann Comhairle may remember it. I doubt if Deputy Cunningham does. In those days, there was a continued fracas in relation to the Foyle fisheries, the blame for which was always visited on the London company.  I remember denouncing Fianna Fáil for having done nothing about it.  However, it was done by agreement with the Northern Ireland Government and that is a thing we should never forget.  It was done, I am happy to recall, through the superb negotiating ability of Mr. Rush, then a principal officer in the Department of Fisheries.</P>
      <P>The whole spirit in which it was done was the presumption on both sides that our fishery controls operating in that area would keep in step. I appreciate the difficulties of the Parliamentary Secretary.  With the passage of time and the enactment of fishery legislation in both areas of jurisdiction, the natural thing is for some tendency towards divergence to emerge.  I think Deputy Cunningham is right.  I agree with him in the view that you have got to watch this tendency very closely in regard to the Moville area and, in so far as it is humanly possible, avoid excessive divergence, lest you give rise to a recrudescence of all the intense feeling in that area which had its real root in the belief that the people on the eastern side of the estuary got a better deal than the people on the western side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That feeling is simmering under the surface and can boil up very rapidly. It is very hard for people to carry a <Col N="673" /> conviction to fishermen operating in that area, whether in the estuary or on the rivers, that there is not some advantage being extended to the people in Northern Ireland at the expense of the people in the Republic. I believe that our Department of Fisheries are vigilant to protect the legitimate interests of our people.  In a case of this kind, there is nothing more important than to persuade the people to believe that is true.  It requires not only to be done but the people must be persuaded that it is being done, if you are not to have very serious trouble harassing and embarrassing our administration.</P>
    <P>If our regulations get tougher and tougher for the protection of the fisheries, without a corresponding strengthening of the regulations on the other side, it may give rise to trouble which only local people or people with personal experience of the history of this fishery fully appreciate. I recognise the difficulties of the Parliamentary Secretary but it is clearly our duty, who have some knowledge of the history of this thing, to warn him of the dangers to which this growing divergence of fishery legislation may give rise in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is more important to keep uniformity between the Moville area and the rest of the country.  At the same time, I can see a point where there are contiguous areas.  If Deputy Cunningham and Deputy Dillon allow these amendments through, I promise to look into the matter between now and Report Stage and see if I can come back with something which may go part of the way towards meeting their views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for that. I think that perhaps the easiest way to deal with this matter is that as soon as possible after this Bill is enacted, we should further amend the Foyle Fisheries Act itself to bring it into line with what we are enacting here now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us whether there is any reason why our Department of Fisheries cannot do what the Shannon Oyster Company proposes to do? We tried to do it in Clew Bay.  I should like to know whether any success attended our efforts and why the Department of Fisheries have not been able to do it through their own expert staff.  Oyster fisheries on our own shores are primarily something that ought to belong to the people.  It seems an unfortunate departure to be inviting companies to come here to establish oyster fisheries on our own shores when we are already afflicted by the fact that a great many of our riparian fisheries are in exclusive ownership. We find that an embarrassment.  We object to certain well-to-do persons having an exclusive right to fish in certain rivers.  I think we ought to be on our guard against creating new exclusive rights in fishing.  If we are to have oyster fisheries, they should be in the ownership of the people.  If they are not, the time will come some day when Deputies will be asking why wealthy companies have the exclusive right to cultivate oysters when, in fact, the right should be exercisable for the benefit of the individual in the community. If that time should ever arise, I would be in sympathy with the representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that it is not enough to take precautions to prevent pollution, if we do not go on to exploit the waters which we are keeping pure. <Col N="675" /> I would regret it if we were preventing pollution exclusively for the protection of foreign companies to come in here and exploit our coastal waters. I should be interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary tell us that the restrictions on pollution which he envisages here will be used primarily by our Fisheries Branch to promote the growth of shellfish beds of suitable character in the ownership of the people rather than the ownership of the individuals I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon is drawing a long bow, so to speak, in this matter.  There are ample waters around our coast.  The few applications that have been received from foreign interests to develop an oyster industry in certain parts around our coast will leave an ample supply of water, tidal waters, bays, and so on, for development by our own people.</P>
      <P>Skill, risk, enterprise and capital are involved in developing certain specific places.  We very carefully circumscribe the specific area assigned to them.  At the moment, particularly in Holland, there is the prospect that the oyster fishing industry may be in difficulties in ten or twelve years' time. They are the main suppliers of oysters within the Common Market area. They have all the skills and technical know-how, built up over years.</P>
      <P>Some of these entrepreneurs in that country are interested, amongst others from Common Market countries, in using their know-how and technical capacity to engage in the development of an oyster fishing industry here in Ireland.  That would be, of course, of benefit to us in the way of employment and in the way of building up an export business.  That is without any detriment whatever, by reason of the availability of waters, to any such development in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experiments at Clew Bay, to which Deputy Dillon referred, have not been successful.  I regret that. We shall look into a further adjustment of the operations that have been carried on heretofore.  They have not been successful.  Oyster rearing, as Deputy Dillon well knows, is probably <Col N="676" /> the most highly complicated business imaginable.</P>
    <P>If know-how and a certain capacity in regard to oyster farming or oyster rearing has grown up over one hundred years, say, in Holland, it is certainly a very useful thing to import that skill in order to facilitate us in the rehabilitation of oyster beds in certain areas circumscribed and specified by way of Order.</P>
    <P>There is no danger of the coastal waters of our country falling into the hands of these people.  We have investigated the matter.  If we feel it is for the overall benefit of the country to have such capital, skill, risk, enterprise, knowledge and technical know-how, I do not see why we should not have it.  I think it is in accordance with the general policy pursued as a matter of principle in the past number of years.  Therefore, I should like to say to Deputy Dillon that he need not have any fears in this matter.</P>
    <P>We are watching the position carefully. There will be no complete domination of our coastal waters by such interests.  We shall continue to conduct our investigations and to offer our advice.  At the same time, having regard to the availability of coastal waters, that can be continued without detriment to private interests wishing to establish themselves here.</P>

      <P>When I concluded last night, I was mentioning the matter of public moneys being used for roads where railways had been taken up.  In my innocence, I thought only of Donegal and I mentioned it to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who happened to be in the Chair at the time, that when they took up the Donegal railway, they were telling everybody how much they were losing by it.  Now we find the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Local Government, had to budget for £75,000 a year for five years out of the Road Fund and out of the Exchequer for County Donegal alone.</P>
      <P>I made it my business to find out to the nearest available date&mdash;and I have it in my file&mdash;how we had gone with other places where there were railways taken up.  The Minister here now has accepted responsibility for taking up these railways.  He said it here last night that he was responsible for the policy.  We asked him to repeat it, and he did.  I am sure we all spoke slowly enough to have it put down on the records and there were a good many witnesses present because I have known Fianna Fáil Ministers to jump out of their word very often within less than 24 hours.  This is very interesting.  The Minister destroyed the railways in Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Longford, Kerry, Mayo, Monaghan and Sligo.</P>

      <P>I am not referring to him.  I am not attacking anybody. The Minister admitted last night that he was responsible.  He must have <Col N="691" /> somebody to carry this out for him. The agents at Kingsbridge carried out the destruction of the railways and this House voted £250,000 in 1959/60; I am breaking up the figures; I am not giving the figures in the same way as CIE have given them.  The breakdown was: Cavan, £45,000; Donegal, £75,000; Leitrim, £40,000; Monaghan, £45,000; and Sligo, £45,000.  That gives a total of £250,000 for 1959/60.  For 1960/61, the figures were: Cavan, £45,000; Donegal, £75,000; Leitrim, £40,000; and Longford, £12,500.  The Minister, I believe, represented Longford at the time and he had to go to Cavan out of it or somewhere else.  The other figures were: Kerry, £12,500; Mayo, £12,500; Monaghan, £45,000; and Sligo, £45,000.  The total was £287,500 for 1960/61 and in 1961/62, it was £287,500 again.  The total of these 1960/61 and in 1961/62, it was £287,500 again.  The total of these three figures is £825,000.  Therefore, let not the agents at Kingsbridge produce those figures and say: &ldquo;What good boys we are and what money we are saving.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like to put in a little addendum to that and say that instead of putting all these monsters and all this traffic on to the roads, making it necessary for the Minister for Local Government to send all this money down to the local authority, this money would have been better spent on improving the by-roads and the boreens up to farmers' houses.  Yesterday I had cleared the air for a little while when the Minister admitted here in the House before a good many Deputies that he was the responsible man.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister yesterday by Parliamentary Question; I asked him last night during the debate on this Bill; and I brought him in on the Adjournment last night, to give a breakdown of the figures on Page 5 of the CIE Report.  Am I allowed to mention the name of CIE here?  I want to read it again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> Road services were substituted for the railway on the West Cork Section as from 1st April, 1961.  Operating results during the year showed that the financial betterment from this substitution and from the substitution of road services for the West Clare and Waterford/Tramore railway lines last year was approximately £90,000.  The substitute services have worked efficiently and have met with general approval from the traders in the area.</P>
    <P>That is dishonest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Completely dishonest. No American bucket-shop run by a get-rich-quickly-Warrington would have produced that kind of financial report.  I asked the Minister yesterday to give me the latest available figures for the number of passengers carried and the intake in money on the Tramore bus service, this alternative bus service on which he prides himself. I asked him to separate the figures for Tramore from West Clare and West Cork, that is, to give us the separate figures for Tramore, for West Clare and for West Cork.  That is a reasonable request.  There is the £825,000 that has been spent on roads and the Cork figures are not in them at all.  I hope the House will take notice of this because we were the guinea pigs and the sufferers from the ruthlessness of the Minister's agents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not a case of how much money it was losing.  We are not definitely concerned with losses, unless they are irreparable losses or extraordinary losses.  We are more concerned with providing a service for the people.  I complimented the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs here today. The Minister for Transport and Power would shut down the telephone services if they were losing money, or shut down the Post Office, if it were losing money, or if the ESB were losing money the lights should be turned off on us.  This is a most ridiculous policy. I put down a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Transport and Power and it was disallowed.  The question asked was it the policy of CIE to tear up the railways and I <Col N="693" /> was told the Minister had no functions in the matter.  Last night, he told us that he directed it.</P>
    <P>You will admit, Sir, that this is very confusing for Deputies and for the whole country.  I intend tabling a question to ask the Minister to break up these figures for me.  I hope I will not have to put it down because if the Minister wants to be courteous, even at this late hour, we will give him the opportunity.  I gave him plenty of notice.  He had since last week to get in touch with his agents at Kingsbridge to find out what these figures are and on what was this £90,000 based.</P>
    <P>The record of the Minister in not answering Parliamentary Questions is notorious.  If a Deputy asks a question about Bord na Móna, the ESB or Aer Lingus, the Minister appears to have no function.  I hope, as a result of this debate and this Bill, that the air will be cleared.  Now the Minister has told us he is responsible for policy and, being the man responsible for policy, he therefore has a function.  If he says: &ldquo;Go and tear up the lines&rdquo;, they will, and if he tells them to stop, they must stop.</P>
    <P>I have a few remarks to make about how inaccurate the Minister is.  He is constantly going to chambers of commerce and disseminating inaccurate information about industry and about other Departments.  But we will stick to transport here.  On an Adjournment Debate, the former Deputy Palmer and I came in here and raised the question of railway lines which were torn up in Kerry and sold to Czechoslovakians.  A licence was given for their export and Irish firms were not allowed to compete or got no opportunity to compete. The Minister for Transport and Power answered me and I am quoting him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned this yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not mention this yesterday because he had not got it yesterday.  It shows how bad the Minister's memory is.  At column 1065 of the Dáil Debates for 13th December, 1960&mdash;it was an unlucky day&mdash;the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general export control is applied in order that firms cannot <Col N="694" /> get export licences for material which they describe as re-usable which in fact is really scrap.  In this case the material is regarded rightly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce as re-usable.  It is composed of rails of over nine feet in length, bridgework and wheels&mdash; material which is manufactured of steel and not cast iron.  It is scrap only in so far as Irish Steel Limited are concerned.  They are the only firm that could make use of the material.  In no other way could it be described as scrap because it is re-usable.</P>
    <P>The Tramore railway lines were not shipped to Czechoslovakia.  They were put up for public auction and there were plenty of local people to buy them. That is the kind of stuff we are getting from the Minister&mdash;usually inaccurate, sometimes half inaccurate, which means it is inaccurate in any case.</P>
    <P>I have one good word to say about this business.  It means nothing to my constituency but in my constituency we have great printing houses and great craftsmen. The Minister was criticised on this publication last night but I compliment his agents on it.  It is good that Government publications like this should be well produced by fine craftsmen.  It is important that the Government should give a good example in employing fine craftsmen. This is very informative as far as bulk figures and some other things are concerned but again I say to the Minister that it is dishonest and it covers up. The Minister and his agents know they were wrong to tear up this line between Waterford and Tramore.  The Minister and his agents know they were mean and vindictive in the manner in which they went about it. The Minister and his agents know that it is not right and it is not true for them to say that they have provided an adequate service because the service they have provided charges 2/8d. to bring a passenger from Waterford to Tramore and back while the line they tore up was able to carry the passenger for 1/9d.</P>
    <P>It is dishonest to say that it is <Col N="695" /> serving the people as well as the old service.  The old service was a great convenience and a great amenity for the mothers of families, and particularly the mothers of large families, in bringing their children to Tramore. They would need to be in the millionaire class to travel at the Minister's prices.  Last night, he stated that the service he has put on brings passengers in closer proximity to the beach.  He should go down there and have a look at it.  I was born and reared there and it does not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Deputy must concede, there has been an increase in the cost of all rail services in the past two or three years?  From Killarney up here, we are paying more than we did two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had better ask the Minister about it.  He has priced the railways out of existence. It is so bad now that working people in Dublin have a contract made with taxis to take them into work and the taximen are able to compete with the bus service.</P>
      <P>There was no necessity at all to take up this railway line.  It was not losing the amount of money given by the Minister in a figure to this House and to the local authorities in Waterford and Tramore.  We were not allowed discuss the matter with the authorities at Kingsbridge.  This was a little railway line, with only two stations and no intermediate stations.  At one end 30,000 people lived and at the other was the finest beach in Ireland.  Nearly half a million people travelled on it during the year it was torn up.  The Minister had no concern for them but he would spend £800,000 to subsidise the people walking into an airport.  I am not criticising the £800,000 spent on Shannon Airport, but I am showing how great the Minister's courage is in some directions and how he dies with fright when he is told the Waterford-Tramore line has lost £3,000.</P>

    <P>The Minister told us cockily last night that we had supported the Bill. We did support it because we got an undertaking from the present Taoiseach <Col N="696" /> who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I will always remember what he said.  He said it was no use going into every fiddle-faddle connected with that Bill.  We would not have to go into every small detail because there would be full consultation with interested parties in the case of any line being closed.  We were sold a golden brick.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to call off the hounds he has going around the country writing estimates of the weight of all the iron bridges in it.  We have a fine iron bridge across the Suir at Waterford.  I believe it is marked down for scrap, too, and I suppose it will go to some Czechoslovakian mill.  I should like to tell the Minister that one of his agents was down there smashing up fine locomotives, but I suppose that gives the Minister the opportunity of buying a whole lot of new ones.  He went up to look at the iron bridge and he said to one of his colleagues: &ldquo;We will have to have boats to take this down.&rdquo; Did he mean they were going to take it down and erect it in another place or did he mean they were going to take it down altogether?  Is it not obvious that all this has been surveyed? Is it not obvious that these men are good at producing the type of balance sheet given to us here?  They are thinking of the fine balance sheet they can bring in by tearing up the West Cork line or the line from Youghal to Cork.  The Minister will roll down to some dinner and announce that he is glad to say the deficit on CTE has been reduced.</P>

The Minister's agents were able to say that, as a result of the substitution of road services for the Waterford-Tramore line, the West Cork line and the West Clare line, there was an improvement of £90,000.  If they were able to show that, they must have had the figures from each of these places separately. I am not asking the Minister to have an inquisition into the accounts of CIE.  I am asking him to give us figures this report shows are available.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have some opportunity of pinning down the Minister.  He has been like a clever fox for a long time.  He had every dodge.  We had him for only a day's hunting and then he got away.  He either went to ground by saying he was not responsible or he dodged out of it altogether; but we had him yesterday and last night and we have him again today.  As they say in my constituency &ldquo;Beidh lá eile ag an bPaorach&rdquo;.  We will fight again another day.  Whether or not our Parliamentary Questions are ruled out of order, we will have another opportunity on a motion by the Labour <Col N="698" /> Party and on the Minister's Estimate.</P>
      <P>On one occasion I asked the Minister a Parliamentary Question and, of course, he would not give the answer. It was in connection with the figures for the Tramore line.  Then he told me it was in the neighbourhood of £400,000 when I had to bring him back on the Adjournment.  Would it not have been easier to say that earlier?  Or, was the figure so bad that he was ashamed of it?  That sort of thing gives me and the ordinary man in the street the idea that the Minister has something to hide when he consistently runs away from this matter.  I intend to make an issue of this.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister when, and if, he is replying to-night, to give me a breakdown of these figures.  If he does not do so, I shall ask a Parliamentary Question. If the question is not allowed, I shall take other steps.  If the question is allowed and the Minister refuses the information, I shall bring the matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is a very serious thing, if this Parliament votes public money to any Minister in any Government and that Minister comes before the House and solemnly says he has no responsibility.</P>
      <P>We are asking for an overall figure, not any niggling insignificant figure, a figure we know he has.  There is evidence that he has it and he refuses to give it, as I said last night, either through discourtesy or pigheadedness or vindictiveness of the kind which motivated him when he made the decision to tear up the Tramore railway line and then ordered at 2 o'clock on Saturday that it be torn up on Monday morning whether it was wet or fine.  It poured rain but men were employed to tear up the track on Monday morning because he was not taking any chances that any representations would be made to his leader or anybody else.  He had made up his mind to destroy the railway and destroy it he did.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>For my sins, after some 30 odd years here, I have been handed a constituency now stretching from the Kerry boundary to Mallow, from Mallow to Waterford and down <Col N="699" /> to Youghal.  In those areas, we have the Banteer-Newmarket-Kanturk line; the Mallow-Fermoy line, running to Waterford and the Cork-Youghal line. In the three cases, the heavy hand was brought down.</P>
      <P>I asked three Questions here last week and the answer I got from the Minister was that a certain gentleman was infallible, that the best experts in the world were dealing with the figures and we would have to accept them whether we liked it or not.  We wrote to CIE seeking information regarding passenger traffic on these lines and the reply we got was to the effect that having fully considered the request contained in the resolution, the Board regretted it could not make available the information sought.  It was suggested that the best way of dealing with the matter would be for representatives of the various bodies on whose behalf we wrote to appoint a deputation to meet CIE when the economic aspect of the operation of the three branch lines could be discussed.</P>
      <P>I am not going to be led blindfolded, with no knowledge of the figures, into any discussion with the Board of CIE.  We are entitled to get figures to make our case and I make no bones about that.  We wrote previously for a breakdown of the figures, such as Deputy Lynch spoke about, and we got this for the year ended 31st March, 1961: Waterford-Mallow line: revenue, £131,099; expenses, £152,754; and loss, £21,655. For the Cobh Junction-Youghal line the figures were: revenue, £32,858; expenses, £57,371; and loss, £24,513; and for the Banteer-Newmarket line, the figures were: revenue, £1,349; expenses, £3,600; and loss, £2,251.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I got the figure of £32,858 for revenue on the line from Cobh Junction to Youghal, I immediately looked round to discover where the money went or came from.  I applied to the Irish Sugar Company for their figures on the tonnage of beet loaded in those five railway stations, Carrigtwohill, Midleton, Mogeely, Killeagh and Youghal, for the year 1960-61, the amount of fertilisers sent down and the amount of dried pulp consigned to <Col N="700" /> those stations.  The figure I got was £29,436.</P>
    <P>On getting that figure, I thought it was worth going a little further into the matter and I went to Mr. Dwyer's factory in Midleton, Midleton Worsteds.  They gave me a figure of £1,560 paid by them at Midleton station in that year.  I went to Bennett's Maltings in Ballinacurra. They gave me a figure of £9,200 paid in that year.  I got the urban council of Midleton to call on the other merchants in Midleton and the receipts have been carefully examined.  The receipts from the merchants of Midleton amounted to £3,400.  I then went to Youghal and found that, between the Youghal carpet factory and Dwyer's factories, something over £24,360 had been paid during the year to CIE for rail services.  That gave us a total of £67,956 instead of £32,858 for total revenue given by CIE just over double.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to try to get the idea of the infallibility of the CIE Board out of his head.  I need only allude to a previous occasion when CIE got a brainwave that nobody wanted to go to Cobh to work, unless he came from Cork city.  All the trains from Cork were run non-stop to Rushbrooke.  The unfortunate Minister was put in the position, when I raised the matter here, of stating on the information obtained from these &ldquo;infallible&rdquo; people, that there was a first-class bus service from Cork to Cobh.  There was not a CIE bus seen in Cobh in the past 25 years.  I am prepared at any time to be reasonable but when I got an unreasonable answer like that, I had to call a public meeting to consider other methods of transport.  They stopped the trains the following morning for the passengers.  That is the kind of lunacy that has been going on.</P>
    <P>I gave a figure here for 22 miles of railroad which cost £57,371 to maintain each year.  Taking that figure from the revenue, for which I hold certified receipts from CIE, there was a net profit of £10,585, without counting passengers.  Did these creatures ever go to school or ever learn arithmetic?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mind what any Minister says.  We are all fair game in this House&mdash;the Minister and everyone else.  I am putting this here plainly: What I am looking for is a sworn inquiry into this matter.  Let it come out in the open where we can deal with it.  I have referred to the figure of £10,585 profit, without counting passengers.</P>
      <P>There is an enormous population in the city of Cork.  The workingclass people in Cork city could go to Crosshaven and Youghal.  Some years ago, as a result of the economy drive, the Crosshaven line was closed, with the result that the people wanting to travel to Crosshaven by bus cannot get buses to take them.  Before the order went out to the stationmasters on the various lines to refuse to give any information to the elected representatives of the people who sought it, I succeeded in finding out that 2,348 passengers left Cork city for Youghal on one Sunday this Summer.  That would be 70 busloads.  How are these people to travel or are they to be left in Cork city without the pleasure of getting even one trip to the seaside in 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the other end of my constituency, there is the Banteer-Newmarket-Kanturk line.  The figures given for that line are: revenue, £1,349; and expenses, £3,600, a loss of £2,251. We asked the Kanturk Development Association to deal with that matter for the year 1960-61 and they brought us in receipts for money paid to CIE <Col N="702" /> for rail services over that line.  For the year 1960-61, the figure was £7,000 odd.  The total revenue here returned is £1,300.  It is time there was a sworn inquiry into where the supposed losses of millions of pounds come from or who is getting the money.  This kind of thing has gone too far.  It has gone beyond all bounds.  How does the Minister expect that 70 buses will take these 2,300 passengers to Youghal and back?  Is there to be any other traffic on the road?  I know what the position is, but, unfortunately, the people concerned cannot assess what will happen.  We know that as a result of the monopoly they enjoy, they have greater profit on road services than on rail services.  Their idea is that if they can drive all this traffic on to the roads and let the ratepayers maintain the roads, they need not spend the £57,000 maintaining the line.</P>
    <P>I shall give the Minister an example of what will happen.  In the year 1960-61 £9,200 was paid by Bennett's Maltings on rail transport from Ballinacurra-Midleton.  As soon as the statement came out about the closing of the lines these people got in touch with Messrs.  Guinness, with the result that that £9,200 worth of traffic will be drawn by Messrs. Guinness's lorries next year.  Does anyone tell me that the Youghal carpet factory that paid over £11,000 to CIE for rail transport will not employ their own lorries? Will not the same thing happen in regard to Dwyer's two factories?  I can give the Minister a guarantee that the day that line closes, CIE will not get one ton of beet.  I guarantee that.</P>

Then, blindfolded, we are to come up and meet the CIE Board with no knowledge of the actual facts, to be told there that the revenue was so much, the cost was so much, and there are the losses, without our getting the figures to which we were entitled in order to prepare our case.  We have something <Col N="703" /> else to do, and I have something else to do, besides travelling around from merchant to merchant in each town and village in my constituency to get the figures I am entitled to get in relation to the accounts of any State-subsidised company in this country.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, Sir, the Minister comes here now with information apparently from the same source again, and he gives it here in reply to questions, and relies on the fact that the matter cannot be raised on the Adjournment under certain rules of this House.  I applied to have these three questions taken on the Adjournment.  I was told I was out of order.  This is the only way I have of voicing my opinion of what is happening and giving to the House and to the public the figures to show what is happening.  Our man can come along and quote figures of £32,000.  That shows Deputy T. Lynch the breakown he will get of the figure he has been demanding here all evening.  There is one breakdown, £32,000.  If he carried all the passengers for nothing for the years 1960 and 1961, instead of a loss of £24,000, there was a profit of £10,500 on freight alone, not taking account of any passengers at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I looked for the revenue from passenger traffic when I had collected those figures.  I think I was entitled to get it.  Apparently the same scarecrow that travelled around to every stationmaster in Cork and ordered him not to give information to the elected representatives of the people was availed of again in regard to these figures.  It was evidently decided by somebody that no information should be given.  We are entitled to information in relation to any State-subsidised company for which we have to vote the taxpayer's money in this <Col N="705" /> House.  We are voting taxpayers' money each year for CIE.  I question now whether that money came in at all because, if all their accounts are kept in the same manner as this account was kept, then somebody is getting money and hiding it somewhere &mdash;taxpayers' money.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but this is the only way in which we can get to the public knowledge and information of what is happening in relation to a State-subsidised company. We are refused information in this House.  We have no other way of bringing the information out into the open.  The Minister will be well advised to have a full sworn inquiry into the affairs of CIE.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The plain fact of the matter is that the people in the constituency referred to by Deputy Corry &mdash;he is a member of the constituency; I am also a member&mdash;view with alarm the proposal of CIE.  Whatever may be in the figures quoted by Deputy Corry, I was a member of the committee responsible for the collection of those figures.  We think they are right; perhaps they may be wrong. We have seen the figures given by CIE.  We think they are wrong; perhaps they may be right.  No one is a liar, but, in justice to the people, and because there is confusion with regard to the figures, the fairest and simplest way to straighten the matter out is for CIE to give, as requested by us, a breakdown of the figures in relation <Col N="706" /> to the three railways&mdash;Newmarket-Kanturk, Mallow-Waterford and Cobh-Youghal.</P>
      <P>Even if we are not agreed that keeping open and maintaining these railway lines represents a loss of revenue to CIE, I think there is still good reason for insisting that the lines remain.  There is a social side to this matter, a side which seems to be forgotten by many people.  Even if those lines lost money, I am convinced that, for social reasons, they should be kept going.  Do CIE ever think of the displacement, the discomfort and the unemployment that might result as a consequence of closing those lines? Is it not true that if and when they are closed, many families will be displaced? Some of them will become completely unemployed and we know the social aspect of that question.</P>
      <P>Is it not true also, as Deputy Corry says, that if those lines are closed, particularly the one from Cork city to Youghal, many families will be deprived of even a day at the seaside during the summer months?  Is it not true also that if the lines are closed, the traffic on the road being greater, the chances of fatal accidents and injuries on the road must correspondingly increase ?</P>
      <P>I appeal in the sanest possible way to the Minister to take all these considerations into account and consult with the people and not to fight or haggle, saying: &ldquo;We will not give you the figures but we will meet you on a deputation.&rdquo;  I think Deputy Corry was quite right in saying that it is unfair to ask people to meet the Board of CIE without giving them the figures they require to make their case.  I appeal to the Minister to be reasonable in this matter, to be more sane.  Someone is going to lose face before the whole thing is over.  I do not mind if it is ourselves, provided that a reasonable approach is made and the railways kept going, even if a loss is incurred by so doing.</P>

      <P>I come from an area which has gone through all the pains and anguish attached to the closing of railways.  I consider I can contribute <Col N="707" /> something useful in the way of giving a general picture of what we are facing. It is easy to understand that Deputies coming from some areas threatened with the closing of lines will become heated.  Statements were made across the floor of the House and an attack was even made on the Minister by Deputies on my side of the House.  I think these statements were made without a realisation of the facts and figures.  A case was made in relation to the Youghal line and a total figure was given.  In connection with that figure, the fact was completely overlooked that the part of the line covered was only the part to Cork.  In other words, the mileage of outlying lines was not taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The same applies to the material brought to the Youghal factories.  It had to come from Dublin and many other centres.  I distinctly remember that, in my own town of Killorglin, figures were put up and £120,000 was paid out for goods shipped from Killorglin to outlying places, such as Dublin and other centres, in connection with wool, fish, mussels and so on, but when it was pointed out that the line from Killorglin to Farranfore covered only 11 miles and that all those figures were related only to 11 of the 200 miles which the railway line covered, the amount of money earned by that part of the line was only £1,800.</P>
      <P>We have to face facts and figures. Whilst I accept what Deputy Corry said, we have got to accept the railway figures as well.  They must know their business.  Surely nobody will seriously accuse them of trying to sabotage or destroy the position, because that is what it amounts to ? They are going eventually to put themselves out of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me refer to the statistics of lorries registered.  Last year, I think there were 2,000 more lorries than the year before.  I am open to correction there but I think I am not far wrong.  Two thousand lorries are the equivalent of 12,000 railway wagons.  A ten ton lorry travelling over 50 miles outwards has a daily turn-about while a railway wagon carrying the same tonnage takes a week over the same distance.</P>
      <P>Let us remember that all the members of this House voted and gave permission to Dr. Andrews to put the railways in order.  The position is not now working out as the Deputies concerned hoped it would at that time.  I think it is time that a general examination of the whole position were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me get back to the position in relation to the Cork and other lines. The people in those areas are probably the greatest offenders.  I am a merchant and we carry the bulk of our stuff by road practically.  Since the <Col N="709" /> railway went, we are compelled to do this.  The fact is that we find ourselves with more lorry power than we need for our business.  We try to get extra business outside.  We sell far beyond our sphere of influence of selling in order to make these lorries pay. The small shopkeepers could not care less whether there is a railway or not because they are serviced from Dublin by vans.  The only people who could keep it going are the big concerns and the bigger merchants but even they are providing their own transport and are hitting the railways.</P>
    <P>This is a serious matter for the House.  The railways do serve a very big public interest, particularly at peak times.  Perhaps the areas concerned could come to the assistance of the railways by baronial guarantee. The loss of the railways is rather more a matter of prestige.  People think they are being pushed into the backwoods.  I heard in my own area at the time of closure that the people would miss the whistle of the train.</P>
    <P>The railway is not now missed.  No longer does it form a part of the people.  They have a good service at their doorstep.  People along the roadways can get into a bus to go anywhere they like, whereas they had to travel two and three miles to a railway station.  That is the position. People are what they are.  They seem to take to the new system.</P>
    <P>We in this House should look at the position objectively and face up now to the issue of whether the railway serves a purpose at all in this country.  Once we decide it is serving a big purpose, now is the time to save it and not in five years' time when there are further curtailments.  The way things are going today, I can see the railway driven into Kingsbridge in ten years' time.  That is a serious position.  We can save the railways now if we get down to face the issue properly and rescind whatever instructions were given by full agreement of the House.</P>
    <P>In my area the railway has passed&mdash; it is gone.  I give this view objectively; I am not giving it from a heated point of view.  I am looking at all the advantages and disadvantages.  We are <Col N="710" /> satisfied that the system as it is operating is doing a good job.  It is doing a satisfactory job for the people in general.  We had the largest crowd ever massed out of south and west Kerry for the All-Ireland Football Final and there was no question of congestion.  They all got to Killarney, Tralee and Dublin.  Even at such peak traffic periods, it is obvious that the ordinary transport is adequate for the people.</P>
    <P>It is said that the big issue facing us here is whether CIE is of value and should be retained.  If it is of value to the nation, we are now faced with the issue of saving it.  Now is the time to see that it is not further curtailed because if it is not saved at this stage, I feel the final collapse will come rapidly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy who has just spoken suggested we should try to examine the position as objectively as we can in order to try to find out the wisest likely policy for the country to pursue in future in relation to CIE. He himself gave a remarkably good example of that objective analysis. What he had to say in his very short contribution was most valuable.  I should like to examine the position as nearly as I can to the same objective way as the Deputy.</P>
      <P>We put this Bill forward simply because we are just a little over halfway now, I suppose, to that very important date in the calendar of CIE &mdash;1964&mdash; the date on which, according to the decision of this House, the company must break even.  At this stage, as mentioned by the previous speaker, if things go on as they are going, then at a gradually progressive rate and at an increasing speed, CIE&mdash;on the railway side at any rate&mdash;will end up at Kingsbridge. Clearly, it is, if anything, now rather like one of those mythical animals they talk about which slowly at first, but at an increasing speed, eventually devour themselves.  CIE on the rail side, is doing that.  The position should be examined to see whether it is desirable that this shall happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the whole idea of rail services like the idea of tram services in the cities&mdash; a fossilised museum piece which can <Col N="711" /> safely be dispensed with from the point of view of our country, from the point of view of the various factors involved in making this great change?  Consider the demographic changes that are likely to take place in rural Ireland, the social changes that are likely to take place, and the various other changes.  Consider the prospect of the people of Killorglin arriving to the All-Ireland Football Final in buses on one particular day when they might have gone along by train.  Is it better that it should take place like this or should we try to retain the best there is in the rail services?</P>
    <P>I think our greatest objections to the present approach to the examination of the public transport problems of the country are that their treatment has been based on an adherence to what we believe are really doctrinaire conservative ideas of the organisation of transport.  We believe we can show that the application of the principle that the service must pay its way or else be abolished is a bad principle. It is having a damaging effect on the country as a whole.  It is not even providing us with an efficient service. As far as we can see, it is not even at the present moment&mdash;examining the accounts of CIE&mdash;likely to meet the directive of the law in 1958 that it must pay its way by 1964.  It has had a number of very serious repercussions from the point of view of the roads, the greatly increased congestion on the roads, and, following increased congestion on the roads, has had the effect of increasing the rate of accidents on the roads, deaths on the roads, injuries on the roads.</P>
    <P>In addition, I think it can fairly be said that the labour relations in CIE are probably about as bad as they could be.  Therefore, I should like to ask the Minister if he still feels that the retention of this imposition on the management of CIE is justified.</P>
    <P>I would again support the Deputy's viewpoint that this imposition was placed on the Board of CIE, and I suppose incidentally on the Minister, by a decision of the House and can be removed only by a decision of the House.  For that reason, I agree <Col N="712" /> completely with all the censures made against the Chairman of CIE&mdash; I think he is all the things they said he was, arrogant and dictatorial, with an appalling sense of public relations. He is very foolish that he does not take pains with public relations and I think the Minister is also at fault in many respects in his curious attitude to this question of his responsibilities.  At times, he is responsible; at other times, he is not responsible.</P>
    <P>I agree also with what Deputies have said in regard to this question of trying to get information about CIE.  I found myself in the position of putting Questions to the Minister and either having them ruled out by the Ceann Comhairle on grounds which were perfectly legitimate, I have no doubt, or of having them accepted by the Minister but being told by him that he had no responsibility.  I have tried to get information on matters such as the mileage of trains in a particular year, the number of diesel and steam engines, the durability of these locomotives and so on&mdash;all perfectly legitimate information for any public representative trying to make up his mind about claims made for and against the present system of public transport.</P>
    <P>I have written to Dr. Andrews and asked for information, and his reply to me has been that he would not give it.  Rather like Deputy Corry in a way, it is comforting to know that the man is equally arrogant with us all, that he treats us all with the same measure of contempt.  Instead of giving me the information I sought, he sent me a 16 to 20 page long-winded, wordy, platitudinous dissertation on his ideas about public transport.  I am not a bit interested in his ideas because I know too well what they are.  I also know too well what is happening in the operation of the transport services &mdash;that eventually they will be reduced to an irreducible minimum, operating so that Dr. Andrews can produce his annual report every year in glowing colours, giving us only very limited information, as most Deputies have pointed out.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Deputy who has just spoken is right that we must not do anything that would make Dr. <Col N="713" /> Andrews work himself out of a job.  I do not think there is any fear of that. He has not stopped a large number of unfortunate workers working themselves out of jobs.  There is a very high rate of redundancy in CIE.  It is one of the things which has led to the very poor labour relations which exist in CIE.  We believe then that this whole question of public transport is a particularly complicated and complex one.  Transport services in any society are the threads which hold the whole fabric of that society together and when an effort is made to disrupt these threads, to curtail or restrict them in any way, it will make great changes in the very fabric, and that is a most important consideration. In our discussions of public transport in 1958, we did not take that point into consideration sufficiently seriously. If we are to alter public transport to whatever way will best suit the economy or needs generally, we must take into consideration all the other factors which are inextricably bound up with the apparently simple questions of buses and trains, of road freight, passenger traffic and so on.</P>
    <P>The most important of these implications are the social implications, particularly in a society like ours which is predominantly rural, predominantly agricultural, which has this dreadful record of rural depopulation, this flight from the land, this very undesirable great growth of the concentration of population particularly on the eastern seaboard, in Dublin, and in the city areas generally&mdash;all particularly undesirable in a country which is anxious to try to develop its economy, based as it should be on agriculture.  There has been a tendency by city Deputies &mdash;perhaps it is understandable&mdash; on the question of the management of CIE to concentrate too much on the cities and large towns and virtually to ignore the outskirts and the farther off parts of the country&mdash;places like Dingle, Donegal, Connemara or wherever it may be.</P>
    <P>We hold the view that every man in our society has identical rights and he should be given as near as possible identical facilities, and that if a person, <Col N="714" /> as part of his contribution towards the national economy, chooses to own a small farm out in Rossaveal, or up in Donegal, or down in Dingle, he has certain social responsibilities which, to a certain extent, he can honour only if he is enabled to do so by the existence of transport services&mdash;simple things like the education of his children.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in CIE to talk about the big man, the man who is driving around in varying sizes of motor cars and so on, personal transport of one kind or another, but it is terribly important to many small farmers that they be facilitated in such matters as sending their children to school or seeing that their wives can go to the local towns for domestic purposes, or social purposes, in seeing that young people living in rural Ireland can be given facilities for transport to the bright lights of the local towns.  These are the most important considerations, if we are to encourage the people to remain in the rural parts of Ireland.  It would be just too bad if we all came into the cities to live.  The repercussions would be felt on the national economy and national prosperity as a whole.  Everybody would suffer.  The population surveys have shown this is a very serious defect in the development of our population changes over the past 30 years and I believe that the present deterioration in the transport services, brought about by this insistence on the provision in Section 7 of the Act that the transport company must be run purely on a profit and loss basis, without any humanitarian considerations whatever, is the result of that retrograde, irresponsible decision which has done very great damage already.</P>
    <P>As the previous Deputy and other Deputies pointed out, it will do irretrievable damage, unless some serious consideration is given to it.  Quite obviously, also, in the consideration of public transport, one must take the repercussions in regard to the provision of an alternative transport system and how that is to be done.  That brings in the question of how much money we are prepared to spend on roads if they are to carry this alternative <Col N="715" /> traffic.  A tremendous amount of money must be spent on these roads, to enlarge existing ones and increase the mileage in order to see there is not complete bedlam as there is at the moment.  In order to reduce that bedlam a considerable amount of money will have to be spent.</P>
    <P>As far as I know, there has been no co-ordination between the Minister for Transport and Power, the Minister for Local Government and the local authorities in the provision of better roads to bear the increased traffic.  It is the sheerest madness to go on as we are at the moment pouring a greater volume of traffic of all kinds on to our roads &mdash; more personal traffic, more public freight traffic.  Our roads were never meant for such traffic at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> In page 15, before section 35, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every order made by the Minister under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next subsequent twenty-one days on which that House has sat after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to insert a new section before Section 35. It is proposed to meet the wishes expressed by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flanagan on Second Reading when they made the point that there was no provision in the Bill as it stood to provide for every order made by the Minister under the applicable sections being laid on the Table of the House. This amendment makes it mandatory that any such orders must be laid on the Table of the House for examination. I think it meets the views which were expressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking last night, the Minister gave us a pretty extensive survey of the forestry situation as a whole but I cannot detect in his speech any change in the policy which has been in existence over the years.  It seems to me that the be-all and end-all of forestry policy and administration is State planting and concentration as far as possible on the nurseries in the one area.  The same appears to apply to acquired land.  There has always been a theory within the Forestry Division that they should not acquire any land, unless they can get it alongside an existing forestry station.  For that reason, they have adhered to a stereo-typed policy over the years.</P>
      <P>I am not criticising that from a State point of view.  As far as State afforestation goes, they seem to be following in the steps of their predecessors. The active drive for the figures I have here before me appears to have commenced in 1948.  In 1947 to 1950, there was a big rise in State afforestation which increased gradually as time went on.  The State at the present moment owns approximately 450,000 acres of land and probably a little more than that.  It is a sizeable amount of the limited acreage of the entire country.  The aim and object is to plant 25,000 acres a year.  I have no personal objection to that but I want to stress early on in my speech that of the total vast sum being expended on forestry of £2,524,000, and that is allowing for the appropriations in aid of £720,000, only £25,000 is being expended on private afforestation.</P>
      <P>I have here some very interesting figures relating to the forestry situation in Europe.  The same applies to forestry as applies to everything else in Europe to-day, that you must try to establish an overall communal policy because if you do not, you will not get anywhere.  That has been one of the greatest difficulties in agriculture, that there has not been a communal policy, that there is a different policy on each side of the fence which has led to doubt, difficulty and frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The same applies to forestry.  In forestry, there is the greatest potential for economic development, not only in this country but throughout the entire continent.  Statistics available show that at present there are very large imports of both types of timber in Europe and the projections I have are produced by the OECD, the FAO of the United Nations, and the Council of Europe, indicating that there will be an increasing demand for timber over the years, imports of which by 1970 will approximate to the enormous sum of £800 million.  That seems to me to open up an avenue of economic development in Ireland which we would be well advised to follow as well as we can.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister is aware of the actual import and export figures which have been prepared by the experts in Europe but if he is not, I shall be very happy to give him the copies I have at my disposal.  Unfortunately, they are in metric tons and the prices are in dollars but it is easy to translate them into our own rates.  Practically all the countries of Europe are importers of timber.  With the extraordinary economic advance which is taking place under the European Economic Community and perhaps with the affiliation thereto of other countries to which its economic advantages will extend, the demand for timber will increase.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the 25,000 acres of timber for afforestation, which is the absolute maximum the Minister will achieve as a result of the difficulties in procuring the land to plant and under the existing system, will not anything like meet the requirements. It will not meet the domestic demand, nor will it leave us in the position to expand this important branch of our economy and possibly to export. Furthermore, I want to draw the Minister's attention to this, that in the structural alterations that have taken place in all the countries in connection with agriculture&mdash;in practically all other countries&mdash;forestry is embraced in the Ministry of Agriculture&mdash; attempts are being made to deal with the political and economic situation that is developing within agriculture; <Col N="722" /> people are leaving the land on account of mechanisation and are being replaced and retained on the land by forestry.</P>
    <P>I have read very carefully the Minister's speech, of which he was good enough to give me a copy.  I find there is a growing amount of co-operation between the Departments concerned which might to a certain extent co-relate the matters about which I have been talking.  The only reference in the Minister's speech is to the inter-departmental conference which suggests some attempt to relate the existing size of farms and forestry. The policy of the Forestry Division has always been only to buy land where they have big tracts of land already, and further than that, to establish nurseries only in big centres where they feel they can increase these nurseries; in other words, their policy has been to centralise.  It seems to me that that policy is the direct opposite to the policy of the other countries.</P>
    <P>In Turkey and Greece, which are considered the underdeveloped countries of Europe, in the entire lay-out of the developing countries, an endeavour is being made absolutely to co-relate the two factors, agriculture and forestry.  I think it is a mistaken policy to have large tracts of land and to concentrate, as we have done heretofore, on having forestry land in the one big centre and having land only where there is a forestry centre.  I do not see that there is any reason for a continuation of that policy.</P>
    <P>It is not as it was 20 years ago when this scheme was laid down by the Forestry Division.  There was little transport then, motor transport and so on, and lorries were not available to those concerned and they could only start centres here and there on small tracts of land.  What we really want is plenty of afforestation in Ireland but the State is limited because it cannot get enough land and the reason the State is limited is that it will take tracts only where it can get them in existing forestry centres.</P>
    <P>That policy should be altered.  The Minister should take the bit in his teeth and say to the officials: &ldquo;Your <Col N="723" /> policy was all right some years ago, but we want a modern and up-to-date policy and the aim and object is to get as much land as possible.&rdquo;  Further, their policy should be not only to get land for the State but to see that the land is planted and that we get timber for the country.  That brings me back to my old favourite in this House, something I have advocated ever since I came into public life.  I have never yet been convinced that private enterprise, properly encouraged and aided, will not make as good a job as, if not a better job than, State enterprise.  For that reason, the Minister should seriously consider what I am saying, if he will accept that.</P>
    <P>Remember, in this enormous Vote &mdash;it is for £2½ millions and with the grant-in-aid, it will reach nearly £3 millions&mdash;the sum of £25,000 for private afforestation is a negligible sum.  The Minister may well say: &ldquo;I have done all I can to encourage people to plant land&rdquo;.  That may be, but something is definitely wrong when you have 450,000 acres&mdash;it is now probably nearer half a million acres&mdash; under the jurisdiction of the Department and the active planting is going on, while only the owners of something over 1,200 acres are looking for the actual grant.  Alongside with the State enterprise, you are not getting the private enterprise which you could afford.  The Minister could and should encourage people as much as possible to go in for private enterprise because timber is one of the things for which there is a market.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point which I cannot understand.  The grant at the moment is £20 per acre, although I understand the Department are considering giving the grant for half an acre.  Assuming that one has to plant an acre to get the grant of £20, there is some extraordinary rule within the Department that that grant is not payable to anybody who afforests land alongside a forestry centre.  Is that, in effect, not forcing the issue?  If I have land, or if anybody else has land, on which previously there has been timber and that timber has been sold and the soil <Col N="724" /> is now fresh and ready for reafforestation, we cannot get the State benefit if we are near a forestry centre.  That means, in effect, that the State is trying to freeze out the private individual. Where are you likely to get land to plant except scrubland or high land or bog land or something like that?  The Minister stressed that we want good land.  By good land is meant hard, dry land.  Anybody who knows anything about timber knows that trees grow better on dry land, that dry type of land you get alongside the bigger estate.  The State is trying to force out the private individual as against State afforestation.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to make a good job of afforestation, he will want to remember that whether it is the State or a private individual planting the land, what we want is timber developed for the nation as a whole.  The figures I can give the Minister with regard to potential imports will convince him that there is a considerable market for timber in Europe.  I shall not give too many figures because I should not like to weary the House with them.  As I have said, I shall be happy to hand over these figures to the Minister&mdash;they are figures officially collected by an international organisation&mdash;provided he will be good enough to return them when he has copied them.</P>
    <P>In 1960, the Netherlands imported 1,359,000 metric tons of timber and the Netherlands is not a very big country. The Federal Republic of Germany imported 2,157,000 metric tons of timber. Those were imports of wood-shaped timber.  The Federal Republic of Germany in the same year imported 3,231,000 metric tons of round timber and the Netherlands imported 630,000 metric tons of wood rounds.  Those are just two examples I have taken. That timber is not imported from Scandinavia but from outside Europe, from other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>It is one of the efforts in which we can really drive ahead.  To bring it back again to the tie-up between the agricultural sector and the Forestry Division, there are of course many small tracts of land scattered here and there which the Forestry Division could <Col N="725" /> acquire.  It may be argued that the fencing of that land would be uneconomic.  I am unaware of the fact that the Forestry Division are making money or are likely to make money for some years to come, but if the State goes on planting 25,000 acres a year, it must reach a stage at which it will be making money.  We have two vital concerns in relation to forestry : one is the employment it will give and the second is the raw material it will provide for us.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to note that the larger proportion of our planting has transferred to the West of Ireland because this is one place in Ireland which is entirely bereft of raw materials and which is faced with perhaps a greater problem than anywhere else, with the exception of counties like Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan.  The West of Ireland is faced with a massive unemployment problem and a total lack of raw materials.  Though there is nothing in the Minister's speech to indicate it, I think this planting is going on there because there has been departmental co-operation and that is the reason why we have been able to get the land and plant it and provide the employment which it is giving. That could be vastly extended.  That is what every other country is doing but somehow the Forestry Division has a scheme laid down for it.  Perhaps that is bureaucracy; all countries suffer from that, but perhaps we are inclined to suffer from it more.  I would ask the Minister not to be a constitutional monarch and put into effect his own ideas.  He is a westerner himself and must know the problems which exist there.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned forest fires and I am happy to support him, speaking on behalf of the major Opposition Party.  As he said, the potential loss is £250,000 and it could become far more than that.  However, I think the Minister was rather unfair in laying the blame for forest fires.  My experience is that the people who start forest fires are not the local farmers.  They have enough <i>savoir faire</i> to put the fire in a place where it will not destroy anything. The people who do it are the tourists.  Instruction is necessary on <Col N="726" /> that point.  It may be necessary to indicate to Bord Fáilte, who are largely concerned with tourism, that these are the people responsible for the majority of fires.  It is the picnickers.  You get a very dry day, particularly in the autumn.  That is the kind of thing that starts forest fires.  The Minister said the farmers burning gorse were responsible for it and that may be so. I think the notices should be put up, as they are in most places, cautioning people against that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the direct sale of arable land and indicated that Deputies should not press for particular cases.  There, again, the Minister is the representative of the people. He comes from a rural constituency, as I do.  There are many instances where the possession by the Forestry Division of some small portion of arable land may be desirable and it may be desirable that they hold on to that land; but there are many instances where the Forestry Division may require 50 or 60 acres of land and there may be three or four acres over, which could be disposed of to a local holder.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why we should go through all the ritual of the Forestry Division having to hand the land back to the Land Commission and the Land Commission having to send out inspectors to find out if there are any smallholders for the land.  If the Land Commission permitted the inspector on the spot to decide whether the land be taken or not, it would be all right, but he is not allowed to do that.  He has to send it back to the Land Commission. It has to go back again to a senior officer; it goes on to a file and maybe six months pass before a decision is taken.  As I know the position, the Forestry Division buy land direct for money.  The Land Commission operate a different system ; they give land bonds.  Surely it is possible, in the particular instances concerned, to devise some method?  Every case is different.  We cannot work the division of land by the book.  It should be possible for the Minister to have the facts placed before him and to give a decision whether a farmer would benefit by ten or 12 acres, without <Col N="727" /> going through all this extraordinary ritual, which may take three or four months.</P>
    <P>Think of all the money concerned, of all the filing, of all the officers concerned. I know from experience.  I have the honour to represent a county in which there is a lot of variation in the land.  We have forestry land and alongside it, we may have arable land or bog land.  We have suffered all the frustrations of that particular type of, shall we say, mild bureaucracy one has to endure here.  I am not charging the officials now.  The officials are in offices.  They are looking at the thing from the paper angle.  What may be perfectly all right on paper is not all right in rural Ireland.  Particular conditions exist in rural Ireland which determine whether they should do this or that.  I do not see why we should have this endless delay in settling such matters.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter I want to refer to with regard to estate sales. The Forestry Division deals in thousands of acres.  When you deal in thousands of acres and when you have State funds at your back, you get rather high-falutin ideas about matters generally.  We are not a wealthy country.  We have quite a lot of timber merchants here who want to buy timber.  The Forestry Division have a system which they have to operate, a system by which the thing is put up for tender.  If they do not do that, some Deputy may come in and query their actions in Dáil Éireann.  In the main, they put up huge lots of timber and this eliminates the small dealer altogether. It should be possible, through the representations of a Deputy or other representative, for a small dealer who wants to buy a small amount of timber to be allowed to tender.  After a time, these small dealers will get a reasonable idea of what wood is worth and will tender reasonable amounts.</P>
    <P>I have had repeated complaints from small dealers who are unable to get wood.  The officials' argument is : we must sell timber and make as much out of it as we can.  That may <Col N="728" /> be all right, but, at the same time, Dáil Éireann are asked to vote £2½ million for the purposes of afforestation. That £2½ million is paid literally by everybody in the State.  Therefore, everybody is entitled to get some benefit out of forestry.  I do not think the Forestry Division would be losing any money if they laid aside a small amount of timber every year to meet the requirements of the smaller wood merchant.</P>
    <P>Another thing about Irish timber is that it has unjustifiably got a bad name for not being as good as foreign timber.  I want to say here and now that if Irish timber is properly treated, it is as good as, if not better than, any timber that comes from Scandinavia, the home of timber.  In Scandinavia, and in fact in all the continental countries where I have had the opportunity of visiting forestry centres, the first thing they do, when they fell a tree, is to remove the bark.  That is done automatically.  When you remove the bark, the tree starts to season.  In Ireland, a merchant buys a certain amount of timber.  The timber is felled and taken absolutely fresh.  Very often, it is cut into saw parts straight away without any chance of seasoning whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I notice in the Minister's speech&mdash; this is only a suggestion; it may not be possible&mdash;he said that the timber, in the main, unless by special order, was not felled by the Department concerned. Would it be wise&mdash;it would also give employment within the State forests&mdash;if the Forestry Division had a system whereby they felled their own timber?  If they did so, they would be in a position to remove the bark and be able also to regulate the use of that timber.  Our timber grows faster than in the majority of other countries on account of our milder climate.  Therefore, it has, perhaps, a higher content of sap.  If this scheme were adopted, whereby the timber was felled by the Department, stripped beforehand and kept for a certain period, Irish timber would then get the name to which it is entitled, in my opinion: that of being as good as any other timber in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>If we are all here next year and <Col N="729" /> debating this Forestry Estimate, I should like to hear from the Minister if he has made any more advances in the matter of private planting.  I would suggest certain ways of doing this.  I see from the Minister's address yesterday that certain lectures have been given in regard to afforestation generally.  I do not think that the average Irish person knows anything about timber or is particularly interested in it.  On many farms, there is no timber and it is very hard to persuade a farmer to start to plant timber and so close up a plot of land from which he may not have any benefit for many years.  The answer from the Government of the day usually is that they give grants and facilitate people in every way.  Many other things could be done and there are many encouragements that could be given.  If a farmer decides to plant two acres of land, <i>ipso facto,</i> he closes up that land for 25 years.  His first return from it will be thinnings.  Meantime, he has to pay rates.  On the half-million acres or so of State forests, no rates are paid.  Why should the private person pay rates on land that is giving no production?</P>
    <P>Regarding bigger landowners who own quite a lot of timber, they are not only paying rates but income tax also. If we want to bring Ireland up to the necessary afforestation level, I have endeavoured to show by the statistics I have quoted&mdash;I do not like quoting statistics extensively because I think they bore people&mdash;that in the difficult situation facing Europe on the land, there is one assured sale, that is, timber.  The Minister should not be satisfied with the 25,000 acres a year planting rate.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by congratulating him on planting 25,000 acres and on getting as far as he has gone on the State side of forestry but he should not be content with that.  He should try in every possible way, by instructing people and giving them all possible incentives, to increase timber production. If he does that, he will make a very useful contribution to the agricultural community.  What I want, and what I am sure my colleagues on this side of the House want, and what I hope my <Col N="730" /> colleagues on the other side of the House would wish, is to see the people retained on the land and the rural way of life defended and expanded.  We can only do that by maintaining auxiliary employment in and around the farm.  The greatest opportunity for that is afforestation.  But the State will not do it alone ; the State must give the private person the incentive to be interested in timber and to raise timber.  If the Minister succeeds in doing that, he will have made some contribution to rural life and when he returns next year, not only will he be reigning as constitutional monarch in the Forestry Section but he will be really doing his job and getting down to brass tacks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusDolan" hpid="Mr. Dolan Mr. Dolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Our country found itself in the rather unique but unenviable position that the vast bulk of our native plantations were taken from us by an alien Government and the countryside left devoid of any worthwhile native timber.  That meant that when native Governments took over, they faced the problem of trying to establish the nucleus of a Forestry Division and get the people forestry-minded, if possible.  Education was needed to drive home to the people that extra forestry would raise the temperature of the country, prevent flooding, make use of land normally fit for nothing else and in general, improve the country's economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have succeeded fairly well in that and at present the people are forestry-conscious.  The Government are now at the stage of being able to plant more than the target they set a few years ago, 25,000 acres a year. That is a tremendous drive forward and, as the Minister says, that acreage we feel will increase from year to year. Up to this, the type of land the Forestry Division acquired has been marginal or semi-marginal, of very poor quality which would not be very suitable for agriculture.  It would not pay the nation or the individual farmer to try to retain any of it for agricultural use.  We saw recently that over £300 was spent per acre on trying to drain and convert some land into good land but despite modern machinery <Col N="731" /> and all the efforts made, we know that that particular land, if up for sale today, would not realise anything like that figure.  Money spent in that way is more or less wasted.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Forestry Division are stepping in and acquiring, as best they can each year, much of this type of land.  It is to their credit, in one sense, that they have not competed with local farmers in buying land. Should that happen, we can easily see that the farmer would probably come off second best.  As time goes on and it becomes more difficult to get extra land, it is important that the Minister's Department should consider some means of preserving the small mountainy sheep farmers and, at the same time, have forestry adjoining their holdings.  With the new grants made available through the Department of Agriculture recently for fencing commonages and sheep confines, I think it might be possible to hammer out a scheme whereby sheep owners and the local forestry section would co-ordinate their efforts so as to have marginal strips between the forests, and thus ensure that by promoting forestry, we would not, at the same time, injure in any way that other very important arm of our present economy, namely, the mountainy sheep farmer.  I think that would increase the grass yield and vegetation in those strips and at the same time prevent, to a large extent, devastating forest fires which are always likely to occur where we have plantations.  I suggest that it would help to develop both these arms of our economy.  It would ensure goodwill on the part of the people in these areas, which would be very effective in preventing damage from fire or other cause.</P>
    <P>With regard to private planting, it is not easy to get it across to the average small farmer that he will gain a great deal by planting a few acres even of the worst land of his farm.  He may feel that the initial cost would be too great.  It would take education and perhaps something more to get it across to the average small farmer that it is a sound investment for his <Col N="732" /> family, much better than an insurance policy, to plant, with State assistance, an acre or two.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger of devastating fires occurring in plantations. Despite all the precautions that may be taken, fires can and do occur. As a resut of new methods of pulping and the increased use of thinnings for chipboard manufacture and so on, forests will be cleared every 25 years or so and are thus more valuable now. The Forestry Division would be well advised to appoint fire wardens whose duty it would be to visit forests and to ensure that tinkers, tourists and campers would be more than careful not to cause damage to plantations. That would be much more effective than relying on the local Gardaí or somebody else.  I agree with the last speaker that it is not the farmers whose land is adjacent to the plantations who are the guilty persons so far as forest fires are concerned.  The Forestry Division has the goodwill of the farmers and their neighbours.  It would be a good thing to have it known that there was somebody whose duty it was to ensure that fires would not occur in plantations.</P>
    <P>The last speaker also referred to the quality of Irish timber.  There is in Ireland and there has been in the past timber as fine as that grown in any part of Europe.  The British Government were fairly shrewd judges of quality.  They saw to it that their Houses of Parliament were roofed with Irish oak.</P>
    <P>We have the necessary personnel to promote afforestation.  We have the technique.  We have satisfied workers, who are skilled in their job.  There is an incentive bonus.  We realise that the Minister is solidly behind the planting drive.  It should be possible to wipe out that part of the £10,000,000 adverse balance of payments which results from the importation of timber and timber products.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavour to achieve that objective.  The Minister is doing trojan work in that respect and fulfilling very capably the office to which he has been assigned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.A. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only <Col N="733" /> two matters arising out of the administration of the Department's forestry services to which I should like to refer. Both these matters possibly might be held to be matters on which I have what might be called a strong personal view.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is able to report good progress in connection with planting and the development of forestry in Ireland.  I have had the privilege of being associated with Governments of this State from the very earliest times and I remember the discussion that Mr. Cosgrave's Government had on forestry.  In spite of their many preoccupations at that time, the first Government did a very good job in connection with the planting of forests.  They laid a foundation from which every subsequent effort was able to evolve.  I do recall some short time after the change of Government in 1932 the late Patrick Hogan, who had been responsible as Minister for Agriculture for the forestry policy, saying to a group of us outside the House : &ldquo;I wonder did we do enough for forestry.&rdquo;  Those facts remained in my mind when I had an opportunity of taking part in the development of a forestry programme during the two Administrations of which I was the head and I think we have a right to point to a very solid achievement.  Therefore, it is with great pleasure that we see that that is being continued by the present Government.</P>
      <P>The previous Deputy spoke about the country being forestry-conscious.  I should like the Department to become conscious of the particular aspect of the forestry policy with which I am personally very concerned, that is, the part of the policy which I think has been rather neglected.  In my own time, I was not able to get much done about it and nothing much has since been done either.  I refer to the matter of growing those trees which are not coniferous, trees like beech, oak, ash, elm, sycamore, arbutus and even some of the ornamental trees. That part of forestry has been, to my mind, from the start of this State, entirely neglected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Look at the figures that appear in <Col N="734" /> the report of the Minister for Lands on the forestry services for the period ended 31st March, 1961, which I think is the last report ; certainly it is the last report I have been able to get. At page 10 of that report, it sets out a table showing the quantities of seeds sown, in lbs., and, at page 13, it gives a tabular statement showing the percentages of the various species planted. A mere glance at these figures will make the point clearly that I am endeavouring to make here.  I do not think the point has been made very clearly or very emphatically for many years in this House.</P>
    <P>At page 10, it shows these conifers, what in popular language we refer to, quite incorrectly, as fir trees.  They are set out there.  The total for the conifers in the year 1960-1961 was 5,344.  The other kinds of trees, which are the subject of the activities of the Department, are described by a name with which I was not familiar&mdash;broad leaves&mdash;and in their case, the figure is 15,346 lbs. of seed sown, somewhat less than in the previous year.  The net result of all that clearly shows that conifers, or fir trees, as they are familiarly called, spruces, larch, pine, and so on, get all the attention, or nearly all the attention, of the Department. All the other trees, hardwood, oak, ash, beech, birch, sycamore, arbutus, are comparatively neglected.</P>
    <P>I think that neglect spells a very great national loss.  I do not know the reason for the neglect.  When I had some hand in the matter, I tried to get more attention paid to these particular types of tree, more attention than had been paid before, but I did not succeed. It may be that the Department's view was against it and, as we all know, when a Department has a strong view, even the head of the Government is not always able to change it, no matter how much he wants to change it.  At all events, I was not able to change it.</P>
    <P>I quite realise, of course, that the tops of mountains or the middle of cut-away bogs are not the proper places to plant oak or birch, but I remember one of my colleagues once saying to me: &ldquo;You get bog oak in bogs and oaks must have grown at some time in bogs. <Col N="735" /> Why not try it again?&rdquo;  Apparently nobody has tried it.  I do not want to suggest that these hardwood trees, or ornamental trees, could be confined to the tops of mountains or the middle of bogs.  Travelling over the Dublin and Wicklow mountains, I get tremendous pleasure in seeing the results of afforestation emerging to the public view, the results of the efforts made in years past to change the face of the Dublin and Wicklow hills by covering them with forests.  It saddens me, however, to see, when going down through the country, the numbers of these magnificent birches and royal oaks and ash falling into decay, the numbers which have been knocked down in the severe storms we have had in recent years and which are not, as far as I can see, being replaced.  I think they should be replaced.</P>
    <P>I have given the House the measure of the pounds of seeds sown in the year to which I have referred.  Page 13 of the report makes even more dramatic how neglected this aspect of forestry is because the total amount of conifers in percentages was 96.8 and in those other kinds of trees I have been talking about&mdash;the broad leaves&mdash;there was only 3.2 per cent. altogether.  That demonstrates, to me, at any rate, that sufficient attention is not being given to these ornamental trees, particularly to the oak and the ash, the elm, the sycamore and the birch.  They are disappearing as far as I can seen from the face of the countryside.  Going down through the country, I see bull-dozers and all the other modern equipment for dealing with road-making simply scattering the trees away in front of them, trees that have been growing there for centuries.  As far as I can see, these trees are not being replaced.</P>
    <P>On the road from Dublin to Cork, a vast number of trees must have been knocked down.  I regard that as a national injury.  It also detracts from the amenities of the countryside.  In the old days, bad as the estate owners were, and adversely as we may quite properly criticise them, irrespective of whatever devious or improper ways they acquired their tracts of Irish <Col N="736" /> land, they had a certain sense of duty. In their demesnes, which formed the most beautiful parts of the country, they planted and nurtured these ornamental trees, trees of value to the country.  In my view, these trees are disappearing far too fast and they are not being replaced.  The Minister should give serious attention to this aspect of the matter.  These old estates are themselves disappearing, if they have not in fact disappeared.</P>
    <P>I did get some satisfaction out of a visit I paid to what I used to know as the Ardilaun Estate in Raheny, an estate I walked through as a boy.  It has most beautiful plantations.  That is due, I think, to the Dublin Corporation ; they have done their best to maintain some of the beauty of that old estate in preserving the oaks and other ornamental trees nurtured there by that family.  Down the country, however, one sees these trees planted by the old landowners decaying ; they are disreputable looking and no effort is being made, as far as I can see, to replace them.  It would be good national business to spend far more money than is being spent on the particular types of trees to which I am referring.</P>
    <P>Even in the case of private forestry, the Minister would be well advised to persuade these people to plant these trees and give posterity the benefit of them.  They will not see very much of them themselves, but, when one plants an acorn, one plants for posterity. That is, of course, one of the great disadvantages of any investment in forestry.  One does not get an immediate return ; one does the work for people 70, 80 or 100 years hence.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second point to which I wish to refer.  This is again largely a personal point of view.  I had hoped at one time that something might be done to establish a pulp factory here.  Certain preliminary steps were taken.  It was my desire that we would have available here an industry ready made for the raw material of our forests where wood could be pulped for the manufacture here of our own paper.  I could never understand why that could not be done.  I have not heard that any advances <Col N="737" /> have been made along those lines since my time.  Certain faltering steps were taken but, faltering though they may have been, they were definite.</P>
    <P>Again, Providence did not see fit to give me the opportunity of seeing to an advanced stage the establishment of that particular industry.  I believe such an industry could be of immense value to the country.  I should like to know if the Minister has any ideas of the utilisation of our forests in a pulp industry and in the manufacture of paper of all kinds by our paper mills. If we had a pulp factory, we would have a ready made outlet for the thinnings of our various forests, or even for old trees, old trees not fit for anything more useful than the manufacture of paper.</P>
    <P>I understand there has always been great difficulty in marketing the produce of our forests.  If that is investigated by the Minister, he will see it is something on which the Section is rather weak.  We have no real market at all, no real plans, no real method for the marketing of the produce of our forests.  This pulp factory I advocate would provide an outlet and a market for their produce.  These are the two matters which I hold dear, feeling perhaps that I am beating the air or like a voice crying in the wilderness, but the establishment of a pulp mill and the growing of ornamental timber would be a great feather in the cap of any Government.  It would be very good both from the point of view of the beauty of the country and from the commercial timber point of view.</P>

      <P>As one who has on numerous occasions in the life of this Dáil hurled an immense number of brickbats at the head of the Minister and his Department, I have pleasure on this occasion in changing the missile to a few bouquets.  I should like to congratulate him on the factual way he dealt with his speech in opening the debate.  The facts which he brought to light&mdash;some of us already knew them&mdash;prove that the Forestry Division of the Department of Lands are on the right track and that the officials and the Minister are doing everything they can to deal with <Col N="738" /> forestry in the best possible way.  There are things, of course, with which from time to time many of us will disagree but at least the general direction in which the Forestry Division seem to be moving is in my opinion satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There are one or two points in the Minister's speech, for instance, the question of the small areas of arable land which the Minister is so anxious to hold when they are situated in the middle of a portion of bad land taken over for afforestation.  I think the Minister is making a mistake.  That is a personal opinion.  In most of those cases, it should be possible to swap a small portion of good arable land for a very much larger portion of land suitable only for tree planting.  In fairness to the local farmer, that can be done and should be done.  The Forestry Division would not lose on the deal. The Minister should reconsider this matter because to make a hard and fast decision on it will not, in my opinion, work in the interest of forestry.  It may be very difficult for the Minister to decide who should get the portion of land.  I suggest that those who are prepared to offer the biggest portion of land in exchange are entitled to it.  That would settle the question without any trouble.</P>
      <P>I was interested in the suggestion of Deputy Costello about the pulp mills.  This is something which we in the Labour Benches have been advocating for very many years.  The excuse given some years ago was that we are not at an advanced enough stage in afforestation to use a pulp mill.  As the years go by, it must be obvious to everybody that we are reaching the stage at which the produce of the forests, the thinnings, can be used.  It would, in fact, make a very big difference to the cost of news-print, as well as to the balance of payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thing I want to deal with is the question of employment in the forests.  Again, I think that the Department are doing a very good job.  They are giving much employment in areas where employment in many cases is very scarce.  They are providing reasonably well-paid employment.  The <Col N="739" /> bonus scheme, which the Minister described, is working reasonably well.</P>
    <P>I was rather disappointed, when he was throwing bouquets at those making it work, that he did not include the trade union movement, without whose assistance the present bonus system would not work as smoothly as it is working.  The Minister has got the full co-operation of the trade union movement in putting this into operation, keeping it going and ensuring that any snags which occur&mdash;and snags will occur&mdash;are ironed out with the least possible disruption of work.  It may have been an oversight on the Minister's part that he overlooked the part the trade union movement played in that.  However, I can assure him, speaking for the trade union which represents the majority of the forestry workers, that we are cognisant of the fact that, without the co-operation of the trade union and the other trade unions concerned, things would not be working as smoothly as they are.  I can assure the Minister that they will continue to work smoothly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The position about the employment of forestry workers is one which has caused a certain amount of annoyance from time to time.  When the Forestry Division start work in a particular area, everybody unemployed in the area for a radius of five to six miles expects to be employed on the job, even though there is work only for half a dozen.  The result is that very many people are disappointed.  The Forestry Division regulation is that they take them from the labour exchange.  Perhaps that is the best way to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a point I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister and his Department.  Where people are employed over a number of years by his Department, they must, of necessity, pick up a number of skills.  It is only reasonable to assume that, doing the same job over and over again, they must pick up a certain amount of skills in the work they are doing.  It is only reasonable to assume, then, that <Col N="740" /> if the job they are doing closes down and there is employment for them in a neighbouring area, they must be considered for that employment.</P>
    <P>It is rather unfortunate that the Forestry Division have not yet decided to establish for their workers some type of a pension scheme because, by doing that, they would ensure a certain amount of continuity in their employment. As it stands, if work stops in a particular area, in theory if a job starts five miles away the Forestry Division are perfectly entitled, under the present regulations, to ignore the claims of those laid off and employ people from the labour exchange who never worked with the Forestry Division before.  They try to get round that.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, the situation arises where people. who have given a considerable number of years` service to the Forestry Division, feel very much aggrieved to find they are laid off and not re-employed when the job closes down and the new job starts.  With the modern method of travel, the fact is that at the present time practically everybody, particularly those who have to go in and out through fields and lanes to where the forests are situated, possesses a motor cycle or scooter.  In view of that, distance has been reduced to very small dimensions.  In fact, people who some years ago might not have been able to go more than five or six miles on a cycle, now have no hesitation in going ten or 15 miles to do a job which they have been doing for years, which they know all about and in which they consider they are entitled to be retained.  I should like the Minister to give consideration to that point and also to the question of ensuring continuity by introducing some type of, if you like, contributory scheme for these men.</P>
    <P>The question of hours of work of forestry workers is at present a very thorny one.  Throughout the country, industry in general has adopted a reduced working week of five days. Local authorities have introduced, in the main, a 45-hour, five-day week, for nine months of the year and some of them for the whole year round.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Forestry Division do not seem to be prepared to make <Col N="741" /> a break through their 5½-day week.  I understand this has something to do with an inter-departmental committee who have decided they will hold the line for a 5½-day week.  It does not matter if local authorities or industry in general agree to a five-day week.  It does not matter if Ministers of the same Government sanction for local authorities the operation of a five-day week.  The Government themselves must decide that nobody in their direct employment will be allowed to work a five-day week.  That is wrong. It is turning back the hands of the clock.</P>
    <P>I said nobody would be allowed, but that is not quite true because tradesmen, those employed on building, those employed on repair jobs, those who are in the craft end of the job, are allowed to work a five-day week.  I do not know who is responsible for it.  I do not know whether it is a certain Minister or a set of Ministers.  However, the Government in general must reconsider this matter and decide that before next spring comes around, something must be done about the question of the five-day 45-hour week for forestry workers.</P>
    <P>It is not as if there will be a great loss of production; it is not as if there will be a big loss of working hours. It has been proved that where the five-day week is in operation, there has been practically no reduction in output.  As a matter of fact, many local authorities inform us that the opposite is the case.  They inform us that the shorter working week has resulted in increased output.  That being so, I think the Government should not be the last people to drag their feet and say: &ldquo;Everybody else may give it but we shall not.  We shall hold the line.  We shall insist that a 5½-day week must be worked.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was a suggestion that men should get a five-day week on the basis of a 48-hour week.  That would mean that men would have to work more than nine hours in one day.  We have got a long way away from the time when people should be required to work nine hours per day.  I suggest the reasonable attitude is a 45-hour five-day week.  The Minister will get more <Col N="742" /> bouquets than he has been getting this evening if, in the spring, before his next Estimate is introduced, he is able to say: &ldquo;We have now introduced this very desirable amenity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The question of employment is a big one.  The number of people who have been employed by the Forestry Division is pretty large.  The Minister's suggestion that the bonus system did not result in unemployment in the forests, while literally true, does not take into account the fact that there was a considerable weeding-out immediately before the bonus system was introduced.  The number of people employed in most forests was reduced very considerably before the bonus system was introduced.  Therefore, we were down to the very bones of the situation before the system was finally introduced.  However, it was introduced and it is working well and we have nothing to say against it.</P>
    <P>Private planting has been touched on very briefly here.  Speaking in this House in 1955, I suggested to the then Minister for Lands that every effort should be made to encourage private planting.  Deputy Dolan, from Cavan, suggested it could possibly be integrated with the type of sheep farming we have in some counties. That may be all right, but whether or not that can be done, the small farmer who can be persuaded to plant an acre or half an acre of timber is ensuring for himself and for his children a far better return than if he, as many of them do, tried to kill himself taking crops out of very bad land.  Apart entirely from the fact that, within a reasonable time, they will be able to get a very good return for trees planted, the shelter belt on their farm will result in a very big gain for them in the years to come. The story is told that in certain European countries, particularly Germany and Austria, when a daughter is born to the household of a farmer, an acre of timber is planted.  By the time the young lady is 21 years of age, a very valuable dowry is there waiting for her.  I do not know if that system could be adopted in this country; I doubt if it will.</P>
    <P>If small farmers, in particular, could <Col N="743" /> be persuaded to grow more timber on land which will not grow anything else, it would be a very good idea. Most of those who are growing timber privately are not small farmers.  The people growing timber privately are said to have sizeable estates.  In very many cases, those people grow ornamental trees, and so on.  An effort should be made to encourage the really small farmer, who has a portion of bad land, to use that land to grow timber. Apart from drying up the land, it would result in his family's having at least a cash crop coming in.</P>
    <P>The use of native timber for building and for furniture-making meets with a very mixed reception from people in this country.  The person who goes into a shop to buy something will ask whether the timber is Irish or foreign.  The fact that it is Irish timber is used as an excuse for refusing to buy the article.  The outlook that it must be better if the timber is foreign should be discouraged. Properly dried Irish timber can be made equal to any foreign timber.  Possibly it is one of the matters which the Department might endeavour to look after in the coming year.  Proper facilities must be made available for the drying of timber.</P>
    <P>When the Forestry Division introduced the bonus scheme some years ago, coupled with it was a promise to the trade unions that when the scheme applied to all the forests in the country a type of machinery would be set up to regulate wages and, we hope, other matters; a type of arbitration board would be set up.  I am sorry to say that that promise has not been made good.  I am not quarrelling with the officials of the Minister's Department. My experience of them has been that they are very courteous and very decent about, in particular, these matters when we discuss them.  At least they will not turn us away with a hard word.  However, we have not our arbitration scheme.  I would ask the Minister to give fairly immediate attention to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacCarthy" hpid="Mr. MacCarthy Mr. MacCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is indeed a matter for satisfaction, congratulation <Col N="744" /> and encouragement that on many of our bleak hillsides, a national asset is now being built up and the scenic beauties are being improved and extended.  I have reason particularly to advocate a greater production of ash in the country.  I have spoken on this subject year after year.  The figure given from the other side of the House that only 3.6 per cent. of the trees planted are hardwood, which includes ash, shows that the provision of that timber is causing much concern.  Sports writers during the past week even suggested, by reason of the high cost of hurleys, which ranges from 12/- to 15/- &mdash;due to transport, mainly&mdash; that hurleys should be made from some kind of synthetic material.  That is a fantastic idea and I hope we shall never see it carried out.  At the same time, in the hurling counties of, say, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary, Kilkenny, Wexford&mdash;all the Southern counties, generally&mdash;100 clubs is not a big number.  Attached to each of these will be three or four teams, including the junior and senior teams.  Then you have the juveniles, the minors and the school and college clubs as well.  With 20 players involved in each team, 10,000 to 12,000 hurleys would be required in counties like Cork and Tipperary.  Only the root and, say, three feet at the base of the ash tree are required for the manufacture of hurleys and there is a market right away for that part of the tree which is not generally used for any other purpose.</P>
      <P>I can tell the Minister there is great anxiety in many parts of the country because ash is becoming very scarce and because the small supplies still available have to be brought from afar by those who are engaged in the work of manufacturing hurleys for our native games.  I would appeal to the Minister especially to see to it that where suitable ground is available in the different counties, more ash trees are planted.  The demand is there for them.  When timber is used in other trades, various substitutes such as hardboard and so on are available but that does not apply to hurleys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said by Deputy Costello the old estates are going.  Most of <Col N="745" /> them have already gone and the land has been divided up.  In the Big House, as Donal Corkery called it, there was at least one merit&mdash;they did preserve the woods and the timber.  Now when these lands are being divided, it is up to the Department to plant trees in the remote parts of the country as a substitute for the woods on the estates which no longer exist.  I know they are fulfilling this obligation very well. These parts were formerly neglected, except perhaps for some rough grazing and things of that kind.</P>
    <P>I would also support the idea of more private planting.  In many counties, there are stretches by the roadside, little glens and so on, of land that is growing furze and is unsuitable for anything except afforestation.  The owners of such land should be encouraged to throw their weight behind this drive.  It would be an asset to the individuals concerned; it would add to the scenic attractions of the country and it would be generally of great advantage in giving employment during periods of the year when other work is not readily available.</P>
    <P>That is the one point and the one appeal I would make to the Minister&mdash; to provide the ash to give the camáns to our hurlers.  It is of real importance at the present time.  The scarcity exists and I have no doubt that it is only necessary to appeal to him and his Department to meet that need.  The late Seán Moylan, when he was in charge of that Department, did a great deal in that way.  I feel sure that the present Minister and his advisers, seeing the necessity is there, will respond in no uncertain way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGeoghegan" hpid="Mr. Geoghegan Mr. Geoghegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I wish to congratulate the Minister, his Department and his staff in general, from the lowest paid worker to the highest civil servant, on the manner in which they have handled afforestation during the past few years.  It is a credit to them.  Deputies spoke to-night of the danger of forest fires. The greatest danger in that respect lies in the western counties where new plantations have grown up.  In mountainy areas particularly, the Minister should endeavour to have <Col N="746" /> maps made available to the fire brigades in centres adjoining forest areas and to have marked on those maps rivers and other water supplies readily accessible in cases of fires.  If fire brigades had ready knowledge of the existence of rivers and lakes near forests, their job of fire-fighting would be made much more simple.  In this respect also, I would suggest to the Minister that elementary training in fire fighting be given to forestry workers.</P>
      <P>In certain mountain ranges, occasionally areas of from between 200 and 1,000 acres are offered to the Department for afforestation purposes.  My only complaint is that it takes too long for the investigating officials to decide whether or not a particular range is suitable for planting.  If these delays in letting the owners know whether their land is suitable or not were eliminated, it would greatly benefit the people concerned who up to now have been badly aggrieved by delays, not only in the acquisition of the tracts concerned but by failure to let the owners know whether or not their land is suitable for afforestation.</P>
      <P>There are one or two other matters I should like to mention.  In this country there are two sawmills, one in Dundrum, County Tipperary, which employs a number of workers, and the other in my constituency, adjoining the Minister's, west of Cong on the borders of Mayo and Galway.  I understand that the workers in the Dundrum mill are organised in the labour movement.  That is not the case in Cong, however.  Some time ago, efforts were made to organise them there, but the man who was making these efforts died and I am afraid it fell through.  I understand new efforts at organisation are being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, however, I would draw the Minister's attention to the case being made at the moment by their union for the workers in the Dundrum mill and would ask him to have applied to the Cong workers the terms of whatever agreement is reached with the Dundrum employees.  I suggest that some kind of bonus scheme be introduced for these workers.  I know <Col N="747" /> they are industrial workers and perhaps the majority of them could not get the benefits of such a scheme, but in each of the two mills, there are skilled sawyers in charge of very expensive machinery and I submit that the same benefits should be made applicable to them as to their counterparts in the cities and large towns throughout the country.  I wish the Minister and his Department the best of luck in the programme before him.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to hear on all sides of the House how unanimous we are in welcoming the extension of our afforestation programme. We have now reached a target of something around 25,000 acres of plantation a year.  However, is it not a sad thing to think that after 30 years of freedom, we have now reached only 25,000 acres a year?  Is it not sadder that, until 1948, we were planting only about 2,000 to 3,000 acres per year?  Those are facts, and if Deputy Ó Briain wishes to contradict me, he can supply the Minister with other figures and he can mention them when he is replying.</P>
      <P>As a result of the initiative of the inter-Party Government, afforestation has now reached the figure of 25,000 acres per year for the first time.  The Minister will tell us, I hope, what the increase per year was from 1932 to 1948, and it will make interesting reading. It will be well worth comparing with what has been done since 1948. When the inter-Party Government took over afforestation in 1948, we found we had not got trained workers, seedlings or nurseries.  In 1948, we set 25,000 acres a year as a target, and it has been reached now only as a result of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Fianna Fáil then came into office and, between 1933 and 1947, it was stepped up to 3,890.  In 1947-48, it was 6,005, in the last year of their reign.  Between 1948 and 1961, it was stepped up to 25,000 acres.  In 1946/47, the last year Fianna Fáil were in office, the figure was 3,890 acres, almost exactly 300 acres more than what was planted by the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government in the last year they were in office.  Immediately the first inter-Party Government came into office, we acquired land and stepped that figure up to 7,736 acres in 1948-49, 7,393 acres in 1949-50, 9,372 acres in 1950-51 and 14,992 acres in 1951-52&mdash; the figure was doubled in three years.</P>

      <P>The people had not an opportunity of seeing the work we were doing.  Those are the facts and they are well worth noting.  In the first three years of the inter-Party Government, we doubled the planting figures of afforestation, and Fianna Fáil had actually dropped in relation to the acreage of the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government's last year in office.  That is very significant.  Yet we hear boasts about the 25,000 acres which are now being planted.  Of course we all rejoice at it but there are <Col N="749" /> one or two matters about which I do not rejoice.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Lands is also Minister for the Gaeltacht and the Gaeltacht is, unfortunately, situated in the most uneconomic part of the country.  I should like to see more land planted in the Gaeltacht than is planted at the moment.  I come from a very historic part of Donegal known as the Rosses, and the Upper and Lower Rosses are a very big area.  We saw that the Minister and his Department were doing absolutely nothing for our area and just 12 months ago, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the parish priest, Canon Molloy, and I, invited officers of the Department to come down to Donegal.  We said we would travel around the area with them and point out what we considered were good sites for the planting of trees&mdash;planting which was essential, for the simple reason that it would give a considerable amount of badlyneeded employment.  The inspectors complimented us on the sites we had chosen for them.  They inspected them and told us they would let us have a decision as soon as possible.  We have not heard from them since.  I asked the Canon if he had the courtesy of a reply to our representations and he said he had got no reply.  We have heard nothing since, and that was 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months before that, I personally had succeeded in getting 12 tenants to offer a very large commonage at a place called Cloughwilly.  About 300 acres were inspected and not even ten acres were accepted by the Department. They said the land was too poor. They had inspected other lands in the Tintown area and they made an offer. I will tell the House the offer they made.  They offered the sum of £285 for 157 acres and three roods.  That was what they considered good planting land and they offered a sum in the neighbourhood of £1 16s. per acre. How do they expect to acquire land for afforestation when they offer £1 16s. per acre?  How do they expect the poor people of the Gaeltacht to eke out an existence&mdash;which they have been ekeing out for years&mdash;on land which they value at that price? <Col N="750" /> Remember, they are supposed to give the market value, under the new Act. The Minister's Department valued that land at £1 16s. per acre.</P>

      <P>I will give another case.  Twelve months ago, I offered the Department a farm between Fintown and Glenties.  I was going to put it up for auction but I thought it was plantable land and I gave the Department the first offer.  I waited for eight months without a reply and eventually I sold the farm for £1,750.  The other day I got an offer of £900 from the Department. How does the Minister expect to acquire land in the Gaeltacht, if he makes stupid offers like that?  The Department offered £900 for a farm which had been sold a few months before for practically double that amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should become realistic in this matter. If they want to acquire land in the poorer parts of Ireland, they must make a reasonable offer for it.  It is a strange thing in regard to most of this land which is supposed to be unsuitable for planting that if there is a little lake somewhere in the centre of it and the land has not been trodden upon very much, you will probably find a small plantation from seed <Col N="751" /> dropped and picked up by birds.  That can be seen all over the country.  This land around the lake is regarded as unplantable by the Minister's officials but if you try to cut turf there, five, six or seven feet down, you come across tree roots.  It must have been plantable at some time or other and I am certain if an effort were made to plant such land around uneconomic holdings, it would give suitable employment and would give some capital to the owner of the land to enable him to purchase land elsewhere or set himself up in the neighbourhood in some business or other.  These are matters which the Minister should realise are urgent.  The land which is acquired is land which has been given away simply because the people clear out of these areas.  The population of Leitrim has fallen but the plantation area has gone up.  The people are clearing out and the Minister gets this land at what he offers, £1 16. 0. per acre.  It is daylight robbery.</P>
    <P>To get away from that controversial subject, I should like to mention one other matter of which I should like the Minister's officials to take note, that is, the shooting drives through the plantations.  I happen to have the privilege of being a tenant of the Minister in that I take a certain shoot but the shooting drives are left so narrow that after five or six years when the trees grow, it is impossible to use them.  If decent shooting drives were left throughout the forestry land, particularly land which is near cultivated land, it would be a very good potential tourist attraction.  If the Minister's officials could see their way in future to leave these drives in a better condition than they are, it would be very useful for tenants and would make the shoots which the Minister has for letting more attractive to prospective lessees.</P>
    <P>I conclude by appealing to the Minister not to send out civil servants to value land in the poorer parts of Ireland. Deputy Corry is laughing&mdash;he knows what I am talking about.  He knows what civil servants do when sent out to value in the poorer parts of Ireland.  Leave it to the local valuer <Col N="752" /> who will give the land a realistic value. When a true value is put on land, more land will be on offer to the Minister than when civil servants value it at £1 16s. per acre.  They tried to buy 170 acres for £250.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying to hear the unanimous acclamation of the House of the progress made in forestry. When one looks at the total land of Ireland and compares it with forestry land, it is very insignificant; there are something like 420,000 acres under timber.  It is significant, however, that the figures indicate that, of that amount, 350,000 acres have been planted at 170 centres throughout the country.  When this country assumed control of its own destiny, it was virtually denuded of timber and it has taken successive Governments here a long time to increase production to the level at which it is today.  It is significant, as the Minister pointed out in his speech, that in the past five years, of the total area under timber, one-third has been planted, or 120,000 acres. That is a substantial figure and it shows that the matter is now probably for the first time being taken seriously, that instead of generating hot air, we are getting trees planted.</P>
      <P>I have heard claims being made over the years&mdash;I think I heard Deputy Blowick make that claim&mdash;that 25,000 acres could be planted without too much difficulty&mdash;but it has taken this Government the past five years to reach an average of 120,000 acres in that length of time.  The value of timber is not disputed by anybody.  It provides employment both in planting and harvesting.  If that were the end of it, it would be satisfactory enough, but it is not.  Once it leaves the forest, it then has to be manufactured and this ought to provide valuable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, from the Minister's speech <Col N="753" /> we gather that there are close on 5,000 people employed by the Forestry Division.  I should like the Minister to indicate to us how many are employed on timber apart from those employed directly by the Forestry Division. There is an ever-growing use of native timber in the construction of houses and other buildings but the release from State forests is relatively insignificant compared with the amount required.  I should like the Minister to indicate, if he can, when he thinks the output from our forests will be able to meet our total industrial needs of timber.  Reading the figures set out by the Minister, one gathers that the income to-day is close on £600,000. Of this £600,000, one-third approximately relates to the variety that would be used for planting and in building; the other two-thirds relates to thinnings and that type of timber.</P>
    <P>It appears that we have yet a long way to go to satisfy the needs of building construction, and other such needs, for a large variety of timbers and that greater strides are required if we hope to see, in the lifetime of some of us, the market in this country being satisfied from our own output. I am pleased to hear that the Minister is concerned about the growth of hardwoods and equally pleased to hear Deputy John A. Costello advert to this fact.  The hardwoods we have produced are valuable and have a high industrial use.  I am glad indeed that the Minister is considering using the good agricultural land, that may be attached to acquired land suitable for timber, for this purpose.  The Minister was right to hang on to those lands rather than accede to requests we have all made that these valuable pieces of agricultural land be given to some farmer.  He should plant them with these hardwoods.  We all know the general types and varieties of hardwood&mdash;beech, oak, sycamore, ash and so on.  We have also been told that the total invested in State forests is something like £24,000,000 and that our income from forests has been placed at a figure of £600,000, or something like two and a half per cent. It is an indication of the value our forests will have, once they have matured and are in full production, as an investment for future generations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> The small efforts made in the early years, which are now coming to maturity, are in fact now producing something like £600,000 and if 40 years ago, we had planted 25,000 acres in succeeding years, I wonder what would the income be now? There is hope for this country while we have a Minister who will seriously tackle this problem of reafforestation. I am pleased that he is directing his attention more and more to the West of Ireland.  It is in the West of Ireland that a large proportion of available land suitable for afforestation can be bought.  In Leitrim, as somebody said, a greater programme can be initiated and indeed in substantial areas of Mayo, Galway, and Sligo there are large areas that can be acquired and planted.</P>
    <P>The Minister on many occasions here said that he is retarded only by the amount of land he can get and by reason of difficulties of title and so on. This House should give the Minister power to get over these difficulties more rapidly and more easily.  This would be a relief to all of us who from time to time have to approach him to get speedy payment for land acquired.  Sometimes the delay is far too long.  I would also advocate that the price of land for forestry purposes be placed at a somewhat higher figure than at present.  I believe there is something like a maximum of £10 per acre downwards.  There are some good tracts of land available and this limit of £10 could usefully be raised and give the Department and the Minister more scope to pay more liberally for them.</P>
    <P>We know how valuable land becomes once a Government Department wants to acquire it, but despite that, a realistic view must be taken and a reasonable market value must be put on land when it is being acquired.  This is difficult to agree on at times and it is not best done by a local person.  Nevertheless, a more reasonable attitude than the attitude I have experienced could be adopted.</P>
    <P>Many people fail to realise the value of forests as a means of conservation of water and as a means of slowing <Col N="755" /> down the run-off.  Much of the recent flooding we have had could have been avoided, if we had large tracts of land covered with trees.  As we all know, as well as slowing down the run-off, trees act as a medium of drainage.  If this advantage were fully appreciated it would be of tremendous benefit to many people.  Trees also form a shelter for game, our stocks of which have been seriously depleted.  The more timber land we have and the more forests we have, the more we can encourage the preservation and expansion of our game.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister or his Department has ever considered the planting of seedling trees on some of our barren lands.  In forests abroad, one sees that the seedling tree does the seeding afterwards.  I wonder if the Department has ever experimented to see whether there is any hope that some of our barren mountains, which might never be commercially planted, could be covered with trees in this fashion.  In any case, it is well worth an effort.  There is not much more I can add except to say that if one could see the planting doubled, then perhaps we would see the present figure of 5,000 people employed in forestry being doubled and a great national asset being created.  The Minister and his Department deserve every praise for the wonderful work they are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the last speaker was on his feet, I could not help thinking how extraordinary human nature is, because no member of the Fianna Fáil Party who spoke on this Estimate had anything but praise for the Minister, while practically everybody who spoke from this side of the House had only criticism for him.  Forestry was like everything else in this country until 1948 because then we had fewer cattle, sheep and pigs than we ever had in our history, and we also had fewer trees growing, less land taken over for forestry and fewer men employed in afforestation.  Every Deputy knows that the foundation of our present forestry position was laid from 1948 <Col N="756" /> to 1951.  At a later stage, in order to accelerate afforestation, the law was changed at the instance of the then Minister for Lands so that land with title difficulties could be conveyed more easily to the Forestry Division.</P>
      <P>I cannot honestly say that progress in forestry here is encouraging.  When we compare our population, our acreage of arable land, mountain land and poor quality land and then consider the number of unemployed, we find little justification in blowing a trumpet about the miserable 5,000 engaged in forestry.  If we were serious about forestry, we would not be endeavouring to blow our trumpet about that.  I would expect to see at least 20,000 employed in forestry.  When we compare ourselves with other countries, we find the growth of forestry here has been very slow.</P>
      <P>I can recall the last general election when Fianna Fáil speakers were soliciting votes from the people.  Naturally enough, they did not make the one speech in every district but had a variety of speeches.  One of the speeches that sounded sweetest in the ears of the electorate was that about the vigorous manner in which the Government would tackle afforestation. More were to be employed in planting; more money was to be given for poor quality land for afforestation; industry was to be set up for the utilisation of the by-products of timber; more land was to be taken over with greater speed and more money paid for it.  Every place there was a queue of unemployed, the carrot dangled before them was that afforestation was the solution of the problem and that the moment the Fianna Fáil Government got in, all would be put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recollect the Minister for Transport and Power saying in a speech on forestry that an endless number of men could be employed on preparing lands for forestry, on drainage, on the huge volume of work in preparation for plantation.  But he went a step further. He went to a part of his own constituency at the time and, in one of his fancy dreams, he described how the Shannon Valley would look if it were planted.  He described an extensive <Col N="757" /> scheme of afforestation in the Tennessee Valley and he was going to switch the Tennessee Valley to the Shannon Valley.  Naturally, his speech sounded favourable in the ears of his listeners.  After that speech, however, he changed constituencies, and I do not blame him.  But I thought he was going a bit too far.  That demonstrates the Government's lack of seriousness in implementing the pledges they pretended to give the electorate before the election.</P>
    <P>I should like to be in a position to compliment any Minister for Lands if he can show a record of work and achievement, but when I examine our rate of progress in afforestation and analyse what is responsible for it, I can only conclude that the increased acreage is due to the facilities provided by certain Acts passed in this House, making it easy to give lands with complicated titles to the Forestry Division.  Forestry is a great national asset, but we all know afforestation will not give a speedy return.  That is why our small farmers and others are so slow in engaging in any worthwhile afforestation.  They would prefer, even if the land is of poor quality, to endeavour to produce something from it that will give a speedy return.  In our present circumstances, with so many of our smallholders in financial difficulties, they are not anxious to produce something on their poor quality land that will not yield a return for a quarter of a century.  They cannot be blamed.</P>
    <P>The older members of the Government Party will recall that when the old Cumann na nGaedheal Government were embarking on a scheme of afforestation and when certain plantation schemes were undertaken, these schemes were the subject of very serious criticism by the Fianna Fáil Party at the time.  But now, when it suits them, they stand up and boast about the high quality timber they can now export.  Surely that did not grow overnight?  When we read of the Federation of Irish Builders paying tribute to the quality of high-class Irish timber for construction and building purposes, we cannot give the credit for the production of such timber to the Fianna Fáil Government. <Col N="758" /> It is due to the foresight of the first Government in this country, who planted the trees now yielding such a good return and warranting all the praise of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Must we not look back now and say that theirs was a policy of foresight and courage and that, even though they were told at the time they were wrong, time has proved them right?  The economy has benefited by it.</P>
    <P>Looking into the past will not be helpful to us.  When I see such a small and limited amount of money being provided for afforestation purposes, I ask myself are the Government really serious in having a Forestry Division at all if they are not prepared to provide fully for it.  Let us calmly consider the fantastic sums being spent in other directions.  When we see the money that can be put into the hands of foreigners for certain developments that usually take place overnight and which fade out after a day or two; when we see the huge sums of public moneys provided for semi-State companies to squander, we should ask ourselves would it not be better spent if placed at the disposal of the Minister for Lands for forestry purposes.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland, the only source of employment we have is agricultural work with farmers, county council work with local authorities and forestry work with the Forestry Division. My constituency can claim that we have no mean amount of afforestation being undertaken by the Department. The amount of planting in Laois and Offaly reflects credit on the Department but when we see the amount of mountain land, wasteland and particularly cutaway bog that is still there and available, we wonder is the Department limiting their activities to certain townlands or districts or corners of the counties.</P>
    <P>I had expected the Minister to reveal to the House on this occasion whether he has made any progress with Bord na Móna regarding planting cutaway and useless bog, hundreds of acres of which are in the hands of Bord na Móna.  In my constituency, Bord na Móna have done a certain amount of useful and practical work but they are leaving hundreds of acres <Col N="759" /> of waste and cutaway bogland.  Surely it cannot be beyond the capabilities of the experts to find some suitable plants to grow there and eventually add to the pool of afforestation and again help to bring some financial return.  It is rather depressing, even for the sightseer, to drive along main roads and to see on each side acres and acres of cutaway bog lying useless. Is it not possible that the poorest of poor bog cannot be turned into soil suitable for the production of some type of shrub or tree?  I call upon the Minister to tell us how far he has gone with Bord na Móna regarding the planting of bogs which they do not now use.  Much additional employment could be given in rural Ireland by that kind of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister was also to consider how he could devise a scheme whereby there would be continuous employment as between the Forestry Department and Bord na Móna, so that when the slack season came in Bord na Móna, instead of the workers being let go, they would be immediately switched over to drainage work or preparatory work on land suitable for forestry.  To my knowledge, that has not yet happened in my constituency and I should like to hear if any progress has been made in that regard.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of acres of land suitable for forestry, the owners of which are prepared to give the land, but there seems to be a Civil Service regulation guiding the Minister to decide that only land convenient to existing large State forests is to be taken over because they say this is easier work and more economical.  If we are to develop and advance in forestry to any great extent, we must be prepared to spread out and move away from existing forests and if we find tracts of land even at a distance from State forests that we can tackle and prepare for forestry, we should take them and so give employment.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the way in which trees beautify the country and any citizen who travels through any part of the forests in Offaly or Laois or in County Wicklow or West Cork will see sights which cannot be <Col N="760" /> equalled for beauty in any part of the world.  Afforestation certainly adds to the beauty of the country and it is to be noted with regret that trees seem to disappear year by year.  If trees are cut down this year, we cannot expect to see trees again in a year or two, but in all cases where road-widening takes place and where provision of trees would improve the landscape, I can see no effort made to provide them. Nobody seems to be giving a lead.</P>
    <P>Local authorities do not seem to be as enthusiastic as they might be and no effort is made to have plantations near the main roads.  In all cases where road-widening takes place, especially on the very large and expensive scale on which it is now done, trees should be planted on each side of the road and the Forestry Division should assist local authorities in that regard financially. If they do not wish to help in that way, they could at least help the local authorities by placing the advice of expert personnel at their disposal. Local authorities should at least be reminded of the necessity to plant trees where trees have been removed and where new roads are made.</P>
    <P>We have not had any real reason from the Minister as to why a greater acreage of land has not been taken over.  It is because the Department appear to be too mean in paying for the land.  When some of the forestry people come down to deal with a farmer or smallholder, one would imagine they were coming for the purpose of deliberately belittling the quality of the land he offers.  Land that is surrendered for forestry purposes is not usually of high-class quality but at least a fair price should be paid for it.</P>
    <P>I want to join with Deputy O'Donnell who protested against unqualified persons expressing opinions on valuation. The general public are not getting a fair deal.  Qualified valuers should be employed.  The Forestry Division should be guided by the expert valuer who has intimate knowledge of local values and conditions.</P>

Perhaps now that five per cent. is in the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary, there may be some hope of getting some practical consideration from the Forestry Division in this regard.  If the Department want land for afforestation, unquestionably they will get it but they must be prepared to pay a reasonable price. Some of the valuations that have been made bore no relation whatever to the value of even the poorest quality land.  I should like the Minister to examine from the files in his Department the acreage offered and the acreage still under consideration and acquisition held up pending decision on price.  I venture to say that if any common sense valuer were permitted to negotiate with a reasonable, fairminded land owner there would be generous give and take and matters would be fixed up without the lengthy correspondence and the long drawn out calls, interviews and inspections that are taking place.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will be prepared to consider steps to expedite the acquisition of lands.  I <Col N="762" /> am respectfully suggesting one way in which it can be done, that is, by the display of a little more common sense and intelligence in dealing with people who offer land.</P>
      <P>From time to time there is a good deal of criticism in the Press of inefficiency on the part of the Forestry Division.  Apart altogether from inefficiency in administration the general public cannot understand why they cannot see trees.  There is nothing easier than to produce plans on paper. It is a different matter when it comes to showing practical results.  It takes many years to prepare lands for planting. Drainage must be carried out; expert opinion obtained.  If proper expert opinion is not available a plantation could be a failure.  There should be long term preparation of land.  Drainage should be carried out and roads should be made.  I have seen cases where roads were made after the forests were laid down.  My suggestion is that the roads should be made simultaneously with planting.</P>
      <P>With regard to private planting, I should like to know what has been the outcome of the various public meetings which the Minister addressed appealing for a greater measure of support. Private planting is very necessary and small farmers should be advised to undertake such work but there is very little encouragement given to them to do so.  The amount of State assistance is insufficient.  The State should be more generous in this matter.  There are some outstanding private plantations, two of which are in my constituency&mdash;the beautiful forests owned by Lord De Vesci, at Abbeyleix, and by Lord Rosse, in Birr. Appreciation should be expressed of the public spirit of these men who have spent so much on afforestation, thereby beautifying the countryside and providing employment.  These privately planted woodlands are comparable with the best that can be found in any part of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such planting should be encouraged. I suggest that there should be a considerable reduction in the rates payable by Lord De Vesci and Lord Rosse in consideration of the expenditure they have incurred on these <Col N="763" /> forests and the employment which they give.  It would encourage private planting if, as a result of negotiations between the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Local Government, rate concessions were made for expenditure on such planting, on the basis of the number of persons employed or on the acreage of poor quality land planted.  That would be a practical way of encouraging private planting.</P>
    <P>I support very strongly the plea made by Deputy Tully for a pension scheme for forestry workers.  For too long this House has been discussing this matter.  Whereas firms like Guinness, Jacobs and other industrial concerns can produce a pension scheme within a few weeks, the employees of a State Department have been waiting for years for a pension scheme.  Forestry workers are specialists. There is a great difference between the ordinary labouring man, storeman or county council worker and the forestry labourer.  Forestry is a specialised type of work requiring skill.</P>
    <P>We have in this country to-day some of the best foresters in the world. They know their job.  They have made, and are making, a success of it.  It is very specialised work.  The Minister would earn the appreciation and gratitude of the House if he would meet the plea made by these very skilled and hardworking employees. They are deserving of consideration and recognition.  The county council workers have a superannuation scheme.  We are now reaching a stage at which many types of workers are enabled to benefit by such schemes. A pension scheme for forestry workers is long overdue.  From my own experience of the very large forest centres in my constituency, I believe that these workers should now be given the benefit of a five-day week. I support Deputy Tully, and other reasonable Deputies, in their argument. The five-day week is coming, whether we like it or not; one might as well try to push back the tide as stop the advent of the five-day week.</P>

      <P>We are an unselfish, patriotic group of public representatives, sent here to work for our constituents.  That is why we can put forward these pleas for our constituents. We do not expect a reward. He that expects little shall not be disappointed; that is the way it is with men in public life.  We do not expect a great deal in return, but we have a duty to perform.  From the point of view of conscience, at least, we know considerable relief when we put forward a case for the people we represent. The forestry worker is employed full-time.  I believe he is entitled to a five-day week and a superannuation scheme.  Both will, I hope, come.</P>
      <P>Now that the Minister has returned to the House, I should like to ask him has he taken any decision in regard to the planting of the Shannon Valley.  I understand there is a file in his Department in regard to the matter.  I should like him to make some reference to the matter when he comes to reply. Beyond that I shall not go at this stage.  I have referred to a speech made by the Minister for Transport and Power already.</P>
      <P>The training colleges at Shelton Abbey and Kinitty respectively are outstanding. They are a credit to the country.  I have nothing but praise for them.  I have a more intimate knowledge of Kinitty than I have of Shelton Abbey; if the latter is as good as Kinitty, there are no grounds for complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to pay special attention to the observations of Deputy Esmonde in his reference to the unlimited demand there will be for timber in Europe in 1970.  What practical steps are we taking now not alone to meet the demand in 1970 but in the following 20 years?  We have no reason to believe the demand will fall off.  If that demand will be there, we should now be taking steps to cater for it.  We should get down vigorously to a scheme which will give a good <Col N="765" /> financial return for the timber we will have available from this country.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister, too, to comment on the speech of Deputy J. A. Costello, particularly on his reference to the setting up of a pulp industry.  Such an industry is long overdue.  Our forests have sufficiently matured to enable the Government now to make a decision.  In the event of a decision to establish such an industry, I respectfully suggest it should be situated in some of the outstanding forests of either Laois or Offaly.  I believe both areas are ideally situated for such an industry.  I know the suggestion will receive favourable and sympathetic consideration since the conscience of the Government cannot be altogether happy because of the way in which they wiped the eye of Laois-Offaly in putting the fertiliser factory in Arklow.  A pulp industry in Laois-Offaly will compensate for that loss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on keeping up to the ambitious plan of planting 25,000 acres per year.  It is certainly very heartening to see this being done because, as the years pass, ultimately a very considerable acreage will be under afforestation, utilising land at present unproductive.  The same applies to a country as to a farm.  You cannot afford to have portion of a farm laying idle.  Every part must pull its own weight and, so in a country, every acre of land must be made to produce its full potential.  It is an ambitious programme and it is good to see it being carried out each year.  Trees provide a natural drainage and are eminently suitable for planting in our wet, unproductive lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister taking up some of the low-lying boglands which are going to waste.  Nothing is being done with them at present. In quite a number of cases, there is no ownership.  There are low lands at Ballivor, Timahoe and Rochfortbridge where Bord na Móna are carrying out their schemes.  There is plenty of bogland there.  At Longwood, near Ardenew, there are 50 acres of bog.  I brought that to the Minister's notice quite a long time ago and I was <Col N="766" /> informed by the Department that there is no ownership whatsoever in respect of that 50 acres of bog.  This borders the State-owned forests.  I have asked the Minister to see about taking it over for planting as it is a pity to see it going to waste.  As I say, there is no ownership involved.  If taken over, it would give some extra employment in the area.  I should like the Minister to look into the matter and do something about it.</P>
    <P>All the land offered is being bought free sale.  There is one thing, however, that is rather annoying, that is, that it is the best part of a year before a price is offered to the person who has offered the land.  I feel that something could be done to speed that process up.  When a person is good enough to offer land, it is the duty of the Department to offer them a price and not have them waiting so long because those people might think of going to private forests to plant for themselves or they might think of some other scheme.  These people were very good to offer the land and I think the Minister should return the compliment by offering them a price fairly quickly. I was glad to see that you went over to Sweden lately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  I was glad to see that the Minister went over to Sweden lately because Sweden is a country which is very progressive in the matter of forestry.  I am told that practically 55 per cent. of Sweden's national income is derived from forestry.  I hope that the Minister will put into practice in this country some of the ideas he found there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a matter connected with my own constituency to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. I did so during the past year.  I am referring to a forest at Clonmoyle near Monasterevan.  There is one portion of the State forest there which is dying for the want of drainage.  It is quite a sizeable acreage.  It cannot be drained because the canal runs quite near it.  The drain runs along by the canal.  I would ask the Minister, together <Col N="767" /> with his colleague in the Government, the Minister for Agriculture, to see if anything could be done in connection with the drain along by the canal.  Not alone would this ensure that more of this forest could be planted but it would also ensure that the portion which is dying could be replanted.  As a matter of fact, the portion that is dying has, I understand, been planted on a number of occasions but each time with the same result.</P>
    <P>If what I suggest is carried out, not only will it be beneficial to the State forest but it will be of advantage to a large number of farmers in the area who cannot drain their land.  It would certainly be a good example to see the Department of Lands cooperating with the local farmers because their co-operation is always needed to keep the fences and the drainage right.  If the Department co-operate with them and endeavour to carry out this drainage work, it would redound to the advantage both of the farmer and the State forest.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I should like to mention.  This is also a matter in respect of which I have been in communication with the Minister.  I refer to the road going down to the State forest on the Rynelle estate at Killynon Prat, near Mullingar.  State employees utilise that road quite a lot. Quite an amount of transport makes use of this road also.  People for whom the Land Commission have built houses live on farms there.  All this travelling has done a good deal of harm to the road.  The Department should either repair the road or give the two householders some grant to improve the road, having regard to the <Col N="768" /> fact that we are now so anxious to have good roads.  It is rather hard on those people who have to travel well over half a mile down this road to expect them to carry out the necessary repairs without getting any facilities from the Department who are inflicting as much damage on the road as the people themselves and in most cases, perhaps, doing quite a lot more damage because some of the State transport is rather heavy.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
    <P>It is certainly very heartening to see the manner in which lands are being offered to the Department and the different areas which are being planted all around the countryside.  In passing, I may mention that you do not see this along the roadside but I see quite a lot of it in my travels.  I am more than anxious to see small parcels of ten or 20 acres being offered because in this way you will gradually build up quite a sizeable acreage in each area.  When one portion of land is offered and bought, you can always expect to get other people to offer land as well.  In that way, we will build up quite a big acreage.  Indeed, it is surprising how quickly the forest will grow.</P>
    <P>Near my home by the Boyne, there was some waste land which was continually being flooded.  Just before the war it was planted and now the trees have grown up and it will not be too long until they have matured.  The amount of wealth coming off this land which was lying waste for generations is really astonishing.</P>
    <P>Progress reported: Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 8th November, 1962.</P>
