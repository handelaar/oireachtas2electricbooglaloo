    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, I was dealing with the necessity for every possible measure to be taken by boards of fishery conservators to ensure proper protection for our fisheries. I take this opportunity of referring to the Salmon Conservancy Fund under which a levy was imposed on salmon for export.  This levy was an unnecessary and considerable burden on those who derive their livelihood from salmon fishing.  I clearly recall the Parliamentary Secretary stating that this fund was to be entirely devoted to the efforts of boards of fishing conservators to provide greater protective services, to ensure that there was a greater degree of protection for our fisheries and higher standards of pay and conditions for water keepers and others engaged in the protection of fisheries.  However, it has been revealed, and is in fact common knowledge, that this levy has not been devoted to the improvement of the fishery protection system.  It has been used to relieve the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="210" /> In the first place, I submit that this levy in itself was an unnecessary and penal tax imposed on those who derive their livelihood from salmon fishing and there should be a section in this Bill providing for its removal.  It is not too late yet to have this unwarranted tax completely dropped.  It was a tax on honest, hard-working fishermen.  It was but an effort by the Government to rake in money unjustly from hard-working honest people.  Therefore the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary when introducing the levy that the revenue therefrom would be devoted to improved protection methods was nothing but a sham.</P>
    <P>I am glad that steps are being taken in this measure to modernise the election of members of boards of conservators.  This Bill makes an effort to regularise the position.  I would draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention to Section 27 which prohibits the buying of salmon or trout unless the purchaser is the holder of a dealer's or an exporter's licence.  This section goes too far because it means that a person will be prohibited from buying fish which he intends to give as a gift to somebody else.  In future, if such a gift is given, it will be a breach of this Act and this kind of provision is not therefore likely to command a very high degree of public support.</P>
    <P>Section 28 contains a new power enabling the Minister to prohibit, restrict or otherwise control fishing for salmon at sea and the landings of salmon so caught in case any excessive development of such fishing should endanger our salmon stocks.  I fear this may limit the income of certain people who have been engaged in this type of activity.  We must here consider the case of the salmon fishermen who have no other income whatever and we must assume that their livelihoods will be very seriously affected by this system of control and restriction.  I trust the Parliamentary Secretary will provide for some safeguard or compensation for such people whose incomes may be reduced through the operation of this section.  There are quite a number of people engaged in salmon fishing who have no other means of livelihood, and under this section their livelihood will <Col N="211" /> be taken from them for a considerable period&mdash;until such time as the Parliamentary Secretary sees fit to restore it, and he is satisfied that the stocks cannot be diminished to such an extent that it will endanger the fishery.  I should like to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary what compensation it is proposed to provide for such people.</P>
    <P>It is also noted that under this section, and under Section 34, the Minister may prohibit, restrict or otherwise control by order only.  I should like to hear that very clearly explained by the Parliamentary Secretary.  Orders are not usually laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I cannot understand why the Minister will not make regulations in relation to the various matters prescribed under the sections to which I have referred.  Regulations are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas but ministerial orders need not be, and I cannot understand why the Minister cannot make regulations in regard to these matters, bearing in mind that regulations are reviewable by the Oireachtas but that orders by the Minister are not.  On an issue such as this, I feel the House should be given an opportunity of reviewing the special circumstances which are likely to arise as a result of the implementation of these sections.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted, and 20 Members being present,</i>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I very strongly recommend that the Parliamentary Secretary should reconsider this question of orders and that, instead of orders, regulations should be made which would enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to provide a greater degree of safeguard for those engaged in the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 31 increases the fines which may be imposed under the Principal Act.  The general scheme seems to be to increase the fines of £5 to £10 to £25, and fines of £10 and upwards to £50.  I certainly cannot see where we could offer any criticism of these increases because, as I have said on many occasions in regard to serious <Col N="212" /> fishery offences, it has been considered in the past that district justices and others were rather lenient in dealing with offenders.  For that reason, I feel that the new section may bring at least some ordered condition in relation to the high degree of poaching which is taking place in our important fisheries.</P>
    <P>In regard to our fisheries in general, we welcome any move made in this Bill or, indeed, in any other reasonable measure presented to the House, which will safeguard them, bearing in mind that we have something to offer our tourists as a result of the wonderful developments which have been made by the Inland Fisheries Trust which was founded, established and set up by Deputy Dillon when he was in charge of fisheries.  Probably if Deputy Dillon had not been in charge of fisheries during those years, the Inland Fisheries Trust would not have been established.</P>
    <P>While we of the inter-Party Government seldom speak loudly enough about our achievements&mdash;and we have many achievements to our credit&mdash;one of the fine achievements of which we can proudly boast is the establishment of the Inland Fisheries Trust which has been responsible for giving us the wonderful fisheries which are so well developed today and which have gained world-wide recognition.  The evidence is very clear from the number of tourists who come here year after year to take part in the well-organised competitions which reflect great credit on our fisheries abroad.  We welcome any steps the Government propose to take which will improve our fisheries and make it known to the world that we have here what we consider to be, and what are considered by experts who come here from abroad to engage in fishing, the finest and best fisheries in the world, due to the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give us a clear explanation on the points which I have raised, particularly in relation to Section 28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Flanagan, there are many sections in the Bill which I welcome but for many <Col N="213" /> reasons I do not propose either to criticise or praise them at this stage. There is one section which worries me very much indeed, that is, Section 28. I represent a maritime constituency, where we have a class of fishermen which is peculiar to the county of Donegal.  I refer to the deep sea drift net fishermen.  There are approximately 150 of these fishermen in my county, manning approximately 30 boats.  The boats are based on four ports: Downings, Gweedore, Bunbeg and Burtonport.</P>
      <P>Those fishermen catch their fish outside the territorial limits and we, as the legislature, have no control whatsoever over the location in which they catch their fish, and I do not think we should.  It is possibly the most precarious livelihood any fisherman could adopt.  Those drift nets fish in the traffic lanes of the coastal steamers around these islands.  No season passes without a tragedy when some boat is either lost at sea or is cut down by a passing tramp ship.</P>
      <P>We should encourage these fishermen. Their season is short.  It begins the first week in June and ends in or about mid-July.  The maximum number of fish these men would catch in any one season would be 30,000&mdash; 30,000 fish caught outside territorial limits as compared with, say, 100,000 fish taken out of the River Foyle alone. Under this section to which I have referred, Section 28, the Minister may make an order prohibiting these fishermen from landing the fish caught outside territorial limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  &ldquo;The Minister may except from the provisions of an order . . . .&rdquo;  If the Minister gives me that guarantee I shall be satisfied.  That is the guarantee I seek&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that this order will not apply to drift net fishermen outside territorial limits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me go further.  The Minister is increasing the penalties for fishing.  There is a weekly close season in this country, and rightly so, during which nets are prohibited but we go further and prohibit in the weekly close season these fishermen from landing the fish which they caught outside territorial limits.  That is true. If they land fish in this State during the weekly close season, irrespective of where they are caught&mdash;and the fishermen for whom I make a plea here today catch their fish outside territorial limits&mdash;not only are they prosecuted for landing the fish but their gear is subject to forfeiture and so is their boat.  The Parliamentary Secretary tells me that is not true.  I am a solicitor to a board of conservators and it has been my unpleasant duty to prosecute these unfortunate fishermen for landing fish in this State, fish which are caught outside territorial limits during the weekly close season.  If the Minister is not prepared to amend the Bill to give exemption to these deep sea drift net fishermen, what will happen is that a trawler will remain outside the three-mile limit with frigidaire equipment aboard, all the fish which are now being landed in the State will be taken by that trawler and during the week landed in some of the ports of England, and we shall get no credit whatever for the 30,000 fish which is annually being landed at the three ports I have mentioned, Downings, Bunbeg and Burtonport.</P>
      <P>Our fishermen are becoming fewer and fewer every year.  Thank goodness, our fisheries are improving.  The method of fishing for this drift net salmon is a very primitive one, as it has to be.  A big boat cannot be used; if a big boat is used, the nets cannot be hauled up because the salmon will drop out.  The small half-decker has to be used and these fishermen have to go to sea a distance of at least five miles.  I appeal to the Minister to give these fishermen a chance to land whatever fish they catch during the weekly close season and make it a <i>bona fide</i> defence for them that the fish were caught outside the three-mile limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The season is a short one of six weeks.  At the moment they are permitted <Col N="215" /> to fish only five nights per week.  Very often during that period, they are lucky if they can get to sea on three nights per week.  Two factors militate against such fishing: the calmness of the sea and the roughness of the sea.  It it is too rough, they cannot go out and if it is too calm, they might as well stay ashore.  Very often, the weekend nights are the ideal nights on which they can go to sea.  I appeal to the Minister to look into this matter. This deep sea drift net fishing does not apply to any other part of Ireland.  I know there may be drift nets off the Boyne, off South Donegal, Mayo and other parts but it is only the fishermen from these three ports on the rugged coast of West Donegal who go outside the three-mile limit. If the Minister does that, he will be doing something to retain these 150 fishermen on our coast and giving them an opportunity to continue to earn the livelihood which their fathers and their forefathers eked out down through the years.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with Deputy Flanagan in congratulating the Inland Fisheries Trust on the magnificent work it is doing.  The Minister for Transport and Power paid tribute in this House to Deputy Dillon for initiating this scheme whereby the Inland Fisheries Trust was established. I am glad the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are following in the footsteps of Deputy Dillon and continuing the wonderful work he initiated.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary has a particular interest in it and I should like to congratulate him on his initiative on following up this scheme.  It should be remembered, however, that our inland fisheries belong to the Irish people and no matter how anxious we are to attract tourists here, particularly angling tourists&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>To how many of the Irish people do the inland fisheries belong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am getting at.  We should not forget that the Irish people come first.  We should not preserve these fisheries solely for our angling tourists because if we do, we are going to drive the <Col N="216" /> Irish peasant, if I may use the expression with great respect, back to where he was when fisheries were owned by the landlords, namely, back to the poaching period.  I know a very valuable fishery in Donegal, the Owenea.  The Irish Land Commission now own that river and it was the custom prior to 1948-49 to lease that river to persons who are not Irish citizens.  I do not know what figure they paid for the lease of that fishery but I do know that when Deputy Dillon was Minister in charge of fisheries, I approached him and requested him&mdash;a request to which he acceded&mdash;to lease that fishery to the local Glenties Anglers Association and he did lease it at what I considered then an exorbitant figure, £400 per year.</P>
      <P>That was the charge made by the Minister for an annual lease of the Owenea River.  When Deputy Dillon had gone out of office, that annual charge was increased to £800 a year which put it beyond the reach of the local anglers association completely. The Minister now leases it out on a daily licence rate, or a weekly or seasonal rate, but if you want to take out an annual licence now to fish on the Owenea River in Glenties, even though you are a riparian owner on the land adjoining the river, you have to pay the Minister £25 for the privilege of fishing, plus the licence duty which you pay to the board of conservators.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is right.  The right to angle on these Irish rivers should not be as expensive for the native Irish as for the angling tourist. It is a bad thing and it is something the Parliamentary Secretary should look into.  Should we have to subsidise the Irish citizen who wishes to angle, at the expense of the tourist angler, we should do so and thus encourage our Irish people to fish legitimately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That we should subsidise the company director who <Col N="217" /> can come and spend some of his illgotten gains fishing in competition with the foreign tourist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The people I mean are the farmers living on the banks of the river, the farm labourer, the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper's assistant, the draper and the draper's assistant.  These are the people who fish in my county.  These are what I call the native anglers in my county. These are the people I believe should be subsidised at the expense of the colonel who comes from across the water for a fortnight's or three weeks' angling.  I know what I am talking about.  Within a radius of ten miles of the town in which I reside, we have 100 lakes, some holding sea trout, all of them holding brown trout and a good many of them holding salmon. That fishing is free and it is not the gentleman to whom Deputy McQuillan refers who angles there; it is the local farmer, the farm labourer, the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper's assistant. These are the people who angle on these rivers and we would be very sorry if we found that the Department of Lands took over that fishing, even for the purpose of re-stocking and gave a lease of it to some retired colonel who might come across for the purpose of having two or three weeks' angling there.  Let us not overlook that fact.  It is a very good thing and I am glad the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary are encouraging anglers to come here but remember we must first get it for our own Irish anglers and, should we have to subsidise them at the expense of the tourist angler, let us do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other members of the Fine Gael Party I accept this Bill because I believe it is a step in the right direction.  Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Flanagan have dealt with the points with which I, too, would be concerned. There remains one section to which I should like to refer, that is, Section 16, dealing with deleterious or poisonous matter.  I should like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that flax water could be related closely to this.  While representing a fishing constituency, I also represent <Col N="218" /> an agricultural constituency where flax was a highly profitable produce some time ago.  It could be that flax could come back again on the market as a very highly profitable produce and if this were so, the farmer would be liable to a £100 fine, or six months in jail, or both, for allowing this water to spill into the river, even if this happened as a result of the river flooding and breaking the dams closeby. I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this very seriously.  The linen industry in Northern Ireland is big business and, from what we hear nowadays about our entry into the Common Market, Donegal could well be very closely associated with the linen industry in Northern Ireland.  If so, flax would again be a very good proposition.</P>
      <P>I should like also to refer to the levy on salmon.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, now that he has visited Donegal in his official capacity, may be more familiar with the fishing on the River Foyle.  I believe this levy is shown up on the River Foyle more than anywhere else in the Republic. You have people from Tyrone and Derry paying the same licence, fishing under the same conditions as fishermen from Donegal, participating in the same fishing in the same water and using the same boats and nets. The Derry and Tyrone fishermen do not have to pay a levy while the Donegal man must.  The Parliamentary Secretary, if he cannot abolish the levy altogether, should abolish it in Donegal because it has given rise to a ridiculous situation.  I should like to take this opportunity of complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary on his interest in fisheries and I hope, as an elected representative for a constituency where there are many fishermen, my co-operation will help him in his duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a word about this levy.  The levy on salmon exports is a disreputable and scandalous imposition and we all know that. It was put on for the relief of the Exchequer under false misrepresentations to the House that it was designed to make an added contribution to the funds of boards of conservators.  The fact is that, whatever the supplement, <Col N="219" /> the ordinary revenue of the board of conservators was made available through the Fisheries Vote year after year after year.  The sum fluctuated; sometimes it was greater and sometimes it was less.  Then Deputy Childers was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Fisheries. He was responsible for introducing this disreputable and scandalous levy.  We are now in this ridiculous position: if an Irish fisherman catches salmon and exports it, he must pay a levy of 2d. per 1b. on his exports; but if a German or a Greek or a Chinaman comes to Ireland and manufactures fish boxes and exports the fish boxes, he is exempt from income tax and corporation profits tax on these exports because he exports.  But the man who puts the fish in the boxes must pay 2d. per 1b. for every fish he sends out.</P>
      <P>That is a ridiculous anachronism which is utterly wrong.  It operates solely to deprive the Exchequer of a relatively trifling sum.  Yet from the point of view of people earning their living by fishing, it is quite a substantial impost.  What disgusts me about it particularly is that it is a grotesque violation of every decent standard of taxation.  There is no justification whatever for saying that an industrialist who manufactures for export is not only free from any import tax on the raw material he uses but is exempt from income tax or corporation profits tax in respect of anything he exports, while a salmon fisherman must pay a levy of 2d. per 1b. on whatever he exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to allow these anachronisms to survive because they give rise to legitimate grievances.  They are indefensible and in time contribute to an accumulation of grievances which explodes into a violent demonstration of bitter feeling.  The sad thing is that when we reach that stage, they are usually put right.  I would much sooner have them put right through our own goodwill and our own acceptance of their inequitable character, so that subsequently, if somebody starts kicking up a row and breaking windows, we will be <Col N="220" /> standing on firm, solid ground and will be in a position to say: &ldquo;The Legislature and the Government have no intention of changing their mind as a result of violence because they have done what is equitable, just and fair.&rdquo;  I do not think we are in that position now.  The sooner we remove that legitimate cause of grievance and complaint the better.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to a matter which causes me very considerable anxiety.  In Section 28 and Section 34 of this Bill the Minister proposes to proceed, not by way of regulation, but by way of order.  That injects an entirely new procedural principle into the powers he seeks under these two sections.  All this Bill and other Fisheries Acts, as far as I know, are controlled by an over-riding section in the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959&mdash;I think it is Section 4&mdash;which requires that whenever the Minister makes a regulation under the Fisheries Acts, that regulation must be laid upon the Table of the House, and unless it is annulled within 21 days, it takes effect and continues to have effect; but if no measure is introduced by anybody to annul it, it becomes statute law without further ado.</P>
    <P>Under the procedure proposed in Sections 28 and 34 of this Bill, the Minister does not make a regulation; he makes an order.  If I read the Bill correctly, that exempts him from the obligation to lay the statutory instrument on the Table of the House.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, it is very rare that a statutory instrument laid on the Table of the House is called up for review.  It is called up for review only if some Deputy feels there is something serious in it which requires to be examined by the House. I remember Deputy Harte on one occasion seeking to call up an order in connection with the Foyle Fisheries. There was some question as to whether he had the right to bring it up, but a procedural device was provided which enabled him to discuss what he wanted to discuss.  In my experience as Minister for Fisheries, and I think Deputy Flanagan, who was Parliamentary Secretary, will confirm that in all the time we were there, I do not think <Col N="221" /> any regulation we made under the Fisheries Acts was called up for review in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the fact that that power exists is a very useful check on any arbitrary use of the regulations in respect of the powers conferred in this and other Acts.  Section 28, as Deputies will have heard, deals with the whole question of fishing for salmon at sea. Section 34 relates to implementing international agreements for the conservation of fish stocks.  I cannot imagine any situation arising which would cause the Executive any embarrassment if they were asked to proceed in these two matters by way of regulation or by accepting the obligation that any order made would be laid on the Table of the House and, unless annulled within 21 days, would continue to have statutory effect.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary can meet me on that, then Draconian as many of the proposals are in this Bill, I think they are justified.  It is necessary we should strengthen the hands of the authorities, who are simply seeking to preserve the inland fisheries for the benefit of our own people primarily against the ravages of poachers, poisoners and the people who I think are often as bad or worse: the hotel keepers and shopkeepers who buy what they know to be poached fish from poachers.  The fact is that if there were no market for poached fish, very few fish would ever be poached.  It is the receiver who keeps the burglar in business.  It is the purchaser of illegally-caught fish who provides the poacher's market.  I am glad Dáil Eireann is being asked to tighten the precautions and to increase the penalties for persons who consciously and deliberately break the fishery laws.</P>
    <P>I would like to say one last word on a matter raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  I share the sentiments, which I suspect are shared by everybody in this House, Deputy O'Donnell voiced in respect of private fishing.  The ideal system is the system obtaining in the United States of America.  When I lived in America, certainly in the State of Wisconsin&mdash; and I believe also in Colorado&mdash;the law was that if you had a fishing river <Col N="222" /> passing through your land, every person had a right of way to the river bank if he had a fishing licence.  At first glance that would seem to suggest that there would be so much fishing that the rivers would all be rapidly exhausted but it does not work that way because the fishery laws in America are extremely stringent and they enforce them quite arbitrarily.  They fix a minimum length of fish and if you are found with a fish of less than that size on your person, there is no defence to a charge of illegal fishing and you are liable to imprisonment.  It is not a defence to say that when you took the fish off the hook he was killed in the process; your duty is to put the fish back into the water.  The law provides you may not have him on your person or under your control, and it seems to work, but it does create a situation in which all citizens of the United States are on a basis of strict equality and, so far as I am aware, there is no private fishing water at all.</P>
    <P>That is a very desirable state of affairs and when I became Minister, the first thing I asked my colleagues in the Department was: &ldquo;Why cannot we do that here?&rdquo; They said: &ldquo;You can, Minister, the Fisheries Acts give you full power to do so but unfortunately it would cost £x million.&rdquo; When you come to examine the whole problem, the fact is that we have power to take over all private fisheries in Ireland, provided we pay for them.  We cannot, by legislation, expropriate people who bought fisheries and provided money for them, but if anybody wants to provide money for that purpose, there is nothing to stop us doing so.</P>
    <P>Heretofore we took the view when in office &mdash; I assume the present Government do likewise &mdash; that there are other prior charges on the available capital before the necessary sum is put up to buy out all riparian owners who have fisheries.  People sometimes forget how valuable these things are.  If you own a length of a river like the Slaney, the Barrow or Nore, quite a modest length of riparian rights there can be rented to a series of tenants for up to £2,000 or £3,000 a year.  If you want to buy <Col N="223" /> that out, it will cost about £50,000. If you apply that to every river and lake in Ireland in private ownership, it runs into money.  We must also face the fact that if and when we do adopt the American system, the cost of licences will go very much higher because somebody must pay the interest on the capital sum laid out to purchase the fisheries.  Secondly, restrictions on fishing will have to be very much more rigorous than at present. With all these considerations in mind, I would not urge the Government to buy out all private fisheries in Ireland, much as I should like to see them in private ownership.  If the problems associated with that purchase can be solved, I should be glad to see the American system working here.</P>
    <P>We are what we are and we should realise that.  We are not Americans; we are not Wisconsin people.  I wonder if you arrested a fellow here for having a trout less than six inches in his bag and gave him six months in jail, what would the neighbours say? I think they would raise their eyebrows and say: &ldquo;He is a very respectable widow's son and you cannot send a boy like that to jail for six months for taking a trout less than six inches.&rdquo;  Unless you enforce rigid regulations of that kind, free fishing will not last ten years for the simple reason that the rivers will be swept clean.</P>
    <P>I should like to make this reservation. A good many fisheries are in the hands of the Land Commission and some are owned by the Department itself.  I know how difficult it is to avoid the charge of improper influence or something of that kind when you deliberately prefer a tender of a local angling association to a higher tender from a private fisherman from abroad. I took that risk when I was Minister and said quite deliberately that I preferred the tender of the local angling association, provided that association's membership was open to everybody who was prepared to conform to reasonable membership terms.</P>
    <P>If the angling association provided that membership should involve payment <Col N="224" /> of 100 guineas per head per rod, then I would have treated it simply as a rich man's preserve.  Where the angling association was open to any man who paid a £1 or £2 or whatever seemed to be a reasonable annual subscription, and where that applied to every resident of the district, I was prepared to say, if they would pay any reasonable figure to rent a fishery, that they ought to get it in preference to a stranger who was prepared to pay substantially higher.  I think I was right.  I think that is a sound principle.  I would have sympathetically considered submitting to the obligation of either laying an annual statement on the Table of the House or providing it in the annual report as to how these fisheries had been set &mdash;in fact, I think we had that obligation. That was something I was quite prepared to defend but it is something that must be watched.  It does give rise to bitter resentment in the country if a local angling association makes a reasonable offer and is turned down in favour of another.</P>
    <P>Angling associations do not consist exclusively of archangels and once the principle I have enunciated is generally known, the next thing that happens is that you are offered 3/9 by the local angling association for the rent of a fishery worth £1,000 a year. I should tell that angling association to have a running jump at itself.  Then, gradually you will find the gap narrowing until you are offered £400 a year when you know that the fishery has been set for £800 a year to private owners.  Then it becomes a matter of degree about which it is very hard to make up your mind.  I am inclined to say: &ldquo;You are offering £400; we can get £800 but we will split it with you.  If you do not want that and if you want to get tough and write letters to the papers, then I will not let it at all rather than submit to a kind of blackmail and give it away for half nothing.&rdquo;  That is to put it quite crudely.  But if an angling association will act fairly and reasonably, they ought to get a preference and the more angling associations become the tenants of these fisheries, the better it will be from every point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> I am not altogether as enthusiastic as Deputy Harte is about the Parliamentary Secretary's andrewmartens throughout the country.  We sometimes criticise poor Deputy Dr. Browne for getting bitten by a dog in order to get a bit of personal publicity.  The Ministers' Parliamentary Secretaries do not bring around Alsatian dogs with photographers to get their publicity but really I get weary of it sometimes with their Government Information Bureau and the <i>Irish Press</i> and Telefís Eireann.  I declare, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot blow his nose at a tea party without some organ of publicity being rushed to the scene&mdash; Telefís Éireann or Radio Éireann or the <i>Irish Press</i> or the Government Information Bureau&mdash;and hot on his heels, wherever he opens his beak, the Minister is after him to show that there are two people in that Department and the Minister for Lands is the top dog.</P>
    <P>These little internal dissensions are matters on which I do not wish unduly to dwell but publicity becomes a little tedious when it grows excessive.  I sympathise with a young man on his way up.  If he does not blow his own bugle, I suppose he cannot expect his boss to blow it for him and I sometimes suspect that when his superior in that Department blows his bugle for him, he blows it with a most uncertain note and, therefore, when he blows his bugle energetically, I have no serious reason to complain but if I were Deputy Harte, I would not allow it to dazzle me.  All these bugles are not blown exclusively in the service of the fishing public of Ireland.  Some of them are introduced in order to drown the trumpet of a colleague who sometimes appears to desire to minimise the energy and intelligence of his Parliamentary Secretary.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will bear in affectionate recollection Deputy Harte's tribute to his energy and the next time his Minister is being awkward, he can produce that certificate from the noble-hearted member of the opposition to rebut the Minister's denigration of his activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill certainly <Col N="226" /> goes some part of the way to cure the evils or ills that beset this valuable industry.  However, from what I see in my constituency, there is still a very long way to go before we can work out the perfect system of control and development of our fisheries.  I am always rather suspicious of all the publicity given to fisheries for the benefit of tourists.  It is peculiar that the first people to get the most out of any scheme worked out for the benefit of salmon fisheries are the big fishery companies that control the lower stretches of the mouth of a river.</P>
      <P>I can never understand why these big companies are not made to pay a good proportion of the cost of running the board of conservators.  As accurately as I can estimate, in my area the anglers, who have the right to elect only three conservators, pay about £900 in fishery licences whereas the total paid by the net fishermen is about £500 of which, strangely enough, our estuary fishermen, pay about £360.  As near as I can estimate, the big company in my area that can capture and export about 75 to 80 per cent. of the fish that come through that river pay approximately £140 to £150 in rates and licence fees.  It does seem unreasonable that rod fishermen, who contribute £900, should have only a very small part of the total and have the least say in the direction and control of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also the case that every attempt to improve fishery legislation seems to be framed in such a way as adversely to affect or squeeze out estuary fishermen and sea fishermen.  Deputy O'Donnell raised a very important point when he asked that due consideration be given to the deep sea, driftnet fishermen. We have not that type of fishermen in my area.  We have estuary fishermen, men who fish in small boats off the shore, eight to ten miles from the mouth of the rivers Maine and Laune in Killorglin.  There are 60 of those boats to-day and, roughly, 100 to 120 families depending on them for a livelihood.  They are placed under the same restrictions as the men on the river.  In other words, they can fish only five days in the week.  If the <Col N="227" /> early part of the week is stormy and unsuitable, they cannot take their boats or nets out on Saturday.  This restriction is fallacious because the regulations should be framed to help those fishermen.  They are an important part of the community, an important part of our national effort.  They are suffering from a legacy of other days when the Ascendancy controlled practically the entire fisheries of the country and every attempt was made to prevent the people from earning the livelihood which, by virtue of their environment, is a God-given right.</P>
    <P>The controls exercised by the board of conservators are also designed to make things more difficult for those people.  Recently there was a case where two or three estuary fishermen bought factory nets in order to take fish, nets that were supposed to have a four inch mesh.  Having been in the water for some short while, the nets expanded.  They were on drying ramps which are open to the public.  The waterkeepers measured the nets and found them to be a shade beyond the regulation standard and the nets were confiscated and the men were fined. These are men who have wives and families.  They had paid £40 or £50, which they could ill afford, for the nets.  Most of the estuary fishermen are in receipt of unemployment assistance during the winter months.  The nets were taken from them under the regulations.  The regulations are there. Nothing can be done about it.  The Government should devise some means of helping these people, who deserve first consideration.  They are entitled to earn their living.  Legislation should be designed to help them to do so. They will not make any great inroads on fishing off the shore.  They will catch only the stray fish that will come inshore on its way up the river.  Their chances of catching any great numbers are very slim but they could, with a little help, make a comfortable living, or at least enough to maintain themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>The next most serious aspect to me is this practice of the taking of stretches of rivers for fishing by individuals, by foreigners.  That has <Col N="228" /> happened on the rivers in my own area.  The best stretches are taken by these people.  There should be some form of control.  The individual should be required to pay extra rates on the stretch of the river he holds exclusively for himself.  We have some very good angling clubs.  In my own town, there is an angling club with a membership fee of £3 per year.  Any outsider coming in, from England, or America, or any part of the Continent, is accepted as a member of that club on payment of the £3 fee.  Unfortunately, the club does not hold the best stretches of the river.  Seven or eight individuals have taken the very best pool in the river.  Some form of taxation should be devised to prevent these people taking these valuable stretches.  In many cases, the stretches are left idle and are never fished at all.  These stretches would be a valuable asset to fishing clubs.  I believe they should be made available generally.  Some scheme could be devised to remedy the present unsatisfactory situation.</P>
    <P>The whole industry, judging by our experience in our part of the country, is very valuable from the point of view of tourists and from the point of view of our fishermen.  It is unfortunate that these valuable stretches should be channelled into the hands of the few, held by the big fishery companies. English gentlemen, or some kind of millionaire who comes in here and takes the best stretches.  Any natural resources should be available to our people in general.  I suggest to the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that they should at some stage bring in further regulations, or devise some scheme which will work to the benefit of all, thereby helping out this very valuable industry.</P>
    <P>I should be very interested to know&mdash; it is a pity that some statement has not been made by the Fisheries Branch&mdash; the reason for the phenomenal run of salmon in the latter half of this year. Are our salmon fisheries on the way back?  Is that due to the system of protection?  There must be some reason for it.  I was amazed on Monday when one of our mussel fishermen informed me that, fishing in the estuary at Castlemaine harbour, the salmon waiting to get up the river, what we <Col N="229" /> normally call the black fish, were like shoals of mackerel.  He said there were colossal numbers of fish in the estuary waiting to go up the river.  A statement from the Fisheries Branch, if they know the reason for the plentiful run, would be helpful.  There must be some reason for the improvement this year as compared with earlier years, when the fish were scarce.  If the reason were known, everybody could help in future to conserve or help out in some direction.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to impress again on the Parliamentary Secretary and his Minister the importance of devising ways and means whereby fisheries in general can be made to serve the greatest possible number of people.  They should take them out of the control of individuals.  Fisheries are a very valuable asset.  They are important to our fishermen, who make their living out of them, and they are also important from the point of view of our tourist trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not so much what is in this Bill that I am interested in as what is not in it.  I cannot for the life of me see why the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department wasted their time bringing in this type of measure to the House. I do not know what purpose it will serve.  I do not know what worthwhile changes are made in the measure.  It seems to me to relate mainly to punishing adequately fishery offences.  We do not note anything in the Bill about the repeal of old statutes, statutes I was hopeful would be either repealed or revised in this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again and again I have pleaded in this House that there is no justification whatsoever for the continuance of the reserved fishery system in the country. I believe that system to be both unfair and unjust.  I have asserted here before, and I assert it again now, that until such time as that system is done away with, we cannot hope to have respect for our fishery laws.  It is not a matter of a month since we had fresh evidence brought to our notice in regard to this iniquitous system.  In a county in this country, a fishery was sold for the handsome price of £65,000.  It was a reserved fishery.  What was its origin? <Col N="230" /> According to an announcement in the <i>Cork Examiner,</i> it was given under a charter of Queen Elizabeth I.  This reserved fishery in Southern Ireland, given under a charter of Queen Elizabeth I, is still going on the market and the latest price it fetched was £65,000 last month.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is hopeful that he will have respect for the fishery laws.  How can he hope to have respect for them when such a position obtains?  When I raised this matter here on a previous occasion, the Minister for Transport and Power was in charge of fisheries and he got quite heated about the matter&mdash;overheated, in my opinion.  He said these were private property, the same as any other property owned by private individuals in the State, and that he was not going to interfere; that these people, mainly titled people, were entitled to continue to hold these properties.  What I had in mind was that if the Minister felt that the present owners were legally entitled to these reserved fisheries in the same way as those who originally got them under charter, then he should acquire the fisheries compulsorily and compensate the owners.</P>
    <P>Why could the Minister not step in last month when this reserved fishery was for sale?  Why could he not introduce legislation to enable him to acquire the fishery by compulsory methods, giving reasonable compensation? It is a very peculiar situation that the landowners adjoining these rivers have no rights whatsoever to interfere with the rivers or their fishing potential, simply because they are not the owners of the fishery rights; others, mainly of the titled class, are the exclusive owners.</P>
    <P>This House is expending money and helping to safeguard their fishery rights. I was hoping that when a young man like Deputy Lenihan took over the control of the Fishery Branch, he would address himself to this question. Surely it should have been possible to draw up legislation which would be fair to all concerned?  First of all, it should be fair in giving the Irish people, who have licences, the right to fish in any river or lake in Ireland.  Secondly, <Col N="231" /> if a number of the owners of private fisheries have expended money on development there or have bought them or have got them to purchase, they should be given some fair measure of compensation.  Sooner or later, this must be done.</P>
    <P>A number of stretches of rivers and lakes are reserved for private people. They are reserved under charters given by English kings and queens hundreds of years ago.  Charles I of England was another man who granted a number of these charters to certain people who were followers of his.  So far as my information goes, these fisheries were given mainly by Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I and Charles II and by possibly a few other of the reigning monarchs of England.</P>
    <P>The laws that were in force 400 years ago should surely be repealed now.  There is no justification for a continuance of this system or for acknowledging the private ownership of these reserved rivers and lakes.  If the Parliamentary Secretary feels the same about these fisheries as Deputy Childers did&mdash;Deputy Childers was not anxious to disturb the system&mdash;then pay these people compensation.  I would support any legislation the Parliatary Secretary would bring before the House with a view to compensating these people fairly and adequately.  I am asking him to discontinue that system.</P>
    <P>There is not much to be said on this measure.  From my reading of it, the Bill is mainly confined to increasing punishment for fishery offences.  That could be said to be desirable but I do not think that in this country you will get the proper respect for the fishery laws as you get for other laws until such time as we do away with this system.  When that system is done away with, you will have greater respect for the fishery laws and there will be no need to mention in any Act such items as are in this Bill about the use of explosives for the taking of fish from the rivers.  Undoubtedly, there is no excuse for such wanton damage to fisheries caused by the use of explosives.</P>
    <P>The people who use these explosives feel they are not committing any crime <Col N="232" /> either against the State or the Church. Their religious convictions would not lead them to believe that they are committing a crime.  They feel they have a right to do so even in relation to the extreme type of poaching which I and every person condemn as completely out of place and the other minor forms of illegal fishing.  That is the frame of mind of the ordinary person in this country.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why these people should have these exclusive rights.  Our Parliament has now been in existence for more than 40 years and I cannot see why successive Governments did not take some measures to wipe that stain off the record.  I make the same plea to the Parliamentary Secretary as I made to Deputy Childers, Deputy Flanagan, when he was Parliamentary Secretary and Deputy Bartley when he was in charge of fisheries some years ago.  I appeal to him to take measures to revise the statutes under which these private fisheries are held.</P>
    <P>By all means, let us me fair to the present owners.  It may be true, as Deputy Childers said, that they bought these fisheries but I have not a whole lot of sympathy for the people who cashed in with the £65,000 for the fisheries in Southern Ireland last month.  We should have legislation to ensure that the rivers and lakes will be open to fishing to all our people. If that cannot be done, why not allow a farmer, through whose land a river flows, the right to determine whether he should admit any people to the fisheries or not?  Why not give him the exclusive right as well as giving it to Lord So-and-so?  Could the ordinary farmer who has a mile of river flowing through his land not make a case for the exclusive rights of that river just as well as some lord or earl?</P>
    <P>The Minister must take note of that fact.  There is strong public feeling in this country about the reservation of fisheries.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to enact legislation in the not too distant future or put it before the Government to revise these ancient statutes and charters, as they were once termed, which gave these reserved fishery rights unfairly to the people who got them.</P>

      <P>I shall be brief.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to confirm or deny the rumour that the proposed fishery harbour in Galway is to be abandoned.  The rumour is floating about in our town that the Minister made a statement in his own constituency that he proposed to take the fishery harbour and put it in his own area.  I think that is a great laugh if there is any truth in it, which I hope there is not.  I see the Parliamentary Secretary is laughing, too.  I hope I am right because I do not think there is a currach fishing off the west coast of Mayo.  To put a harbour there would be the height of folly.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I should like to direct the Parliamentary Secretary's attention.  It concerns the store at Galway docks for equipment for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  It is about time that store was handed over. I would call it a waste of public money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have got my point in anyway.  It is an important matter and I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of it.  Another matter relates to the safeguarding of the livelihood of the oyster fishermen of Galway.  One sees the oysters being brought from Kerry and placed in the beds off Galway. I think the purpose of that is merely to get them baptised as Galway oysters.  Feeling is running high there. There are a lot of men who have been getting a fair livelihood out of this industry which they built up themselves. The industry is now world-famous. This is a matter to which the Parliamentary Secretary should direct his attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should expedite the provision of lobster boats for the men off the west coast of Ireland.  If it pays the Frenchmen to come there and collect these lobsters, it should pay the men who are forced to migrate across channel.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would do something to expediate the provision of these boats, it would help to reduce the number of those who leave the west. He has had several applications&mdash;some six months&mdash;and they complain they <Col N="234" /> have not even got an acknowledgment. That is a sad state of affairs in an area with so much emigration and migration.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to direct his attention to that point.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a little more co-operation between the Department and the rod fishermen on the Corrib in Galway.  There is a very good voluntary association known as Bráithre na gCoirb which has the interests of fishing at heart.  Fishing on the Corrib is a very important addition to our tourist business.  It is worthy of great assistance from the Department. These people will give every co-operation.  In fact, I think they were there ahead of the Department in developing the Corrib.  The Parliamentary Secretary should do something to assist these people in the great work they have undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with dismay and disappointment that we saw this Bill.  We expected that when the Parliamentary Secretary was bringing in a Bill to amend the fishery laws, he would have regard to the real issues at stake.  We have got something which is nothing more or less than a puny measure relating to the amendment of the system of election of boards of conservators and a few other minor details.</P>
      <P>When we consider that fisheries in this country could and should be one of our greatest national assets, that our rivers and seas abound with a rich harvest of fish, that it could provide secure and lucrative employment for at least ten times more people than are at present employed in it&mdash; a miserable 1,600 persons are said to be employed directly in fisheries in this country&mdash;we must see that the Parliamentary Secretary was very lax, when preparing this measure, that he did not tackle the real issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking on the Estimate earlier, I questioned the manner of election of the boards of conservators. I questioned seriously who they were; whether they were <i>ex officio</i> officers; how many of them are alien as against Irish.  We were concerned that, by <Col N="235" /> and large, the boards of conservators, with which this Bill is primarily concerned, were a vested interest and had lost the respect of the ordinary salmon anglers and trout anglers.</P>
    <P>I expressed the hope that those who comprise the boards of conservators under the new Bill would be Irish men and women and would represent all that is best and all that is hoped for by the ordinary anglers. We see a situation where more and more of the best waters are falling into the hands of foreigners.  We see more and more signs &ldquo;Trespassers will be Prosecuted&rdquo;, &ldquo;Keep Off&rdquo;, and so on.  The mere Irish angler is relegated to the backwaters.</P>
    <P>We thought in 1922, when we won partial freedom for this country, that it would involve at least the right of the Irish people to fish in their own waters.  The old Elizabethan laws still stand between them and those fishing waters.  As Deputy M.P. Murphy, speaking before me, said, the Elizabethan laws still pertain.  Private property is regarded as sacrosanct in that regard and the mere Irish are shut out altogether.</P>
    <P>There was one hopeful aspect but many of us have been sorely disappointed. Where the Land Commission, in particular, took over land and water rights, we hoped they would retain these water rights for the nation.  We had a point in question when the Land Commission took over the Charteris Estate in Cahir in my constituency.  They took with it a valuable stretch of water which was regarded as an exceptionally good stretch of fishing water for trout and salmon.  Many of the local angling clubs hoped it might be possible to acquire these waters, which they so badly needed, at a reasonable price from this State body.</P>
    <P>It is becoming more and more difficult for angling associations to find the necessary money to acquire additional water, having regard to the exorbitant prices which are being charged.  Only the land barons at home and abroad can afford to buy it, and they usually get it.  We were <Col N="236" /> sorely disappointed when the Land Commission put that fine stretch of water up for sale separately, as distinct from the mansion and the land, and it has gone to the highest bidder.</P>
    <P>The policy of keeping our best waters for the land barons is being perpetuated and we all regret it.  We want to see to it that Irish men and women can walk unhindered to the fishing places of this country and fish there&mdash;of course, in accordance with the rules and regulations laid down by the Fisheries Branch and by the fishing clubs.</P>
    <P>When I deplored the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary had not grappled with the more important aspects of our fishing industry, I had in mind a matter to which I also referred in my last contribution on this subject, namely the overall desirability of extending our territorial water limits.  I urge the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Lands and the Minister for External Affairs to take their courage in their hands and to do as the Icelandic people did. I urge them to expand the territorial waters of this country to upwards of six miles, thereby giving added protection to our fishing fleet.  It is lamentable that there is no sign of progress in that regard in this measure. It has not been referred to in any shape or form.  Obviously we do not have the courage and the daring of the Icelandic fishermen to pursue this vigorously.  They have now won for themselves extra mileage in territorial limits, of which we are all very proud.</P>
    <P>Again, and I harp on this, when can we look to the day when an Irish Government or an Irish Minister or Parliamentary Secretary will tackle this problem with the same courage and enthusiasm, daring and success as the Icelandic people?  If we are sincere in our efforts to secure better conditions for our fishermen, we must help them to co-ordinate their efforts, to gain for themselves a lucrative livelihood from the seas. They expect that much from us.</P>
    <P>I had also hoped that the Parliamentary Secretary would have taken steps to ensure that inspectors and waterkeepers who have the <Col N="237" /> responsibility of supervising our rivers, would have been made permanent and pensionable servants in this measure.  We expected that, since they are so closely tied up with the boards of conservators.  People have deplored public suggestions that these inspectors, who have an arduous, difficult and dangerous job to perform, have not been deemed permanent and pensionable.  They are directly responsible to boards of conservators and at the present time they are sadly lacking in that sense of security which they so badly require in order to discharge their duties with a full sense of responsibility.</P>
    <P>When one considers the atmosphere in which they work, one will appreciate that they do need, above all else, a sense of security, of permanency, and of being paid adequately for a job well done.  There are great temptations and dangers involved.  They have not merely to safeguard the Department against poaching, but they are also subjected to threats, and violence has been done to them, as we all know. I would not thank the Parliamentary Secretary if he recognised better the value of these men by making them pensionable and permanent.  Through the Chair, may I say to the Parliamentary Secretary: &ldquo;Am I being unfair to you in that respect?  Do I anticipate any hope of your doing this?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Speaking of my own constituency, one inspector has the responsibility of looking after all the rivers in Counties Tipperary, Waterford and Kilkenny.  I submit that it is a formidable task for any one man, if he is to do it adequately, to supervise the rivers in this large area. Obviously, more inspectors and more waterkeepers are required if the job is to be done properly.  The Bill provides for the imposition of fines and I feel it is very desirable that people should be fined, and severely fined, for illegal practices in relation to fishing.  I would, however, ask the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="238" /> to have regard to the damage done to our fishing potential by cormorants and sharks and other such pests and to make available greater bounties for the destruction of such ravagers of our waters.</P>
      <P>As Deputy M.P. Murphy has said, there is unfortunately a disrespect for the fishing laws of our country as they are at present applied.  We did expect when the new nation was formed and when we achieved native government, that many of the old, antiquated laws governing fishing would be so amended that the ordinary Irish people would have more easy access to fishing rights in their own country.  While we have a situation where the moneyed people, the wealthy, the opulent, the rich, and especially people from abroad can come in here and enjoy the exclusive privilege of fishing the best waters of our country, it is understandable that the keen sportsman who is disappointed when shut off from the waters which he has a God-given right to enjoy will resort to other methods of catching fish.  That is regrettable.  As I say, we feel that where there is an opportunity for the Land Commission to take over water rights, they should avail of it so that our rivers will be held in trust for the nation and made available particularly to angling clubs.</P>
      <P>It is wrong policy that these rich waters should be put up for public auction, because automatically it is some outside water baron who is usually able to purchase these rights and hold them for himself and his friends to fish them.  I am not suggesting that visitors to our country for fishing purposes are not welcome.  They most assuredly are; they will be welcome always and will be made happy and comfortable by the angling clubs; but it must be understood that they come here as visitors only.  I repeat they will be welcome, and they will be invited back time and time again, but to preserve the best waters for them is absolutely unfair to our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat my earlier criticism of the Parliamentary Secretary for failing to grapple with the real issues at stake&mdash; to bring fishing within the means and the access of the ordinary people of <Col N="239" /> Ireland, to make fish available in our shops and homes at reasonable prices, to assist fish vendors to present fish in a more attractive manner for our housewives, to bring more security into the lives of our fishermen around the coast, to bring about a worthwhile increase in the incomes of those engaged in fishing so that we can realise on the rich harvest that our waters are capable of producing for the benefit of our people.  We should also keep in mind the extension of our territorial water rights.  These are the things we feel are of primary importance, and we regret very much that the Parliamentary Secretary has thought fit only to tinker with what are very important subjects in this Bill.</P>

      <P>This debate has somewhat widened from the original purpose of the measure before the House.  The Bill itself has no pretensions to being anything other than a measure to introduce some important reforms in regard to administration of our inland fisheries.  The last speaker embarked on a discussion of fisheries in general, which would be more appropriate, in my submission, to an Estimate debate.</P>

      <P>Certain misconceptions in the course of his speech should be corrected.  First of all, the figure of 1,600 was given as the total number of people employed in our fisheries, sea and inland.  That figure will have to be rejected here and now, because the actual figure is 10,512 people directly employed in our inland fisheries.  As many people again are employed in the marketing, transport and processing of fish.</P>

      <P>The figure of 1,600 mentioned by Deputy Treacy relates <Col N="240" /> only to whole-time sea fishermen.  In addition to them there are 4,800 people directly employed in inland fisheries and 4,081 employed in a part-time capacity in sea fisheries, so the total number of part-time and whole-time people employed in inland fisheries and sea fisheries comes to 10,512.  As many again are employed part-time in the marketing, processing and transport of fish.  So taking our inland and sea fisheries we come to a figure in the region of 20,000 directly and indirectly employed.</P>

      <P>These figures put the matter in a different perspective.  In addition, I feel that certain misconceptions may arise as a result of attempts made to minimise the importance of the fishing industry, so far as the economy is concerned.  So far this year, the figure in regard to salmon exports for the first eight months of the year is £700,000&mdash;quite a substantial figure.  In addition, exports of sea fish are in the region of £1,200,000, and the income from our angling tourists comes to another £1,200,000 approximately, so the figure in relation to visible and invisible exports in regard to fish in round figures is in the region of £3,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>A further misconception has arisen in that regard.  I am glad that Deputy Flanagan has brought it to my notice.  Both he and Deputy Dillon waxed rather eloquent about the salmon levy.  The facts of the matter are that there has been a rising contribution year in and year out, in recent years, from the Exchequer towards the development and preservation of our salmon fisheries.  In 1959-60, £18,000 was paid by way of grant to boards of conservators.  In 1960-61, the figure was £18,700.  In the current year, the figure stands at £26,000&mdash;a jump from £18,000 to £26,000 in the way of grants paid to boards of conservators by my Department.  Of that figure of £26,000, £14,000 comes from the <Col N="241" /> Exchequer.  It must be emphasised that the figure is nearly twice as much as was paid from the Exchequer during the period when there was no levy on salmon exports.  The figure paid by the Exchequer has doubled since the period about which Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Dillon talked.  We have now a rising level of grants paid from the Exchequer, and there is also the grant paid from the levy out of the Salmon Conservancy Fund.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is only right and proper that there should be this increased emphasis on the importance of preserving and developing an important asset such as salmon fisheries, and I wish to stress the fact that this levy from the Salmon Conservancy Fund goes <i>in toto</i> towards the actual protection and development of our salmon fisheries.  The people who contribute towards that fund are, in fact, the main beneficiaries of the expenditure out of the fund.  I see nothing at all inappropriate in that.</P>
      <P>Apart from those remarks, the general tenor of the debate was constructive. In particular, I was glad to note some of the remarks made by Deputy Dillon, Deputy Flanagan and Deputy O'Donnell.  Deputy Dillon dealt very well with the point made by Deputy Murphy in regard to the question of appropriating the various private fisheries throughout the country.  That matter has been closely examined by this Government and previous Governments.  As we are all aware this House already has the legislative authority to appropriate those fisheries, giving due compensation. The figure involved would be roughly £2 million, but that figure is only a little bit of the story.  In addition, Deputy Dillon outlined some of the enormous costs that would be involved in preserving such a system throughout the country&mdash;the enormous administrative cost at present borne by private owners here and there, up and down the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we consider the practical advantages I have already mentioned in regard to the salmon industry which has already this year, in the first eight months, gained £700,000 in the way <Col N="242" /> of exports, an industry that is going ahead in the way of attracting tourists on the basis of the existing structure, we feel, and previous Governments felt also, that it simply is not justified to adopt the suggestion made by Deputy Murphy.  It is just a matter of practical economics.  I do not disagree with him in principle in the matter at all, but it comes down to a simple matter of economics and fixing your priorities in regard to expenditure. I feel that any such expenditure or any embarking by the State on such a complex administrative job as would be involved, should take second place to the much more important work in regard to the development of our fisheries on which we have placed priority.</P>
    <P>A number of suggestions were made. Deputy Dillon and Deputy Flanagan in particular mentioned Sections 28 and 34 and the orders which will be made by the Minister under those sections.  I can see that there is very real merit in the points made by the Deputies, and I shall give consideration to an amendment which will make it clear that any such orders must be laid before the House.  I hope to introduce that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell also made a point in regard to drift net fishermen, particularly in his own constituency.  I shall look into the point he made concerning the importance of making it plain that it would be a <i>bona fide</i> defence in respect of landings by such fishermen that the fish were caught outside the territorial limits.</P>
    <P>The other point made by Deputy O'Donnell is one on which I wish to reassure him.  I made it clear last night when opening on this Stage, that Section 28 is in no way designed to&mdash; nor will it in any way&mdash;prejudice the interests of the existing traditional drift net fishermen who derive their livelihood from fishing around our coasts and particularly in Deputy O'Donnell's own constituency.  It was for that very reason, indeed, that subsection (2) of Section 28 was inserted: to enable the Minister to except from the provision of any order made under the section &ldquo;fishing in any particular place or by a particular method.&rdquo;<Col N="243" /> Its purpose is to do exactly what Deputy O'Donnell spoke about: to protect the interest of our existing traditional fishermen.  That will be done.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section as a whole, which is an enabling section, is to provide power to deal with any massive industrial drift net fishing off our coasts which would destroy, or attempt to destroy, or aim at destroying or damaging, our salmon stocks. That situation has arisen in Britain in recent times and we want to guard against any danger of its becoming a menace around our coast.  Viewed in that light, the section will give protection for our existing traditional fishermen who will not be in any way prejudiced by its operation.  Subsection (2) guarantees that they will not be prejudiced in any way in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also spoke about various Land Commission lettings of fishery rights and lettings from my Department.  I can reassure him that we always give very real consideration to any tenders received from angling associations.  On occasions when we have satisfied ourselves as to their strength and their repute we have given such rights to angling associations that have tendered a lower tender than some private person, and that policy will be followed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Treacy both referred to the question of providing greater financial security for the staffs of boards of conservators. I have spoken on this matter on several occasions recently and at the moment we are examining this question in detail.  It is not an easy matter going through each grade employed in each board and deciding on what would be appropriate and further deciding on what is practicable having regard to financial resources.  Those difficulties have arisen in regard to our working out of such a scheme but I can assure the House that it is being very closely examined at the moment.</P>
    <P>Apart from these aspects I feel there is nothing further that needs to be said beyond again emphasising the remarks made in my opening statement last night, that this Bill is designed <Col N="244" /> as a further step in the protection of our inland fisheries.  With that end in view, in particular, there is this tightening up of the protection of these fisheries by increased penalties for poaching offences, penalties for such reprehensible offences as poisoning or dynamiting fish; there is a provision to create a new offence in respect of using a boat, or any other vehicle or machinery of that nature in regard to a fishery offence and for the forfeiture of these articles on conviction; provisions tightening up the disposal of salmon or making it mandatory that dealings in salmon will be largely through salmon dealer and exporter channels; provisions, of course, enabling restaurants and hotels to be inspected with a view to ascertaining what fish may be in their possession. All these provisions are designed to tighten up on the poaching of salmon and on the illegal disposal of salmon. On another level there is an important provision which has been mentioned enabling regulations to be made tightening up the system of nomination and election to the boards of conservators.</P>
    <P>As I made quite plain in the statement last night, these are only among some of the reforms which we are considering at the moment in regard to our inland fisheries.  Deputy Treacy was critical of this aspect but I felt that, once we had certain reforms agreed on, after consultation with the various interested parties and associations throughout the country, it would be better to bring them before the House, have them discussed in legislative form and enacted.  If I waited until all the reforms contemplated had been discussed, until all the matters had been debated with the various groups concerned, it would be Tibb's Eve before any progress would be made.  I was merely being selective in bringing in agreed reforms.  Many other reforms, some of which have been mentioned in the House, will, I hope, be the subject of legislative action in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputies for the constructive manner in which this Bill was approached and to assure them that the points raised will be kept in <Col N="245" /> mind in regard to the administration of fisheries, and the one or two particular points in regard to this Bill that were raised will be examined closely between now and the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 28, to delete &ldquo;or an appointment to,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are seven amendments in my name to this piece of legislation.  The Bill is incapable of real amendment but I have put down these amendments in an effort to get rid of some of the worst features of the Bill.  I want, first of all, to draw your attention to the phrase that is used in the description of &ldquo;official information&rdquo;. In the definition section, Section 2, it says: &ldquo;&lsquo;Official information&rsquo; means . . . &rdquo;; then there is a series of words which are something of substance, something that might possibly be regarded as proper to be protected by an official secrets code: &ldquo;Secret official code word or password&rdquo;.  However, then the definition widens out and there is included: &ldquo;Any sketch, plan, model&rdquo;.  Again this might be regarded as a type of document which should be protected but after that the definition becomes very general: &ldquo;article, code, document or information . . . &rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, the information has to be secret and confidential and, if that were left for the adjudication of the court, nobody could object to it because there would have to be a case made by those who were prosecuting <Col N="246" /> that the information communicated was secret and confidential.  However, there is added to that that this information may be expressed to be either secret or confidential.  In a later part of the section it says:</P>
    <P>A certificate given by a Minister under his seal that any official code word or password or any sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information specified or indicated in the certificate is secret or confidential shall be conclusive evidence of the fact so certified.</P>
    <P>The safeguard that at one time seemed to be provided by the adjudication of the court is taken away.  All that is to happen is that a Minister, a member of the Government, certifies that something is secret or confidential and the first obstacle in the way of getting a successful prosecution is gone.  The second point is this: the material declared to be secret or confidential has to be in the possession, custody or control of a holder of a public office.  So far as that refers to civil servants or the people who are servants of the State in different capacities, one again might not object to it but it goes on to say: &ldquo;or to which he has or had access by virtue of his office . . . &rdquo; The rest of it does not matter for the purpose of my amendment.</P>
    <P>That directs attention immediately to the public office.  All civil servants are bound by a declaration which they sign with regard to keeping secret any information which comes to them by virtue of their office and if public office merely meant the servants of the State that would not be so bad but the public office goes on further and is widened in its interpretation to mean &ldquo;an office or employment which is remunerated out of the Central Fund or out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  Stopping at that point, there immediately comes to one's mind the fact that civil servants are clearly people remunerated by moneys from the Oireachtas.  So are the Guards and so are the teachers. When one thinks of the Central Fund that brings in the judges, so that &ldquo;public office&rdquo; here refers to the whole body of servants of the State <Col N="247" /> whether they are in the Civil Service, the Guards, the Army or the judges.</P>
    <P>The matter goes further still.  Again, I feel that there might not be much trouble as long as there is a protective clause that the information was prejudicial to the safety or the interests of the State.  There is no necessity, for the commission of an offence in connection with this matter, that there should be anything prejudicial.  As long as what is official information is communicated to somebody else, then an offence has been committed.  Again when one sees the end of this definition while hesitation would be greater with regard to, say, the ordinary servants of the State, one would not object to bringing in as the holders of public office anybody employed &ldquo;under any commission committee or tribunal set up by the Government or a Minister for the purposes of any inquiry.&rdquo;  Generally speaking, when an inquiry is established under the auspices of the Government one calls upon civil servants and local authority servants as being practised people in the taking of minutes and recording information.</P>
    <P>Again, I think there should be some protective clause if the net was only cast wide enough to catch those employed under any commission, committee or tribunal set up by the Government or a Minister for the purpose of an inquiry, but the public office is made applicable too and groups anybody appointed to a commission, committee or tribunal set up by the Government or a Minister for the purpose of any inquiry.  These people then, having become by definition the holders of public offices, are forbidden to communicate to anybody other than amongst themselves anything called official information.  That means not things upon which the safety of the State depends and not things prejudicial to the safety of the State but anything that comes to that person to which he has access by virtue of his office having being appointed a member of a commission, committee or tribunal.</P>
    <P>Further, it has to be noted that the reference to communicating includes not merely &ldquo;communicating or receiving, <Col N="248" /> whether in whole or in part&rdquo; a particular document, but the information or the substance of it, or the effect of it or the description of it. If anybody communicates either the substance, or the effect, or the description of something to which he has had access because of having being appointed to a commission, committee or tribunal under the auspices of the Government, then by merely communicating that to somebody else he is guilty of an offence.  The communication includes the transfer or transmission thereof.  Not merely that, not merely the transfer of the document, but the communication of any information or the substance, the effect or the description of any information to which a person has had access because he has been made a member of a commission set up by the Government.</P>
    <P>A number of examples occur to me. One commission established at the moment deals with higher education. The chairman is the Chief Justice and a very eminent member of the hierarchy is a member of that body. These two members become holders of a public office.  If they desire to communicate, say by letter to the newspapers, something that has come into their possession, or the substance of something to which they have had access because of their position on such a commission, then the Chief Justice will have committed an offence and the Bishop to whom I referred will have committed an offence.  The commission of the offence is clear.</P>
    <P>The prosecution is a different matter.  My memory picks up two occasions.  It may be asked why would the Chief Justice or the Bishop who is a member of the commission want to communicate to the public or to anybody else the substance of some information to which they have had access because of their membership of the commission?  The present Bishop of Galway was made chairman years ago of a commission which dealt with vocational organisation.  I suppose it was one of the best manned commissions this State has ever had. They deliberated over many years and produced a tremendous volume which indicated a great deal of interested <Col N="249" /> and devoted work and, many people thought, a number of very sound suggestions.</P>
    <P>The report did not please the Government of the day.  The present Taoiseach when questioned about delays in bringing in some of the recommendations characterised the document as a slovenly document.  The Bishop was naturally moved to make some comment on that.  The discussions were not really made public and a considerable amount of information was contained in minutes.  There was a considerable inquiry into the way in which certain people took advantage of the tariff movement; the way in which they had worked particularly for their own benefit had been brought out in a number of pieces of evidence which were brought before the commission and published in minutes. All the documents that came before the commission were not published in the recorded minutes.  Certain matters were regarded as being of a confidential nature in the sense that they were rather revealing with regard to say a business in such a way that it might be important to a competitor to get the information.</P>
    <P>That was kept secret as far as the published minutes were concerned but they were recorded and there is no doubt that the proper defence against this attack of slovenliness, if the particular member of the hierarchy bothered his head about the remark, would have included a number of references to the type of documentary evidence he had before him.</P>
    <P>In the case of a person who is of sufficient repute to be made a member of a commission to inquire into certain things, and more particularly if he is of such repute to be made chairman of such a commission, is it not the height of madness to declare that person has been guilty of an offence because he communicates to the public by means of letter the substance of something contained in a memorandum to which that person had access as a member of the commission?  This definition brings him in because he has been appointed to a commission.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another matter which is historically well known.  It was <Col N="250" /> better known some years ago, but matters like this are dimmed by the passage of time.  There was another commission set up to inquire into the work of the old national health insurance project.  The then Bishop of Clonfert was made chairman of that commission.  That commission reported in terms that were very adverse to the particular type of national health insurance being run at present.  As might be expected, the present Minister for Health was a member of the Government whose administration was brought under critical scrutiny in this particular commission's report.  As might be expected, he, of course, jumped into the fray right away.  Quite a controversy developed over that, which led to the late Dr. Dignan publishing a pamphlet in which he set out his views on the national health insurance programme and his attitude toward an amendment of that.  He undoubtedly made use of and communicated to the public the substance, if not the actual record, of certain information to which he had access because he was a member of that commission.</P>
    <P>Again is it reasonable to seek, as is done in this proposed legislation, that the communication of such information, without any hint of its being prejudicial to the interests of the State&mdash; merely the fact that a person lets another person know, not by communicating the official document or information itself but by giving him the substance of it without question of what he has done being prejudicial to the interests of the State&mdash;is it reasonable to seek that that man can be found guilty of an offence?  These are some of the reasons why I want at least to clear out that part of the Act. As far as one part of the proposed Act is concerned, where it deals with the safety and preservation of the State, nobody can make much objection to it.</P>
    <P>There are a few points I want to attend to because I think they are pressed too far and too much power is being taken as against whatever emergency might be thought likely to occur.  I am not thinking of information prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State, but simply the communication of official information <Col N="251" /> without its being information which would affect the interests of the State let alone the safety or preservation of it.</P>
    <P>I think the Act goes too far.  It could be called an administrator's dream.  It certainly is a citizen's nightmare. The matter is pressed far too far in the circumstances which can be contemplated.  I want to get rid of one excrescence.  If you must, have it kept to civil servants, guards and teachers. They are definitely confined.  They are public servants and they are all tied by certain declarations with regard to the non-communication of official information.  Be it for good or ill, they are all tied.  But this is extended to bring in employment under commissions or tribunals of inquiry.  I have said already that so far as the people who generally officiate as secretaries, notetakers and so on at these commissions, members of the Civil Service are concerned, it is not such a big extension, although I hate to see its being done.  But I think it is madness and I do not see any argument for putting the burden of this on people who are appointed to a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I take my example again and come back to the Chief Justice, who is chairman of the Commission on Higher Education.  One of the members of the Hierarchy of the Catholic Church is a prominent member of that Commission. If they tell anybody anything to which they have had access because they were members of the Commission, these people are guilty of an offence. I said at an earlier stage of this legislation that it seems to be following the lines of matters that have been very seriously discussed in England with regard to those situations in which the State claims privilege as regards the production of evidence.  In England, the judicial system has worked to this point: that where the claim is made that the bulk of the information would be prejudicial to the safety of the State or the preservation of the State, the courts accepted without demur&mdash; or at least they used to until the matter was pressed in an extravagant way&mdash;the statement of a responsible member of the Government that whatever <Col N="252" /> was in issue was or might be harmful to the safety of the State.</P>
    <P>That, of course, has gone to extremes.  It started off with the case where a submarine was sunk and a lot of people lost their lives.  An action was taken by the dependants of some of the officers that they should be remunerated, the claim being made that there had been negligence in the construction and operation of the submarine. Notice was served asking for the production of certain documents in regard to the building of the submarine. Particularly as the 1939 War was pending, the claim was made that the production of the documents would give away secrets of submarine construction, and that was something in which the safety of the State was concerned.</P>
    <P>That was accepted without demur. That was pushed and pushed and pushed until in England the courts have occasionally said: &ldquo;We feel bound by what has happened before but must have regard to the old canon with regard to the law that justice not merely be done but should be seen to be done.&rdquo;  That certainly was not the case in these privilege questions when they were pressed to the extremes to which they have been in England.</P>
    <P>There is quite a volume of opinion growing in England&mdash;there have been questions and debates in Parliament&mdash; and this division of thought has been shown: people will accept the preservation of the State and say &ldquo;Do more or less what you like, but we think you have extended that on those grounds to many matters that should not come under it at all because what is involved is not the safety of the State but the secrecy of departmental records.&rdquo;  While they have felt bound by precedent, they have kicked more frequently and more violently against this type of thing.  This is the line of thought that will not accept a global statement by a Minister of the British Government that a whole mass of documents is privileged.  They demand that he examines each one and is able to say with regard to each one: &ldquo;I have had my attention directed to it and I think it is prejudicial.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In any event they at least&mdash;and this <Col N="253" /> is from letters in English newspapers and debates in the House of Commons &mdash;keep the question clear that it is the Civil Service proper and the Army as well that are protected in this way by the plea of privilege.  A member of the Civil Service in England sending up minutes, or minutes going up with various Civil Service signatures on them are also to be brought in because otherwise the civil servant would not write as freely or advise in such a valuable way if he thought at some time or other what he was advising might come into the public light.  The distinction has been made, and it is a peculiar thing in England, that the nationalised boards have not that protection. A Minister in England dealing with anything like fuel or his civil servants are covered and the information sent him is confidential but the Chairman of the National Coal Board or his servants are not protected.  If he comes into court, he cannot claim that sort of protection.</P>
    <P>As well as extending over this matter, under this Bill not merely do people employed in various types of enterprises who might be described as people remunerated by moneys provided by the Oireachtas come in, but others who are appointed on the Boards are brought in.  In the later stages we have dragged in contracts made, and the contracts are made either by an outsider and the Minister or between a State authority and the Minister.  A &ldquo;State authority&rdquo; brings in the Attorney General, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Revenue Commissioners, the Commissioners of Public Works and, of course, the Irish Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I shall be dealing with that at a later stage but it is appropriate now to show the widening of the whole matter. People who enter into contracts, and there are many contracts that have to be entered into by the Board of Works, the employees of people who are in contractual relation with the Board of Works, all fall inside this scope of this piece of legislation and if they communicate any information they have got in such a way as is expressed to be confidential, whether the employee knows about that or not, they are guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> I should have thought one could recognise the necessity for carrying on the old official Secrets Act and dressing it up in modern form but to make this wide extension goes far beyond anything required either by the safety or the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>I need not be reminded&mdash;because I know&mdash;of the old dilemma that faces everybody dealing with this type of legislation probably best expressed by Lincoln, President of the United States years ago, when he said that it was a grave question as to whether a Government not too strong for the liberties of the subject could be strong enough to preserve its existence in a great emergency.  I do not mind, with few exceptions, what is done in a great emergency where the safety and preservation of the State are at stake but it is a different matter where it is a question of passing out some document or the substance or gist of a document and that is to be made into an offence because the Minister stamps it and says: &ldquo;No matter what you say, that is secret and confidential and my certificate goes.  The courts cannot inquire into it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people who serve on these commissions tell somebody something or publish a note about something and the Minister says: &ldquo;That is secret and confidential.  You should not have done it.&rdquo;  That makes it an offence. Is there any justification for that?  We have lived under the Official Secrets Acts since they were established and there was only one prosecution and that failed disgracefully, with the comment from the judge that the case should never have been brought.  That is the background of all this.  Yet, into something dealing with the security of the State, we dig in a whole lot of other things in regard to people who go on commissions so that they are theoretically guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I suppose the answer will be made that no offence can be prosecuted without the consent of the Attorney General but in these latter days does anybody think that is a good safeguard? We have heard the Minister himself speak of the way prosecutions are brought.  In certain cases, the police <Col N="255" /> make the prosecution themselves.  In other cases, they must go to the Attorney General but do not forget the position in which the Attorney General is in regard to dealing with State matters.  It is a very weak position. The Attorney General is not a judge.  He has not the fortifications the judges have.  There is no question of his getting a term of office, even though it may be only for a number of years, which cannot be terminated except on grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour.  The Attorney General is a creature of the Taoiseach who appoints him and the Taoiseach is entitled at any time to demand his resignation and take his office from him.</P>
    <P>This proposed Act takes away all the protection of the courts which are ousted in many ways.  The Minister certifies certain things and in the background then is the Attorney General who has to consent.  The prosecution must be brought either by the Attorney General&mdash;which is quite a good safeguard&mdash;or with his consent.  We give our judges a position and fortify them in many ways because we want them to be independent.  We take the fortifications away from the Attorney General who is in an entirely different position.  Yet that is the bulwark of safety for a person who goes on a commission and wants to tell the public of some information he got because he was chairman or a member of a commission of inquiry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like very briefly to support the remarks of Deputy McGilligan on this amendment. Even at this late stage, the Minister would be wise to withdraw this Bill and bring it in again in another form whereby he avoids mixing up questions of the safety and security of the State with what we might call more normal questions of information of a secret or confidential nature and which have nothing to do with the security and safety of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the position of people who are appointed to any commission, committees or tribunal set up by the Government <Col N="256" /> or by a Minister and, under the terms of the definition of public office contained in Section 2 of the Bill of such appointees, their liability to incur the penalties which are provided in this Act for disclosure of what is regarded as official or secret information.  The real objection to that rests on the fact that the Minister has steadfastly refused to consider changing subsection (3) of Section 2 which enables any member of the Government simply by certificate to decide and to enforce on the courts that decision as to what is or is not secret or official information. Under this legislation, all that is necessary is that a Minister gives a certificate that a particular matter is to be regarded as confidential and whether it is a factual decision or not, whether it is a right decision or not, under the Bill as it stands, it must be accepted as conclusive evidence by the courts.  No argument, no disputes are allowed in the matter.  The decision is taken out of the hands of the courts into the hands of the Minister.</P>
    <P>That is the very serious aspect of this Bill and people who are good enough and civic-minded enough to serve on commissions set up by the Government will now be faced with the possibility that if they disclose any information, verbally or otherwise, that comes into their hands as members of a commission, they may face a fine of £100 or six months in jail, depending on whether the Minister gives a certificate that the information is to be regarded as confidential.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan referred to the fact that the only safeguard in the Bill&mdash;and that it was probably what the Minister would rely on&mdash;is the fact that the Bill states that proceedings cannot be commenced except by or with the consent of the Attorney General.  I pointed out, as did other Deputies, when we were dealing with this section of the Bill, that that safeguard is a very weak one indeed because the next subsection in the Bill provides that even without the consent of the Attorney General, a person may be arrested and lodged in jail and kept in jail, and that all that can be done without the consent of the Attorney General.  Under this <Col N="257" /> Bill, a person could be kept in jail virtually indefinitely without any charge being preferred against him. So that I do not regard the consent of the Attorney General, whittled down as it is by the next following subsection in the Bill, to be any very great safeguard at all.</P>
    <P>I think this is a very, very dangerous Bill.  I will agree with the Minister and I will agree with any Deputy that so long as the Bill is properly operated it may work and it may work without unduly prejudicing the position of citizens but if this Bill is worked unfairly by this Government or by any other Government, it is going to be a very dangerous Bill which certainly will put in jeopardy the safety and security, not of the State, but of the citizens of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

      <P>Might I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this whole question?  Listening to the careful submissions made by Deputy McGilligan and other legal people in the Dáil, any reasonable layman would be convinced of the dangers inherent in this Bill.  Let me be quite clear.  I am not going to charge the Minister or the Fianna Fáil Government with doing anything wrong under this Bill but they are only human and, as sure as there are little apples, they will move out and another Government will move in and another Government will follow that. What then?  What will be the position then if, for any reason, a Government are elected as a result of some slick operation?  What could it not do with the ordinary citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me remind you, Sir, that the thing that annoys me about this is that there are a large number of documents in the Irish Military History Bureau which are not to be opened for 50 years from the date of the setting up of the bureau and they are all marked &ldquo;Secret and Confidential&rdquo; but there are in the possession of the people who wrote them copies which are also marked &ldquo;Secret and Confidential,&rdquo; and although, in theory, the writer is free to use them, if at any time an unscrupulous Minister or an unscrupulous Government thought <Col N="258" /> something was going to be published which was detrimental to them, all they have to do is to certify that it is secret and confidential.  The safety of the State does not arise at all.  An embarrassment of a Government perhaps might arise or an embarrassment of a Minister.  We are all human and everybody knows it is very embarrassing if something is published that we would prefer not to be published.  The extent to which documents are stamped &ldquo;Secret and Confidential&rdquo; running through Government Departments is, in my opinion, completely unnecessary.  In regard to a great number of the documents, it would not matter if they were put on the fairgreen and published.  There is this phobia of stamping everything with a red stamp &ldquo;Secret and Confidential.&rdquo; Somebody does not want anybody else to know about it, even in another Department, until it gets to the Government, or something like that.</P>
    <P>In regard to this question of a person being appointed to a commission or anything like that, Deputy McGilligan has pointed out how wroth the Government of that day could be with such a prominent supporter of the then Government as Dr. Dignan was, that he was publicly dispossessed and, if the Minister of the day had had the power sought in this Bill, as sure as you are a foot high, he would have prosecuted him and it would have been God's charity because it would have shown how silly but now brutal the measure could be.  But there was more than that.  There was a civil servant involved and he was seriously warned and he had to get out of certain voluntary organisations that he was in where he was rendering service of an important nature in the interests of Catholic social work.  He was ordered off by the then Minister and he had to retire and get out of every one of them because it was alleged by the then Minister that he had conveyed confidential information that he got in the discharge of his office.</P>
    <P>I am not going to refer again to some of the matters that Deputy McGilligan has referred to but all I want to do is to say to the Minister <Col N="259" /> that as a responsible person and charged with heavy responsibility, he should not take undue power for himself or for any future Government.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I cannot see my way to accepting this amendment.  I feel that the three Deputies opposite who have spoken are exaggerating the whole matter out of all proportion.  To me it seems quite clear that it is desirable to include within the ambit of the phrase &ldquo;public office&rdquo; a person who is appointed to a commission, committee or tribunal appointed by the Government or by a particular Minister.  I want to point out that the inclusion is only in regard to secret or confidential information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that later.  We have already dealt with it fully on Committee but we can deal with it again, if necessary.  The net point here is whether or not people who are appointed to these bodies should be in a position to disclose secret or confidential information.  I think it is entirely desirable that they should not be permitted to disclose such information.  They can disclose everything else.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The courts are not in as good a position to take that decision as the Minister involved.  I think this will actually help the work of these commissions and tribunals because all the persons who would be coming before such bodies to submit evidence or to help them with statistics, will be able to do so and will feel free to do so when they know that the secret or confidential information <Col N="260" /> which they will be giving to these committees or tribunals will not subsequently be disclosed to anybody else.</P>
      <P>Consider the position, for instance, of a Government Department, which is asked to give statistics, or information, to such a commission or tribunal. If that Department knows that there is no restriction on the individual members of that commission or tribunal subsequently disclosing to the world at large the most secret or confidential information, what position will such a Department be in?  The officials would be very reluctant to disclose any information to such a body.  So would an ordinary witness.  I think, therefore, that this provision will actually facilitate the working of these various bodies.  I think it is entirely unacceptable to suggest that a person who is appointed to one of these bodies should be at liberty to disclose confidential information which comes to him as a result of his appointment.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan asked why are we doing this.  I think the provision is completely defensible.  In the case of information which is at the disposal of a Government Department, or of a particular Minister, such information normally concerns other persons, private citizens or groups of private citizens.  The Minister is merely the custodian of that information.  He is a trustee.  All of us private citizens are compelled by law from time to time to disclose to Government Departments all sorts of confidential information about ourselves and our affairs.  We give that information to these Government Departments, and to particular Ministers, and we are then entitled to assume that that information will be protected.  That is the issue here.  The issue is whether or not information which a Government Department has about other citizens as trustee, or guardian, or custodian of the public good is to be published or distributed or broadcast to all sorts of people who are not entitled to get it.  That is the principle on which I defend this particular provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is not contained in any part of this Bill. The argument runs on two shockingly <Col N="261" /> bad points.  One, it is mainly information which will be in the possession of Government Departments which will be put before these commissions.  That is not the case at all.  Take a commission dealing with university education.  I do not believe that more than a fiftieth part of the information going before that commission will come from Government Departments.  If it does come from Government Departments, then it will come from the Department of Education or the Department of Finance, the former with regard to the way in which university education fits into the scheme of things, and the latter with regard to the moneys that will be spent from time to time.  What confidential matter is there in that?</P>

      <P>What will be prohibited from communication is what the Minister says is secret and confidential. That is why I asked before to have that phrase taken out.  If it is taken out, then it is all right.  I am a member of a commission and I am assailed in public for something that occurred, or some report I read, and I want to defend myself; I try to do so by means of documents which seem to me to establish the point of view I have taken before the commission.  The Minister says: &ldquo;That information is secret and confidential&rdquo; and I cannot produce it; that is the greatest nonsense. If I do produce it, I am committing an offence.  If this whole point were confined to Government Departments, or to information given to Government Departments, I might agree with the argument, although I think it is again a handicap that a person on a commission cannot comment on information obtained from a Government Department.  I can think of the Department of Industry and Commerce, which may be getting information about one concern in circumstances in which people are playing, one against the other, for some concession in regard to a tariff, or something like that.  I can well <Col N="262" /> imagine that in those circumstances information in the possession of the Minister might disclose the secrets of another firm to the public or to rivals. I do not mind that information being protected, but this provision does not make any limitation.</P>

      <P>The phrase used here is &ldquo;an official document&rdquo;. &ldquo;Official document&rdquo; is referred to only twice in the remainder of this legislation.  To get the contrast, an official document would include a passport, official pass, permit, document of identity, certificate, licence, or other similar document; it also includes an endorsement.  I take it as accepted that, when the phrase &ldquo;other similar document&rdquo; is used, we are governed by the ordinary rule of interpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the &ldquo;office&rdquo; is to be a member of a commission. That is nonsense.  Let me come back to the official document.  One could stand over that with one reservation. It includes several things, and then one comes to the general words &ldquo;or other similar document&rdquo;.  As I understand the code of interpretation used in our courts, these general words <Col N="263" /> would have to be related to the special, particular words that precede them. Therefore, it would have to be a document similar to a passport, official pass, permit, document of identity, certificate, licence.</P>
      <P>In any event it is the court which would decide that, because the court is not ruled out in this.  If any question, therefore, arises with regard to an &ldquo;official document&rdquo;, then it is something similar to the document specified; you have a court adjudication and that is all right.  But, by contrast, you get &ldquo;official information&rdquo;. I am not sure that I am absolutely correct in this, but I can only find the words &ldquo;official document&rdquo; referred to once afterwards.  That is in Section 6:</P>
      <P>A person shall not retain any official document or anything which constitutes or contains official information . . . .</P>
      <P>There, even though it is included in the section, the whole force of the particularity of &ldquo;official document&rdquo; is completely destroyed by the fact that immediately afterwards there is the phrase added &ldquo;or official information&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The argument apparently is that this section is only intended to cover things that come, say, to the hands of Government Departments because they may have some repercussions on other people who are engaged in some way in traffic with Government Departments.  That is nowhere in the definition.  Nowhere at all.  The Minister is young in office, but surely he knows enough about life to realise that when commissions of inquiry are set up there are many more people who come before these commissions other than Government Departments. Independent people come before them. The whole value of a commission of inquiry is to bring to bear upon the closed circuit of a Government Department what people outside are thinking.  It is business people, commercial folk, people interested in some type of institution that may be the subject of inquiry, who give the outside view, and that outside view is then put in contrast with whatever <Col N="264" /> information the Government Department has.</P>
    <P>The Minister's whole argument is weakened by two things.  They are the two great flaws in this legislation. One is that the courts are ousted as far as this legislation can bring that about.  The question of regarding something as secret or confidential, if left to the courts, would take a great deal of the harm out of this legislation.  If the courts were able to say: &ldquo;Nobody could consider that secret or confidential, no matter what a Minister says about it&rdquo; that would be perfectly all right.  But we have got to the point here that the Minister's certificate is conclusive and that takes away the whole of the argument of the courts.</P>
    <P>The second flaw is that, as far as the official information is concerned, it is simply that a person shall not communicate it.  It is made one of those absolute crimes.  There is no question of mentality of any type to be established with regard to it. There is something that a Minister thinks is secret and confidential.  You have to communicate that, the substance of that, to somebody else.  If you do, then there is an offence.</P>

      <P>In page 4, line 16, after &ldquo;not&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in any manner prejudicial to the interests or to the safety or preservation of the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>May I take amendments Nos. 2 and 4 together?  They are the same except that they are applicable to different sections.  I have talked about this before.  So far as Part III of this legislation is concerned, communication of information to the prejudice of the safety or preservation of the State, with minor exceptions, I do not mind what is done as long as somebody establishes what is prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State.  I tried to get that by one simple amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me come back to Part II.  Part II deals with official information and official information means whatever the Minister says.  Anything ludicrous may <Col N="265" /> be declared to be secret and confidential. That cannot be questioned.  The fact has to be established whether somebody got what is called secret and confidential information by virtue of some office he held.  In those circumstances, there are two things&mdash;a person has communicated and a person has received.</P>
    <P>I should like to bring the courts into this matter.  There is a special point regarding Section 5.  It is only in relation to special circumstances.  I want to bring in the courts to say there must be evidence that the person has in any manner prejudicial to the interests of the safety or preservation of the State communicated something. That means that there will have to be some proof given by the State, not as to the person's intentions but as to the fact whether or not the communication of the document was, in the opinion of a judge, prejudicial to the interests of the State.  I think there should be an onus on the people who are going to prosecute to say: &ldquo;There is the document.  It is marked.  The Minister has said it is secret and confidential. That finishes that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is communicated.  Is it in any way prejudicial to the interests of the State?  You have the opinion of an independent judge on that matter.  I think that is a safeguard which should be put into this Bill.</P>
    <P>I argue more strongly in connection with Section 5.  Section 5 has a wider fling than Section 4.  Let us take the case of a person entering into contractual relations, say, with the Board of Works.  Then if a person who is employed by the contractor in association with the Board of Works passes out any bit of information relating to the contract which is expressed in the contract to be confidential, then it is confidential.  I think more particularly in connection with that, that you should have the onus of establishing whatever has happened and say: &ldquo;Very good; the court will decide whether there is anything prejudicial likely to occur to the interests of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We were told that the object of this section is entirely new; that the object was to meet the situation which might <Col N="266" /> arise if examination papers were disclosed to a master of a school and he made use of the disclosure to instruct a class taught by him as to the questions that were to be asked.  The pupils would get a good result.  We were told that there was one case where that had happened or was supposed to have happened.  I think there was only one case mentioned.  In my whole experience, I have only heard the suggestion made once that examination papers were disclosed, examination papers which could be regarded as in any way tied on to this.</P>
    <P>I ask myself the question: what about the pupils in such a case?  If people, who have got hold of an examination paper for the purpose of printing it, disclose that to a teacher in some school, I have no doubt there ought to be some punishment inflicted. A more serious offender would be the master who took advantage of the paper offered to him if he made use of that in order to instruct pupils very definitely on the points which were going to arise in an examination paper.  I think that man is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>What about the pupils?  What about the parents of the pupils?  The boys are called in and told that the master has certain tips for an examination. They do not know where he has got the tips but they go to an examination room a few days later and find themselves stared in the face with questions they have already been tutored in.  They must then get suspicious. Let us suppose that in between they have been at home and have told their parents that they had a special class and were told to make up whatever information was available to them in certain texts on certain points.  The parents should be more alert to what is happening than the youngsters themselves.  Are the parents aiding and abetting in this whole matter?  Are they to be guilty of an offence although they could prove they had no <i>mens rea,</i> to use the technical term in these matters?  So far as I can see, the legislation even covers this.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that an examiner gives a series of questions he has intended to put to a certain group of <Col N="267" /> pupils for a certain examination and the pupils get that information before the event.  There is some complicity involved there.  Let us suppose that the examination has passed and the examiner decides to publish the questions that he put.  There are occasions when boards of examiners meet.  Four or five may meet and one person wants to put questions on certain things.  Is he entitled, if he publishes afterwards the questions he would have put, except that he was forbidden to do so by his colleagues, to say that seven questions were set and that they said to him that he could set only two, instead of any more, along his lines?  Is it an offence to publish afterwards the documents about which he had entered into conflict with the Department of Education or whatever the Department might be?  Can he say afterwards how he would adjudicate on the questions?</P>
    <P>The whole thing could be resolved by getting a chance to go before a court and saying, in effect: &ldquo;Whatever I did was in no way prejudicial to the interests of the State.&rdquo;  If the court says it was prejudicial then he is for it.  If the court agrees with him then I do not think the Government or the Department have any right to assert their right to say, in effect: &ldquo;No matter what the court said, or would say, we think this is an offence and we want to get a man punished for it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I find myself in the position of being unable to accept either of these two amendments. Deputy McGilligan has explained clearly the purpose of the amendments. They differ very little from the amendment which he put down on Section 4 on Committee Stage, except that he has now incorporated the words &ldquo;to the interests of the State&rdquo; in addition to the words &ldquo;the safety or preservation of the State&rdquo;.  That does not really affect my basic thesis about this whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is improper that civil servants or other public servants&mdash;the Army, Garda, and so on&mdash;should be able to disclose secret and confidential <Col N="268" /> information which has come to them in the course of their duties as public servants.  I think administrative chaos would result if we were to accept that proposition.  As I have already explained on an earlier amendment, the basis of my position is that the State is the repository of a great deal of information about all of us.  It is not right that State servants or anybody else should be enabled to disclose that information as they think fit.</P>
    <P>The incorporation of the words &ldquo;to the interests of the State&rdquo; does not really affect the position at all, because the information which could be disclosed might not affect the interests or safety or preservation of the State but it might vitally affect the interests and welfare of a citizen or firm or group.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the individual citizen should know, and be secure in the knowledge, that any information he discloses to a Government Department about himself is safe in the <Col N="269" /> Department, even though his vital interests might not be affected by its disclosure; that it will not be disclosed irresponsibly or recklessly by any public servant.  I think it would vitiate the whole purpose of Sections 4 and 5 to incorporate in them the words suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The argument again is on the basis of Government Departments.  There is no mention of them in this.  There is no limitation on them.  I would not mind limitation to a body of citizens but take a Government inquiry which they declare to be secret and confidential. One would immediately say, if a case were brought, that to disclose information prejudicial to another person is I think prejudicial to the interests of the State.  That has nothing to do with Government Departments.  A person shall not communicate confidential information.  I want to take &ldquo;a person&rdquo;.  Consider the Chief Justice, who is Chairman of the Commission on Higher Education.  He is forbidden to communicate to anybody anything to which he has access as a member of that Commission.</P>
      <P>The three University Colleges, if they have not already done so, will come before that Commission and will give information.  They want that information, I believe, disclosed.  So far from thinking that the matter disclosed would prejudice them, they want their case made clear.  Their case may be made clear by the Report of the Commission&mdash;but it may not.</P>

      <P>The Minister might set the dogs on me.  I would rather not. This gets back to the old argument that you must trust the Minister to do everything.  Parliament is for the purpose of putting questions to Ministers. The courts are for the purpose of correcting them.</P>
      <P>This legislation provides simply for the Minister to say that something is secret and confidential.  Say a man is a member of a commission and certain information comes to him in that way. He dare not publish it.  From the Minister's argument I can realise the whole background to this.  The type of administrator implied in this measure is mainly to be found in the Civil Service but some Ministers become enthused with the point of view I have mentioned.  This first and foremost deals with administrators.  Courts are ousted from deciding these matters and my simple request is that the courts be brought in.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 23, after &ldquo;where&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;he is aware or has reasonable grounds for believing that&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has been put down by me partly as a result of the discussion on the Committee Stage and partly as a result of representations which have been made to me since then by the Council of the National Union of Journalists.  That Council made the case that the holder of a public office might pass on to a journalist information which might be regarded as official information within the meaning of the Bill without being authorised to do so or without its being in the course of his ordinary official duties.  They made the point that even where a journalist, and perhaps even the official concerned, was under the impression that the information was being communicated <Col N="272" /> quite properly to the journalist, the journalist would be guilty of an offence under this subsection, in that it would be no defence for him to show that he did not know that he had obtained the information irregularly.  The Council said there would appear to be no great difficulty about information circulated by the Government Information Bureau.  Clearly, officials in the Government Information Bureau are duly authorised to pass on official information and they do so in accordance with their duties.</P>
    <P>For my own part, I think the possibility envisaged by the Council of the National Union of Journalists is extremely remote.  First of all, as I mentioned on Committee Stage, the prosecution would have to prove that the information was communicated in contravention of subsection (1). Secondly, civil servants have specific instructions not to make unauthorised communications directly or indirectly on matters which come within their knowledge in the course of their official work.  They know that the Government Information Bureau is the recognised channel for the dissemination of all authorised information to the Press.  However, in deference to the views of the Council, I am moving this amendment.  Deputies will see that it is proposed to make subsection (3) of Section 4 apply only where the person obtaining the information is aware, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that the communication of such information would be in contravention of subsection (1).</P>

      <P>The Minister's amendment shows that he is beginning to realise the weakness of having this section worded in the absolute and categorical manner in which it has been worded.  The amendment as moved is an improvement but it also should establish the arguments the Minister made and should establish also the necessity for an amendment of subsection (1) of Section 4 on the same lines&mdash;that a person shall not communicate any information which he knows, or has reasonable grounds for believing, is confidential.  For the sake of conformity if nothing else, the Minister should provide in this amendment <Col N="273" /> a somewhat similar provision in subsection (1).</P>

      <P>I think we can take amendments Nos. 5 and 6 together.  The purpose of these two amendments is to remove any doubts there may be as to whether the directions which are given for the return of official documents should specifically refer to the documents concerned.  I have examined subsections (2) and (3) of Section 6 again and I believe that it would not be possible to sustain a prosecution for failure to return these documents in accordance with the directions given under these subsections unless the documents were specified or indicated or otherwise sufficiently identified. However, it is desirable to remove any doubts there may be about the matter by amending the two subsections along the lines indicated so as to make it clear that the direction should specify or indicate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Harte</b> asked the Minister for Health what progress has been made in relation to improvements in the heating and other amenities in St. Joseph's Home, Stranorlar, County Donegal; and if the improvements so far effected will provide a greater degree of comfort for the patients in the coming winter months.</P>

      <P>In reply to an earlier question on this matter on 25th July last, I referred to the steps being taken to provide improved heating for the patients, pending the installation of full central heating as part of the comprehensive improvement scheme for the Home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that a total of 37 electric heaters have now been provided in apartments used for patient accommodation and that the installation by the Electricity Supply <Col N="282" /> Board of a larger transformer unit to serve the Home has enabled full use to be made of these heaters, with a resultant improvement in the heating of the Home.  Consideration has also been given to further measures to provide improved heating pending the installation of a permanent central heating system and it has been agreed that a skeleton system of central heating should be provided as quickly as possible.  A temporary boiler has now been installed for this purpose. Work is in progress on the installation of the pipework to connect the boiler with new heating units to serve patient accommodation in the main and infirmary blocks.  Delivery of these heating units is expected shortly and I am informed that the entire installation will be completed by mid-December.</P>
    <P>I am advised that these arrangements should provide a reasonably satisfactory standard of heating in the Home until the permanent heating system is installed as part of the general improvement scheme.  Meanwhile the plans for the first stage of this scheme, that is the erection of a new 98 bed single storey extension, have been completed and approved of by my Department.  The draft Bills of Quantities have been recently submitted to the Department for examination.  Completion of the tender documents will be expedited and the health authority should be in a position to invite tenders for the first stage of the scheme before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of successive Ministers for Health has been to encourage voluntary effort in the field of district nursing.  For several years past local health authorities have had standing authority to pay annual subsidies <Col N="283" /> to district nursing associations which provide appropriate services. These subsidies cover a substantial proportion of the associations' total annual expenditure.</P>
      <P>On learning recently that nurses employed by such associations had received an increase in their remuneration, retrospective to the 1st January, 1962, I issued a circular letter requesting each health authority to review the financial position of each district nursing association in its area and&mdash; where circumstances so warranted&mdash; to make an immediate supplementary grant, retrospective to the 1st January, 1962, to enable the association to pay the increase in the nurse's salary.  I also recommended health authorities to pay the annual subsidies at quarterly intervals so that the associations may be assured of stability in their finances.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that the response from health authorities has been satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The permanent post of district medical officer, Ramelton dispensary district became vacant on the 31st December, 1960, and had been filled temporarily up to the 5th October, 1962, when the temporary district medical officer resigned.  Since that date the duties of the district medical officer in the district are being carried out by the permanent district medical officer of the adjoining dispensary district of Rathmullan.  No steps have been taken to fill the post in a permanent capacity; the health authority have submitted a proposal to me for the amalgamation of the Ramelton and Rathmullan dispensary districts&mdash; one district medical officer to serve the combined districts.  I am at present considering the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding the appointment of a &ldquo;jubilee&rdquo; nurse for the district <Col N="284" /> is that the Queen's Institute of District Nursing have advertised for a nurse for the district and are at present considering applications.  They hope to be in a position to make an appointment shortly.  Since the former &ldquo;jubilee&rdquo; nurse retired on the 14th May, 1961, midwifery services in the Ramelton Dispensary district have been provided by the midwives of the adjoining Letterkenny, Milford, and Rathmullan dispensary districts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will take steps to arrange a reciprocal agreement between the British authorities and the Revenue Commissioners so that a British tourist may drive a Republic registered car through the Border <i>en route</i> from one part of the Republic to another, with special reference to Irish people whose normal place of residence is now given as Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the question, the reciprocal agreement suggested by the Deputy would take the form of an arrangement under which we, for our part, would permit our residents to drive through the State, without paying customs duty, cars which they had hired in the Six Counties whilst the British Customs, for their part, would permit British residents to drive through the Six Counties, without paying customs duty, cars which they had hired in this State.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental principle of our regulations governing the temporary importation of motor cars that relief from duty can be allowed only where the importer has his only or principal place of residence outside the State and I am not prepared to provide the further relief sought by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I understand that the British regulations embody a similar residence qualification and, in consequence, a United Kingdom resident may not import a non-duty paid car temporarily into the United Kingdom without payment of duty.  Any relaxation of this position would be a matter for the British authorities.</P>

He must leave the car at the Border, cross the Border and seek other means of transport to take him to Omagh.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>In 1960 the United States Advanced Research Projects Agency indicated that it was offering to provide free seismological equipment of the most modern type to 125 observatories throughout the world and invited the support of all seismologists for this project.  The instruments would be issued on indefinite loan and all records would be freely available to interested scientists.</P>
      <P>This country was invited to participate in the project and, as it had always been the intention of the Meteorological Service of my Department to install seismographic equipment at Valentia Observatory, it was considered that the provision of the most modern seismological equipment free of charge would fit in well with their plans for the further development of the Observatory.  Accordingly the generous offer of the USA was accepted.</P>
      <P>The United States Research Projects Agency is representative of a variety of U.S. interests.  Once the seismograph project was launched, its administration in the United States was handed over to the US Coast and Geodetic Survey, a body with which the Meteorological Service has collaborated over many years in the matter of magnetic observations.  The purpose of the project is to encourage and conduct an expansion in fundamental research in seismology on a world-wide basis and to provide standardised instrumentation capable of furnishing quantitative data for the study of world seismicity, earthquake mechanisms, seismic wave propagation and energy determinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> There has been no formal agreement with the US Government regarding the loan, or use, of the equipment.</P>
    <P>The agreed arrangement is that copies of the records, which are made daily, will be sent to the US Coast and Geodetic Survey by post in weekly, or monthly, batches.  As I have already said these records are also freely available to all interested scientists.  Any records of nuclear explosions would be included in the data made available but I should make it clear that the equipment is not used for the detection of explosions of nuclear weapons but solely for the detection of nuclear explosions for seismic research purposes.  The reports are available as part of a scientific examination, publication being at regular intervals.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he has considered whether there is a danger of providing excess hotel accommodation, referred to in a recent statement; and, if so, whether he will consider taking steps to provide increased encouragement <Col N="294" /> for the provision and extension of accommodation in small hotels and guest houses which would cater for the majority of holiday makers who are not interested in luxury accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of hotel accommodation is a matter primarily for private enterprise.  There is no excess but a deficiency in B and C Class accommodation.  State assistance is provided through grant and loan schemes administered by Bord Fáilte under the Tourist Traffic Acts and through income tax concessions.  On the basis of the information available, the Board endeavours to relate accommodation capacity to potential traffic. Bord Fáilte's immediate target for top-grade accommodation will be achieved in 1963.  Selectivity is now the keynote for this grade and new projects are considered mainly on the basis of their direct traffic generating potential.</P>
      <P>Progress in other grades, while substantial, has not been as extensive as I would wish but the situation is improving. Of the 3,200 extra bedrooms available by 1963, almost half will be in middle and lower grade hotels.  This is insufficient.</P>
      <P>Concentration now is on the improvement and expansion of existing premises, to which the various incentives apply.  I regret to say that the 20% improvement grants scheme which was introduced by Bord Fáilte in January, 1960, after consultation with the Irish Hotels Federation and which was designed specifically to meet the needs of existing middle and lower grade hotels, has been availed of by only 10% of hoteliers.  As encouragement to the owners of lower and middle grade premises, the Board has adjusted recently the lower limit on the cost of works eligible for improvement grants from £2,000 to £500. There are now reasonable incentives for the owners of small hotels to improve and expand their premises.</P>
      <P>I have asked Bord Fáilte and Ostlanna Iompair Éireann to consider jointly ways and means of stimulating additional Grade B and C accommodation in areas where such accommodation is at present inadequate.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the President of the Hotels Federation stated recently that there was grave danger that hotel bedroom accommodation might outstrip the public demand?  He was speaking with reference to the high grade hotels and the fact that the majority of people who come to this country are anxious for reasonable accommodation rather than the luxury accommodation which is being provided, to a great extent by the taxpayer.  Surely the Minister believes that priority should be given to the small hotels and guest houses anxious to cater for the great majority of tourists coming to this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, no B or C class hotel proprietor has been refused assistance by Bord Fáilte because of the fact that a number of A class hotels have been started.  There was a slowing down in the administration but the great majority of applications by B or C class hotels have been granted. Nothing has been put in their way.  It just so happens that there has been too slow or too small a response to the grant system by hotels in that category.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in previous replies to questions on this subject the full cost of any increase in pensions to existing CIE pensioners would fall to be met by CIE in the form of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments unless, of course, the contributing members were prepared to agree to an amendment of the scheme so as to provide for an increase in contributions to meet all or part of the cost.  Under the existing legislation the initiative for proposing amendments to the scheme rests entirely with the Board and I see no necessity for amending legislation in this respect.</P>
      <P>I am advised by CIE that the realisation of the investment in the superannuation fund and its investment in the 6 per cent.  National Loan would not produce any greater income and would not, therefore, permit of higher pensions being paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the amount of their pension from CIE, wages, grade pensioners may qualify for unemployment or disability benefit at 65 years of age and at 70 years are eligible for contributory old age pensions, including such increases in benefits and pensions as may be payable from January, 1963 <Col N="297" /> under the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1962.  Both CIE and their workers are, of course, liable to pay the appropriate contributions towards the cost of such pensions.</P>

      <P>With the permission <Col N="298" /> of an Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 25 together.  The apportionment of income and expenditure to particular sections of the railway network is a highly technical and difficult problem.  The Oireachtas has delegated to CIE under Section 19 of the Transport Act, 1958, sole responsibility for determining whether particular railway services are economic and has vested in the Board full discretion and sole authority to discontinue services they deem to be uneconomic and likely to remain so.  With a view to determining as accurately as possible the precise economic position of the various sectors and lines in the Board's rail system, the Board, with the assistance of a firm of industrial consultants, undertook during the past year an extensive study of the entire rail system.  That study confirmed that the revenue earned on a number of lines was less than the direct cost of operating services over them apart from overheads and other expenditure not readily allocatable.</P>
      <P>As regards the branch lines referred to by the Deputy, I understand that the Board have furnished to the local bodies figures showing the revenue and expenditure for the year ended 31st March, 1961 in respect of the various lines in Counties Cork and Waterford which the bodies in question requested from the Board and that the Board have invited the bodies concerned to send a deputation to discuss the matter further.  I also understand that one of the bodies in question has agreed to send a deputation to the Board for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The information sought by the local interests would not enable them to add anything to the very comprehensive study already carried out by CIE and their consultants.</P>
      <P>As the statutory responsibility for determining whether any particular branch is economic or not rests solely on CIE, who have gone to considerable trouble to secure an objective assessment of the position for each line, I would suggest that the most appropriate way for the local bodies concerned to pursue this matter would be by discussion with the Board.</P>

      <P>So that adequate consultation may take place at the meetings between the interested parties and the Board of CIE, would the Minister not think it desirable that all information necessary to these interested parties should be made available and would he explain the prohibition on officers of CIE giving information requested locally for these interested parties?  Is the Minister further aware that in one particular case a figure of £700 in revenue was quoted to the interested parties and since receiving that quotation they received evidence, by way of receipts from traders in that area, of a figure paid in that year in excess of £7,000 and in view of the disparity in the figures, does the Minister not think that it would be more conducive to better understanding between CIE and the general public if they withdrew the prohibition on the giving by officers of information to the interested parties before they meet the Board of CIE?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would simply create confusion if the figures given by officers of CIE in local areas where taken as being the actual figures representing the revenue attributable to a particular line.  This is a firm of consultants of international repute who have prepared the figures and they have been examined by CIE.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and there obviously comes the point where CIE decide that a line is uneconomic.  To give a separate set of figures from different station masters and different areas and examine receipts of individual firms would simply create confusion. This is a highly technical matter and must be done in the most official way by CIE.  All figures are examined by the Board and the company issue a general statement of revenue and expenditure to those people appealing to CIE in relation to the closing of a line which is accurate and quite sufficient for the <Col N="300" /> purpose of any debate they would like to have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already done my best to explain to the Deputy that these figures would simply create confusion in the minds of the people concerned. When you examine the actual receipts and expenditure for a particular line, you have to eliminate a great part of the receipt value for goods despatched or received at any station because it does not apply to the line. This is a highly complex matter.  It would be quite wrong to create a precedent whereby State companies were asked to give details of receipts and expenditure from the various branches of their operations.  It would simply mean they would have no independence of action and it would be a most serious precedent.  It is not necessary because I have full confidence in the Board and the manner in which these figures have been analysed.</P>

All they want to do is to come with that information to the Board of CIE.  Even if it is not in some particular relevant, is it not open to the Board to say: &ldquo;It looks simple but is not as simple as it looks&rdquo;?  Is it not maddening that <Col N="301" /> the local people should know the information is in the stationmaster's office and that yet he will not be allowed to tell them?  Surely that is not good public relations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are to have decent public relations and an understanding of what is happening, and if the Ardee Town Commissioners want the figures available to the station-master, would it not be rational for CIE to say: &ldquo;Here they are, but we annex herewith a report from the business consultants we employed which shows that these figures are not really relevant to your case and that the relevant figures are these figures&rdquo;? Then the Ardee Town Commissioners can go to the Board of CIE and say : &ldquo;You are listening to your consultants but we make the other case.&rdquo; That is argument.  At the conclusion of the argument, the Board of CIE can act, but the present situation is that a body in the position of the Ardee Town Commissioners feel that unless they go round to every shopkeeper and every person who drove cattle in or out of Ardee station, there is no means available to them to get the information they want, although they know it is sitting in the stationmaster's office.  Why not give it to them and say to them: &ldquo;This is not as simple as it looks.  There is another side to the story&rdquo;?  If the Board will do that, I think they will find people are much more reasonable than they appear to think they are.  After all, the Ardee Town Commissioners represent the people.  The Board of CIE represent nobody but the Executive.</P>

      <P>The possibility of flooding at Shelton Abbey, Avoca, was fully considered when the suitability of the site for a fertiliser factory was under examination.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of providing adequate protection of the site against flooding is much less than £50,000. This cost, in accordance with normal practice, was taken into account in estimating the cost of the civil works involved in the development of the site, of which cost it is only an insignificant proportion.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The replies to the questions as numbered by the Deputy are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The factory is an economic unit with a design capacity of 150,000 tons per annum of nitrogenous fertiliser in the forms of sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate.</P>
      <P>(2) Official statistics of imports for the latest fertiliser season, i.e., the 12 months ended 30th June, 1962, were sulphate of ammonia 101,969 tons, calcium ammonium nitrate 30,638 tons, total 132,607 tons.  This shows an increase of 63 per cent.  On the home demand in 1958, when Economic Development was published, of 81,219 tons.</P>
      <P>(3) Official statistics do not segregate the different values for bagged and bulk fertilisers.  I am informed, however, that the latest import prices c.i.f. (i.e. in ships hold) prices are, on average, as follows: Sulphate of Ammonia, £14 5s. Od. per ton in bags, £12 15s. Od. per ton in bulk; Calcium Ammonium Nitrate, £13 17s. 6d. per ton.  The additional cost of moving the products from the ships hold into the importers' stores would include, <i>inter alia,</i> the costs of discharge, port dues and transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Details of the factory costings are confidential.  It would, quite obviously, seriously inhibit the operating company in their commercial operations to disclose such information. A special Committee of administrative and technical officers carried out intensive investigations during 1960 and 1961 and reported to me that the factory <Col N="306" /> could compete with prevailing import prices.  Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta have now confirmed that the terms of the factory contract establish beyond question that after full allowance for all the appropriate commercial costings the factory products can be sold at prices competitive with the prices of the comparable imported products.</P>
    <P>(5) There should be no surplus for export.  The factory is due to come into production during 1965, i.e. in two and a half years from now, and there is little doubt that the present home demand (132,000 tons last season) will reach, at least, the design capacity (150,000 tons) by then.  As already indicated, it has increased by over 50,000 tons since 1958, when Economic Development was published.</P>
    <P>(6) The answer is in the negative.</P>
    <P>(7) The estimated employment figure is 300.  There is no reliable information available as to employment in comparable industries abroad as chemical factories vary considerably in their range of products.  We have no comparable industry in this country so far.</P>
    <P>As to the remaining inquiries, the position is that all the Departments concerned with the assembly and evaluation of the material on nitrogenous fertilisers published in Economic Development, viz., the Departments of Agriculture, Finance and Industry and Commerce, were represented on the Committee which investigated the project and submitted, unanimously, the report on the basis of which the Government decided to establish the factory.  I am not prepared to publish any reports containing costings and other purely commercial information furnished in confidence to me and, through me, to the Government.  It will, of course, be my duty to place before the House the fullest possible information on the project when introducing, shortly, the legislation necessary to provide for the further financing of Nítrigin Éireann Teoranta.</P>

      <P>As I have already announced, a contract has been awarded to Messrs. Lurgi of Frankfurt Am Main, West Germany, for a nitrogenous fertiliser factory to be erected near Arklow, Co. Wicklow. The basic contract price is of the order of £5 million.  The necessary civil engineering works are being put in hands at once and the factory is <Col N="308" /> due to come into production early in 1965.  Fuel oil, sulphur and limestone are the main raw materials.  These commodities are freely available on a commercial basis.  I am fully satisfied that the factory prices of sulphate of ammonia and calcium ammonium nitrate, produced to the prescribed technical standards, will be competitive with prevailing import prices. Accordingly, there is no reason why farmers and market gardeners should not receive their requirements at prices competitive with the prices they pay for the imported products.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to differences in the national legislation and practice of the various European countries, it is difficult to make exact comparisons. However, in so far as I understand it, seven out of thirteen of these countries have statutory provisions relating to annual holidays which are, in a general way, more favourable than our legislation.  On the same general basis, it would appear that the position here is as good as, or better than, the position in the remaining six.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to public holidays, the practice varies so widely, not alone from country to country but from area <Col N="312" /> to area within individual countries, that it is even more difficult to make direct comparisons.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether, in view of the fact that he was President of the International Labour Conference in June, 1962, he will consider implementing the principle of equal pay for men and women in this country as embodied in the I.L.O. Charter.</P>

      <P>The general policy in relation to the determination of wage rates is that they should, so far as possible, <Col N="313" /> be negotiated freely between employers' and workers' organisations. If workers' trade unions desire to ensure equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value, it is always open to them, in negotiating wage agreements with employers, to seek to implement this principle as embodied in the International Labour Constitution and in International Labour Convention No. 100.</P>
      <P>Since the Convention expressly provides that its principles may be applied by means of collective agreements between employers and workers, the enactment of legislation on the subject would not necessarily be required.</P>

      <P>The question of the nationalisation of the milling and baking industries was debated in the House in November, 1960.  On that occasion I stated that I was of opinion, for reasons which I gave, that nationalisation was not desirable and that it would not result in cheaper flour or bread.  I am still of that opinion.  While the problems involved in determining a standard of millability and the practicability of introducing a scheme for the growing of wheat on a contract basis are matters which are primarily the concern of the Minister for Agriculture, I am not satisfied that nationalisation is the appropriate way of dealing with these problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is prepared to intimate to housing authorities that the full 66? per cent. subsidy on new houses will be paid where such houses are used to relieve overcrowding in council houses caused by the marriage of a member of the tenant's family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained fully in replies to previous Parliamentary Questions the position regarding the payment of subsidy in respect of such rehousing.  I would refer the Deputy to my reply in the matter on March 1st last to Deputy P.J. Burke, and to supplementary questions asked by the Deputy on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the Minister has explained the position in this matter, but does he not consider it a severe hardship that newly married couples who are living with their in-laws, should be rendered ineligible for local authority houses carrying a subsidy of 66??  Does the Minister not appreciate that these newly married couples have no option but to go and live with their in-laws?  The Minister must be aware that this is a big problem throughout the country and one which imposes a severe hardship on young newly married couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have sympathy with the people described by the Deputy.  On the other hand, there are other sections of the community with whom I have very great sympathy also.  I have to have regard to the needs of these other sections. That is not to say that consideration is not given to the position of these people to whom the Deputy refers.  I admit that up to the present that consideration has not led to any real results, but I certainly sympathise with them.  Because these other sections are in such great need, I cannot promise anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want any priority to be given to these.  I merely ask the Minister to have their applications <Col N="323" /> considered in the ordinary way.  I do not want to enter into an argument with the Minister now, but would the Minister be prepared to receive a small deputation of members of this House who are also members of local authorities?  I ask, at any rate, on behalf of my group because we feel very strongly about this and we believe a discussion with the Minister might result in a little more progress than one gets by way of question and answer here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Without intending any discourtesy, I am inclined to say I am not prepared to receive such a deputation at the moment.  Consideration is being given to this particular aspect of the housing problem, but there are other aspects which are more urgent. I doubt whether a deputation from one Party, or from all Parties in the House, would add anything to the material necessary for full consideration to be given to the matter.  We have all the pros and cons from the various members of the House.  We have all the information from the debates and from question and answer. If there are particular aspects that the Deputy thinks have not been properly brought to light, or sufficiently considered, or if there is any particular proposal he, or any other Deputy, may have to make I shall certainly be glad to have that and to examine it in order to discover whether or not it holds out any promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I did not hear the Minister say the matter was being considered.  If that is so, that obviates any necessity for a deputation because the Minister has all the information.  I merely appeal to the Minister to give the matter urgent consideration.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 to 58 together.</P>
      <P>It is a matter for each local authority to assess from time to time the number of new dwellings required to be provided in their area under the Housing of the Working Classes and the Labourers Acts.  Figures so assessed are not usually furnished to my Department except in conjunction with housing proposals.  I am not accordingly in a position to give the information sought in reply to the first part of each question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to plans for future building, I would refer the Deputy to <Col N="325" /> my reply to his question of 20th June, 1962, since which, the erection of four further houses at John Street, Wexford, has been approved.  No further building proposals have been submitted for the other towns mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The present position regarding the remaining schemes is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wexford U.D.</i> The 34-house scheme at John Street is in progress.  A 24-house scheme has been approved for Davitt Road, North, and a scheme of about 120 houses at Slippery Green has been generally approved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Enniscorthy U.D.</i> A proposal for the acceptance of a tender for a 28-house scheme at Bellefield is awaited.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Ross U.D.</i> Proposals for the acceptance of tenders for schemes of 20 houses at Charleton Hill, 4 houses at William Street and 2 houses at Windmill Lane are awaited.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gorey.</i> The housing authority's observations on technical questions raised in respect of a 14-house scheme are awaited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed that, at a recent date, the number of families on the Corporation's waiting-list, including those recommended for rehousing by the City Medical Officer, totalled slightly over 4,000.  The Corporation had 1,169 dwellings in progress or in tender at the 30th September and I understand that between new building and vacancies they expect to be able to provide about 3,000 new tenancies in the next two and a half years.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the average period in which an applicant for a corporation house with (a) one child (b) two children (c) three children and (d) four children can under existing circumstances be housed by the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Information as to the average period in question is not available <Col N="328" /> in my Department.  If statistics were assembled to determine it, the resultant figure would be of no practical use as size of family is only one of several factors governing rehousing. It would also be soon outdated by prospective increases in housing output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not strike the Minister as a rather shocking thing that, when families cannot get housing in the city where as many as four are living in unsuitable housing, the best they can expect is that three-fourths of the existing applicants may be housed at the end of two and a half years at a time when we are building offices, luxury hotels and every form of luxury building, while people remain in condemned houses in our city?  Is there not something wrong?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government have been in office now for six years.  Six years prior to their arrival, the number of houses built in the city had reached a very high level.  It then fell very considerably.  We are now in the position in which the Minister says that it will take two and a half years at least to house three-quarters of the existing applicants, but that by that time there will be a substantial addition to the waiting list.  Does the Minister not consider there must be something wrong in our priorities if in those circumstances so high a proportion of entire building resources are devoted to luxury hotels, office buildings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it has been raised and since it may or may not be a policy matter, depending on one's point of view, I should like to say that this is a matter which is giving vital cause for concern to my Department and myself.  We have been quite a considerable time consulting with the Corporation helping them along, advocating that they should go faster and try to bring the plans to the stage at which they can build.  What I have read out is what is proposed to be done.</P>
      <P>Behind it lies this story of the situation which is not quite as simple as the Leader of the Opposition seems to put it.  You cannot just have a full stop on housing and then an immediate restart when the circumstances have changed so radically from the position exising five or six years ago when there were 1,600 or 1,700 vacant houses occurring annually as against the present situation where the vacancy rate has fallen well below half that figure and continues to decline.</P>
      <P>These are matters which we must consider and which have probably created the unfortunate situation indicated by the figures I have given. I would be quite safe in referring the the Leader of the Opposition to the statement of the position given by the City Manager of Dublin very recently, possibly a month or five weeks ago, which I think was quite an illuminating statement in regard to the whole situation of housing, the shortage of housing in Dublin and the difficulties attendant upon stepping up the programme to meet this rising need and the change in circumstances.</P>

    <P>I do not think it is just a question of its being an appalling situation that <Col N="330" /> this should be so.  It is apparent that there may be this long delay.  I do not think the city council of Dublin, the City Manager, the Department of Local Government, the Minister for Local Government or the Government are to be blamed for that situation, for the reason that from the Department we are and have been prepared to provide all that is essential and necessary so far as house building for Dublin Corporation and any other corporation is concerned by way of finances and what have you.</P>
    <P>The Corporation, to my mind, in their efforts have been doing the best and most expeditious job it is possible for them to do in bringing about an upturn in the number of houses under construction.  The number is increasing at present and will increase in the future.  Times have changed radically since six years ago.  You cannot switch off building construction today, turn the tap and switch on the flow tomorrow.  It takes time and that is largely the difficulty which has faced the Dublin Corporation.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 76 together.</P>
      <P>As regards abnormal loads, British conditions differ from ours and we would not necessarily follow their regulations.  There are at present certain controls on large loads applied by the Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (Construction, Equipment and Use) Orders 1934 to 1948, made under the Road Traffic Act, 1933.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Road Traffic Act, 1961, a comprehensive review of regulations regarding the construction, equipment <Col N="336" /> and use of vehicles, including the matter of driver's equipment, is well advanced. The first subject taken was the lighting of vehicles, and as I indicated in reply to Question No. 74, my proposals in that regard will be published in the near future.  The remainder of the regulations, including those dealing with abnormal loads and crash helmets, will then be dealt with.  The practice is to consult expert opinion in the preparation of draft regulations and then to publish an advance draft for any comments that interested parties may wish to make on it.</P>

So many of these regulations are under review at the moment that I would not even try to state when I would hope they would come in.</P>

      <P>There is no means test for <Col N="339" /> old age contributory pension.  So far as the non-contributory pension is concerned, the first £80 of a service pension or special allowance is ignored in the calculation of means and if the remaining means do not exceed £52 10s. in the case of a single man, or £105 in the case of a married man, the full rate of pension is payable.</P>

      <P>We now have the report of this commission which gives us material which may lead to a fundamental reorganisation of the workmen's compensation scheme.

Is he aware that the proposals suggested in this Question would merely mean a two- or three-line Bill to the effect that the weekly payment for workmen's compensation would be increased by such and such an amount?  Does the Minister also appreciate&mdash;I know he does, but I have to put it in the form of a <Col N="341" /> question&mdash;that the examination of the report of the Commission entails its examination by various Departments of State, when all those views are combined? Is the Minister not aware that the framing of legislation after that could take some considerable time?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 91 and 92 together.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the Agricultural Science Association on 21st September, 1962, I said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;With the extent of rural congestion as I have described it, it goes without saying that, in future, every acre of land which becomes available for acquisition must be acquired to cope with it.  It will be recalled that the Report of the inter-Departmental Committee made special reference to the number of western holdings vacated by owners and let to neighbouring farmers. This pattern, however, may not be entirely peculiar to the West. While undoubtedly there may sometimes be justifiable and compelling reasons for temporarily letting lands, there can be no justification for allowing land to be vacated indefinitely. The Committee recommended that where holdings are let and not properly worked or left vacant they should be acquired by the Land Commission for relief of congestion.  The Government believe that, in the interest of relieving congestion, promoting proper land utilisation and preventing sizeable areas from falling into a derelict or semi-derelict condition, the Land Commission's statutory powers of acquisition will have to be more earnestly directed towards such lands in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land of that kind is rarely looked after well and the trouble is that it tends to become more unproductive as time goes on, yielding nothing like it should to the sum of goods. The Government cannot tolerate that and owners will simply have to make up their minds to opt in or opt out.  My directive to the Land Commission will be to adopt a stiffer attitude towards the owners of vacated lands.  I have recently given public notice that I propose to direct the Land Commission to compile a Register of vacant and derelict <Col N="345" /> holdings and lands that have been let for a period of 5 years or over. These people will receive an offer from the Land Commission to purchase their lands; if they do not sell or, alternatively, return, live on and effectively work their holdings, then I feel the Land Commission will have full support in using their wide compulsory powers for the acquisition of these lands.  This country can no longer afford absentee landowners; they are just as detrimental to the common good as were the absentee landlords of former times.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is not proposed that these measures be restricted solely to the West; and let me say also that the Land Commission will continue to consider on its merits the application of a landowner who, by reason of special circumstances, has to make a merely short-term temporary letting of his land.</P>

      <P>May I take it from the Minister's statement, therefore, the proposed policy of the Government refers also to the man whom the Minister mentioned in his address to the Agricultural Science Association, for example, the gentleman who owns the broad acres in the Midlands and who, according to the Minister, has no time to go to the fairs because so much of his time is devoted to attending race meetings and other sporting events?  Does the Minister propose to include such gentlemen in the Land Commission's projects for the acquisition and division of holdings?</P>

As I have pointed out on a number of occasions, having regard to the extent of the genuine congestion problem still awaiting solution&mdash;that is, amongst the people exclusively or mainly dependent on agriculture for a livelihood&mdash;I want to stress that the main emphasis of land policy must be directed towards uneconomic holders and migrants from congested areas with the objective of attaining for them family farms of the type enunciated by the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>While I have answered the Deputy's question which is, as far as I can trace, the first of its kind to be asked in the House, I feel that, as a general principle, it is undesirable that the discharge of replanting obligations by particular landowners should be the subject of discussion in the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that two smallholders have between 25 and 40 Irish acres each <Col N="349" /> and that in the area adjoining these farms, there are 14 deserving applicants with a valuation of between £4 and £17?  Does the Minister not consider that the claims of these two farmers that their land requirements could not be met were justified in the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I do not subscribe to the doctrine that the claims of the local smallholders cannot be met anywhere.  The adjoining farm mentioned by the Deputy had a valuation of £22 5s.  It was bought by two local small farmers and my information is that they owned 25 and 30 acres, respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Efforts by the Land Commission to purchase this estate on a voluntary basis proved unsuccessful. It is not possible to indicate at present what further action will be feasible regarding the lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the new purchaser has been in possession for a considerable period and that it is quite clear that the Land Commission so far have made no effort, since he obtained possession of the land, to acquire it?  In the light of the Minister's recent statement that he was making all possible efforts to relieve rural congestion, is it not his duty to acquire any land that becomes available for division to help smallholders? How does he reconcile this statement with the fact that 288 acres of first-class land have been allowed to go to a purchaser, while within four miles of that big farm, there are at least 50 smallholders with under £14 valuation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is untrue to say that the Land Commission made no efforts to acquire these lands since the new purchaser bought them.  They did, in fact, make an attempt to acquire these lands by purchase from the new owner. I explained the legal position about this estate as the law stands in the <Col N="350" /> House in reply to a previous question by the Deputy.  I pointed out that the Land Commission under their powers, as they at present exist, could not have acquired these lands compulsorily from the former owner, and that the question of the new owners would depend on how they worked the land. That is still the situation.  Sufficient time has not elapsed in this case for the Land Commission to be in a position to judge whether they should use their compulsory powers of acquisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

      <P>Agreement to purchase the commonage in question for afforestation purposes was reached by my Department with the five co-owners a number of years ago.

      <P>In view of the fact that this has been going on for years, as the Minister said in his answer, and the fact that this is very suitable land for planting beside existing forests where employment is diminishing and before it diminishes further, would the Minister use all the power possible to try to get the one tenant who is not cooperating with the other four to agree?

As Deputies are aware, it is the function of the Broadcasting Authority to provide a national television service and it will be for the Authority to decide when the provincial transmitters will be brought into operation.  I am aware that the Authority is making every effort to extend the service to all areas as soon as possible, and in spite of unforeseen difficulties and delays it hopes to have the four provincial transmitters in operation by the end of this year.  It should then be possible to receive the <Col N="360" /> Telefís Éireann programmes in practically all areas.  If reception is not satisfactory in some isolated districts the Authority will consider what further steps should be taken to give adequate coverage in those districts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>No immediate campaign is contemplated in regard to recruitment for Civil Defence on a national basis such as the Deputy may have in mind.  The effectiveness of the Civil Defence services in the event of war must depend mainly on the extent of the trained personnel available. Recruitment to the Civil Defence Services is primarily a matter for local authorities and sustained efforts towards this end have been proceeding on a national basis since 1957.  I myself and officers of my Department have availed of every opportunity to emphasise the necessity of having trained Civil Defence personnel available to meet wartime needs and that the amount of training which could be given under war conditions would be very limited.</P>
      <P>As far as the making available by the State of money for Civil Defence purposes is concerned, I can assure the Deputy that lack of money has not been a problem.</P>
      <P>Regarding the education of the public for Civil Defence work I may say that while direct instruction of the public has not yet been undertaken, the fact that so many volunteers are being trained throughout the country has spread some knowledge of Civil Defence.  A booklet entitled &ldquo;Methods of Protection&rdquo; has recently been printed and copies have been distributed to the local authorities for issue to members of the Civil Defence services.  A further booklet for issue to each householder on &ldquo;Home Protection&rdquo; against the fall-out and other hazards of nuclear war has been prepared and will be issued at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 151 to 154 together.</P>
      <P>There are no statutory provisions governing the use of dogs by the Garda Síochána nor are such necessary.  They are trained to be obedient to their handlers and are used to assist them in the execution of their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Police dogs are regularly used in other countries for the control of disorderly persons and since the establishment of a police-dog service in Dublin in December, 1960, they have been <Col N="373" /> used successfully on a number of occasions for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the police on the spot to decide whether the actions of a public gathering are, or are not likely to cause, a breach of the peace and it is the duty of the police to take such immediate steps as are reasonably necessary for the preservation of the peace and the maintenance of law and order.</P>

      <P>While dissociating myself most emphatically from the &ldquo;andrewmartins&rdquo; of Deputy Dr. Browne and those accompanying him, I want to ask the Minister, do the Government seriously suggest that the employment of dogs is a suitable means of controlling crowds exercising a constitutional right to demonstrate, when all our experience teaches us that if any irregularity arises, it is possible for the Garda, by ordinary police methods, to restore order without any serious difficulty whatever?  Is the Minister aware that a great many responsible people in this country, including myself and many of my colleagues, view the employment of dogs in this context as highly opprobrious and likely to cause the gravest concern among the people?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 158, 159, 160 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>I regret that the incident on the 23rd October occurred.  I regret that the persons taking part in the protest march saw fit to behave in a disorderly manner and to refuse to obey the directions of the police.  I regret also that matters developed to the point where, in the actual situation which obtained, the Gardaí on the spot felt it necessary to use police dogs to maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>The procedure and practice with regard to marches and demonstrations is well established.  Those organising such demonstrations are expected to inform the authorities beforehand of the purpose of the march and the route to be followed.  When this is done the Gardaí facilitate the organisers in every way with their arrangements and take all necessary precautions to ensure that law and order is maintained. Reasonable arrangements are always made for a representative delegation to go forward in advance of the main body to deliver messages or present petitions where this is required.</P>
      <P>If the usual procedure had been followed in this instance, there would have been no trouble of any sort.  This, unfortunately, was not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information before me goes to indicate that a meeting of the Irish Committee for Nuclear Disarmament was being held on the evening of the 23rd October.  During the course of the meeting a member of the English Committee of One Hundred came into the hall and urged those present to abandon the meeting and follow him in a march on the American Embassy. He succeeded in persuading a number of those present to adopt this course. No notification of any sort was given to the police authorities.  In consequence, when the local Gardaí learned that a number of persons had commenced to march on the American Embassy they were entirely unaware of the nature or purpose of the demonstration. When the marchers were <Col N="376" /> requested to turn back some of them proceeded to lie down on the roadway and obstruct traffic while others volubly insisted on their rights to proceed to the Embassy and endeavoured to force their way through the small police cordon.</P>
    <P>At this stage, the march was of a most disorderly character.  The police van carrying the police dogs had in the meantime come upon the scene and in an endeavour to restore law and order and to prevent any further deterioration of the situation, their handlers brought the dogs into action. I must emphasise that had the leaders of the march not acted in such an irresponsible manner in trying to force their way through the cordon, the question of police action would not have arisen.  The police had a duty to refuse to allow an unruly and aggressive crowd to make a demonstration before a foreign Embassy and the also to protect the Embassy and the adjoining property.  The marchers had every opportunity of telling the police that they wished to send forward a letter of protest, but they chose not to do so and endeavoured to force their way through.  The blame for anything which happened subsequently must, I think, in fairness, be attributed to them.</P>
    <P>I would like to correct some false impressions about the nature of these incidents which seem to have got abroad.  This was not a peaceful orderly demonstration by a group of responsible law-abiding citizens.  The marchers made no attempt to nominate delegates to go forward and hand in a protest but insisted on marching on the Embassy <i>en masse.</i> There was no question of police dogs being set upon the marchers.  Only two dogs were involved and they were at all times kept on a short leash by their handlers.  They were not at any time used for any purpose other than the protection of their handlers in the execution of their duty.</P>
    <P>If those who wish to organise peaceful demonstrations, whether to protest or otherwise, will co-operate with the police and follow what are by now well established procedures, there is no reason why an incident of this sort should ever recur.</P>

      <P>Has it now reached the stage that if a small group of citizens wish to make a perfectly normal, peaceful protest, which takes the form of handing in a letter of protest by one or two of its members, and simply because of some trifling matter they fail to notify the police they wish to make such a protest, the Minister condones the use of half-savage dogs to prevent those people from making the protest?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister recognises that the protest march was an impromptu march carried out because of the world situation at that time?  Is it not a fact that the group &mdash; I was a member of that group&mdash;knew they would have to stop 50 yards or more from the Embassy, and did so?  Further, is it not a fact that I went forward and asked the station sergeant, knowing that was the likely procedure, if I might go out with one other person and present a document to the Embassy, but he refused to allow me to do so?  Is it not a fact there was no suggestion anybody intended to go through at all and that, as the Minister said, they lay down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further arising out of the Minister's reply, if it is suggested this was a disorderly mob which was besetting the Guards, why is it that none of the members of the group were brought to <Col N="378" /> court on the following day and charged with any offences arising out of the meeting?  Is it not a fact that the dogs were set on me in Lincoln Place approximately 250 yards from the Embassy by the man in charge and is it not a fact &mdash; this may concern Deputies, and I can prove it &mdash; that when they kicked me, threw me on the ground and set the dogs on me, they knew I was in fact at that time a Deputy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if, when he refers to the situation in other countries, it is a fact that in Britain when it was contemplated that dogs would be used by the police in such a manner, the proposal was dropped by the authorities there?  Is it not the position that outside Buchenwald, Dachau and other concentration camps, it is not known that dogs were set on innocent citizens in the pursuit of an innocent protest march?  Is it not unknown that human beings, outside the worst criminals, should be subjected to attack by dogs?</P>

The operation of the scheme has to date brought improvements the cost of which is in excess of £1,000,000 a year.  In January last a composite claim for a pay increase for all ranks up to chief superintendent was lodged by the Joint Representative Body. Following the election of the new Representative Bodies in July, the new Joint Body indicated that they did not wish to pursue the claim lodged in January.

      <P>Inasmuch as we are all now agreed that the use of dogs is normally not a desirable practice, nor will it be the practice of the Garda Síochána in these circumstances hereafter, I ask the Minister this &mdash; in answer to a question, he has said that only one trivial scratch was suffered by a member of the public and that one relatively trivial injury was caused to a member of the Garda&mdash;will he now undertake to have a full inquiry made because no doubt there are circulating in the city stories to the effect that numerous persons had to be treated at Dublin city hospitals from bites inflicted by the dogs under the control of the Garda Síochána?  That statement is either true or false.  If the Minister cares to say now that he has made these inquiries and that there is no truth in these allegations, well and good, but if the allegations have not been brought officially to his attention before, I now inform him those rumours are circulating in the city of Dublin and they require to be confirmed or denied.</P>

      <P>I cannot possibly reply to 16 or 17 questions at once. Deputy Dr. Browne has a facile habit of running a number of questions together.  May I, a Cheann Comhairle, answer Deputy Dillon's supplementary question?  I am aware that these rumours are circulating and I am in a <Col N="384" /> position to state that they are entirely false.  My information is to the effect, as given in this answer, that only two persons reported to the Garda that they had been injured.  One of these persons gave a name and address which, on a subsequent inquiry by the Garda, turned out to be false.  When inquiry was made by the Garda at the hospital at which this person alleged he had been treated, the hospital knew nothing about any such incident.  That is the extent of my information at the moment.  As far as I can ascertain, there is no question whatever of any number of people having been bitten by dogs.  However, I have given this assurance and I want to repeat it, that if any member of the public complains to me about his treatment by the Garda on that occasion, either by dogs or in any other way, I shall have it fully investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have that assurance from the Minister.  I was merely trying to save him when I intervened in his reply.  In fact, when he says the injuries were trivial, if he wishes to verify from a photograph, he will find there was one person who was seriously injured on both forearms and there is, I think, a photograph available to show those injuries, if he cares to look at it.  I saw these injuries myself.  I deprecate the fact that there may be exaggeration by a number of people.  To my knowledge, only one person was seriously hurt.</P>
