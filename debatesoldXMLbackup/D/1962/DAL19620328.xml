      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether his statement on 26th April, 1960, repeated in the White Paper of July, 1961, that the best situation possibly for us would be association with the Common Market, if Britain were also a member of it, on a basis which satisfactorily took account of our economic circumstances, is still the Government's appreciation of the position; and, if so, if he will state at what stage and on what reassessment of the issues and considerations involved the Government decided to seek full membership of the EEC rather than the association proposed in the Government White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether in view of the Government undertaking in the White Paper of July 1961 that a further White Paper would be published in due course as a basis for discussion by Dáil Éireann of whatever decision might be proposed by the Government, and of the fact that such a decision to seek full membership has since been taken, the Government will take steps to provide a further White Paper for discussion in Dáil Éireann without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, Sir, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments for and against <Col N="634" /> membership of, and association with, the European Economic Community are set out in Part IV of the White Paper of the 30th June, 1961.  In a statement made in this House on the 5th July, 1961, I indicated that our application would be for membership of the Community, not association, and I gave the reasons for that decision. On the 1st August, 1961, when announcing our decision to apply for membership, I stated that it was in accordance with the policy outlined in the July discussion.  There could, therefore, be no possibility of misunderstanding of the Government's policy in this respect.</P>
    <P>In the statement made fifteen months previously and mentioned in Question No. 1 the word &ldquo;association&rdquo; was used in its normal sense and not in the technical sense it has in Article 238 of the Rome Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply to Question No. 2, will he say when the White Paper is likely to be issued which he stated would be issued for discussion by Dáil Éireann when the decision was taken by the Government?  In view of the fact that the decision has been taken by the Government to apply for full membership, will the Taoiseach now make the White Paper available dealing with the decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision was taken in July, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that White Paper the Taoiseach said that depending on whatever decision might be taken by the Government a White Paper would then be published.  Surely the Taoiseach will agree that the former White Paper is out of date and that a new White Paper with this new decision should be made available to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When presenting that White Paper to the House, I announced the Government's decision and that decision was confirmed subsequently in the course of that month. I think the Deputy may have in mind the question that will arise for consideration here when our negotiations <Col N="635" /> with the European Economic Community on our application for membership have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it that such a White Paper will not be made available until after discussions with the European Economic Community have taken place and that the Government have decided on their own line of accepting the implications of whatever decision may be arrived at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that no White Paper will be presented to the House before that.  Documents were made available last week dealing with the agricultural decision of the Community, but the White Paper, to which I think the Deputy refers, will relate to the final decision when that comes to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understood that the Dáil will make the decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach say whether it has been possible to obtain for circulation an authoritative translation of whatever arrangements were made by the Six among themselves in respect of the agricultural field?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the translation is authoritative; it is our translation.  That has been done already and copies of those decisions as translated by ourselves are available in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether any of the present members of the EEC are permitted to have preferential trading arrangements with their former colonies or dependent territories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would direct the Deputies' attention to Part IV of the <Col N="636" /> Rome Treaty, the Implementing Convention relating to the Association with the Community of the Overseas Countries and Territories and the Protocol relating to goods originating in and coming from certain countries and enjoying special treatment on importation into one of the Member States.</P>
      <P>The Implementing Convention will expire at the end of this year and a new Implementing Convention is at present being negotiated for a further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it conceivable that arrangements could be made to retain certain preferential trading arrangements with colonial and former colonial countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume if we were a former French colony, we would have the same rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it conceivable then, in so far as we were at one stage a member of the Commonwealth, that preferential arrangements could be made with Britain if we wished to have a different sort of association?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not think so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's view there can be no preferential arrangements arrived at in the solution of the British application to enter the Common Market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether in view of his statement that Ireland is prepared to accept the defence implications of the Bonn Declaration he will state whether such commitments involve (a) the despatch of troops to areas at war, (b) the provision of bases for nuclear weapons, and (c) the provision of training facilities in this country for troops of those nations committed by the Bonn Declaration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probable, as I have stated on a number of occasions, that the instrument designed to give effect to the Bonn Declaration will provide for consultation and co-operation in the field of foreign policy, including defence.  That instrument is, however, still being negotiated.  It is thus not possible to give more precise indications at this stage of its content.  I may say, however, that there has been no suggestion in any press reports that the proposed instrument will involve any of the obligations suggested in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach whether the recent very important change at the United Nations in our attitude to nuclear bases has anything to do with the commitments which we feel we have to enter into?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if in view of the increasing loss of land through coast erosion, breaching of embankments, tidal flooding, etc., <Col N="638" /> and the practical impossibility of finding any Department of State to accept responsibility for it he will assign some Department to be responsible for coast erosion, tidal flooding, reclamation of land now covered by tidal waters, etc., and place funds at its disposal for the relief of this very urgent problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is having a Bill prepared which will set out the proposed financial and other arrangements dealing with coast erosion and he hopes to introduce the Bill in this House later this year.  It is intended that the Bill would assign certain duties in connection with coast erosion to the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>The Department of Lands is responsible for the maintenance of a limited number of embankments in respect of which the Land Commission administer trust funds for the upkeep of the embankments.</P>
      <P>The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, contains a provision which empowers the transfer to the Commissioners of Public Works of embankments constructed for the protection of lands purchased under the Land Purchase Acts or the subject of proceedings under those Acts.  In addition the Commissioners assume responsibility for embankments included in schemes executed under Part 2 of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  The total length of embankments for which the Commissioners are at present liable is approximately 200 miles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that it is the intention of the Government to introduce a Coast Erosion Bill later this year.  In the meantime, am I to take it that the people who have suffered such heavy losses will have to grin and bear them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, further to a reply of 22nd March on the subject of the Consumer Price Index, he will state at what date it is expected that the proposed national household budget inquiry will begin, at what date it will be <Col N="639" /> completed, and at what date any necessary subsequent adjustments to the Consumer Price Index will be made.</P>

      <P>It is intended to complete the preliminary arrangements for a household budget inquiry in time for the effective collection of data to start early in 1963. It will be necessary to arrange for the inquiry to cover a full 12-month period in order to eliminate any seasonality in expenditure patterns and it is hoped to have the revised weighting pattern for the Consumer Price Index available towards the end of 1964.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I have placed in the Library of the Oireachtas copies of the correspondence to which these four questions refer: that is, the Acting Secretary General's note P.O. 134 of 2nd January, 1962, and my reply thereto of the 7th March.  The relevant United Nations Resolutions are also to be found in the Library.</P>
      <P>It will be seen from a study of these documents that the Acting Secretary General's note was concerned with the Swedish resolution of the 4th December last for which we voted.  This resolution did not call upon States to enter into specific commitments.  It merely requested the Acting Secretary General to make two inquiries from all member States:</P>
      <P>(1) The conditions under which countries not possessing nuclear weapons might be willing to enter into undertakings to refrain from manufacturing or otherwise acquiring such weapons.</P>
      <P>(2)  The conditions under which they would refuse to receive in the future, nuclear weapons on their territories on behalf of any other country.</P>
      <P>In reply to the first inquiry I informed the Acting Secretary General on the 7th March that the Irish Government would be happy to subscribe to an international agreement containing provisions under which States not possessing nuclear weapons would undertake not to manufacture or otherwise acquire control of such weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="646" /> It will be noted that neither the Irish resolution on the Prevention of the Further Dissemination of Nuclear Weapons of the 5th December, 1961, nor any of the previous Irish resolutions on the subject, contemplated that an international agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons would be temporary.  All our resolutions and my speeches in support of them made it clear that what we sought was a general permanent international agreement and our reply to the Acting Secretary General makes it clear that the Irish Government are prepared to bind themselves permanently under such an agreement not to accept or acquire control of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>Our reply to the second enquiry of the Acting Secretary General was in conformity with the anti-dissemination resolutions we proposed in the United Nations in 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961. Each of these resolutions represented the maximum which we believed would be accepted in the gradually improving climate of opinion in favour of the proposals. If we had linked our proposals with a proposal to prevent nuclear States from equipping their troops with nuclear weapons wherever they might be, or their allies from admitting such troops to their territories no matter how gravely they felt themselves menaced, our resolution calling for an agreement against the spread of the ownership and control of nuclear weapons would not have been passed unanimously last year.  Indeed it would not have been passed at all.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that if there were a possibility of a general agreement with the necessary safeguards to confine nuclear weapons to the territories of the nuclear Powers, we would be most willing to accept it, but as there is firm opposition to this suggestion by many nuclear and non-nuclear States, it would, in our view, be most unwise to link it with negotiations for an agreement against the spread of nuclear weapons which is now accepted in principle by all members of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The replies which the Acting Secretary General has now received have <Col N="647" /> confirmed the belief we have held since 1958 that a number of States could be persuaded to bind themselves not to make or acquire control of nuclear weapons provided they were not compelled at the same time, in the absence of an effective system of international security, to bind themselves never under any circumstances to admit to their national territories their nuclear-equipped allied forces.</P>
    <P>I am more than ever convinced that proposals for de-nuclearising certain areas if they are to be successful must form part of an agreement accepted by a group of States and backed by the U.N. and the major Powers which will not only eliminate nuclear weapons but will also limit all weapons of mass destruction, exclude foreign troops and provide for the peaceful settlement of disputes, and the enforcement of the rule of law in the area concerned.</P>
    <P>Now that both the United States and the U.S.S.R. have incorporated the prevention of the further spread of nuclear weapons in their disarmament proposals we should, I believe, concentrate our efforts in promoting an international agreement on the matter. Such an agreement would reduce world tension and open the way for negotiations to eliminate nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction area by area throughout the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <P>Is it not a fact that the Irish delegates to the United Nations last November and December made it quite clear that any decision with regard to the dissemination or making of nuclear weapons would be temporary and voluntary and any decision would be binding only in a temporary and voluntary manner?

      <P>I have told the Deputy that all the documents in connection with our Resolutions in the past and the present Resolution, our reply to the Secretary General of the United Nations, and his letter to us, are in the Library.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate it is a very complicated issue, but surely that is a simple question of a very fundamental change in policy.  Did we at a certain stage say we did not wish to contemplate the acceptance of nuclear weapons and nuclear bases?  Is it the <Col N="649" /> position now that we may, in certain circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We never said any such thing.  What we did say was that we could not ask those countries depending for their security on their nuclear-equipped allies to throw out those allies in the present state of the world.  However, that is a side issue.  The main issue is that all the members of the United Nations have agreed that an agreement should be negotiated which would prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, which would prohibit the giving of nuclear weapons, or information as to how to make them, by nuclear Powers to non-nuclear powers, and which would prohibit the acceptance of nuclear weapons by non-nuclear Powers.  That is one principle upon which everybody is agreed.  For my part, I do not want to get it mixed up with the de-nuclearised zone idea because that idea is very violently opposed by a number of people and by a number of States prepared to accept the terms of the Resolution we got passed.  It is important for the world that we should concentrate on that now, particularly since the United States and the Soviet Union have accepted it as part of their disarmament policy.</P>

      <P>The differentiation made by the Deputy at (1) in his question regarding experiments for the purposes of (a) research and (b) medical investigations is not understood, as the two classifications mentioned are not mutually exclusive.  With regard to (3) of the question, up to October last there was one inspector formally appointed under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, engaged on this work who had the assistance of medical inspectors of my Department as occasion arose.  As from that time, the work has been assigned to medical inspectors of my Department.</P>
      <P>The compilation of information on the lines of that requested at (2) has been put in hands and if the Deputy will repeat that part of the question a few weeks hence I hope to be able to furnish the information requested, subject to the qualification mentioned in regard to part (1) of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Casey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if in view of the hardships being suffered by recipients of infectious diseases allowances and recipients of disabled persons (maintenance)  allowances as a result of the increase in the cost of living he will take such steps as are necessary to increase these allowances at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in replies to recent questions, the rates of allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1952, which, in addition to a personal allowance include provision for rent and domestic help allowances in appropriate cases, still compare very favourably with rates of other social welfare payments and I do not feel that I would be justified in present circumstances in proposing any general increase.</P>
      <P>The maximum rate of allowance under the Disabled Persons (Maintenance Allowances) Regulations was increased to £1 2s. 6d. a week on 1st January, 1961.  Expenditure on these allowances has been running at a high level in recent years and is now over £700,000 per annum, and I regret that I am not at present prepared again to consider any variation in the scale of allowances which would have the effect of increasing this charge on public funds.  Where, in a particular case, an allowance is considered insufficient, application may be made to the public assistance authority for a home assistance allowance and the Regulations provide that income from public assistance shall be disregarded in determining the amount of disablement allowance.</P>

    <P>NOTE.&mdash;The fund would be actuarially insolvent on the basis of equal contributions by C.I.E. and the members. It is necessary for C.I.E. to keep the fund solvent and the amounts which C.I.E. must contribute for that purpose are determined by actuarial investigations at 5 year intervals.  In the 5 years ended 31st December, 1961, the Board was required to contribute a total of £1,152,500 to the fund whereas the total amount of the employees' contributions in the same period was £445,676.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose <Col N="669" /> to take Questions Nos. 45, 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>The information given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance arose from inquiries I caused to be made into a specific claim by a correspondent of his that there was a degree of congestion at certain North European Ports which might warrant the development of a trans-shipment port on the Shannon Estuary.  The information was contained in a letter addressed by me to the Parliamentary Secretary and was compiled in the ordinary course of my Department's work, being based on an examination already made in my Department supplemented by local enquiries which our Ambassador at the Hague was asked to make.  No cost was incurred.</P>
      <P>The prospects of oil being transshipped at Shannon Estuary were explored some years ago and the results were given to the Dáil by the Taoiseach, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, on 18th June, 1958 (Cols. 311-313 of the Official Debates).  There has been no change since of which I am aware, which would affect the prospects for oil.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the proposals of the Shannon Estuary Co. Ltd. and Government action thereon I would refer Deputies to the very full reply given by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 19th July 1961. It is not the practice to publish the reports made to Ministers by Inter-Departmental Committees, especially when, as in this case, they deal with the affairs of a private company.</P>

      <P>Irish Shipping Ltd., as a member of the North Atlantic West-bound Freight Association, has been called upon to produce certain documents wherever located in pursuance of an enquiry by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission concerning payment of commissions to forwarding agents and charges for forwarding services in respect of shipments from ports in this country and Great Britain to certain United States Atlantic coast ports.</P>
      <P>I have informed Irish Shipping Ltd. that, in so far as the documents concerned relate to activities of the Company outside United States territory, I could not accept that the jurisdiction of the United States Federal Maritime Commission applies and that I could not therefore approve of compliance with the Commission's request in respect of such documents.</P>
      <P>I have asked the Minister for External Affairs to make representations through our Embassy in Washington to the U.S. State Department with a view to securing a withdrawal of the demands of the Federal Maritime Commission relating to the production of documents by Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>

      <P>(1)  The population of Dublin County Borough in 1930 on the basis of the 1926 census of population was 404,094*.</P>
      <P>(2)  The population of the County Borough as ascertained by the 1961 census was 535,488.</P>
      <P>(3)  At 31st March, 1930, there were 5,918 Corporation tenants, including 3,084 tenants who were purchasing their houses from the Corporation.</P>
      <P>(4)  At 31st March, 1961, there were 40,638 Corporation tenants, 3,337 of whom were purchasing their houses from the Corporation.</P>
      <P>The information requested at (5) and (6) is not available.</P>
      <P>(7)  The wages of labourers employed by Dublin Corporation in 1930 ranged from 59/- to 64/- per week.</P>
      <P>(8)  The present rates of wages are 195/6 per week for casual employees and 203/- per week for pensionable employees with an additional 2/6d. per week after 20 years' pensionable service.</P>
      <P>(9)  The grades which corresponded to the present clerical officer grade were Clerk Class C and Clerk Class B and the salary scales for these grades in 1930 were £99 to £244 per annum and £144 to £313 per annum respectively.</P>
      <P>(10)  The present salary scale for clerical officers is £350 × £25&mdash;£550 × £30&mdash;£850 per annum.</P>
      <P>* This figure is in respect of the population of Dublin County Borough as extended by the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930. The area of the County Borough was substantially increased between 1930 and 1961 as a result of boundary extensions in 1942 and 1953.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of what I want to say in regard to this Bill I have already said but I want to add a word of complaint.  When the Official Secrets Bill was laid before the House, it was accompanied by a White Paper. The White Paper indicated on its face that the Bill is to be regarded substantially as a codifying Bill.  That fact, I think, should have placed a very special obligation on the White Paper to direct the attention of Deputies to those parts of the Bill which go beyond the actual operation of codification, <Col N="689" /> with special reference to subsection (3) of Section 2, which, I think, introduces an entirely new principle and which, as the Minister now sees, has attracted substantial criticism from all sides of the House.  I direct his attention to the fact that the White Paper simply refers to that part of the Bill which contains that objectionable subsection in the following words:</P>
      <P>Part I containes the definitions and provides for the repeal of the 1911 and 1920 Acts.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that it was a serious oversight not to mention that fact in the White Paper dealing with the Bill which is now before the House.</P>
      <P>I do not want to recapitulate what I said last night but I want to conclude my observations by saying I think it is a mistake to suggest in the discussion of this Bill that its effects are much wider than they, in fact, are because by so doing, one can obscure the important and relevant matters which require attention.  I do not see in this Bill any elaborate plot to undermine the liberties of the people.  I may say that it is substantially a codifying Bill.  Last night I made some reservations in respect of Section 10 and in respect of the section which deals with persons and contractual relations with the Government.  I urged on the Minister that subsection (3) of Section 2 should be dropped as I consider it to be peculiarly offensive and unnecessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points have been made in the course of the debate with which I do not propose to deal because they are essentially committee points and we can have a fuller and freer discussion on them when we come to the Committee Stage.  I would hope, therefore, that Deputies will understand if I do not mention particular points they made.  It does not mean I am ignoring those points but merely that, having regard to the fact that it is inevitable they will arise again on the Committee Stage, I am leaving them for discussion then.  In the meantime I shall have them examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with Deputy <Col N="690" /> O'Higgins's query as to the necessity for the Bill.  There is a clear case for introducing it.  It is desirable that so far as possible our law should be contained in modern statutes passed by the Oireachtas and it should be our ultimate aim to get ourselves into a position where that would apply to all our statute law.</P>
    <P>With regard to this measure, Deputies will realise that our law on this subject is contained in two Acts of the British Parliament, the 1911 and 1920 Acts.  Apart from the undesirability of having our law contained in British statutes, there is the fact that the provisions of these Acts are not appropriate to our time and circumstances, though they were probably completely appropriate and suitable to the British Empire of 1911 and even to that Empire in 1920.  As I indicated in my opening remarks, that was borne out here during the War when the Government of the time found that they had to invoke the Emergency Powers Act and make Emergency Powers Orders to cater for these very matters, simply because the existing statutory machinery was inadequate and inappropriate.</P>
    <P>I must apologise to the House and to Deputy Dillon in particular for the fact that the explanatory memorandum did not refer specifically to subsection (3) of Section 2.  One of the most endearing characteristics of this House is its unexpectedness.  There is no reason why this particular provision should excite a great deal of argument or comment.  It seemed to me in putting it into the Bill to be a perfectly normal piece of machinery which was necessary to facilitate the working of the Act.</P>
    <P>The background is that in proceedings for the unauthorised disclosure of official information which did not happen to be expressed to be confidential, the prosecution might be placed in an extremely difficult position without having such a provision.  The public interest would be prejudiced if the information were disclosed but, if the accused denied that the information was confidential, the prosecution would have to disclose it in court.  That would be an impossible situation, especially where the safety of the State would be <Col N="691" /> involved, and this provision is in the Bill to meet such an eventuality.  However, I must take note of the strong views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition and I shall look into the matter and see whether the objective could be achieved in some other way. I cannot at the moment see that it can but I shall take note of all that has been said here in regard to the provision. I again apologise to the House for the fact that the explanatory memorandum was drawn up on the basis of my approach to the Bill which at that time did not regard this provision as likely to lead to the amount of discussion it has led to.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the Leader of the Opposition on what he has said about Deputy Dr. Browne's contribution.  I think the Deputy was tilting at windmills and that the Bill is a comparatively straightforward piece of legislation to meet this particular situation. There is nothing sinister in it.  Deputy Dillon has dealt with the arguments put forward by Deputy Dr. Browne more cogently than I could.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan made a number of points in regard to the Bill but I feel that they are Committee Stage points and that we will come back to them on that Stage.  He did mention the whole background of the Bill on the question of privilege.  I want to remind the House in regard to subsection (3) of Section 2 of the nature of that background and of the fact that the courts have imposed on themselves a sort of voluntary discipline with regard to Government documents and Government information. The legal position still is that if a Minister of State indicates that a document is privileged and that it is not in the public interest to disclose it, the courts will accept such a statement from the Minister.  We are not doing very much more than that in subsection (3) of Section 2.</P>
    <P>There has been a fair amount of discussion on Section 10 and there seems to be some misapprehension about it.  I want to make it clear that the provisions of Section 10 do not create an offence themselves but provide evidence that acts constituting offences under Section 9 were done in <Col N="692" /> a manner prejudicial to the safety or preservation of the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin raised the question of private detectives and I see by the Order Paper that he will be at me about this matter at Question Time to-morrow.  I propose to leave it over until then except to say that I do not regard this Bill as being appropriate in any way to control or exercise any function in relation to this type of organisation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully made a point with regard to Section 8 about a person being innocently in possession of a forged birth certificate.  I feel that there may be something in that point and I will look at it between now and the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins and Deputy Tully mentioned Section 12 and the mandatory nature of a case being heard <i>in camera</i>.  I want to point out in that regard that the provisions of Section 12 only apply to contraventions of Section 9.  It is important to bear that in mind&mdash;that the safety or preservation of the State is involved.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the Bill covers matters which are not really related and that it is absurd to include in a Bill dealing with matters concerning the security of the State the question of the leakage of examination papers.  I am not sure that that is a valid criticism.  We are dealing with the disclosure of official information whether it is of serious or of comparatively trivial importance and I think it is appropriate and desirable to include all matters dealing with the disclosure of official information in one Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not think anything is lost by putting comparatively minor matters into a Bill which also deals with very serious matters&mdash;that happens all the time in our legislation&mdash;but we did, at least, divide the Bill into Parts, and matters of varying degrees of importance are dealt with in the separate Parts of the Bill.  The safety and preservation of the State provisions are contained in Part III.  The question of disclosures by printing contractors, leakage of confidential reports by civil servants&mdash;all that type of information&mdash;is dealt with in Part <Col N="693" /> II.  Part IV deals with the various supplementary and legal provisions.  I think it is perfectly justifiable and legitimate to include these matters in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, Deputies made a number of points and raised a number of queries, particularly with regard to Sections 4 and 5.  I shall not deal with them now.  I shall be returning to them when we come to the Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of the Bill is to increase the salaries of members of the judiciary, and the new rates proposed are set out in section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Judicial salaries were last increased in 1959, and this measure has been rendered necessary by changes in the circumstances affecting judges' salaries which have taken place since that time.  It seems appropriate that these proposals, which have regard among other things to what is known as the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo; of salary increases should be considered now, on the virtual conclusion of the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo;, rather than be left in abeyance until some later time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as remuneration is concerned, the position of the various branches of the judiciary in relation to other sections of the community may be said to have been determined by the <Col N="694" /> Dáil Select Committee on Judicial Salaries, Expenses Allowances and Pensions, which reported to this House on 24th April, 1953.  This Committee consisted of twelve Deputies, and examined the question of judicial remuneration in all its aspects.  Comprehensive memoranda were submitted to the Select Committee by the various branches of the judiciary.  The recommendations of the Committee, which were unanimous, were that the salaries of District Justices and of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court should be increased by £450; and that the salaries of the President of the Circuit Court and of judges of the Supreme and High Courts should be increased by £250.  The new rates thus recommended were accepted by the Government and were made effective by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953.</P>
    <P>The pattern of judicial remuneration having been provided by the Select Committee, the Government have since 1953 confined their review of judicial remuneration to ensuring in a general way that the pattern is maintained, and that the relationship with other groups in public employment, which secured the seal of approval of the Select Committee in 1953, is substantially maintained. Thus, when by 1959, it became apparent that by reason of increases secured by others since 1953, the judiciary had fallen behind in the matter of pay, the Government sponsored a flat increase for all branches of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>Similarly, increases secured since 1959 by other sections of those in public employment make it now necessary to propose further increases for the judiciary, and the Government, having reviewed the changes in the interval, are satisfied that the new rates are fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>In proposing these increases, I realise that some Deputies, and some sections of the press, may be tempted to suggest that the rates of salary for judges are already high and that the money involved in providing the present increases could be spent to better effect for the benefit of other sections of the community.  I would therefore ask that the question be approached <Col N="695" /> with a sense of fair play, and with an appreciation of the facts.  Let me point out that, of the 57 judicial persons concerned with this Bill, 52 have salaries which do not exceed those paid to the holders of the highest posts in the Civil Service.  These holders of the highest posts to which I have referred have secured, or will shortly secure, the benefits of the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo; increases.  It is little more than a month (21 February, 1962) since the Minister for Finance moved a Supplementary Estimate of £600,000 for Increases in Civil Service Remuneration, and there was no opposition in this House to that proposal.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to remind Deputies that in his speech on the Vote on Account on 7th March, 1962, the Minister for Finance said that pay increases account altogether for £5.24 million of the additional expenditure in the coming year, and he gave the break-down as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>As I said, the heads of the Civil Service have salaries comparable to the salaries of 90 per cent of the judiciary and have benefited from salary increases corresponding generally to those now proposed for the judiciary. Nobody has suggested that salary increases should not be extended to the heads of the other public services, and, accordingly, it seems unfair to focus the spotlight of criticism specially on the judiciary who happen to be particularly vulnerable for the reason that their salaries cannot be raised except by special Act of the Oireachtas.  By comparison with the other figures I have quoted&mdash;£2.5 million, and so on&mdash; the £21,000 which is the annual cost of the present proposals in relation to judges' salaries should, I suggest, be viewed with a proper sense of proportion. I hope that this debate will be conducted with restraint and a sense of decorum.  It is very necessary that both the persons of the judiciary and their <Col N="696" /> functions should be treated with respect. The judiciary's independence of the executive is provided for in the Constitution and is a valued safeguard in a democratic state.</P>
    <P>The new rates proposed in the Bill have been formulated on the basis of providing, roughly, increases of the order of 15 per cent for justices of the District Court and for ordinary judges of the Circuit Court, and increases of about 12½ per cent for other members of the judiciary.  I must emphasise that the percentages I have mentioned were adopted by the Government only as a very general indication of what would be an appropriate improvement.  The sums arrived at on the basis of the percentage increases I have quoted have been rounded by the Government, upwards in some cases and downwards in other cases, so as to provide new rates which seem to the Government to be equitable, not only as between the judiciary as a body and the general public, but also as between the various categories and judge and justice. Actually the new rates involve increases varying from almost 17 per cent to 11 per cent.  It seems necessary to emphasise what the proposed percentages are as it has been stated erroneously in some quarters that the Bill, if passed, will give judges' increases from 23 per cent to 29 per cent.</P>
    <P>If the percentage increases involved in the present Bill were related solely to the eighth round increases granted elsewhere, some of them at least would be open to criticism.  It is scarcely necessary for me to mention that members of the judiciary have not got anything like eight rounds of salary increases since the end of the Emergency. Indeed&mdash;I want to emphasise this point&mdash;their salaries have only been increased on three occasions since they were originally fixed in 1924. Since 1959 there has, apart from the eighth round, been a modest upward adjustment of the salaries of the more highly paid sectors of other public employment. This adjustment was based on a revaluation of work, and was related to increases obtained on the same basis prior to 1959 by the lower grades.</P>
    <P>In considering, therefore, what the new salaries of members of the <Col N="697" /> judiciary should be, the Government have felt that without carrying out any formal revaluation of the work of the judiciary, there is scope on this occasion for increases which in some cases exceed to a moderate extent the improvements which would arise solely from the eighth round.  In considering this matter, the Government has not lost sight of the fact that since 1959 schemes of reorganisation of the Circuit Court and the District Court have been brought into operation with resultant economy.  The new rates proposed represent, therefore, the Government's considered view of the extent to which, in all the prevailing circumstances, judicial salaries should be soon revised.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have observed that the Bill proposes to make the 1st November, 1961, the effective date for the payment of the improved salaries. That date has emerged as the effective date for salary adjustments generally in other sectors of public employment, and it seems only fair to extend to the judiciary a similar degree of retrospection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this Bill.  In stating our attitude, I should like to make it quite clear, however, that I second the Minister's recommendation to the House, and I believe it is an important one, that we should discuss the question of judges' salaries in a spirit of fair play and in an atmosphere of restraint and decorum.  I should like to say to the Minister I do not know of any reason why we should not do so.  I hope that is the spirit in which the House will approach this matter.  Certainly the opposition from these benches to this measure is not actuated by any spirit of antagonism to the judiciary or any members of it.  We recognise very fully the important part the judiciary play in the institutions of this State and further their role in those institutions. We believe, however, that it is inappropriate that the Minister should within 24 months of having given very substantial increases to the judiciary come back to the House with these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should appreciate what the House is being asked to do.  The last occasion on which the salaries of the <Col N="698" /> judiciary were raised was in October or November, 1959.  This Bill, under Section 1, when it is passed, is to become operative from November, 1961.  That is a period of very nearly exactly two years from the time the last increases came into operation and the time these proposals are to come into operation.  In that period of two years, the House is being asked to sanction an increase for the Chief Justice, the holder of the principal post in the judiciary, of £1,150, over the pre-1959 figure.  We are being asked to sanction increases for judges of the Supreme Court over the pre-1959 figure of £800.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy putting the two together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the position before the increase of 1959.  I think I am correct in saying that, prior to 1959, the salary of the Chief Justice was £4,850.  In 1959, that was increased to a figure of £5,335.  We are now being asked to increase it to £6,000.  My calculation at any rate is that over and above the figure which obtained prior to the 1959 Act, we are being asked to sanction an increase which totals £1,150.  Similarly, for ordinary circuit court judges, an increase of £800, for the President of the High Court, £800, and for other High Court judges, £750.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be misunderstood in this.  I am putting the two together and I am dealing in my total figures with the position which obtained prior to the last increase.  The point I am making is that, inside of two years, that is the total increase the Minister is asking the House to give.  The increase on the 1959 Act in the case of the Chief Justice is £665; in the case of judges of the Supreme Court and the President of the High Court it is £430; and for other High Court judges, it is £425.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We consider that having regard to the fact that substantial increases were given in 1959, this Bill is inadvisable. We believe that by many people throughout the country it will be regarded as inexplicable.  It is right to remind the House that on the occasion on which the House was asked to consider the question of judges' salaries last, that is, under the 1959 Bill, the <Col N="699" /> then Minister for Justice, who introduced the measure, made it clear that his view, and presumably the view of the Government at the time, was that judges' salaries would not be raised according as the cost of living increased in the same way as salaries of other members of the public service.  At column 538 of the Dáil Debates of 29th October, 1959, when speaking on the Courts of Justice Bill, 1959, the then Minister for Justice said:</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, judges' salaries are fixed on a long term basis and are not revised, to cover changes in the cost of living, with the same frequency as occurs in the case of persons engaged in other branches of the public service or in outside employment generally.</P>
    <P>Then he went on, as the Minister did today, to mention the occasions prior to that on which increases were given.</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>In fact, since the salaries of the majority of judges were first fixed in 1924, adjustments have been made on only two occasions&mdash;in 1947 and 1953.</P>
    <P>The pattern as far as judges' salaries are concerned is that at roughly six year intervals increases were granted. An increase was granted in 1947; six years later, in 1953, another increase was granted; and again, six years after that, in 1959, after a careful review and study by the Government, another increase was granted.</P>
    <P>The Minister who introduced the measure in 1959, to my mind, took very great pains to make the House aware of the fact that the matter had been under very long and careful consideration by the Government and that the step the Government decided to take then in introducing the measure to increase judicial salaries was taken only after a review lasting something like two years and at the request of the judiciary.  I endeavoured to follow the Minister fully in his opening statement but he did not make it clear to me that as far as the top grade people in the judiciary are concerned, this measure is at their <Col N="700" /> request or that they have come to him or to his immediate predecessor and sought increases.  Apparently that was not the position last time.  Requests were made by the judiciary, I understand, in 1957 and after two years of examination, deliberation and discussing it among themselves, the Government decided on a flat increase of 10 per cent. and introduced the 1959 Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not convinced me that the same circumstances as existed then exist now and he seems to me to be going back on what I do not like to call an assurance but a very emphatic statement by his predecessor that judges' salaries were fixed on a long-term basis.  No one can consider this measure, being brought in 24 months after that statement by the Minister's predecessor, as anything long-term.  No one can say that the salaries fixed under the 1959 Act are in fact being treated as having been fixed on a long-term basis when the Minister comes in now with this legislation.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible that a strong case could be made for some type of an independent examination of the position&mdash;for examination of the district justices following the revision of the work which they have to do and the adjustments of the district court districts to which the Minister has referred.  Talking for myself, I do not think I would recommend any opposition to an independent examination of their position, if the Minister had approached the matter on that basis.</P>
    <P>It might have been a better basis on which to approach this Act rather than that it should be simply thrown at the House by the Minister without any prior consultation or discussion which would ensure the type of consideration of the measure which the Minister wants to get and which I hope the House will give it&mdash;to use the Minister's own expression, to deal with it in a sense of fair play, to discuss it with restraint and decorum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes for judges and justices increases ranging from £325 to £665 per annum and there is a further proposal that these <Col N="701" /> increases be made retrospective to 1st November last.  I have no doubt that the members of the Government Party will once again use the subterfuge of accusing the Opposition of trying to make political capital out of this.  The Minister has nodded his head already. That suggestion of the Opposition making political capital out of debates such as this just does not go down any more.  When the Singer case was being debated here, the first defence of the Government spokesmen was that the Opposition were trying to make political capital out of it.  It seems that the only reply by the Government to any debate of this kind is that we have no argument, that we are merely trying to make political capital.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants to interpret it that way, he is quite entitled to it.  He suggests we may not behave ourselves so well in this debate and, in a school-masterly fashion, says he hopes the debate will be conducted with restraint and a sense of decorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>So I have a licence to speak as I feel.  It is not clear whether the Minister wants to justify his proposals by relating them to the cost of living as the previous Minister for Justice, the former Deputy Traynor, did when he introduced his proposals in 1959.  Nor is it clear whether or not the arguments to be advanced on this occasion are the arguments that seemed to be advanced by the Taoiseach when he spoke in support of the proposals for increases introduced on 29th October, 1959.  On that occasion, as reported at column 561 of the Official Report, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any democratic society, judges occupy, and should be seen clearly by the public to occupy, positions of high authority, of independence and detachment.  Independence in the sense that we use that term in relation to judges means something more than freedom from improper Government influence.  It means putting them into a position in which <Col N="702" /> they will be, as far as possible, immune from improper influence of any kind, and it is no exaggeration to say, in my view, that an adequate and indeed a generous basis of remuneration for judges is the basis for their independence.  It has always been so regarded here.  It is, indeed, so regarded everywhere.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must approach the matter in this way if we are to follow the Taoiseach's line: what price are we here to put on integrity; in short, what price should we determine in the case of judges and justices, be they High Court or Supreme Court Judges, what salary is suggested as being sufficient to maintain that integrity which the Taoiseach says every man who sits on the Bench should have?</P>
    <P>It is proposed in this measure to give the Chief Justice a salary of £6,000 per year.  Are we not being a bit inconsistent when we suggest that both the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Finance should get substantially lower salaries?  I am not telling the Minister for Justice that he and the Minister for Finance are not being paid enough&mdash;in fact, I think their salaries are adequate&mdash;but it is a fantastic proposal that in the name of integrity and so as to prevent him from accepting bribes as is implicit in the Taoiseach's statement, and in the name of putting him into an independent position, we should give the Chief Justice £6,000 a year.  The Minister for Finance has many more far-reaching decisions to make and will certainly have decisions which could have a great impact on every citizen when he announces his Budget proposals here on 10th April next.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach says:</P>
    <P>In any democratic society, Judges occupy, and should be seen clearly by the public to occupy, positions of high authority...</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be unfair to say that in any democratic State pensioners should be seen to live in accordance with our concept of a democratic way of life.  That will always be described as hitting below the belt in a debate of this kind but we must have regard to the feelings of <Col N="703" /> the people, and there is no point in pleading that these proposals are in respect of only 40 or 50 people and that the total bill for the year will amount to about £25,000.</P>
    <P>We have the Taoiseach lecturing the workers with regard to the eighth round increase in wages which they applied for and secured, and talking about the effect it would have on prices and on the agricultural community. Those pensioners were not members of trade unions and could not secure any increases.  What effect does the Minister think these proposals will have on pensioners in his constituency and on pensioners throughout the country?  What does the Taoiseach mean when he says the judiciary should be immune from improper influence?  It has been pleaded here that they have not been receiving salaries commensurate with their dignity and so on.  Is it therefore to be assumed that during the period when, as the Taoiseach says, they were underpaid, they were not immune from improper influences?  I am sure he did not mean that and I am sure there is nobody here who would suggest that those who sit on the Bench in this country are not of the highest honour and integrity.</P>
    <P>I do not think we should appear to put ourselves in a position where we, in turn, would appear to be paying them extra money, generous money, as the Taoiseach says, in order to dispense justice as they should, by reason of their appointments and their salaries.  The Taoiseach said their remuneration should be on a generous basis.  If we accept that for the judges, for the higher civil servants and for higher-paid people in the country, then, irrespective of the consequences, we should be prepared to accept it in respect of all our people.  I mean particularly those who are dependent on small pensions or on social assistance.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I was not here when the Minister spoke but I had time to glance through his speech.  I see a recurrence of the eighth round of wage increases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If salaries of judges and increases they might get should be related to the eighth round of wage increases, I think the Minister and the Government should begin to realise that while on this occasion the eighth round of wage increases was not meant to relate to the increase in the cost of living, it was a successful effort, to a large extent, to give the workers a good standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case, when the Minister relates it to the eighth round of salary increases, the eighth round of salary increases was directly related to the eighth round of wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the last occasion when this matter was being discussed, the then Minister for Justice said that because the cost of living had increased, it had an adverse effect on the way of life and standard of living of the judiciary <Col N="705" /> and therefore he proposed to give them a 10 per cent. increase, which he did. That increase was given from 1st January, 1959, and since then, according to Government figures, the increase in the cost of living index has been four points, or 2.72 per cent.  If anybody cares to make up the percentages now proposed, he will find they range from 10½ to 17.  Therefore, it cannot be argued that these proposed increases are in accordance with the increased cost of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <P>These increases in wages and salaries merely help to provide a decent standard of living for the workers.  There is a tremendous difference in a worker obtaining an increase as they did in the eighth round on a wage of £8 or £9&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister says his argument is that there is no comparison. I fully agree with that.  I do not think it can be argued that with the salaries they have at present, the judiciary could plead that they had low living standards.  Whether the Minister <Col N="706" /> agrees with that or not, it does not seem that one can have a very low living standard on £4,500 a year, or whatever the figure is now.  I know the proposed figure is £6,000.  It is proposed here that the Chief Justice should get a new salary of £6,000 a year.  At present he has a mere £5,335.</P>

      <P>The Minister says these unfortunate gentlemen have got only three increases since their salaries were fixed back in 1924 but he omitted to say that since 1953&mdash;eight short years ago&mdash;the Chief Justice, if we include the present proposal, will have obtained an increase of £1,150.  That is a sizeable increase.  With all due respects to the judiciary, their integrity, intelligence and qualifications, I do not think it is right, in view of the recent statement by the Taoiseach when he appeared to lecture the workers and to warn them about the haphazard ways in which the eighth round of wage increases was negotiated, that we should condone an increase of £1,150 to an office which eight years ago carried a salary of £4,850.  It is proposed in respect of the Supreme Court Judge that as compared to his salary in 1953 he should get an increase of £800 per annum and so on down to the Circuit Court Judge for whom it is proposed, with the two increases, that of 1959 and the one proposed under this Bill, that the increase should be £675 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody will agree that we should pay the judiciary well, that we should pay the Chief Justice, the Supreme Court Judges, the Circuit Court Judges and particularly the District Court Justices decent salaries, but it is out of all proportion to suggest that in respect of one of these gentlemen he should over a period of eight years have applied to him or to his position a salary increase of £1,150.  The present salaries from the District Court Justices upwards range from £38 per week to £107 per week for the Chief Justice.  I do not suggest that he should live on £10 per week, or £8 or £15. One wonders what in the present day that sort of money means, or does it <Col N="707" /> mean that it all goes back in income tax?</P>

The Taoiseach and the Government are admonishing this country as a whole that it should live in accordance with its means.  There is no point in telling us, as the Taoiseach did on the last occasion, how much they would be paid in Northern Ireland or Britain. According to what the Taoiseach himself always says, we should pay them in accordance with our ability to pay.</P>

      <P>The Minister will then leap out of that and say that this is a mere £20,000, and therefore it means that the more exclusive the group in this country the bigger the salaries they should have.  It is very bad example to those who were told last week that their case for an increase could not be put to conciliation and arbitration, their allowances could not be linked to the cost of living, and that they would have to wait over to the Budget.  The argument was made by the Minister for Finance last week in respect of office workers and civil servants in general that their wages were subject to agreement by conciliation and arbitration and that increases in respect of them were not a matter for the Budget, but in respect of pensions they could not be linked to the cost of living, they could not be subject to either conciliation or arbitration, but they should be left over to the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Suppose the Minister for Justice suggested now that these proposals be left over until the Budget, would not that be a very good gesture, to see whether or not the country could afford these colossal increases&mdash;for the Chief Justice from £5,335 to £6,000 per year. I suppose that on the 10th April when the Minister introduces his Budget if <Col N="708" /> he has any residue he may apply it to the old age pensioners and those dependent on social welfare and social assistance.</P>
    <P>I have said that the salaries of these gentlemen range from £38 to £107 per week.  The new proposals mean that their salaries will range from £45 per week for a District Justice to £120 per week for the Chief Justice.  I have a certain sympathy for the District Justices.  I do not think that anybody could argue that their salaries, which at the present time range between £1,900 and £2,000, are over paid, especially in view of the fact that their salaries in 1924 were in the region of £1,000, and as far as my Party are concerned they would be prepared to support some increases for those lower judges, but we think it is out of all proportion to what Government spokesmen have said and what the Taoiseach has said in recent months to apply such huge increases as these to some who have&mdash;I use the words deliberately&mdash;colossal salaries at the present time.</P>
    <P>It is often argued that if they were not on the Bench they would be earning twice as much in the courts.  I think that is cod, and with all due respect to the Governments who appoint them and to those gentlemen themselves, the plain fact is that they are on the Bench because they were useful to political Parties.  The Taoiseach has admitted that.  He did not say that in the same words as I am saying it now, that they were useful to political Parties, but he did on the last occasion refer to definite political appointments of members of the judiciary, and it is a well-known fact that those who presented themselves and canvassed for Party purposes but failed, or who have been T.D.s, have got the reward of being appointed to the Bench.  It is ridiculous to say in respect of the majority of them that they were earning twice those salaries when they were in practice in the Four Courts or wherever they operated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I want to say on behalf of the Labour Party that we are opposed to this Bill, though not opposed to the idea of increases for certain lower paid grades, particularly <Col N="709" /> those of the District Justice class, and we think it is fantastic that in a period of eight years when the Minister for Finance boasted that there has not been a great increase in the cost of living the Chief Justice of this country, or the Office of Chief Justice, should have applied to it an increase of £1,150 since 1953.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be very brief.  At the outset, I want to say that I for one stand for remunerating the judiciary at a level that will maintain their integrity, and that that integrity must be maintained at whatever price if the ordinary citizen is to have the justice and fair play he is entitled to in a democratic State such as ours.  I also want to say that I will adhere to the Minister's request during his opening speech that this debate should be carried on without recrimination or anything that would not be helpful.  But I cannot see for the life of me why it is proposed to give the Chief Justice a salary of £6,000&mdash;or £114 a week.  I think that is absolute nonsense.  We are not a wealthy country and we have no enormous mineral wealth we could exploit, we have no oil or anything of that kind that would allow us to give salaries even to the judiciary such as those proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the justices in the lower paid sections of the judiciary are concerned, I fully agree that they are deserving of some increases.  I know of some cases of hardship in the lower grades of the judiciary, but I cannot see why these enormous salaries are granted to the High and Supreme Court Judges.  The Government have lost their head.  Account should be taken of the fact that there are many people in this country who are not members of trade unions and who have not an effective weapon to demand increases in remuneration in one way or another.  There is a huge section of people&mdash;383,000 farmers and their families&mdash;who pay for everything in the country, including the cost of this Bill, and vast numbers of workers who are not joined in any union to protect their interests.  I may mention the 380,000 farmsteads out of which the people are being forced to flee simply because the Government <Col N="710" /> have made up their minds to keep the cost of living down by compelling the farmers to sell their produce at prices lower than the cost of production.  It is on their behalf that I raise my voice here.</P>
    <P>I was never one to begrudge a man proper remuneration for his brains or his brawn.  If a reasonable increase were proposed and a proper case made for it, I certainly would support it, but the Minister has not brought in a reasonable demand, and he has not supported it or attempted to support it beyond saying that there has been an eighth round increase.  In his opening speech, he gave absolutely no justification for this increase.</P>
    <P>I am opposing this measure, not because I disagree with paying the judiciary in a proper way, but because there is a vast number of people who are being forced to fly out of the country by a completely lopsided Government policy.  Too much is being given to too few, and the rest are regarded as the hewers of wood, drawers of water, and the quarriers of the gold for others, and there is no consideration for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time somebody said, contrary to what a number of members of the House seemed to think, that this is not the King's Inns Past Pupils' Union, or indeed an extension of the Solicitors' Debating Society.  This is Dáil Éireann. Accusations have been made with regard to the making of political capital, but what politician or what member of the House can claim not to have sinned in so far as making political capital is concerned?  Is it not part of our function to show up what we consider to be the deficiencies and inadequacies of those who oppose us?  If such efforts are to be termed the making of political capital, the only alternative is complete and utter silence&mdash;and silence gives consent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say very definitely&mdash;and I make no apologies whatsoever for saying it&mdash;that I think it is disgusting that the Government should make this proposal to improve the lot of people who, to my mind, are not doing too badly at all, at a time when the most helpless sections of the community are <Col N="711" /> feeling the brunt of economic hardship. I refer particularly to the old age pensioners who have to live on 30/- a week.  When we think of 30/-a week in contradistinction to a salary of £114 a week, what can we say except that a Government which propose to implement such a proposal at a time like this have a death wish and are seeking their own destruction. Not only is there to be an increase but there is to be retrospection as well.  It is not sufficient to give £20 a week but they say: &ldquo;let it go back to November&rdquo;.  How hard it is for an old age pensioner to get a few weeks' retrospection!</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Corish has said about the fallacy of the colossal alternative earnings which are allegedly available to the legal luminaries. He also put his finger on a very good point with regard to the suggestion that we must purchase integrity. It is common knowledge that when vacancies occur on the Bench at any level, they are chased assiduously by the Party followers of every Party and that, contrary to the Government finding it difficult to fill vacancies when they arise, the problem that besets them is to determine which person of the many who apply they will put into the position.  It is not a question even of purchasing ability. From my own slight brushes with the law it seems to me that there are numerous people walking the corridors of the Four Courts who could discharge the not too onerous duties equally as well as anyone else.</P>
    <P>I should say that of course the district justices seem to me to have an entirely separate case from the case of the judges of the higher courts. The district justices perform a very difficult job.  As one who has had an opportunity of observing it in action, I can say that the district court has to deal probably with every aspect of legislation, from charges related to unlighted bicycles to capital charges. To my mind, the district justices have to work pretty hard and there may very well be a case&mdash;there probably is a case&mdash;why they should be given an increase to help them to live more easily.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> Surely no one can suggest that a salary of £5,300 is inadequate and must be increased by another £800? I do not see the logic of that.  As I say, the Government seem anxious to commit political <i>felo de se</i>.  That is indicated in their recent actions and speeches.  Also, their prognostications as to what the future holds would seem to bear out that idea.</P>
    <P>This proposal, to my mind, is no more than a gesture which was referred to very aptly in a different context in the editorial of this morning's <i>Irish Times,</i> the last sentence of which reads: &ldquo;The hungry sheep look up and <i>must</i> be fed.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Deputies have pointed out, this is a sugarcoated pill for some of us in so far as there is a certain justification for some of the proposals in the Bill.  While accepting that there is some need for an increase in the remuneration of the lower echelons of the judiciary, I do not think we can be too easily fooled into supporting the suggestion that some people in our society because they are living on £5,000 a year are feeling the pinch and are so hard up that we must increase their salaries.</P>
      <P>The Minister makes no justification whatsoever for his proposals, particularly in relation to the increases for the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Supreme Court Judges and the High Court Judges.  As for the circuit court judges, there is obviously a shading off between their needs and requirements and what it is desirable to pay.  One feature of the Government's activities over the years has been their insistence on establishing without question a case for any increase put forward and their reluctance when a case is established to accept it.  We have had experience of their behaviour, and indeed of the Minister's behaviour, when members of the Garda attempted to point out to the Minister that there was a serious need for an increase in their pay.  We all know the summary way in which the Minister dismissed those claims and, indeed, some of the men who made them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>They did, after a short struggle which they won.  The Minister asks us here, as Deputy Dunne suggested, as if he were talking to some schoolboys' debating society, to see that this debate is conducted with a sense of restraint and a sense of decorum.  This sort of supercilious lecturing by the Minister is completely unnecessary if the Minister did not have a guilty conscience about the proposals which he has put forward here.</P>
      <P>All of the salary increases to which the Minister referred were justified before arbitration machinery or the Labour Court or by union activity and justified on the plea that there had been an increase in the cost of living and that it was desirable to improve the standard of living of the average salary and wage earner.  No case can be made at all by any honest person of any standing that these people on £4,000 or £5,000 a year or more are feeling the pinch or that they are in need of added or increased remuneration, that they are finding it difficult to pay their bus fares or their food bills, or to clothe themselves and their children&mdash;most of whom are grown up&mdash;or pay school bills, or pay for school books or that they are trying to afford a holiday, or on any of the usual grounds put forward to justify a demand for increased remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that when one cannot justify it on those grounds, some other valid grounds could be advanced by the Minister and they have not been so advanced.  He has not attempted or dared to suggest, and I hope he will not, that we should try to put the salaries of these people on a par with the salaries paid outside the country because he would then leave himself open to the establishment of that principle in relation to every other section of our society.  One of the oddest arguments I have heard advanced is the suggestion that in order to maintain the <Col N="714" /> integrity of the judiciary, it is necessary to pay them particularly well.  I am not in favour of underpaying anyone and equally I am not in favour of overpaying anyone.  That is the main objection we must have to this Bill, certainly in relation to the parts which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests that we should try to retain a sense of fairplay. I am prepared to accept a sense of fairplay about the Supreme Court or the President of the High Court, or whoever it may be, if the Minister will have a sense of fairplay about other sections of the community, the people whom he and his colleagues have repeatedly said they cannot afford to help more than they are helping at the moment.  I mean of course the pensioners, whether they are the Civil Service pensioners we were talking about a week ago, or old age pensioners, or widows, or the people on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  All these people are people about whom the Minister does not appear to be greatly concerned. What about a sense of fair play for these people?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not know as well as I know that there are people in the country who are starving to death on 30/- a week, suffering from advanced gross malnutrition, who go to bed hungry every night, who are not able to clothe themselves properly, who often find themselves without fuel or light.  I know this from my own experience. I have seen these people lying in beds in unheated and unlighted rooms, in bed from 4 o'clock or 5 o'clock in the afternoon, all night, until the following day, because, I suggest to the Minister, a sense of fair play does not operate for them.  The Minister, however, is suggesting that we should remember our sense of fairplay where people are paid £4,000, £5,000 or £6,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I suspect that these people are well able to look after themselves.  I would plead with the Minister, as a member of the younger generation who should know and understand and appreciate these problems as well as the rest, that he should ask the Government to consider the position of these people, to <Col N="715" /> establish a new order of priorities and to leave the well-off as they are and try to do something about the many under-privileged already in our society.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the suggestion that one can be sure of getting a high quality judge only if one pays him this extravagant salary.  That is contrary to my experience.  As some other Deputy mentioned, as far as we are all aware, once there is a vacancy on the Bench, it is the multiplicity of candidates that bedevils the situation and not the scarcity.  Even then, there might be something to be said for high salaries because I accept that the judiciary have a very special position in our society and I have no wish to attack or to criticise them as individuals. I am merely suggesting that there is a priority and that they are fairly low in the order of priority at present.  But to suggest that one has to pay very high salaries in order to keep the standard of integrity, the quality of the members of the judiciary, is not, as all of us know, in accordance with the facts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the quality of the appointee were the highest consideration, then I think there would be a good case for making salaries particularly attractive, but we all know of our own experience that, at a certain phase of government, the appointees to the Bench are members of the Government Party, whether Fianna Fáil on one side, or Fine Gael, on the other. This necessarily means that people are appointed for their political loyalties and not necessarily for their legal ability.  That is not to say that there are not judges on the Bench who are very high quality lawyers.</P>
      <P>The general principle is still true that the Government do not wish to make these salaries for the exclusive purpose of ensuring they will be the highest qualified appointed on the Bench.  That is one of the least qualifications, the most important being the political loyalty of the appointee.  Therefore, I do not think it would be justified on that score.  I can well accept the Minister's assurance that there is a barrister acting in the courts who would not bother to take a Supreme Court judgeship.</P>

However, there are figures in excess of that which are exorbitant, extravagant and immoral. I do not pretend to be an authority on morality: I do not wish to deal with any further.</P>
      <P>I have a great sympathy for the district justices.  I think that if there is a case for an increase for any of the judiciary it can be made in relation to the district justices.  The summary court is about the only court, I think, the ordinary people can afford to go to as far as they want to go to law.  It does a good job.  It is simple, honourable, and has a high standard of integrity, on the whole.  It has, I think, reasonable standards of judgments, courtesy and humanity.  They are courts of which we can well be proud.  Their turnover of work is very considerable.  I think they well earn their salaries.  I would not be against giving these hard-working men some increase in their salaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems that we have tried to elevate the High Court and the <Col N="719" /> Supreme Court members of the judiciary into sorts of deities in which we surround them with idolatry, pomp, panoply and ceremony.  Part of it is this attempt by the Minister to remove these people from ordinary assessments, to put them above ordinary judgments and to set them apart from all the rest of us.  The attitude is that these are people who are not to be judged by the ordinary standards of whether they can afford to pay for the necessaries of living.  It is about time we stopped to consider the position. I would have hoped that a young Minister would take an opportunity of pointing out to the judiciary that there is too much of bells, bows, buttons, wigs and gowns.</P>

      <P>Other countries succeed in seeing that justice is meted out without all that sort of nonsense&mdash;&mdash; France, to a certain extent and certainly America does.

To ask why they are getting this money, if they made representations, if any arbitration occurred, who sat on it, if the Labour Court intervened, what case they made, and so on, is out of the question.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough.  We make progress, but slowly.  The trouble is that there is a record in this House of Governmental behaviour in relation to increases in salaries and wages, which makes this whole proposal outrageously irresponsible.  Only seven or eight months ago, we found ourselves debating a Bill which proposed to imprison for five years men who had asked for increases in wages.  I refer to the electricians in the E.S.B.  The Taoiseach was most vehement in his condemnation of these workers for what everybody believed to be reasonable demands for increases in wages to meet the needs of the men, women and children who would otherwise have gone hungry, unclothed, under-clothed, deprived of simple luxuries or the bare necessaries.</P>
      <P>The reaction of the Taoiseach and of the Government of whom the Minister is a member was a downright repudiation of that claim.  We know now that that was the most important industrial conflict which took place for the past ten or 15 years because if the Taoiseach and the Government had got away with what was in effect a wages standstill order, it would have been applied to the rest of society and there would not have been any eighth round increase at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>However, only last September, the Government turned that claim down.  In spite of the poor case made here for increases to the judiciary, that need could not be established to the satisfaction of the Taoiseach on behalf of electricians and on behalf of these relatively underpaid workers.  It is not my particular <Col N="721" /> job to argue the case of the farming community but only a couple of weeks ago we heard the Taoiseach deliver a most downright condemnation of the farming community's appeal for a greater share in the national income and the national wealth.  He pointed out to them that until they increased production, they could not get any money out of the national income.  That is really both parts of our society&mdash;the industrial side, on the one hand, and the agricultural side, on the other.  Both were lectured and blackmailed by the Taoiseach.  Finally, he had to lecture to them because he found he could not get away with his bullying tactics. He asked the farmers not to seek any increase in the total takings from the national income.</P>
      <P>Let me speak of the old people and the pensioners.  One of the curious things is the suggestion that the payment should be retrospective to last November.  I may be wrong but I think the Government gave money to some of the pensioners last year or the year before.  We know they had to wait five or six months&mdash;until 1st August&mdash;before they could get it.  As somebody pointed out, only last week the Minister for Finance told us we could not consider paying the Civil Service and other pensioners what we were going to pay them until we had the Budget, when we would know what was available.  All that repressive attitude to wage and salary increases, the condemnation by the Taoiseach of those who asked for increases without guaranteeing to increase productivity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>All that adds up to create the impression in the House and outside in the country that the Government wish to discriminate in favour of the already privileged in society. I know well that if you were to take the total sum, multiply it by ten and divide it among the old age pensioners and the other pensioners, it would probably not increase their allowance by one farthing a week, a month, or a year.  I know that well but that is not the point.  The point is, to improve <Col N="722" /> on an old phrase, that the Minister, as far as the public is concerned, is not only doing an injustice but he is taking steps to see it will be seen that an injustice is being done to these pensioners.  I think the Government in their appeal to the House for these increases are completely out of touch with the feelings of the public and that the public do not want their present Supreme Court judges to get these considerable increases in their salary scales.</P>
      <P>I asked a question recently in order to find out what the comparable increases were between the different sections of our society.  From 1955, the differences in the amounts paid were: industrial workers, £144 increase on the average; agricultural workers, £79 increase over the same period; and old age pensioners, £22.  Now the judges in that same period got something over £500.  Obviously, there is a very serious discrepancy between the awards made over that time to those people.  I honestly do not believe they can be justified on any standards.  I do not believe that a society such as ours, which can only afford to pay 30/-a week to old age pensioners, can justify paying anybody in our society £6,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As referred to by previous speakers, it is indeed peculiar that the Minister should in the course of his opening remarks insert the sentence: &ldquo;I hope that this debate will be conducted with restraint and a sense of decorum.&rdquo;  During my membership of the House I have never known of any other occasion upon which a Minister made such an opening remark.  Why did he make that remark?  What grounds had he for making it?  Why should the Minister worry if some Deputies in the course of their contributions did not restrain themselves if he were in a position to make an adequate reply?  It seems to me that the reason for its inclusion is that the Minister has a guilty conscience about this measure.  He feels it is not justified.  To ensure against the debate that he knows will ensue on such a matter, he inserts those opening remarks that we should restrain ourselves and discuss it with decorum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the House I protest <Col N="723" /> against that.  Each Deputy here is entitled to address himself to any question that arises and there is as much restraint and decorum on this side of the House as there is on the Government side.  It is also noticeable that since the Minister made his opening statement there have been contributions from about five or six Deputies but no member of his own Party has offered to speak.  One would think that having listened to four or five speeches based on the same arguments more or less, some member behind the Minister would make a case in support of the Minister's Bill.  That has not been done.  Of course the reason is obvious, that there is no case to make in support of this measure.</P>
    <P>We all recognise the importance of the judiciary and realise they must be adequately paid.  All of us on the Labour Party benches firmly believe they are adequately remunerated at present.  It is not so long, October, 1959, since the former Minister brought in a measure here giving substantial increases to all members of the judiciary.  We felt that when those increases were approved by a majority vote in this House, there would be no need for a further measure for a long time to come.  Indeed, we were surprised to learn a few months ago that the Government had in mind to provide further increases for this sheltered section of our community.</P>
    <P>The fact that the number affected is small is immaterial.  What we must consider is whether the expenditure proposed is warranted or not.  In the case of the first member of the judiciary mentioned in the Bill, the Chief Justice, the Minister tells us that a salary of £5,335 is not adequate for that post.  On what grounds does the Minister make that suggestion?  In the course of his address here, he gave very few grounds to substantiate that argument. I respectfully suggest that any citizen of our State in receipt of more than £100 weekly is adequately remunerated, having regard to our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister states that the salaries of the Supreme Court judges and of <Col N="724" /> the President of the High Court, at a figure of £4,070, are inadequate, that in order to make them adequate and in order to give these members of the judiciary a reasonable standard of living, it is incumbent on this House to approve a further increase of £430. Similarly, we must increase proportionately the salaries of the other judges.  Mention has already been made by members who addressed the House of the reasons for these increases. Some of them referred to the statements made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, when he took part in a debate in October, 1959, in relation to increasing judges' salaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Deputy describe him as the former Taoiseach?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the former Government.  The Taoiseach's statement on that occasion was that they must be immune from improper influences.  That was the main argument he put forward for the increases proposed two years ago.  Surely no Deputy has reflected more in this House on the judiciary than that remark reflects on them, the inference being that unless they are given big salaries, they may not be immune from improper influences; in other words, they may take bribes and be guilty of corruption in one form or another?  I do not believe that integrity can be bought and that we should follow the lead of 1959 that, unless we pay these people more for their services, they are liable to corruption and improper influences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same could be said of the Taoiseach himself who incidentally has a much more difficult job.  I maintained here in 1959 that he had a much more difficult job and much more difficult work to carry out on behalf of the country than the Chief Justice, the members of the Supreme Court or the President of the High Court whose proposed salaries will be £2,000 more than his in the case of the Chief Justice and £500 in the case of the others I mentioned, I want to <Col N="725" /> assert again that I see no justifiable reason, even though it seems to be the practice since the foundation of the State, for paying these people salaries far in excess of that of the Taoiseach or the other members of the House who are in charge, say, of the Departments of Finance, Industry and Commerce or Agriculture.</P>
    <P>In the mathematical calculations of the Government and in the statement made here by the Minister for Justice to-day, the Chief Justice is worth in money both the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not know whether the Minister will agree with me that he is or not, but I think he is not.</P>
    <P>The argument made here in regard to the Chief Justice is that we must pay him a salary of £117 weekly, if we are to deal fairly with him, and that it is a reasonable rate of remuneration, having regard to what the Government Party would describe as the onerous nature of his duties.  That would be all right if our economy warranted such big salaries.  We cannot afford to imitate other countries such as America, Britain, France or possibly Western Germany, who are much better off and have much better resources than we have, in the payment of members of our judiciary or in the payment of any other sections of our employees.</P>
    <P>If it is accepted that we should do so, then it should also be accepted that the average standard wage in rural Ireland of from £6 to £6 10s. weekly in the case of ordinary manual workers should be proportionately increased to the average standard wage, say, in Britain, of an ordinary unskilled labourer of from £12 to £13 weekly. However, there is no mention of that. The Government are not so anxious as to how the masses of the people, the ordinary workers, who have to exist week in and week out on such wages, are going to live and buy their bread and butter, their tea and sugar, their clothing, and so on, all of which, with the possible exception of clothing, cost them just as much as they cost the Chief Justice or the members of the Supreme Court. <Col N="726" /> What are the Government's intentions regarding increases of salaries for other sections of the community? We know their viewpoint on wages but what about the vast number of self-employed people who have made application for increased emoluments in the present session of this Dáil? What about the farming community, vast numbers of whom have to work and live on uneconomic holdings? Recently, we had a question addressed to the Minister for Agriculture asking if there was any possibility of giving an increase to the dairy farmers and the Minister informed us that it would upset the economy of the country if he were to give any such increase. The agricultural section of the community were told that they were well off enough at present; that we had no extra money to give them for their milk, pigs and other produce and that whatever money we had was needed to give a few extra pounds to the judges.</P>
    <P>On this very day, the case for the worst off section of the community, the incapacitated and disabled people who cannot provide for themselves, was put before the House.  My colleague, Deputy Casey, asked the Minister for Health if it would be possible to allow some increase in the maximum allowance granted to disabled persons.  The present allowance is only £1 2s. 6d. per week but the Minister told us that he had no money and that these people must continue to exist on this 3/- a day.  He added that if there was extreme hardship, they might have a chance of getting a little extra in home assistance.  It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health should make that statement in this House on the day that a Minister of Government should tell us that a man with £101 a week is not sufficiently remunerated and that he should get £655 a year more.  It is an outrageous proposal to bring in when many sections of our community are finding it difficult to make ends meet.  It allows one section of the community to live in luxury and affluence.</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind when dealing with this section of the community, <Col N="727" /> and I mean no reflection on them&mdash; the former Parliamentary Secretary laughs but I do not see anything funny about this; I do not know how the people down the country will take this measure, having regard to the representations made a few days ago about the price of milk&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is no need for the section of the community with which we are now dealing to provide for the rainy day.  The Department takes good care of them in their old age.  In examining the financial records for the past year, I note that the pension or retirement allowance of one of these judges is around £50 a week.  The case cannot be made that they must save from their income to provide for the rainy day.  We are looking after it for them.</P>
      <P>In addressing ourselves to this question, we must remember that we are living in a country with a population of roughly two and four-fifth millions and that a large number of our people are engaged in employment of an uneconomic nature.  There are those who have no continuity of employment and those who have continuity but whose wages are only from £6 to £9 weekly.  Then we have a large number of farmers throughout the country who find it hard to make a living and the small business people in the towns and villages who find it very difficult to meet their commitments. Then there is the big percentage of our people, about 60,000 or 70,000 annually, who have to fly from the country to gain a livelihood.  This is the country that is supposed to provide £117 a week for the Chief Justice and almost £100 a week for the other senior judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be very fortunate if I could have that amount of money spent in West Cork.  It would give regular employment all the year round to 18 men.  While we recognise that these <Col N="728" /> judges and highly-placed public servants must be remunerated in accordance with their status, I believe that there is no justification for Dáil Éireann to assert that the Chief Justice is entitled to 18 times as much as the ordinary worker in this country.  The Minister can make up that sum for himself.  The maximum rate of wages for county council workers in Cork county is £6 8s. 6d. a week.</P>

      <P>You are working it on a percentage basis and if a county council worker got a 10 per cent. increase, he would get 12/- a week.  The Chief Justice gets an increase of £600.  The Minister will agree with me that the salary he proposes for this man is £5,650 more than the average income of the people I refer to.  It is going to cause a great deal of unrest in the country.  Other workers who have contented themselves with smaller increases than they felt they were entitled to and the other sections of the community who are crying out for redress will ask questions to which the Minister and his Party will have great difficulty in replying having regard to the fact that they have brought in this measure.</P>

We have the Minister's statement that the Government intend to provide for increases in the salaries of the judiciary.  The Minister outlined their reasons for giving these increases.  As I have mentioned already, in the course of his statement here, the Minister brought it to our notice that he found, I think, some difficulty in getting some members of the legal profession to accept positions as judges. That has been dealt with by a number of speakers and, unless the rules of this House changed within the past half-hour, the matter is relevant.  It was dealt with at length.</P>

      <P>I support the case made by the previous speaker, who pointed out that when an appointment is to be made to these badly remunerated positions on the Bench, there is a great deal of canvassing, and canvassing of a political nature.  Down through the years since the foundation of this State, appointments to the Bench have been made on a political basis by successive Governments.  The Taoiseach addressed himself at length to this question in the course of the debate in 1959.  He said in the course of that debate, when dealing with the question of appointment to the Bench, that he believed it was only right&mdash;I am quoting his exact words&mdash;and proper that the Government should have the appointment of judges.  I expressed the opposite viewpoint, and I have it in mind now to elaborate on that, if elaboration is in conformity with the rules of the House. <Col N="731" /> Some time ago, I made a claim here that members of the judiciary should be appointed on a somewhat similar basis to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the trend of my remarks was disrupted by the intervention of the Chair, but that is something I accept.  I am here representing a rural constituency.  I believe I am interpreting the viewpoint of the people I have the honour and privilege to represent here in opposing as forcibly and as vehemently as I possibly can the passage of this <Col N="732" /> measure.  It is not necessary for me to repeat the grounds of my opposition.  I believe the proposed increase in salaries for these people is absolutely outrageous.  It is not in keeping with the maxim laid down by the Minister's Party in 1932 when it was stated publicly that no man in this country was worth more than £1,000 per year.  It may be said that money has since depreciated in value.  Taking that fact into account, a salary of £6,000 for the Chief Justice and the substantially increased salaries for the other members of the judiciary are not in keeping with the depreciation in the value of money.</P>
      <P>It may be contended by some that it is quite in order for a rural Deputy to get up here and exploit this measure. The Minister implied in his opening statement that that tactic might be adopted for political purposes.  There is no political purpose in any statement made from these benches.  We believe there is an obligation on us to make these statements.  If we remained silent, we would not be fit to represent the people who sent us here; we would not be doing their job by expressing their viewpoint here.  If there is money to spare, it would be much better to give it to the thousands of workers&mdash; wage earners and self-employed workers&mdash;who have to exist on very inadequate incomes, to the people who were the subject matter of discussion earlier today in this House, the disabled and the infirm, who the Minister for Health thinks can exist on 3/- per day without any difficulty.  It would be far better to think of such sections of the community rather than people receiving £100 a week or little short of it.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I wish to say I resent the intrusions of the Chair during the course of my remarks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to revert to the point made by the Minister introducing this Bill that it was one that should be dealt with quickly and with decorum.  Unfortunately, his warning has been found to be very well warranted as, subsequent to Deputy O'Higgins resuming his seat, most, if not all, of the speakers have tended to rant rather than discuss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is not implying that Deputy O'Higgins was the cause of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>Most certainly not.  I do not say I agree with everything Deputy O'Higgins said, but he dealt with the matter in the manner I would expect of him.  Other Deputies dealt with the matter in the manner I would have expected of them.  It is a wrong way to approach this matter to reduce this to a discussion as to how much per week the Chief Justice is worth.  In any question of such appointment what we have to consider is the market conditions, if you like, to try to find out what a man of the capabilities we require could otherwise earn by his own efforts.  If we find, as we do, that a leading member of the Bar, a really top-rank man, can earn by his own efforts an income of £5,000, £6,000 or even more, it is obvious that the Government in an effort to persuade such men to accept office on the Bench must be prepared to pay the market price.  It is just as easy as that.</P>
      <P>I know it is always very hard not to envy the salary of a man getting more than we are.  That is a human feeling, but we should not allow it to influence us in considering a measure such as this.  It is essential that the judiciary should be composed of men not only of the highest integrity but of the highest ability.  Men of that standard of integrity and ability do command a high price, because those qualities pay off handsomely in practice at the Bar.  Let it be clearly understood they have achieved that eminence through very hard work and through their own brilliance in their profession.  As the Minister stated in opening, it is more than unfair to use this debate as an attack on the judiciary simply by reason of the fact that, under current legislation, we may not increase the salary of a judge without bringing the matter formally before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparisons have been made&mdash; and not without reason&mdash;between the salaries paid to members of the judiciary and those paid to the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet.  Of course, it is always much more embarrassing for people to <Col N="734" /> vote money to themselves.  Personally, I think it is quite wrong that the Taoiseach should be paid at the rate at which he is being paid and others with less responsibility are paid far more.  That is because people go in for political life with a sense of vocation and are prepared to accept office at a lower figure.  I am sorry it is so.  When it comes to a question of the remuneration of people in Government employment we should treat the matter with great delicacy and should remember at the same time that, without any comment whatever, we have agreed to increase the salaries of other leading civil servants.</P>
    <P>I would refer in particular to Secretaries of Departments who up to the 15th December, 1959, were being paid at the rate of £2,647 per annum.  It could quite easily be said that that is an iniquitous amount to be paid to anyone in view of the low rate of payments to old age pensioners.  But there is a certain amount of sentimentality in putting the matter in that way. Even if we took away their salaries altogether and asked the Secretaries of Departments to work voluntarily, that would not affect the rate of payment of old age pensioners at all.  Here again you are up against the question of the market price of the best men and women available.  Consequently, we have the salary payable to Secretaries up to the 15th December, 1959, as £2,247.  From the 15th December, 1959, this amount was increased to £2,825.  Nobody made any comment about that.  That was a reasonable, proportionate increase in view of the other increases in wages and salaries. Again, on 1st April, 1960, the salaries of Departmental Secretaries were raised to £3,000, again without comment; and with effect from 1st November, 1961, their salaries were again increased to £3,375&mdash;a total of three increases in three years and a total increase of £728 per annum.</P>
    <P>In view of all this song and dance about old age pensioners, disabled persons and other social welfare beneficiaries and the fact that they were not referred to at all when these salaries were increased, I think there is a certain amount of insincerity about raising the matter now.  Certainly <Col N="735" /> I do not think it is possible to throw that in the teeth of the Fianna Fáil Party, which has so consistently increased all social welfare benefits year after year and which has a record second to none in that regard. Nobody can ever say that a Fianna Fáil Government were lacking in consideration for those of the community who are in need or who are less fortunate. The basic trouble is, of course, that to raise social welfare benefits by even 6d. or 1/-, which is an almost insulting increase, costs such a phenomenal amount of money.</P>
    <P>Let us remember, also, when considering these increases, that there is a question of income tax and sur-tax involved.  I admit that an increase of £365 per annum does look very large indeed.  But the trouble with large salaries is that if you wish to increase them at all, you have to increase them nominally by a very large amount if the increase is to be effective at all. Take the case of the Chief Justice with an increase of £665 per annum. With his salary before the increase he is bound to have exhausted all his allowances and to be assessed at the full rate of tax and sur-tax.  Consequently, on his increase of £665 he will pay £210 11s. 8d. in income tax, at the standard rate of 6/4d., and in surtax, £166 5s. at 5s. in the £.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>He will never manage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>So that of his £665 increase, he will have the doubtful pleasure of handing back, or of having taken off him before he gets it, £376 16s. 8d.  Therefore, his net increase of salary is down to £288 3s. 4d.  It may be said that is far too much.  That is a matter of opinion, but do not let us fool ourselves by thinking for a moment that the recipient of this increase, if and when he gets it, will really have an extra £665 in his pocket, because he will not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these matters are confusing the whole issue, however.  If you take a county council worker, a married man with two, three, five or six children, and he gets an increase of £1 a week, <Col N="736" /> that is a net increase because his allowances still keep him well clear of the income tax level.  It is when you get into the higher income bracket that income tax and surtax take such lumps out of your income that any increase at all must be vastly inflated in order to be real.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies have stated that it is quite unreasonable to fix this rate of salaries.  That is assuming the Government and the Minister simply sat down and thought of a figure which would be big enough to keep the Chief Justice at a reasonable standard of living.  That is not the way it worked out.  It is a matter of what is the price you have to pay in order to get the best men.  That is exactly what was done, nothing more, nothing less, but if you are prepared to say you would rather the judiciary were chosen from the members of the Bar who are less competent, who have proved themselves to be less competent, I would be greatly surprised because, in spite of the rude remarks made by certain people about the judiciary, the fact is that even Deputy Oliver Flanagan must appreciate that we have got to respect them and that in order that we should respect them we have to ensure they are the best people available.</P>
    <P>The only way you can do that is by paying them.  We are doing that here in a reasonable way and even if we did not pay any increase it would not be to anybody else's benefit.  It would not reduce the rate of income tax, it would not reduce the rate of tax on cigarettes, spirits, petrol, it would not increase the old age pensions.  So by avoiding this increase of salaries, we would not benefit anyone but we would be doing a bad day's work for the country.  The greatest effect of democracy is a competent and satisfied judiciary, a judiciary which has the final word even over the interpretation of the Constitution. For those reasons it is essential that high standards should be maintained at any cost, and with market prices as they are and earnings very high at the Bar among those who are best qualified, we have no alternative but to do as we have done. I have no apology to anyone for this <Col N="737" /> measure which I support without any reservations whatsoever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Anything I say on this measure is impersonal as far as the Minister for Justice is concerned. He is one Minister of the present Government for whom I have a certain amount of respect because on any occasion I called on him I found him a very reasonable and charitable man. As far as I am concerned may he long reign there.  But he has my sympathy for having to come into this House with a Bill of this description, having to listen to the Orange flute being played, to Deputy Booth standing up and giving members of this House a lecture.  We do not want any lecture from Deputy Booth.  I was here twenty years before I ever heard of him, and I will be here 20 years after he is dead, with the help of God.</P>
      <P>He comes along here to tell the House that we despise the judiciary. Far from that, I have as much respect for them as Deputy Booth has, probably more in a way.  Nevertheless, he tells about the income tax they pay and, of course with a sneer, he gets back to the road worker.  He does not understand anything about the road worker or the agricultural worker or any other worker in this country.  Of course it is with a sneer that he gets back to that level&mdash;down from the Chief Justice with his salary of £6,000 a year to the road worker, and he says the road worker does not pay income tax.  The road worker lives under the law and is bound under the law to pay income tax if he is liable for it just as the Chief Justice must pay it.  But as far as Deputy Booth, or any of his kith or class are concerned, we would have a law for one type and the other sections would be ground down.</P>

      <P>It may be all right for Deputy Booth to say the Minister should not increase his own salary.

    <P>Last week, I had a question down to the Taoiseach relating to the farming community and Fine Gael had a motion relating to pensions and we were told: &ldquo;Wait until we see what <Col N="741" /> is in the Budget.&rdquo;  The people drawing over £5,000 a year at present cannot wait until 10th April, two weeks away.  Not alone that, but these increases are to be retrospective to November 1st, 1961.  When a mean, miserable increase was given to Deputies not so long ago, it was not retrospective. Why was that?  We are Deputies elected by the people and that is a hard court to get through.  It takes a good man to do so every time. I think Fianna Fáil have gone daft and that more lunatic asylums are necessary.</P>
    <P>I believe Fianna Fáil will get their answer in the near future and the sooner, the better.  When they go back to the people, they will find that it is not on £6,000 a year the people are trying to live but that many are getting, not the 30/- a week old age pension we hear about, but only 15/- a week to keep body and soul together. The same applies to widows and orphans and agricultural workers of whom many thousands have left the land in the past two years.  This Bill is not for them but for the judiciary. Only the judiciary and Deputy Booth's class, the big investors, are benefiting.  Fianna Fáil have gone that way now but they will soon be told where to get back to.</P>

      <P>I know that if I take the same line as most Deputies who have spoken, the wags in town will give me a cheer and I shall not have to do any explaining, but if I support the Minister's proposals I shall be taking a hard decision and I shall have to do a lot of explaining.  I have decided to do it the hard way.  I like taking the hard way.  It is easy to go the other way as many do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the judges are not popular any more than jailers or executioners, or for that matter, Teachtaí Dála are popular.  Do not forget that when it was suggested that we should get an increase, after 13 years, the crowd said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Little does the crowd know that 80 per cent. of the Teachtaí Dála must have over £2,000 a year.  If all the Teachtaí Dála were asked to give a pledge to live on £1,000 a year, 90 per cent.  of them would resign.  So <Col N="742" /> now, do not focus on the judges for what they have and give the impression that the Teachtaí Dála are satisfied. They are not satisfied.  If they had to give up all their business, and so on, and do with £1,000 a year, there would be 90 per cent. resignations next week because they could not live on it, for the very good reason that, being Teachtaí Dála, they have certain commitments which the ordinary man in the street has not got.</P>
    <P>I had an argument with a woman about two years ago at a time when I was getting £12 10s. a week and she was getting about 30/- a week.  She said: &ldquo;You, with the awful amount of money.&rdquo;  She was comparing my miserable amount with her 30/-.  Her money was hers but mine belonged to everybody.  I could not go anywhere but I was touched for a bob or two. If I went into a pub with some pal, a few people would come over to me and I would have to give them a few pints.  Everywhere I went it was the same thing.  If it is a poor person with no seat in his pants, there is nothing about it.  We have to dress up.</P>

      <P>I am making a good case, Sir.  I am making the case that, just as we require a certain amount of money to carry out our duties, so do High Court judges require a certain amount because they have to live at a certain standard, too.  However, they have a much higher standard than we have.  They are people who are supposed to live apart from the rest of us. They cannot mix with the rest of us for fear they might be lobbied, or for some other reason.  They have to live in big houses, houses with a high rateable valuation.  They have to go around in cars.  If they want a drink, they must go to a hotel.  If they go anywhere, it must be the tops because if they associate with the rest of us, they are in danger of being lobbied or touched or squared about some case, which is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference is that those people require a high income, so as to be able to live independent of the rest of us and in spite of us, so that they can do justice without any danger&mdash;<Col N="743" /> because, in spite of what is said, we are all the same.  Judges are not special beings.  They are just like you and me.  Before they became judges, some of them were politicians. They hobnobbed with the rest of us. They had their beer and they backed a horse.  They are not any different from the rest of us.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, deep down in all of us, there is this surge to break the law and grab more than we should grab and wipe our neighbour's eye and that applies as much to the judge as to the rest of us.  We select a small number of people and give them a good salary so that they will be beyond those temptations which many of us are not.  That is the reason those people get a high salary.  I am sure there is a prejudice against them because they are members of the legal profession or perhaps because members of the legal profession are not very favoured with the public because it is true that they rub it in and take advantage of poor people. Once they become judges, they cease to practise and they depend just on a salary and they are not supposed to engage in any other business.</P>

      <P>I believe that is their job.  About the year 1955, I was in court for possession.  I was on the floor, too, you know, and I was on public assistance at the time.  I had a little business and there was an order for possession because of rent. I went to court and, naturally, I owed rent.  They did not get possession. I was told to pay a certain amount and then to pay off the arrears. When the person who brought me to court claimed costs, the judge came to my assistance, without being asked to <Col N="744" /> do so.  He said: &ldquo;Wait a minute. You have junior counsel here and I do not think it was necessary.  I shall not give you costs but only for yourself: that is all.&rdquo;  He did that.  He protected me at a time when I was on the floor.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that in many ways judges do protect the poor against avaricious members of the legal profession as well as the public.  Their job is there.  They have a big job and there are only a handful of them. I am satisfied they require a decent salary and it is a fact that if you were to break it down, if this increase they are getting was &ldquo;divvied up&rdquo;, all the old age pensioners would not get a farthing a week.  In fact, the total amount is £22,000, and members here make no objection to the district justices getting an increase, so that, actually, the amount at stake is probably about £5,000.  That is what we are debating.  If you break that down, you will find that 60 per cent. of it will go back in taxation.  Therefore, you are asking about a miserable £3,000.</P>

      <P>I am making the case because I make it a practice to look on both sides of the case.  Always and ever here in legal debates or anything else, I look on both sides of the case.  I know it would be very popular to say: &ldquo;Have a bash at the judges; I will not lose any votes.&rdquo;  I might lose a few votes by supporting the judges but I will lose none by having a bash at them.  Therefore, I am taking the hard road.  It is largely a waste of time and a lot of argument over a couple of thousand pounds which are being given to people whom it is necessary to keep apart from the rest of us so that they will judge <Col N="745" /> people without any fear or favour whatsoever.</P>
      <P>I have read of numerous cases in the American courts where judges were regularly brought into the back room by political parties and things were more or less fixed behind the scenes before the case came before the court at all.  That happened in America and it happened elsewhere.  It is all right to say that money should not count.  Every man, they say, has his price.  Whether you like it or not, these men must be above temptation. They are just human and the proof of that is that if any of you read of the trials at Nuremberg, the break down was that all of those fellows made a whack out of it.  It was proved that Hitler at least never made a penny.  He was dedicated; he was not interested in money.  But the rest of them were all lumping it up with treasures and pieces of art.  It is the same with judges.  There may be an odd person who is dedicated but we do not legislate for special humans; we legislate for human beings.  Therefore, so as to put the human beings in the judiciary above temptation of any sort, we must pay them, and well.  I believe that in spite of any prejudice against the legal profession, once they take the oath, they become the protectors of the poor. That is my opinion and that has been my experience.</P>

      <P>Many members have put up different pleas but it has been left to Deputy Sherwin to take the outstanding part in suggesting that the gentlemen concerned will fall through the back of their trousers through faulty material, and will be unable to go with certain friends at night, unless they get this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before touching very briefly on a few points in connection with this proposed wage increase, I wish to reply to Deputy Booth.  Deputy Booth wondered what we would do with such a small sum as £21,000.  I could tell the Minister what we could do with it.  We would be very pleased in County Cork to get it even as a token grant towards all the damage that was done there a couple of weeks ago and in respect of <Col N="746" /> which the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance refused to come to our assistance.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal, for a while back all over the country, we have heard discussions about the eight round of wage increases.  What strikes me forcibly is the difference in this claim.  I am sure, as one of the leading lights in an industrial concern, Deputy Booth would agree with me that in regard to any wage increase that has yet been decided upon, whether it be the eighth round or any other round, it has always emanated from the trade union movement on behalf of the workers, or from a group of workers themselves or from representatives of the local authorities on behalf of the workers employed by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>In considering this claim, therefore, we must understand that the position is somewhat different.  Over the years, the workers have never got wage increases from their employers without having asked for them and without a series of negotiations between the trade union representatives and the employers. It is natural to assume that the representatives of the employers always like to strike the best bargain they can.  Can we try to strike the best bargain here?  We do not know.  I am seeking information on that.</P>
    <P>There is no claim from any organisation on behalf of the people concerned in this proposal.  There is no case as to whether the figures put before us here by the Minister are based on the increase in the cost of living or anything else or on some of the problems to which Deputy Sherwin referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have read that.  However, the Minister should have based the case on sounder arguments. I can assure him of one thing, that if he were the representative of such a group and went before the Labour Court, he would not get more than 5/- per week.  The Minister should be in a position to put before the House a better case than that which he has put before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="747" /> In any wage demand, no increase is ever thrown away by the employers. The employers base their opposition on two or three points.  The main point, of course, is: &ldquo;Industry cannot stand up to your demand.&rdquo;  That is one answer.  Another point is whether or not they would be safe in fighting the demand of the workers, basing the possibility of a fight on the old theory of supply and demand.  If they thought they could draw unorganised labour from other fields, then perhaps it might strengthen their case against the demand for such a wage increase.  I do not think the Minister could say that in this case the supply and demand of the labour concerned would affect us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the case of any wage demand that is presented to a wage tribunal or to the Labour Court. Deputy Booth laboured the point that Secretaries of Departments got increases to which we did not object. The arbitration scheme runs through the Civil Service and we must all agree that if the junior member of the staff is entitled to an increase, so also is the Secretary of the Department.  The Secretary of a Department, whether we like it or not, is in a far more onerous position than perhaps his own Minister and he is not a part-time employee.  He works the full 12 months except for the few weeks' leave he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wage demand of the ordinary worker presented to the Labour Court must be based on the increase in the cost of living.  The representatives must <Col N="748" /> be able to show increased costs for overalls, the various tools the tradesman uses, whether for carpentry or anything else.  They must be able to show the number of points by which the cost of living index has gone up.</P>

      <P>In regard to this claim, can any such increased costs be shown?  Would the wear and tear of the gown be taken into consideration? I do not know what such items cost.  Would part of the demand include depreciation of such articles?  I presume in such a position a man would not use an ordinary biro?  Has the Minister taken that into consideration?  I am sure he has, but I wonder what figure he would allow for all that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">

      <P>The Minister should not be ratting on the members of the Cabinet because it took a long time for them to do anything for the young Guards.  There must be a young Franco in the Cabinet.  This case has no comparison with other proposals that have come before this House.  It has no comparison even with the case of a secretary of a Department or even with the other case mentioned by Deputy Booth when he spoke of income tax and surtax.  The ordinary road worker who recently got an increase of 10/- a week in Cork now has to pay income tax.  And we have to go back to Cork and tell them that they have got to pay income tax on that 10/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> This matter will be no help to the general public.  The various members of the Cabinet, from the Taoiseach down, have bemoaned increases in wages.  They have stated that if there were to be increases in wages, there would have to be increased output.  If there is to be increased output in the courts, it is going to cost more.  You will have an increased number of Guards going to the courts, increased numbers of barristers and solicitors attending there and increased numbers of witnesses and messengers and the cost of all that is to be added to the £21,000.  The Minister should have realised that he has no justification for this proposal, whether it is his own or whether it had the full backing of the Cabinet from the Taoiseach down.  He should remember that while the people holding these positions are important, they are no more important than any other section of the community as human beings.</P>
    <P>We can get on with the officials of the various Departments and they in their turn will help us to find an answer to the problems presented by us to them on behalf of our constituents. But in this case the only concern with these people is not to find but to fine the unfortunate people who go before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Occasions such as this show up clearly where responsibility lies in this House and where it does not.  The Labour Party representatives have spoken very clearly against any increase for the judiciary, except for the district justices.  They are in favour of increases for industrial workers, for Civic Guards and for civil servants. Why are they opposing the increases to the judiciary?  They say it is because the members of the judiciary have enough already but I ask them where do they draw the line?  Is it at £500, £1,000, £1,500, £2,000, £2,500 or £3,000?  I suggest that the reason they approve the increases that have been granted in the eighth round and oppose the increases to the judiciary is very clear and is becoming clearer as we listen to the debate.  The judiciary are a small body and their votes do not count.  It is popular to oppose an increase for the judiciary who are already admittedly well paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> We have had people here talking about the old age pensioners and comparing their plight with the position of the Chief Justice to whom it is proposed to give £6,000 a year.  Anybody who makes that argument is doing it with his tongue in his cheek. If such people pretend to be honest about it, I ask them to be logical and I ask them if they are suggesting that the old age pensioners should be paid the same as the Chief Justice. No one is suggesting that, so I suggest it is plain dishonesty to try to bring that argument into this debate.</P>
    <P>Most of the speakers who have opposed the Bill have said that they would favour an increase for the district justices.  They have pointed out that the district justices work very hard and do a good job.  I am greatly surprised that members of the Labour Party have taken this line as I always thought that where there was a differential laid down and that the Labour Party would not be in favour of breaking down that differential.  It seems to me that as far as the Labour Party are concerned one set of principles are to be applied to one section of the community but not to anybody else, especially when the other section have not got many votes.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been accused of not giving any reasons to the House for his introduction of this Bill.  I should like to recall the Minister's opening statement when he referred to an all-Party Committee which sat in this House in 1953 and which made recommendations on the whole range of judicial salaries.  He also said that the Government had endeavoured to base this present measure on those recommendations, allowing for the variations in the value of money since that time.  Nobody referred to that statement made by the Minister.  I would ask Deputies who suggest that these increases should not be given to tell us do they disagree with those recommendations or do they say that this measure is not in accordance with them.</P>
    <P>If they want to argue along those lines, it is quite legitimate, but I would suggest that some of the arguments made here are purely for the purposes <Col N="751" /> of political capital.  I say further that Deputies have been making political capital out of this Bill with a vengeance. That is a very easy thing to do on a Bill such as this.  It is very easy to exploit ill-feeling and, human nature being what it is, most people would not favour granting an increase to a man with over £5,000 a year in order to bring him up to £6,000 per year.  It is very easy to exploit that situation; but anybody who is prepared to treat this matter responsibly, and to go a little further than a mere surface assessment, will naturally consider the circumstances in which the increase is being granted and will also consider the arguments put forward by the Minister in his opening statement.</P>
    <P>I suggest that it takes leadership, statesmanship and courage for the Government to introduce a measure such as this.  No political kudos will come to Fianna Fáil because of this Bill.  We have no illusions about that. Thank God, we have a Government who are prepared to exercise both leadership and courage when these are necessary to ensure that the institutions of this democratic State are kept safe from any danger of collapse.  I thank God we have such a Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>I decided not to intervene in this debate, but, having listened to some of the speakers, I feel it is obligatory upon me now to give some indication of and justification for the action I shall take in regard to this Bill.  Reference has been made to the eighth round increase.  A previous Government here were very unpopular when they brought in a wages standstill order.  Listening to some of the Opposition speakers, one would almost imagine that what they want now is another standstill order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this State was founded, a certain ceiling was set on the salaries of members of the judiciary.  I have never heard anyone down through the years complain about that.  Unlike Deputy Sherwin, I have not had an opportunity of familiarising myself with the way Supreme Court judges live.  On every occasion in this House, however, I have supported increases, <Col N="752" /> and I have added the advice that better wages bring about a better standard of living and a better standard of living inevitably means increased production. There has not been increased production in some fields of our economy because the workers feel they are not getting sufficient wages.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made that the judges' case should be submitted to the Labour Court.  It takes a lot of courage to suggest that the judiciary should join a trade union and possibly take strike action.  Quite a number of people might be pleased at that.</P>

      <P>This increase, retrospective to November 1961, represents an increase of 12½ per cent.  I do not think the public will worry unduly about that increase.  On the voting on this issue, one wonders if there may be the possibility of an election.  Well and good, if we have an election.  I certainly agree with Deputy Colley that the Government, realising that would be the issue, are to be admired in introducing this measure.</P>
      <P>It would be the popular thing for me to say that district justices should, of course, get an increase, but the Labour Party will not suggest that because the workers get an increase, the foreman should also get an increase. That is the only analogy I can find as between district justices and Supreme Court judges.  When a man goes in to buy a suit of clothes, or anything else, he does not wear a badge to indicate whether he is a justice or a builder's labourer.</P>

      <P>I do think of them, and the people of Dublin think about them.  I trust the Deputy is not suggesting I am forgetting the unemployed. In the past I supported the increases given by the Government.  I <Col N="753" /> was quite voluble about them.  I cannot be such a political acrobat as to vote against an increase on this occasion. There is no need for me to justify my attitude.  It is the attitude I have adopted throughout, and it is the attitude I shall, I hope, adopt in the future.</P>

      <P>I have often heard it said that adversity makes strange bedfellows.  It would appear now that opportunity makes even stranger ones. One sees Fine Gael, the richman's Party, and Labour, allegedly the poorman's Party, aligning themselves in this year of 1962 simply for what they believe to be political advantage&mdash; political advantage that I can assure them will bring them nothing.  Anybody of commonsense or intelligence, when he sees these two Parties aligned like this, knows automatically what to do.  It would not take a great deal of argument to convince any sane person where right lies.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Fine Gael Party has done so many twists that he must now be one of the chief performers in the country.  I wonder do his colleagues realise, or are their memories so short that they fail to remember, that this same gentleman was responsible in 1932 for putting Mr. de Valera into office as President of the Executive Council.</P>

It is remarkable the turns and twists he has taken since.  He had an opportunity for yet another one this evening.  The main reason why Fine Gael oppose this measure is that they have not got a very big share in the judiciary.  If they had a good number there, they would not be opposing this measure, and no one here is so foolish as to believe they would.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all Fianna Fáil and, whoever was responsible for that, was a very just man.  It may be the popular thing to make a case against the judges.  Reading the papers, particularly those truthful ones, one is told that any senior counsel with any reputation at all can easily make up to £10,000 or £15,000 a year.  I take it that any man who is a judge would have been quite a reputable senior counsel and would have been able to make a very good livelihood, had he never become a judge.  It appears to me that by becoming a judge, he lost a tremendous amount of money.  In all fairness, if we are to have able people in the judiciary, the very least we must do is to compensate them.  None of these people has denied that he has been able to make up to £10,000 or £15,000 a year.  As far as I know, so far no judge has been able to make anything like that; so the people who became judges must have been tremendous losers financially.</P>
      <P>That is the simple way I look at it. It may not be a very serious matter for a county councillor in Mayo, Limerick or Dublin to take a turkey from someone for doing a bit of soft work, but it would be a ridiculous situation if our judges had to do likewise. Anything we can do to place the judiciary beyond suspicion is a step in the right direction.  It may not be a popular thing to vote for this measure, but I am going to vote for it.  I do not like hypocrisy.  The attitude towards this has been completely hypocritical.  There is no shadow of doubt about it.  It is simply because the Parties opposing it have the impression that most members of the judiciary do not now and probably never did belong to their Parties that they are opposing it.  Any step we can take to put the judiciary beyond suspicion is something we are bound to do.  The cost is not so high.  To give a shilling or two shillings to the old age pensioners would probably cost a hundred times as much.</P>

      <P>The attitude of the Labour Party has been fairly well explained but, having regard to some of the things that have been said, I feel I should comment.  We must ask ourselves whether this is the opportune time to increase judges' salaries. I believe it is not.  This case should be put back for trial, because we must remember we are surrounded by a multiplicity of other immediate problems.  We must have regard to the attitude of the man-in-the-street. The effect on him of such a lavish increase will, I submit, be all the more frustrating when he has regard to all that is happening around him.  Deputy Sherwin indicated, perhaps rightly so, that the cost of these increases would approximate to a farthing each for old age pensioners.  That is not the point.  Now and then, when it suits us, we have regard to principles and we often say a principle motivates our actions.  We should not pretend any longer that we can afford to pay such high salaries and increases when there is such a miserable situation at the other end of the scale.  I was intrigued by Deputy Sherwin's reference to the wags in the town.  I believe there will be a lot of tongues wagging about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley sincerely said it took courage to take a stand of this kind. I sincerely believe, however, it is inopportune to make this move.  I am not thinking of lining up with Fine Gael or indeed Fianna Fáil.  We must get down to a realisation of the people's problems, the problem of the fellow on the lowest rung of the ladder.  Reference has been made to the salaries of Ministers and T.D.s. We must look further down the ranks. Deputy Colley took the Labour Party to task and talked about differentials. He said he understood it to be a principle of trade unionists to maintain differentials.  Indeed it is.  But if the Chief Justice gets an increase of £665, how can you maintain differentials in respect of old age pensioners, widows and orphans and unemployed?  When we talk about maintaining differentials, it appears some people do not understand the <i>modus operandi</i> of trade unions.  Deputy Colley has a fair knowledge of it.  When a trade <Col N="756" /> union sets out to maintain differentials it has regard to what the fellow at the top has and what the fellow at the bottom has.  If you increase the fellow at the top, the fellow at the bottom seeks to get somebody to maintain the differential.  I am not suggesting the Labour Party should advocate an increase of £665 for all recipients of benefits.</P>

      <P>I am talking about maintaining differentials.  I am not talking about percentage increases at all.  Deputy Carroll talked about the experience of people going into a shop to buy the same loaf of bread.  That is a good argument for maintaining differentials.  We should realise by now that well-paid people are not dependent on hand-outs to meet the cost of an increase in the loaf of bread.  I have had to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Lands admonishing the Labour Party for taking this or that line.  He is always talking about taking up lines, and I think at times he is going around in circles.  I am wondering where he will stop.  The Labour Party have firm convictions in regard to various problems and, as we are entitled to do, we give expression to them.  Simply because we do that, it is wrong for somebody to say &ldquo;This is a new expression of &lsquo;The Twist.&rdquo;&rsquo; The latest definition of &ldquo;The Twist&rdquo; is our friend, Deputy Leneghan.</P>

    <P>Deputies spoke about the eighth round increases and pointed out that the salaries of judges had to be related to the cause of these increases but I think by now almost every Deputy realises that the eighth round increases were initiated and accepted so that the standard of living of the workers would be raised.  Is it seriously suggested that the judges are so badly off that we have to improve their standard of living?  I am not against the judges getting an increase sometime in the future but I submit to the Minister and the Government that they seem to be putting the cart before the horse.  Let them, first of all, set about looking after the people who <Col N="758" /> are in immediate need and, having done that, we will cease being a nation of hyprocrites.</P>

    <P>I think Deputy Colley made the best possible case for these increases, but although he is a very able Deputy, in my opinion, since I have seen him in the House, I do not think his case would impress anybody outside, except, perhaps, the judges who are to get the increases.  It is all very fine to use this Chamber as a debating society and score minor points over one another and I am afraid a number of Deputies who have come here in recent years and climbed the ladder very suddenly have a wrong impression of what the House is meant to be.  It ill becomes any Deputy who, in a short time here, is jumped up to a Ministerial post, with no experience of the tough procedure of being a backbencher <Col N="761" /> with his ear always close to the ground, to utilise his new post as a means to deliver a homily or a lecture to the members of the House who were elected by the people.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in the House for a number of years and I can say I never had any experience, under any group who formed Governments in those years, of the Taoiseach or a Minister coming in before a debate and warning or admonishing Deputies that they should act as decent, respectable men and not lower the tone of the debate.  I know that at the end of a debate or discussion, when there were rather tough speeches, Ministers at times referred to the attitude of certain Deputies.  A Minister is fully entitled to do that. If he gets a few hard knocks, he is entitled to reply, but no Minister, in my opinion especially the present Minister for Justice, is entitled to lecture Deputies on how they should conduct themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much play has been made here by the Minister and some who support the Government with the suggestion that the eighth round of increases is one reason why it was imperative for the Government to bring in this Bill to give this extra salary to the judges.  Is the Minister who has taken that line disowning everything that has been said by the Taoiseach and by the former Taoiseach on the question of what the judiciary are entitled to?  It was stated in black and white by his leader that the salaries and emoluments of the judiciary should not be tied to, or associated in any way with, yearly increases given to other groups of the community arising from wage or salary <Col N="762" /> demands, and the question of a seventh or eighth round of increases, according to the Taoiseach, should have no bearing on what the judges are paid.</P>
    <P>That was the line taken back in 1953 when a Select Committee of the House examined the question of the emoluments of the judiciary.  Not alone was that view taken then but the same line of thought has run through the speeches and statements of the Taoiseach here.</P>
    <P>To-day we have the Minister blandly suggesting that when there was an eighth round of salary increases, it would appear that the judges are entitled to their share of the national cake.  On what leg does he stand?  Is there a complete change of policy with regard to judges?  Do we take it now, if there is a demand next year which will be described as the ninth round, that it will be decided by the Government that the judges will have to get another increase?  The Government themselves are responsible for the criticism that has been offered here and for the long discussion.  They are responsible if there is any criticism of the judiciary.  Personally, I do not think there has been, but if they are used more of less as a cockshot in the political fight here, the Government are responsible for putting them into the cockpit because if they had stuck to what the Taoiseach argued over the years, the increases for judges would come over lengthy periods.</P>
    <P>The argument here was that any adjustment in the salary scales of the judiciary should be on a long-term basis.  These are the words of the Taoiseach.  But the Minister comes here and seeks to justify this new increase on the ground that only a very limited number of increases were given since 1924.  That is true.  I think this is only the third since 1924.</P>

If we look at the 1953 figure, it is not unreasonable to say that around 1959/60 there should have been another look at the payments and emoluments of the judiciary.  But, having taken that look in 1959 and having regard to the Taoiseach's view that these adjustments should be on a long-term basis, I find it hard to understand now, only two years afterwards, these very big increases being sought.</P>
      <P>For the record, I want to have it clearly established in the House that the third increase was given in 1959. On 1st January, 1959, the Chief Justice got an increase of £485.  The judges in the Supreme Court got an increase of £370.  The President of the High Court got an increase of £370.  The judges of the High Court got an increase of £335.  Circuit Court judges got an increase of £260.  That was not a bad increase at all in 1959.  The intention, when that increase was given in this House, was that there would be no other increase until after the lapse of a long period.  Yet, within a period of two years, the Government have decided to give a further increase, on top of those increases.  Since 1st January, 1959, the increase to the Chief Justice amounts to approximately £1,100.  The increase to the Supreme Court judges is well over £700.  The increase to the High Court judges is again, on my reckoning, well over £700 per annum. The increase to the circuit court judges is over £600.</P>
      <P>If we look at those figures, I think we will agree there is no justification whatever for giving, inside a period of two years, from 31st December, 1959, to 28th March, 1962, an increase of £1,100 to any individual in this State on the basis that the cost of living has gone up or that his status has disimproved as a result of increased salaries paid to other sections of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think a case has been made by the Minister.  He himself may have been quite satisfied but I <Col N="764" /> cannot accept the argument that he has put up here that you must pay well for the services of the legal man who is going to be a judge; that you must pay for that at a level which will measure up to what they are likely to get in the practice of the law outside. I should be very interested to find out from the Minister whether or not it is a fact that the four people whom he has mentioned here have refused to accept appointments on the bench&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if the four men he has mentioned who are members of the Bar. on financial grounds, would not take up appointments on the Bench, although they were offered those appointments. <Col N="765" /> That is the question I want to ask. If we take up the line Deputy Booth has taken here, that the market conditions must be taken into consideration, I can only say I think it is a dreadful description to use when we are talking about justice.  Is this a question of principle that is involved or is is just the stock exchange that we are discussing?</P>
      <P>Are we to regard judges and members of the judiciary and members of this House on the basis that you cannot get them unless they are paid at a certain high level?  If we do not pay them at that level, they are prone to temptation and are prepared to accept bribes&mdash;is that the basis on which we are discussing this very important Bill?  If it is, may I remind the Minister of the quotation from the Americans when they were dealing with the oil sheiks of the Middle East?  They said: &ldquo;It is very easy to bribe the sheiks but the costly thing is to keep them bribed.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a fair line of thought in this House in relation to judges that unless we paid them some outrageous blown-up figure which certain members of the Bar are alleged to be making outside this House then we cannot attract them.  It has been suggested that there are quite a number of men in legal circles who are making £10,000 a year in this country. Deputy Dr. Browne has commented on that.  My only comment is that if that is true, there is something wrong. The Minister's Deputy, Deputy Corry, put his finger on it when he said it is outrageous that such charges are imposed on the community.  If it is asserted that a man can make between £10,000 and £15,000 a year at practice at the Bar, and if we are to depend for our appointments to the judiciary on competition of that nature, I can only say I do not think it is true.  I think the number of men who go to that figure are very limited indeed.  I would say you could count them on the fingers of one hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I do <Col N="766" /> not think it is a fair line of argument to pursue, in order to convince the public, that members of the Bar are making such big money outside that we have to pay the judges at a level that will attract them.</P>
      <P>There is one other point on which I desire to dwell.  This is not a question of attracting the best men from practice at the Bar.  If the machinery for the appointment of members of the judiciary were of the nature suggested by Deputy Corry, and to which I do not intend to refer at any length, I would say the question of emoluments then should be considered coldly by a neutral independent body such as the Labour Court&mdash;call it what you like.  However, when the selection is being made, it is purely on a political basis.  Therefore, although I do not suggest that incompetent men are selected, it is quite apparent that a man who is the wrong colour, and who may be the most qualified and the most fitted for the job, because of his colour, is left out.</P>
      <P>The cat has been let out of the bag here.  A number of Deputies on both sides of the House agreed with Deputy Leneghan when he suggested that there is a lot of jealousy between the political Parties in connection with these appointments.  I am afraid there is.  It is a bad thing to have such jealousy and it is a bad system. I shall not refer to it any further than to say that all the things happening here and the discussions are brought about because of that system.  If the appointments were made purely on the basis of qualification, there would not be half the criticism.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, in spite of the fact that it is a bad system, I do not deny that good men come in.  However, I think it cannot be denied that the very best possible men that would be available are just unfortunate enough not to get there because they are not prepared to play ball politically.  I do not think any man who goes on the Bench should have to play ball politically with any organisation in this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on what I might call the junior group in the judiciary, that is, district justices.  If there is any <Col N="767" /> case to be made for an increase, it is to be made for them.  I am not advocating that here but I believe there is a possible case for investigation.  I think it should be done by the method adopted in 1953, the setting up of a Select Committee.  In 1953, that committee made recommendations which were brought into operation by the Courts of Justice Act, 1953.  What is wrong in 1962 with setting up such a committee again?  That is what should have been done instead of the Government's making up their minds, and saying: &ldquo;The eighth round has been given to the higher civil servants; we shall have to give something to the judges.&rdquo; I do not know how it was done but it would appear to the public that the Government decided, without any deep thought, that the time was ripe, after a short interval of two years, to increase the salaries of the judiciary.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government have left themselves open to this discussion.  Undoubtedly, there will be political reactions and I welcome them not for the sake of the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party or anybody else but on the basis that first things must come first.  Even if this increase were only £2,000 or £4,000, that is immaterial. There is an order of priorities we must establish.  Not alone must we do justice to the community but we must appear to do it, and we are certainly not doing it in regard to the weaker and poorer sections when they see the Government are able to find the money for this increase.  Even though it is not a big sum, they will say, as they are entitled to say and as we shall say for them, that they are forgotten, that when it comes to a question of principle, that principle does not count when it comes to an issue like this in respect of a section of the community with whom they are most in touch.</P>
    <P>As regards district justices, they are the nearest to the people.  They are the real courts of this country.  Any hard work that is done in the district courts.  The district justice has to be an all-round man and when we see such a big differential between the salary of the district justice and that of the bigwigs, there is room for examination, <Col N="768" /> as far as a Select Committee is concerned, of that differential which has been established by the Minister, in view of the kind of work performed by that group.  Let us not forget their job is just as responsible as that of the High Court judge.  They also dispense justice, they are broadminded and&mdash;I was going to say merciful&mdash;understanding. These district justices are closest to the people.  Let me remind the Minister that there is no necessity, in regard to the dispensing of justice in the lower courts, to have them dressed up in the flummery and ceremonial apparel which is attached to the Circuit, High and Supreme Courts.  The ordinary person going into the district court sees the district justice as a normal man and there is no question of lack of respect for the court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to pursue it, except to say that, apart from the salaries for which we are making provision, there is also a very big item which has not been taken very much into consideration in this discussion, namely, the expenses attaching to their batmen and the wearing apparel of the judges.  All that is part of the expenses of the upkeep of the court.  The Minister should bear that in mind when taking into consideration the increase in the cost of living, that provision is made already under some other heading besides this special Bill for these incidentals.  Even in the Minister's own section as far as the Garda Síochána is concerned, there is not a true reflection of the cost of these courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wanted information from me as to what it cost to keep a circuit court judge going in Roscommon, I could assure him that not alone was he getting this whopping big salary but he had a batman to look after him.  In addition to that, from Tuesday to Friday, four days of the week, there were at least 12 hefty, healthy young members of the Garda Síochána rounded up from stations ten and 12 miles away to provide a guard of honour at 11 o'clock in the morning and to bow him out at 5 o'clock in the <Col N="769" /> evening.  Does the Minister think that sort of thing in a town like Roscommon is justice?  The Minister would be doing a good day's work if he got rid of all that kind of humbug which does not add anything to the dispensing of justice.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude on this note.  I do not know how many Deputies who were listening to the Minister's opening statement heard the clock sound. I noticed it and I think a number of other Deputies noticed that while the Minister was delivering his opening address, the tick of that clock increased in intensity at least tenfold until he came to the climax of his statement.  It is the first time I have heard it in years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest this is a very inopportune time to bring a Bill such as this before the House.  Apart from the fact that it asks for a colossal increase for people who already have colossal salaries, it also shows to the country at large that the Government can find money for certain things which they think important and cannot find money for other things which the people think important.  The Minister made one statement by way of interruption when Deputy Corish was speaking.  He said, if I heard him correctly, that the judges would not get very much of this increase as it would be absorbed in income tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>Would it not have been more honest for the Government to make that quite clear when the Bill was being introduced and say to everybody: &ldquo;They will get only so much; the remainder will go back to the Government.  We are giving them this increase so that they can say they are now getting £6,000 a year.&rdquo;  It is unfortunate the Minister did not preface his remarks with that statement because it might have made a difference to some of the speeches made here.</P>
      <P>I want to reiterate what previous speakers have said&mdash;that we in the Labour Party believe the district justices are entitled to more money than they were getting.  We believe that they should receive an increase because they are the people in this country who, in co-operation with the Guards, administer justice.  They sit regularly and people come before them with the strangest cases.  They have to decide these cases on the spot.  They get a certain amount of co-operation from the solicitors for the prosecution and the defence but they have to make up their minds on the spot as to what should be done, what the law is and they have to temper justice with mercy.</P>
      <P>If they had to carry out the strict letter of the law, as is done in the higher courts, there would be an awful lot of people in jail in this country.  The result of their work is that we have a relatively law-abiding country as compared with other countries not so far away.  For that reason, we believe that district justices are entitled to increased salaries.  The suggestion that anybody, no matter who he may be, is entitled to get an increase dating back to last November of an amount equal to what an ordinary working man would earn in two years, even if most of it is to be paid back to the income tax authorities, is something which we cannot swallow, and for that reason we are opposing the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it was inevitable that certain things would be said in this debate.  It was inevitable that comparisons would be made with old age pensioners and with social welfare classes generally and that we <Col N="771" /> would be told that these increases are extravagant, unwarranted and unjustifiable. It was inevitable that we would be told that this small country cannot afford these extravagant salaries.  Having anticipated that these things would be said, I am still entitled to be more than a little surprised at the fact that they were said so often.  They are the stock arguments that are available to be used when a proposal of this nature comes before the House, a proposal which everybody knows is necessary and must go through but from which there is some political kudos to be gained by opposing it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish suggested it was unfair to imply that the Labour Party or any other Party were opposing this measure in order to achieve political gain.  It may be unfair but I am afraid I have no other alternative but to believe it.  What other conclusion can I come to when I see the Minister for Finance coming into this House less than a month ago and proposing salary increases to the higher paid officials of the public service amounting to £600,000 and the Supplementary Estimate carrying those increases being passed without a word of protest from any Deputy? Then I come in with a proposal which costs only £21,000 at the outset and which ultimately will not cost the Exchequer anything like that amount and I find all this opposition to it.  A sum of £600,000 goes through quickly.</P>

    <P>There is a peculiar anomaly in this matter.  Our people have an implicit faith in judges.  Time and again, when an independent inquiry is set up, there <Col N="774" /> is a demand that a judge should preside. Any time some impartial duty has to be carried out, people turn automatically to judges.  As a politician, I have often resented the underlying implication that members of political Parties cannot act impartially or preside impartially over some arbitration or commission of inquiry. But one can always trust a judge.  That is the underlying implication.  People believe in the independence and impartiality of the judiciary.  They value it but, somehow or other, when it comes to being paid for, they just do not want to pay.  That feeling is there and the most unpopular thing one can do is to come in here with a proposal to increase the salaries of judges.  I should like Deputies and people generally to be realistic about this.  We value our judiciary, their independence and integrity.  Let us make up our minds that, if we want to keep them that way, we must pay them.</P>
    <P>Old age pensions have nothing whatever to do with judges' salaries.  There is no connection whatsoever between them.  I want to make that crystal clear.</P>

      <P>At least half of that £21,000 will come back to the Exchequer in income tax.  We are left then with a sum of £10,000.  Even the Labour Party and Deputy McQuillan are prepared to give the district justices what we are giving them and, therefore, as Deputy Sherwin rightly pointed out, we are down to a figure of about £3,000 or £4,000.  What would one do with £3,000 or £4,000 if we threw out this Bill?  It would not be worth a thrawneen to any section of the community.  I want to make it quite clear that in giving this increase to judges, we are not taking anything from any other section of the community.</P>

We are not taking anything from the old age pensioners&mdash;they are in a class of their own&mdash;or anybody else in order to give these increases to the judges.</P>
      <P>People talk about an order of priorities. The suggestion was that I was coming in here pouring out money to the Chief Justice and depriving some old age pensioner of something.  That is ridiculous.

      <P>Deputy Mullen is, like myself, a good Dubliner.  I must assume he is sincere in his approach. He made a certain case.  I have been trying to analyse it.  If it is not just political tactics that is behind the opposition to this proposal, what is it?  No Deputy could seriously suggest it is the amount involved.  What <Col N="776" /> is it?  Is it that we are giving bad example?  There might be some force in that argument if we came along in a time of no change whatever in salaries and wages and gave a whopping increase to the judges, but that is not the position.  This proposal comes along at the end of the queue for the eighth round increase.  All sectors of the public service have got, or are on the verge of getting, their eighth round increase.  There is, therefore, no question of giving bad example.  It is not the amount of money.  It is not bad example.  What is the objection? Is it just that there is political capital to be made because of the human resentment on the part of ordinary people against rises for highly-paid individuals?</P>
      <P>I want now to deal with members of the Bar and what they earn.  I said &mdash;I repeat it now, and the Fine Gael front bench know that it is true&mdash;that there are at least three or four men at the Irish Bar who are earning so much money they would not take a Supreme Court judgeship.  In those circumstances, how can anyone argue that the judges are being over-paid? Deputy McQuillan made an eloquent plea that we want the best men appointed to the bench.  He agreed we have good men under the existing system, but he said we had not got the best.  Surely he is arguing for me there.  If he wants the best, then he must be prepared to pay a Supreme Court or High Court judge as much as and more than he can earn at the Bar.  That is subject to one slight qualification: there is prestige in being a member of the Bench, and that compensates to some extent for a fallen income.</P>

I am surprised to see the Labour Party coming in here, as some of the Deputies in the Labour Benches did, and advocating more or less that we should give these jobs to the lowest bidders.  That is a rather peculiar principle.</P>

      <P>The implication was made on a number of occasions today that the argument that you had to pay this salary to get good judges was not valid because you would get people anyway.  I am glad the Labour Party are reacting violently and rejecting any such suggestion.</P>
      <P>I also want to say a word about an argument which has been discussed a couple of times, about propriety.  I do not think that is really the most serious aspect of the problem&mdash;the argument that we have to pay judges substantial salaries in order to keep them free from corruption.  I do not think that is a really relevant argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one the Taoiseach used in 1959.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care who used it or when.  I am giving my own view.  I think this is more in the sense of what the Taoiseach said: Originally, in the nineteenth century when judges became paid by the State, their salaries were set at such a level as to make them completely independent and free from any possibility of corruption.  Up to that time, a judge lived to a large extent on the fines he could collect.  The original basis of judges' salaries was designed on that conception: that jugdes should be paid so well and so generously that they would be free from any element of corruption.  We should still have regard to the mainteance of that principle, but I do not think it is as important today as it was originally.  I am not advancing it as the reason for these increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies have spoken as if a salary of £6,000 were unknown or unheard of here.  We all know that is not true.  In a number of sectors of the public service, men are earning £6,000.  Indeed, we all know that in industry and commerce generally, a number of men in this community are earning £5,000 or £6,000 a year. Deputy Murphy from Cork is not <Col N="779" /> present now.  I understand that in some of the agricultural organisations dealing with farmers' produce, and owned and run by farmers, a salary of £6,000 is not unknown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not fall for this type of argument that £6,000 is an outrageous salary and that the only man in the country who is getting it is the Chief Justice.  It is just not true. More discussion seems to be directed to the remuneration of the Chief Justice than that of anybody else.  The point was made again and again that the Chief Justice is getting an increase in salary of £665.  I admit he is, but that is largely a status symbol increase. By the time income tax and surtax are taken off, the net increase to the Chief Justice will be £289.  That is a very relevant factor Deputies should keep in mind when considering this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy told me that the Chief Justice will now be earning as much as two Ministers and asked me did I think that was right.  I am not too anxious to say whether I think it is right or wrong at this stage. I want to point out that at the moment the Chief Justice's salary is equivalent to that of two Ministers. In other words, he is worth two Ministers. Before the war and right up to 1946, he was worth two and a half Ministers.  At least his position is not getting better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not say he was worth it.  He was getting that sort of salary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Now he is coming down.  He was equivalent to two and a half Ministers; and now he is worth only two.  Somebody&mdash;I think it was Deputy Tully&mdash;very rightly asked, if the amount of money involved here is so small, why are we bothering?  There is a very important aspect of this.  Do we not all know that a man's work or <Col N="780" /> value is judged by what he earns?  It is a human and natural thing and it is something which is very common here&mdash;to look down on a man who does not earn as much as you do.  I think that applies at all levels of our society.  It applies among tradesmen, labourers, professional classes &mdash; particularly professional classes.  It is there and we must face up to it.  For that reason, we cannot let the judiciary slip behind the other classes with whom they are normally comparable and with whom they started out exactly comparable when they began in 1924. A question of the prestige, honour and traditional integrity and respect of the judiciary is involved in this.</P>
      <P>I have a duty and the Government have a duty to see to it that our judiciary are maintained and continued in the high respect in which they are held by our people. Admittedly, I agree that they will retain that respect mainly by their conduct in the courts and by the manner in which they discharge their judicial functions.  But being the sort of society we are and the type of people we are, a very important part of that is bound up with the salary a man earns.  If we are to keep our judiciary in their proper place in the community, we must keep them at their proper salary levels and we must make sure judges are maintained <i>pari passu</i> with the other sections of the community with which they are mainly comparable.</P>
      <P>We have a duty to do in this regard and we shall do it, whether it is politically popular or not.  Ultimately, when the chips are down, I do not think this decision will be unpopular. We are doing our duty.  Fine Gael knows that very well and Deputy Sherwin, who has an unerring instinct in these matters, knows we are right. I may say that I had no idea of what Deputy Sherwin was going to do until he started on his sound, commonsense speech in the House.  As I said, the Government in this Bill are doing their duty courageously and I invite all men of principle and goodwill to follow me into the Division Lobby.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Before Section 2 to insert as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nothing contained in this Act or in any regulations made thereunder shall operate to abolish, delimit, curtail or render less operative functionally the existing grade of assistant pharmacist.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I notice in this Bill there is no mention whatsoever of assistant pharmacist.  In view of the fact that such qualification has existed down through the years, I am anxious to ensure that their interests will be preserved in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In retail shops up and down the country, many chemists employ an assistant.  The assistant has a modified qualification.  He does three years in a retail shop.  Then he does six months' lectures and then does an examination.  The duties of an assistant are simply that he can do temporary duty for a qualified pharmacist for a period of two months and also, he can act as a cover for the principal.</P>
      <P>I submit that, in view of the fact that a lot of the work done in the ordinary retail chemist shops consists of little more than selling cosmetics and cameras, it would seem ridiculous to have a situation arise whereunder nobody would be employed in these shops except a person who had taken a degree in pharmacy at a university. It would also mean that a number of poor people who could qualify as an assistant and get employment would for ever be precluded from that type of occupation.  Furthermore, it would mean that the average pharmacist would find it more expensive to run his retail business and, as a consequence, the cost of these services to the public would be increased.  It is for these reasons that I have moved this amendment, namely, to preserve that particular qualification as assistant pharmacist and also in the interests of those who already are assistant pharmacists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is said that any assistant pharmacist <Col N="785" /> can afterwards qualify as a full pharmacist now as in the past.  I feel that as that type of person is not mentioned in the Bill, it may afterwards transpire that the post of assistant pharmacist may be obliterated in time, to the detriment of the average retail pharmacist and consequently to the cost to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The mover of this amendment is under a misapprehension. There is nothing in the Bill relating to assistant pharmacists.  The reason for that is that their present position is not being altered in any way.</P>
      <P>The existing statutory provision relating to assistants to pharmaceutical chemists is Section 19 of the Pharmacy Act (Ireland), 1875, Amendment Act, 1890: It reads as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;19.  The council may cause examinations to be held at such times and in such manner as may be prescribed by them from time to time for the purpose of examining assistants to pharmaceutical chemists, and such assistants as shall pass such examinations shall be competent to transact the business of a licentiate of the Pharmaceutical Society in his temporary absence, but shall not be entitled to conduct or manage a business or to keep open shop on their own account.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This section is not being repealed. It will stand as part of the law and there will accordingly be no interference with the existing rights of an assistant to a pharmaceutical chemist to transact the business of a registered pharmaceutical chemist in his temporary absence.</P>
      <P>The examinations for qualification as assistant to a pharmaceutical chemist will continue to be held.  My legal advice is to the effect that nothing in the Bill will affect the method whereby a person may become qualified as an assistant to a pharmaceutical chemist or whereby an assistant can qualify as a pharmaceutical chemist. Therefore, the amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9 is consequential on amendments Nos. 17, 2 and 5.  I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>(b)  the person is&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  the legal personal representative of a person who at the <Col N="787" /> time of his death was lawfully keeping open shop for the dispensing or compounding of medical prescriptions, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  the trustee or committee of a person lawfully keeping open shop for the dispensing or compounding of medical prescriptions who is adjudged bankrupt or becomes an arranging debtor or becomes of unsound mind,</P>
    <P>and the shop and the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions therein are personally managed by an authorised person, or.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the right to keep open shop for the dispensing or compounding of medical prescriptions so as to provide for the continuance of such business where the person keeping open shop dies or becomes bankrupt or of unsound mind.  The open shop in such cases may be kept by the representatives of the person but it will have to be managed by an appropriately qualified person.  The keeping of open shop in these circumstances will be subject to regulations made by the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society.  The regulations will be made under the new expanded subsection providing for regulations, proposed to be inserted by Amendment No. 9.</P>
    <P>The provision in so far as it relates to the continuance of business after the death of a person keeping open shop is a modern version, expanded to cover both pharmaceutical chemists and allied classes, of an existing provision&mdash;Section 32 of the 1875 Act&mdash;which related to pharmaceutical chemists only, and which, under Amendment No. 17 will now be repealed.  In so far as the provision relates to keeping open shop in the event of bankruptcy or unsound mind, it is new to our Pharmacy legislation but is in line with the corresponding legislation in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The amendment is in line with the views of the Pharmaceutical Society and the Apothecaries Hall in this matter.</P>

      <P>The amendment seems reasonable but may I just express surprise that it should be found necessary?  It appears strange to me that those responsible for the drafting of the Bill were not aware some considerable time ago that this obvious omission exists in the heads of the Bill. It surprises me that the provision now proposed to be inserted did not in fact appear in the green draft which we have in front of us now.  It is perfectly clear that this amendment, which, on my information, became apparent as a result of the discussion of the provisions of the Bill between the Apothecaries Hall and the Pharmaceutical Society, should be inserted and that it is a desirable amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>Before subsection (3) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  No person shall be employed by a manufacturing or wholesale chemist in the sale of poisons whose qualifications do not accord with those of an authorised person as defined in the Acts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for the purpose of clarification.  I am not clear whether there is any legal provision that a person acting as traveller for manufacturing or wholesale chemists must have certain qualifications. While we are very strict, and rightly so, about the qualifications a person must have who is in charge of a chemist shop, we should be equally strict in regard to persons acting as travellers for the sale of medicines which may be termed poisons.  With the best will in the world, I do not think it is possible for the average doctor to keep up to date with the wonderful modern developments taking place in various therapeutic preparations coming on the market with the speed of light.  I know that finally we must make our own judgment but it is desirable that we should have intermediaries between the medical profession and the wholesalers who would have a certain amount of authority, and that the professional man should be able to rely on whatever he is told by this traveller.  If it is a fact that such travellers already must be so qualified, then my case falls to the ground but I do think there is a case, where a layman is dealing with dangerous drugs, dangerous from the point of view of the poisons they contain or the side-effects they may have on the patient, for his being able to talk on level terms with the doctor so that any information which he has will be information which has been explained to him and which he understands because of his training and on which the doctor can rely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>While not disagreeing with the intention expressed by Deputy Dr. Browne in this amendment, <Col N="791" /> there is a difficulty in it which needs particularisation.  Firstly, &ldquo;No persons shall be employed&rdquo; seems to cover all employees which would be going rather far.  However, I do agree with Deputy Dr. Browne as regards the necessity for control and to have properly qualified Pharmacists in charge and in certain cases actually carrying out the operations necessary to secure the standard which Deputy Dr. Browne as a doctor would require.</P>
      <P>He has raised an interesting point which I think the Minister might consider, that is, the relationship between the doctor and the manufacturing chemist.  Recently, I had reason to inquire in an academic way into the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and their distribution to the medical profession.  As Deputy Dr. Browne rightly remarks, the doctor in modern times is largedly dependent on the guarantee of the firm which sells to him any particular preparation.  As to their efficacy, they are dependent on the salesmen of these organisations and in those circumstances, it might be desirable to consider the qualifications of the intermediary, whether he be a professional salesman or whatever he may be.  This is a matter which should be considered but I think the wording of the amendment would require some particularisation.  It appears to me to be too wide.</P>
      <P>There is another point which I should like to make and it is this&mdash; what do you mean by chemist?  Traditionally, to the man in the street, the chemist means the pharmaceutical chemist around the corner.  Now, however, the term chemist is very much wider.  There are very large classes of chemical practitioners who are not in any way related to the pharmaceutical industry at all.  There are physical chemists, organic chemists and even bio-chemists, all practising professionally in this modern complex world and most of them have no relationship with the practice of pharmacy at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;manufacturing or wholesale chemist,&rdquo; strictly speaking, could apply to the manufacture of chemicals for industrial purposes or to the wholesaling <Col N="792" /> of them for industrial purposes. That is a large business in itself and I do not think that Deputy Dr. Browne intends to capture these by such an amendment.  Again, I should imagine that there are substances classified as poisons pharmaceutically which have a large industrial usage and are manufactured industrially.  Is a poison such as cyanide classified as a poison pharmaceutically? If it is, it would mean that no one could manufacture cyanide and the illogical result would follow that a person engaged in electroplating or gold mining and who is using cyanide would have to be a pharmacist. This is an important legal point and I thank Deputy Dr. Browne for giving me the opportunity of raising it. There are probably other substances that I could think of in the same connection.</P>
    <P>I have seen large chemical factories on the Continent where there are a number of plants but where one division is pharmaceutical.  You have such things as a chlorine plant, a sulphuric acid plant and certain organic chemical plants with no direct relation to pharmacy and you have a unit dealing with pharmaceutical preparations, all in the one factory. Quite clearly, what Deputy Dr. Browne wishes here is to ensure that in so far as pharmaceutical preparations are concerned, they should be produced by adequately skilled personnel and in this case the role of the pharmacist is important.  There is something more, that in the chain of selling and in the chain of information in regard to these things, some qualifications should be necessary. There is the question of how we can divide pharmaceutical chemists from other chemists in view of the peculiar use of the word &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; in the pharmaceutical sense.  I say that on behalf of the other body of chemists who are not less chemists than the pharmacists.  I would ask the Minister to see that such adequate distinction should be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Dr. Browne's point to be that we should ensure that anyone who is travelling around, as many high-class <Col N="793" /> firms have travellers, to the medical profession should be fully qualified as pharmacists so that they may be able to put up these products to the doctors who are dealing with them.  These people do not actually sell the products.  They travel on behalf of them and they make known to the medical man concerned what they consist of and they place before them the new products that come out from time to time.  I think the Minister should give it active consideration, irrespective of whether or not it is necessary, because most of the travellers I have had dealings with, particularly if they represent well-known firms, such as Burroughs Wellcome and Co. or Parke Davis, are qualified chemists and have themselves actually served behind the counter in the dispensing and sale of drugs.  There are, however, other people connected with the lesser known firms who are not pharmaceutical chemists.  Therefore, for the purpose of tying this up completely so that it will be conducted by a qualified profession, there is a great deal in Deputy Dr. Browne's amendment.  I suggest the Minister might seriously consider accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me point out that this Bill relates only to what might be described as sale by retail and it prescribes only the qualifications to be possessed by those individuals who compound and dispense medical prescriptions for the general public, whose knowledge of these matters may be taken to be not extensive.  It also deals with that class of individuals who sell poisons as distinct from medicines, and prescribes the qualifications to be possessed by them if they are to be entitled to sell poisons by retail.  As I said, these two classes deal with the general public whose knowledge may be taken to be limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The representatives of manufacturers and wholesalers do not deal with the general public.  They deal with pharmaceutical chemists who are qualified to form their own views as to the safety with which these drugs may be handled or their efficacy as curative agents; or they are dealing <Col N="794" /> with medical practitioners whose knowledge is, I assume, no less than that of the pharmaceutical chemists. There is not, therefore, the same need to impose restrictions upon the type of person who may be sent out, not to sell but to solicit orders, from those who are in a position to ascertain for themselves, if they have any doubt whether it will be safe to handle the commodities offered to them and passed on by them by retail to the public.</P>
    <P>Apart from that fundamental fact, this Bill relates only to those who sell and dispense medical prescriptions to the general public or to that other class whose powers of sale are more limited in that they are restricted to selling poisons to the general public and who will have further guidance. The schedule of poisonous substances is already in existence and it will be further expanded when Comhairle na Nimheanna is set up, as it will be, next month.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not necessary to establish the proper controls on wholesale dealing in poisons.  The sale of poisons will be dealt with basically in regulations under Section 14 of the Poisons Act passed last year.  The class of persons who may deal in poisons and the conditions to be complied with in such dealing will be specified in regulations under subsection (3) (b) of that particular section. In the Act itself, it is provided that these regulations relate to wholesale and retail dealing.  The word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; is defined as &ldquo;sale includes sale by wholesale and sale by retail, and cognate words shall be construed accordingly.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These regulations to be made by the Board can cover to the extent necessary the specification of what classes of persons may engage in wholesale dealing in poisons.  The purpose of subsection (2) of Section 2 of the Bill, to which the amendment has been moved, is merely to preserve the existing rights of authorised persons and registered druggists in retail dealing in poisons so that these rights cannot be wiped out under regulations made under Section 14 of the Poisons Act.  As the law <Col N="795" /> stands, Section 31 of the Pharmacy Act of 1875 specifically excludes wholesale dealing from the scope of that measure.  This Bill is based upon the 1875 Act and is really a modernisation of certain provisions in that measure.</P>
    <P>All the regulations made after consultation with Comhairle na Nimheanna in relation to poisonous substances will be laid on the Table of the House and can be discussed here in the House.  If any Deputy feels that a regulation should be annulled because it does not prescribe the qualifications to be possessed by those who are employed by manufacturers or wholesalers to solicit orders, because that is what they do, he can put down an amendment or raise the matter here in discussion.  If necessary, the regulation can thus be defeated and sent back to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I suggest Deputy Dr. Browne should withdraw his amendment.  This is not the Bill to which it should be made and another opportunity will be offered in the not too distant future for discussing the qualifications which should be possessed by those who solicit orders for drugs and medicines on behalf of manufacturers or wholesalers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> This amendment is really consequential on amendment No. 16.  The purpose of amendment No. 16 is to provide for the commencement of different provisions of the Act on different days, in spite of the entire Act being brought into operation at the one time as was originally intended.  When that Act was being drafted, it had not been anticipated that regulations under Section 14 of the Poisons Act, 1961, could have been made before this Bill became law.  The making of these regulations will in general have to await the recommendations of Comhairle na Nimheanna.  That Comhairle has now been established, but in view of the wide field of their activities, it may be some little time before they are in a position to furnish their recommendations.</P>
    <P>The regulations under the Poisons Act, as I have said, would <i>inter alia</i> specify the classes of persons entitled to engage in the sale of poisons.  If the Pharmacy Act were to be brought into operation in its entirely at a time when regulations under the Poisons Act had not yet been made, it would mean that the only classes of persons entitled to engage in the selling of poisons would be those specified in Section 2 of the Bill.  That section does not provide for the sale of poisons used exclusively for agricultural or veterinary purposes by agricultural traders, seedsmen and similar classes of persons who are licensed to do so under Section 2 of the Poisons and Pharmacy Act, 1908.  That section exempts these traders from the general provisions relating to the keeping of open shop for the sale of poisons contained in Section 30 of the 1875 Act and Section 15 of the 1890 Act. The commencement of Section 2 of the Bill and the concurrent repeal of Section 30 of the 1875 Act and Section 15 of the 1890 Act, prior to the making of regulations under the Poisons Act would therefore withdraw the protection now enjoyed by this class of trader and would mean that the operations of all such persons would be illegal.  This was not intended when the Poisons Act was going through, and it is necessary to safeguard all existing rights by taking power to <Col N="797" /> bring the Act in, section by section. I am now reverting to amendment No. 8, and there are a number of other amendments as well.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 28, after &ldquo;premises&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and consisting of or including the selling by retail of drugs or poisons&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (4) of Section 3 prohibits the use, in connection with any business, of a description, title or emblem which might reasonably suggest that the person conducting the business or a person employed by him possessed some qualifications in pharmacy unless such person in fact has such qualifications.  Subsection (5) lists a number of descriptions&mdash; pharmacy, medical stores, drug stores, drug hall, medical supply stores and chemist, the use of which in connection with a business, will be regarded as suggesting the possession of qualifications in pharmacy.  The Institute <Col N="799" /> of Chemistry, which represents the persons with academic qualifications in chemistry to whom Deputy de Valera referred, have protested that the provisions appear to equate the use of the description &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; in connection with a business with the possession of qualifications in pharmacy. They claim that their members' rights to the use of the description &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; in connection with a business might thus be infringed on.  It had been considered that the use of the description &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; by persons other than pharmacists, would be a description of professional status rather than a business description. The amendment, however, will remove any doubts and will specify that it is only in connection with a premises where the business of retail pharmacy is allegedly carried on that the description &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; is forbidden to non-pharmacists. Persons with academic qualifications qualified in chemistry will be free to use the description &ldquo;chemist&rdquo; in connection with the manufacture or distribution of chemical products.</P>

      <P>Just a question on this section.  This Society will regulate the examinations in schools of pharmacy and I have been informed it is desirable something more than the retail side of pharmacy should be taken into account in the matter of representation on the council of the Society.  There are other important branches of pharmacy developing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> There is hospital pharmacy, public health pharmacy, research pharmacy in the university schools of pharmacy. I should accordingly like to ask the Minister whether any consideration has been given to the bringing in of these interests to the council.  Another way of putting the question is whether there is a case for broadening the constitution of the council of the Society so as to include representation on the council of those important branches of pharmacy which I have mentioned. There is also, of course, industrial and manufacturing pharmacy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental fact we have to remember when talking about pharmacists, whether they are pharmacists who keep open shop for the sale of poisons or those who are employed by manufacturers, is that they have qualified as pharmacists by examinations held by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and that their fundamental training does not differ in any way from that received by the pharmacists who make a living by keeping open shop or who are in the employment of persons who keep open shop.</P>
      <P>There is the difference, of course, that the people who keep open shop in the end are the people who support this Society; it is they who have to pay fees for registration and for the provision of these courses and through which the other classes of pharmacists referred to secure their qualifications to practise.  There is no reason whatever why those who are employed by manufacturing chemists or those working for local authorities or in hospitals or other institutions should not join the Society and become entitled, through their votes and their support to secure representation on the council.  Neither is there any real justification for trying to establish in a special position those who have not done so very much to advance the profession of pharmacy as those who have maintained the Pharmaceutical Society since it was first established.  Those who complain that they are not sufficiently represented on the council have a perfectly good remedy&mdash;they can join the Society, participate in its proceedings and share the burden of defraying the costs of the Society's functions.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister misunderstood me.  I was assuming that the persons I referred to&mdash;what I would call the new specialities in pharmacy&mdash;were only members, licentiates or graduates of the Pharmaceutical Society.  I quite agree there is no conflict between the Minister and myself about the unity of the profession.  Let me confess that I am making the point because it was made to me.  The point was that because of the growth of the profession in those other fields, it might perhaps lead to an improvement in the structure of the Society if those people were more widely represented on the council.  The plea was simply this&mdash;to make the point that within the Society itself, from the point of view of balanced, up-to-date and progressive courses, these other interests I have mentioned, these younger branches of pharmacy, would get adequate representation.</P>

I do not think that is fair.  If they want to secure greater representation on the Council, there is an open road.  If they want to be able to influence more heavily the courses provided by the Council, let them joint the Society, pay the subscription, get a vote and get the representation on the Council which they are now seeking as a special concession.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> With the upgrading of the Pharmaceutical College now, students will have to do three years in U.C.D. and two of B.Sc. in Pharmacy and, after that, I understand, one year practical and then graduates sit for some small licentiate examination before the Pharmaceutical Society and then achieve membership of the Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are now in a position, as regards qualification, and from a statutory point of view, to seek reciprocal arrangements with Great Britain.  In those circumstances, would it not be a desirable adjustment to facilitate the inclusion of some medical representatives, as obtains in Britain?  I feel if that were done, it would facilitate our negotiations for the establishment of reciprocal arrangements.  In the absence of such arrangements at present, all an Irish pharmacist can do is to go to England and practise there as an unqualified person.  He may get <Col N="804" /> more money but he is regarded as unqualified, in the absence of reciprocal arrangements.

      <P>The point Deputy Hogan has made is surely worth considering.  The constitution of the council of the Pharmaceutical Society is, as laid down in the parent statute of 1875.  At that stage, the Society was quite a different Society from what is now envisaged under this Bill.  It has grown up.  Its activities are very much extended and the effect of the work its members are going to do obviously will have a much different effect on the medical profession and on other bodies.  Elsewhere, certainly in England, if my information is correct, the council does consist of much wider and broader representation than here and it does include medical practitioners. It also includes representatives of the teaching department.  Here it is confined, as at present constituted, to members of the Pharmaceutical Society.  It expressly excludes doctors and anyone who has anything to do with teaching.  That seems to be a very confined constitution.  While I appreciate that the Bill here is of a limited aspect and scope, it does appear that at some stage the Minister must consider the proper composition of the council and whether <Col N="805" /> the council should not be recognised to deal more effectively with the added scope of the Society itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the council is in fact, prohibited by law from conducting examinations which might be held to be purely medical examinations.  There is a provision in Section 21 of the 1875 Act that the Society's examinations &ldquo;shall not include the theory and practice of medicine, surgery, or midwifery or any branch of medicine or surgery; and the examiners appointed by the council are hereby empowered, after such examinations respectively, to grant or refuse to such persons, as in their discretion may seem fit, certificates of competent knowledge and qualification and skill to be registered as pharmaceutical chemists or as chemists and druggists under this Act.&rdquo;  I imagine that that restriction was imposed on the council in the interests of the pharmaceutical chemist.</P>

        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> So far as the qualifications in pharmacy will be adopted here and the teaching associated with it, if it is to follow parallel lines with Britain, there will be a growing emphasis away from pure dispensing and increasing emphasis on drugs, even on physiology, and on public health.  I ask the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter, particularly in view of the fact that it would be desirable in the public interest to have medical representatives on the council as well as pure pharmacists.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>To delete subsection (3) and (4) and substitute a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>(3) The Council may charge a fee in respect of registration and the amount of such fee shall be determined from time to time by the Council with the consent of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="806" /> What I hope to do here is the imposition of an annual levy.  At the moment I think there are 1,100 chemists who are members of the Pharmaceutical Society and 1,500 who are not members.  I think membership means paying four guineas per annum.</P>
    <P>I feel that in all these matters the question of free association arises. When a doctor qualifies, he pays a fee for registration.  That is just one fee. It gives him the right to practise. After that, he may, if he wishes, join the I.M.A. or the B.M.A., but it is voluntary, and he has to pay an annual fee.</P>
    <P>I feel that association should make itself sufficiently attractive to get everybody to join voluntarily.  I should like to see every doctor here a member of the I.M.A.; they are not. However, I should be the last person in the world to suggest that any statutory provision should be made to force them to join; just the same as I feel it might be desirable that men in certain vocations should belong to a certain association or union.</P>
    <P>I feel at the same time we should not introduce legal provisions to compel people to join a certain association or union, whether it be the Boilermakers' Union or any other union.  The same principle of free association obtains here, particularly when you think that the majority will now be forced by statute to become members.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill dealing only with retail shops, ordinary chemist shops in our towns and villages.  Yet, this Bill envisages incorporation by statute, the compulsion to pay an annual fee by everybody, whether he works in a hospital, in some kind of dispensary for an income or whether he is a traveller on the road for some pharmaceutical house.</P>
    <P>I believe that for that type of person who does not keep open shop to be asked to pay an annual fee into a society, which he has not been doing up to this, is an interference with free association.  It is even complained that under existing conditions&mdash;whether or not it will improve the new Bill is another matter &mdash; hospital teaching <Col N="807" /> pharmacists are not sufficiently represented at the moment in the Pharmaceutical Society.</P>
    <P>If you join any medical association, you get something in return.  If you join the Royal Society of Medicine or the B.M.A., you get the services of a journal.  You get a library and advisory service.  They even provide rooms, if you attend luncheon, or other places, and they provide for post-graduate courses.  Here, men are being asked to pay an annual fee and there is no talk of a journal, no talk of their getting anything in return for this annual fee which they are being forced to pay.  I understand it is being set aside for the education of future pharmacists.  In other words, I am being asked to pay a levy, by Act of Parliament, to educate somebody else in the same profession. It seems to be a little illogical.</P>
    <P>It looks as if a certain number of the pharmacists who are members of the Pharmaceutical Society have taken the Minister under their wing, or can it be that the Minister has taken them under his wing?  However, at least they have come to a nice arrangement and it looks as if the rights of free association of the others is being set aside. I should much prefer to leave it purely voluntary and thereby encourage the Pharmaceutical Society, which I wish well, to put their house in order and to make their association sufficiently attractive, as we tried to do in the medical profession to encourage members to come in and pay an annual fee. If they can do that, I think it is the proper approach.  For us to step in and say: &ldquo;Stand and deliver&rdquo; to those who, so far, have shown unwillingness to become members of the Pharmaceutical Society is an interference with the fundamental liberty of the person.</P>

      <P>If they have any pride in their craft, they become members. Less than 50 per cent. are members.  The Society cannot carry out all that work: it mystifies me how the Society did carry on during recent years, in particular, with scientific training advancing to the extent it did &mdash;improved laboratories, more expensive staff, and so on.  That burden has been put on the people who voluntarily become members of the Society.  No society is finished with its licentiates when they are qualified. It must keep registers.  It looks after their interests in life afterwards, irrespective of whether or not they are members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I am taking the Royal College of Physicians, which is pretty close to pharmacy.  They charge a fee for licences and after that, there is no fee. They charge a fee for a licence and then the man can go out and practise. If the man afterwards wants to seek a higher qualification, he can take a fellowship, just the same as you have here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have no objection to a society asking for a higher fee from a fellow: he is looking for the higher qualification.  The other type of person is looking for the right to live. I would draw that parallel.  You can charge anything you like if the applicant wants to become a Fellow of the Royal College of Pharmacists. If he wants that, let him be prepared to pay a good fee annually for it.  I believe it is a semi-honorary title and carries certain privileges.  However, if he wants the humble right to <Col N="809" /> practise and make his living, is it not sufficient to charge a fee for being registered and to charge the Fellows afterwards?  Let them pay an annual fee.  The Royal College gives tuition from the first to the sixth or seventh year that it is necessary to qualify a medical man.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Hogan has shut his eyes to a very important fact which Deputy Brady has mentioned, that is that this Society protects pharmacists in their livelihood.  To some extent, it is a qualifying body, a professional body, if you like, but it also performs the functions of a trade union, and every <Col N="810" /> trade union expects the members to pay their subscription.  I think the Pharmaceutical Society should do likewise. It is not unique: take the opticians, the Dental Board, patents agents and others.  All these people have to pay.</P>
