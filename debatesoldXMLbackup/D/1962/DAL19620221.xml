    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan  Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. McQuillan</b> asked the Taoiseach whether he has seen a report that the foreign ministry in Copenhagen published a 500 page report on the economic consequences of Denmark's joining the EEC; and whether the Government, using similar methods and studying the experience gained by those countries which have already operated within the EEC since 1958, will provide the Dáil with a comprehensive white paper to include the possible and probable political, economic and defence implications of Ireland's joining the EEC, as a preparation for a full debate on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to regarding the publication of a document by the Danish authorities on the economic consequences of Denmark's joining the EEC.</P>
      <P>I would remind the Deputies that the Government issued last June a White Paper on the EEC and that this House and the public have subsequently been kept informed of developments in relation to our application for membership of the Community.  It is intended to continue the practice of making available information regarding various aspects of our application, as occasion requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the economic consequences of membership, Deputies are aware that a series of industrial surveys has been put in hands, directed towards an examination of the difficulties that may be created for particular industries and the formulation of <Col N="385" /> positive measures of adjustment and adaptation.  Until the information which is being collected in the course of these surveys has been assembled and examined, it will not be possible to draw any firm conclusions as to the consequences for particular industries of membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>So far as I am aware, the Danish authorities have not previously issued any document corresponding to a White Paper on the question of membership of the Community.  As soon as copies of the document referred to in the question can be obtained, I shall have it examined with a view to ascertaining whether it possesses any features which have not been covered in the information made available in relation to our application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Taoiseach to accept, in relation to previous questions, the principle of issuing a further White Paper so as to bring developments in connection with our application for membership of EEC up to date.  Can he give any indication as to when such a White Paper will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give an indication of an intention to issue a further White Paper at this time.  I undertook to try and make available an authentic text at the earliest possible time of the EEC decisions in relation to agricultural policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall in the course of a number of questions, answers and supplementary questions a suggestion that the publication of a White Paper at a reasonably early stage would contribute materially by providing the necessary available information not only for the information of the House but for the information of the public in general?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, we have already published a White Paper in which we have set out all the available information in respect to the constitution and procedures of EEC. We have given all the information available to us of developments in the meantime.  The most important development has been the making of decisions regarding agricultural policy. <Col N="386" /> The texts of these decisions, as soon as they are available to us, will be communicated to Deputies.  I think it would be quite unreasonable to ask the Government, during the progress of the discussions with the Community, to publish a White Paper containing statements of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to press the Taoiseach unduly to deal with hypothetical questions during the course of the discussions going on at the moment, but there has been an accumulation of documents such as the draft of the Fouchet Committee declaration and the policy declaration. The Fouchet Committee is sitting again and that committee, of course, will issue a declaration.  Perhaps, the Taoiseach would bring out a White Paper at a reasonably early date so that people might refer to it for the information they feel they are entitled to have and which I, too, feel they are entitled to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Every effort will be made to supply the House with all the factual information that will become available, but a White Paper presupposes statements of Government policy and I do not think it would be desirable to undertake anything of that kind at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach must understand that there is general confusion on Government policy in relation to the application for membership and the negotiations in regard to the Common Market and he himself is&mdash; I am sure, without intending to be&mdash; on record with conflicting statements in relation to the political implications of our joining, and conflicting statements in regard to the nature of the policy which we now have and the policy which we held, let us say, in 1949.  In these changing circumstances, is it not clear that we cannot get satisfactory elucidation to the Common Market by means of question and answer in this way?  It is unsatisfactory from the Government's point of view and from every other point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite untrue to say there have been conflicting statements and points of view and <Col N="387" /> any confusion that may exist is only in the minds of those who find the facts are not what they want them to be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says the Government have no declared policy on certain aspects of Common Market policy, but is it not a fact that, as soon as we are accepted, if we are accepted, we will be committed to the policy already made by the member States?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We will be committed to whatever emerges as a result of the discussions which, I hope, will be proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Taoiseach misunderstands me. Certain policy has been determined by the member States.  If, and when, we become members we will be committed to policy already made by the member States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as policy decisions have been taken by EEC in the implementation of the Rome Treaty, then certainly we are committed to what the Community has already decided, except to the extent that we may seek to secure some modification of these decisions having regard to the special circumstances of our own case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  That is my difficulty.  I just want to ask the Taoiseach is it not a fact that in November last he said nobody could authoritatively say what the political implications of the Common Market were?  Then, very recently, he said we are completely accepting the implications of joining the Common Market. In those circumstances, we are in the dark as to what the Taoiseach thinks are the implications.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Resolution on Political Co-operation between the Member States of the European Communities.</Title>
    <P>The European Parliament,</P>
    <P>Having noted the results of the first conference of heads of Government and Ministers for Foreign Affairs which took place in Paris on 10 and 11 February 1961,</P>
    <P>Considers</P>
    <P>(i)  that periodic meetings of the heads of Government or of the Ministers responsible for the foreign policy of the Member States of the European Communities can help to strengthen such co-operation usefully and to the best effect;</P>

    <P>(a)  if it provided for participation by the Executives of the Communities in the discussion of any <Col N="391" /> question concerning the fulfilment of their tasks;</P>
    <P>(b)  if it does not encroach upon the functioning or the competences of these Communities and their Institutions under the Treaties of Rome and Paris, and if it strengthens these Communities;</P>
    <P>(c)  if the Governments report to the Parliament at least once a year on the state of political co-operation;</P>

      <P>I am well satisfied with our current forestry programme, which, at the recently-attained annual planting rate of 25,000 acres, is really substantial for a country of our size and resources.  Indeed, in relation to population, it is the most extensive programme of afforestation being undertaken anywhere in Europe today. In the five years ending next month, the area of new State plantations laid down will reach about 120,000 acres. I see no reason to alter the arrangements under which this excellent progress has been achieved.</P>

The omission does not have an appreciable effect on the index and, in fact, hospital expenses constituted less than 0.25 per cent. of total expenditure as recorded at the Household Budget Inquiry 1951-52 on which the index number is based.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I replied to the Deputy's question on 6th December last, I have looked afresh at the question of the publication of the booklet, in the light of the need to apply the resources which the Minister for Finance can make available to me to the best advantage in the administration and provision of health services.  To be of real use, the booklet would need to have a very wide circulation and consequently the cost of publication and distribution would be considerable. This expenditure would be largely waste if in a year or so the booklet had to be radically revised and, in view of the review of the health services shortly to be undertaken by the Select Committee of this House, I feel that it would be preferable to defer publication until all changes which may follow such review have been decided.</P>
      <P>I am strengthened in this view by the fact that, with the passage of time and in the absence of any material changes in the scope of the services, the public are becoming increasingly familiar with their eligibility under the various heads and the manner in which they should go about availing themselves of any service.  In fact, I think that the stage has been reached where no member of the public is now deprived of a service because of ignorance of his eligibility or of the steps he must take to secure it.</P>

Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, the Department has published a coloured poster, which is very widely displayed all over the country, and which makes people fully familiar with all the services available to them.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will formulate standard procedure and obligations for all local authorities in regard to the administration of social welfare legislation, particularly in regard to the issue of medical cards, and thus eliminate the present differences in administration of the social welfare services which occur between the various local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart altogether from schemes of social insurance and assistance which are not administered by local authorities, social welfare services include the provision of housing for the working classes, provision of labourers' cottages, provision of meals for school children, free or cheap fuel and footwear schemes, home assistance and medical services, all of which present their special problems relating to eligibility and standards.  It would appear, however, from the Deputy's question, that he is particularly concerned with the functions of local authorities under Section 14 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure for the maintenance <Col N="395" /> of the General Medical Services Registers and the issue of medical cards, in connection with the general practitioner service, under the section of the Health Act mentioned, is governed by Articles 9 to 13 of the General Medical Services Regulations, 1954.  Each decision on entitlement is, however, a matter for the health authority and I have no power to specify standards or give detailed instructions to health authorities on the practical considerations which might govern such decisions.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, however, one of the Terms of Reference of the Select Committee of this House which will shortly be established is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;to review the existing arrangements for determining whether a person is or is not within an eligible category&rdquo; (i.e. a category eligible for health services).</P>
    <P>The Committee will also be required to make recommendations on these and such other matters related to the health services and their operation as they think fit.  Dáil Éireann will, therefore, have the opportunity of considering in due course any recommendations which the Committee may make in regard to the administration of the General Medical Services as well as other services for which I am the responsible Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Bearing in mind that the local authorities in the person of the managers usually have absolute autonomy in determining who should or should not receive a medical service card and that the Select Committee of the House is to investigate the health services, is the Minister not aware that the application of the means test in determining who should get a medical service card varies very much from local authority to local authority? Pending the findings of this Select Committee of the House, would he not try to get some uniformity in the application of the means test to those who apply for medical service cards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that would be quite impossible.  Subject to <Col N="396" /> what the Committee may say, my present view is that the question of eligibility for entry upon the general medical service register can best be determined by those who know the circumstances in their own area and can relate the circumstances of a particular person to those generally obtaining in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCarroll" hpid="Mr. Carroll Mr. Carroll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carroll</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister at this stage consider it advisable to issue a direction to those concerned that medical cards should be issued on application without waiting for the unwieldy investigation which sometimes takes over a week, thereby denying to many people the medical services to which the medical card would entitle them in the interim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to overlook the fact that what is applied for is the right to have one's name inscribed in the general medical register.  The medical card is proof that the name is there and, in general, the name is there for one year entitling the possessor of the card to general practitioner service for one year.  If a person is in obvious need of medical attention, he may go at once to the persons designated by the health authority and apply for a card which will give him immediate medical service.  That will not entitle him to remain on the register for a year and if it is found that the card has been issued on the basis of false representations made by him, then, of course, he is responsible for payment of the usual medical fee for the attention given to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that an improved dental service should be provided for persons in the lower income group who are eligible for dental services from local health authorities. The extent to which such a service can be provided is, however, limited by two factors viz. the dental personnel and the funds available.  It is settled policy that dental services for children, who in the long run will benefit most, should be given priority in the use of the available resources.  According as personnel and funds become available, however, services for adults are being improved, due regard being had to the need to maintain and improve the services for children.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be particularly interested in the position in County Mayo where two wholetime dental surgeons are at present employed by Mayo County Council.  These two dental surgeons are fully occupied in providing a dental service for children. Some months ago I approved of the creation of a senior dental surgeon post in Mayo and a few weeks ago I also approved of the creation of another ordinary wholetime dental post.  Steps are being taken to have these two posts filled through the Local Appointments Commission. When Mayo County Council have the services of four dental surgeons, it should be possible for them to provide some dental services for persons in the lower income group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The obligation on health authorities to pay the full approved charge for eligible patients receiving treatment in extern institutions is limited to patients sent in by them or with their prior approval, although in certain areas, e.g., in Dublin where, because of the special circumstances that the health authority is in a position to provide facilities in its own institutions for only a minority of the patients requiring hospital treatment, patients who enter extern hospitals are deemed for payment purposes <Col N="400" /> to have been sent in by the health authority.</P>
      <P>Save in the areas where the special arrangement mentioned applies, eligible patients who enter extern hospitals without the prior consent of their health authority are covered by Section 25 of the Health Act, 1953.</P>
      <P>In such cases, where an eligible patient accepts treatment in a public ward in an approved extern hospital, his personal liability to the hospital is 10/- a day in respect of all treatment given, including doctors' fees; the health authority being obliged to pay a subvention to the hospital covering the balance of the cost of the patient's maintenance and treatment and the fees of the hospital's medical staff concerned. Where, however, the patient, instead of availing of treatment in a public ward, opts to be treated in private or semi-private accommodation &mdash;and this applies also to approved nursing homes&mdash;the health authority pays a subvention of 8/- a day to the hospital or home plus, in cases where they arise, a part contribution towards the cost of expensive drugs and medicines and of blood transfusions, and the patient is liable for the balance of the charge levied by the hospital or home and for any medical fees in addition.</P>
      <P>I understand that all health authorities have taken reasonable steps by means of advertisements in the public press; by leaflets; and by circular letters to medical practitioners practising in their areas to explain what health services are available; how they may be obtained and the financial implications of exercising a choice of institution or of accommodation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether his attention has been drawn to the suggestions made by Professor A. Whelton, President of An Bord Altranais, on 9th January that senior nurses in Irish hospitals should not have to perform menial duties, that nurses should be recruited at the age of 17 years, and that auxiliary nurses or assistants should be appointed; and whether he will take steps to encourage hospitals to put these suggestions into practice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press reports of Dr. Whelton's recent address on the occasion of a refresher course for nurse tutors.</P>
      <P>I understand that Dr. Whelton, being anxious to stimulate new thinking on all aspects of nurses' training and working, put forward, in a personal capacity, a number of suggestions for consideration by those taking part in the course.  In such a context, it is appropriate that there should be the fullest discussion of new ideas and controversial issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards two of the points mentioned in the Deputy's question (that is the age at which nurses commence their training and the employment of auxiliary or assistant nurses), I would expect to have the advice of An Bord <Col N="403" /> Altranais before any change is made in present policy.  The question of the duties of senior nurses is one which is kept constantly under review. It can, of course, be accepted as a general statement that an undue amount of the time of such experienced nurses should not be taken up with menial duties.  What must not be lost sight of, however, is that the performance of menial duties is often an inescapable part of the personal nursing care of certain patients.</P>

      <P>Clerical Officers recruited by competition confined to Post Office departmental grades were not eligible to receive any children's allowances at all under the civil service scheme as their remuneration was not differentiated on a marriage basis.

The question of according children's allowances in respect of married members in this category was raised under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service and an agreement was reached which provided for the payment <i>ex gratia</i> of allowances of £11 a year for each eligible child.</P>

      <P>Members of the Defence Forces, wherever serving, are chargeable to income tax on their ordinary pay.  Soldiers serving in the Congo usually allow the whole, or a part, of <Col N="407" /> their pay to accumulate pending their return.  When the accumulated pay is being drawn a deduction for income tax is made equal to the total of the deductions which would have been made if the pay had been drawn in the normal way.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will introduce amending legislation to eliminate the present unjust practice whereby income tax is deducted from lump sum refunds of superannuation contributions previously paid by workers from wages which were not liable to tax deduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind contributions to a superannuation fund approved by the Revenue Commissioners under Section 32 of the Finance Act, 1921.</P>
      <P>Where such contributions are refunded to an employee, the law requires payment of income tax at one-third of the standard rate on the amount refunded.  The underlying principle is that the Revenue should be compensated for relief allowed on the contributions when they were made.  The rate taken, one-third of the standard rate, represents roughly the composite rate at which relief for employees' contributions to the fund is given.  In the case of any particular fund some employees will have enjoyed relief from income tax at the standard rate; others will have received no effective relief in that they would not have been liable for any tax even if their contributions had not been allowed as deductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might emphasise that the liability to income tax at one-third of the standard rate on the amount refunded is imposed on the trustees of the fund and not on the employee.  The law adopts the only course which would be administratively practicable by looking at the fund as an entity rather that at the individual members of the scheme.  In some cases the rules of <Col N="408" /> the fund require the trustees to recoup the tax by reducing the amount which would otherwise be payable to the employee.</P>

    <P>As regards (c) of the Question the prospectuses of the various issues listed contain a statement to the effect that the stock and interest thereon will be exempt from all taxation, present or future, if it is shown in the manner directed by the Minister for Finance that the stock is in the beneficial ownership of a person who is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in the State.  The manner in which a claim to relief should be made and proved was prescribed in 1930 by the Minister for Finance as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  A claim to relief is to be made in writing to and proved to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Revenue Commissioners may require such information by affidavit or otherwise, and such evidence as they consider necessary for the proper determination of the claim.</P>

There was a joint meeting of the Board of Works and the Electricity Supply Board and in an agreed report on 6th June, 1961, it was unanimously agreed that no further work would be done because it would only aggravate the flooding and the Shannon position generally.  The agreed report recommended that the works on the tributaries of the Shannon should not be done independently but should be accompanied by works on the main stem of the Shannon.</P>

      <P>Let me choose tactful words.  The Parliamentary Secretary, clearly, is not <i>au fait</i>.  The river in question is draining into a lake the level of which was lowered by six feet some years ago.  There is no possibility of consequential flooding on the drainage of this particular tributary river as the lake will receive all that the river can discharge.  In these circumstances would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider allowing the upper reaches of this river to be completed?</P>

      <P>Information with regard to the dates on which proposals for Rural Improvements Schemes not yet inspected were submitted from the rural districts of Bantry, Castletown, Dunmanway, Skibbereen and Schull and the parts of the rural districts of Bandon.  Clonakilty and Macroom included in the Cork South West constituency area is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission <Col N="418" /> of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated in the Official Report.  As stated on a number of occasions recently there is a general shortage of engineers in Government Departments and vacancies for 38 appointments, including three for the Special Employment Schemes Office, have been advertised&mdash;the applications being due in the Civil Service Commission offices today.  When the new appointments have been made it is expected that it will be possible to reduce the arrears of inspections over a period of months.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>RURAL Improvements Scheme applications awaiting inspection in the Cork South West constituency area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonoghOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>It is regretted that because of vacanices in the inspectorate staff there has been some delay in the inspection of Rural Improvements Scheme applications, particularly in County Leitrim where the demand for grants is especially heavy.  Steps are in train to recruit additional engineering staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Inspections of Minor Employment Scheme applications are geared to the preparation of the winter programme of schemes each year, and it is expected that all cases in Counties Leitrim and Roscommon for which <Col N="421" /> grants are likely to be available in the coming year's programme will be inspected in good time.</P>

      <P>I would point out that the Taoiseach did not say, as the Deputy states in his question, that membership of the European Economic Community &ldquo;will effect a change in the position of this country in the United Nations&rdquo;.  What the Taoiseach said was that &ldquo;it might be affected in some degree&rdquo; following our membership of the E.E.C. but that our general support for the aims of the United Nations, and our attitude in the main issues that arise within the United Nations would not be changed.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby approves the Summer Time (No. 2) Order, 1961, made by the Minister <Col N="434" /> for Justice under the Summer Time Act, 1925 (No. 8 of 1925).</P>
    <P>The Order provides that the period of Summer Time this year will be from 25th March to 28th October, which is practically identical with the period of Summer Time we had in 1961.  If the Order were not made the period of Summer Time this year would be from 16th April to 8th October.  The effect of the Order, therefore, is to lengthen the period of Summer Time by six weeks altogether, three weeks in the Spring and three weeks in the Autumn. The period of summer time now proposed is that which has already been fixed by Britain and the Six Counties and it is to synchronise with them that we have made the Order.  Otherwise, while we would have the same time as they have for the greater part of the year, there would be two short periods in the Spring when we would differ from them by an hour.  This would cause difficulties in relation to cross-Channel traffic, postal services and so on.  It is to avoid this that the Order is made.  I recommend the Order for the approval of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one short matter I have to refer to.  Under Section 3, we are introducing a novel and revolutionary concept into our criminal code.  We are now providing that crimes committed abroad by any national at any time can be tried in this country.  I understand that in fact it is necessary that this provision be inserted in the Act in order to give effect to these Conventions and for that reason I think it is proper that the Dáil should enact it, but I should like to find out from the Minister what the position is concerning similar legislation which presumably exists in other countries.  Presumably, other signatories to this Convention who have enacted similar legislation in their own country will have power to try Irish nationals in their countries for alleged breaches of any of these Conventions and I understand there is provision in the Conventions themselves by which the high contracting parties undertake, after investigation, to hand over any person to another high contracting party who, it is assumed or presumed, has committed an offence. I should like to know whether, in respect of this section, the ordinary law of extradition will apply and whether we may be required to hand over an Irish national, in the event of an allegation being made that the Irish national was resident here, to one of the other high contracting parties for trial abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, Section 3, subsection 1, says</P>
      <P>Any person, whatever his nationality, who, whether in or outside the State, commits, or aids, abets or procures the commission by any other person of, any such grave breach of any of the Scheduled Conventions as is referred to in the following Articles respectively of those Conventions,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> It is only in the case of &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; of these Conventions that a person can be tried here for offences outside the State.  I think the same thing applies in regard to piracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not quite answered my question.  I want to know if it is possible to get an answer to this question: would we be required to hand over an Irish national to other countries who have had adhered to this Convention on the suggestion being made by them that that national had committed an offence which they wished to try in their country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Eighty-two other States have already ratified this Convention. I cannot say that all of them have the same legislation as we have here but when they have ratified the Convention, I suppose it must be presumed that their legal arrangements enable them to carry it out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Ordinarily, the criminal law is confined to the territory where a crime is committed.  This State will try anyone, a national of our own or an alien, who commits a crime here.  Ordinarily speaking, States do not try people who commit crimes outside their own country. There are two or three well-known exceptions.  Although there is some doubt whether we would try here a citizen of ours who committed murder abroad, it is certain, according to our law, that we could try a citizen of ours who committed bigamy abroad. Under this Convention, are we now going to try people who are not our nationals and do not commit crimes here?  That would be a very serious extension of the criminal law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very serious.  This Convention was signed by us in 1949 and I am sure the Government of the day were quite well aware of the fact that in signing the Convention, they were undertaking to pass legislation here that would enable the Convention to be operated.  It is, of course, as the Deputy says, an extension of the right to try prisoners here for offences committed abroad, and in only one or two very exceptional cases <Col N="437" /> is there right for the State to try people who have committed crimes abroad. There were discussions at the Geneva Convention about arrangements regarding the humane treatment of people in time of war and it was decided that a Convention of this kind was necessary. The Committees established to discuss the Convention recommended this to the various States, and 82 States have ratified the Convention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the point which Deputy Costello put has been answered yet.  We are going to exercise jurisdiction in criminal matters over people who are not nationals of our own, who being aliens do not commit a crime here.  Other countries will do the same.  Supposing an Irish national commits one of these crimes abroad and there is an extradition treaty between that country and ours, who in the end will try him? Will we try him because he is a national, or will they ask for him to be sent over to where the evidence is of whatever he is alleged to have done?  The thing will work the other way, too.  Of course it raises the question of whether in fact we have surviving any extradition treaty with any country.</P>

      <P>I feel sure the Minister and his advisers have gone very carefully into the necessity for this particular section and as it is drafted at the moment, we are taking power to try a Chinaman for alleged atrocities committed in Tibet.  We are extending tremendously the jurisdiction of our courts here beyond anything that has been contemplated in the past.  I have raised the query as to whether it is necessary to take on this obligation and to extend this jurisdiction in the manner in which it is <Col N="438" /> being extended, in view of the requirements of the Convention.</P>
      <P>The Conventions, as I understand them, require the contracting parties to enact legislation necessary to provide effective penal sanctions against persons who commit grave breaches of the Conventions.  The Conventions go on to require that the high contracting parties will search for persons alleged to have committed grave breaches of these Conventions and bring them before their own courts. It seems to me, at any rate, that the high contracting parties have undertaken to enact legislation to make some of these offences penal in their own countries and, secondly, to search for alleged offenders against this Convention.  It seems to me that the Conventions do not go so far as to require the high contracting parties to enact legislation to give such power as we are giving in this Bill to prosecute a person, a national of a country, for example, in the Far East, for having committed offences, for example, in the United States of America. That is the power we are giving under Section 3.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported on this Supplementary Estimate last week, I was putting it to the Minister that while we were in favour of this further investment of public moneys and prepared to facilitate him in providing the money, I thought it necessary, in this context of appropriating a very substantial sum of public money, to ensure that, in so doing, we had the approval and understanding not only of the members of the House but of the public generally. It was with that purpose in view that the Minister finally decided to leave this matter over until today, so that a fuller statement on the situation might be made than he was in a position to make last Thursday.  I suggest to him that when he is dealing with this matter in a comprehensive way, one very important statistic which he should provide to the House is how much Canadian money has been invested in this project and how much Irish money has been invested in it.</P>
      <P>My recollection is that a substantial sum of Canadian money was invested in this enterprise.  I want to make it clear that our approval of this Supplementary Estimate is based on a careful consideration of all the facts as they are known to us.  As I understand this situation, sometime between 1954 and 1957, this whole question of the exploitation of the Avoca copper deposits came to a head and the Government of that time, of which I was a member, fortified themselves with the opinions, if my memory serves me correctly, of two leading firms of mining engineers, one from America and one from Great Britain; that both these firms certified to us that in their considered judgment the ore deposits on which the mine at present exists were substantial but that in fact there was a very much more heavily mineralised area in the other half of the mining property to which the mining company could turn, in the event of the price of copper declining on the world market, and that the existence of this richer ore body provided some guarantee for the continuity of the mining operations even in face of some decline in the then very high world price of copper. Of course the world price of copper has since declined sharply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> On that advice, we consented certainly to the exploitation of this mine.  We have got to keep it present in our minds that any mining project, however excellent the preliminary findings may be, has in it inherent risks, and I suppose this project in Avoca is no different from any other in that respect.  As I understand the present situation we are in the process now of opening up what we believe to be the richer ore body and the money now required is necessary in order to bring the preliminary work and installation of a conveyor belt system to completion, and that when this work is done, the mining property will have an opportunity of proving out pretty definitely whether in fact under the tests of actual mining operations, it is viable or not.</P>
    <P>Everybody, when he hears of a subscription of £250,000 to an enterprise of this kind, is inclined to ask himself: (1) what security have we got for it? ; and (2) where is this going to end?  As I understand it, the answer to the first part of this question on this occasion is that we get, or are entitled to get, an equity in the mine equal to the present proposed subscription.  The answer to this second question is that this increased capital contribution ought to make it possible for this company to establish, once and for all, whether this enterprise is economically viable on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Those two questions being answered, if these are the correct answers, that justifies us in making this appropriation of public money in order that we can establish definitely for all time whether this is a mining enterprise which can be successfully carried on in existing world conditions or world conditions that may be reasonably anticipated.  We, therefore, are prepared to support this Supplementary Estimate.  But I would ask the Minister has he the figures to hand at this moment of the contributions by the Canadian interests and the Irish interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that the respective contributions are <Col N="444" /> £2 million each from Canadian and Irish sources.  The figure of £2 million is not quite accurate, but it is as near accurate as makes no difference.</P>

      <P>I am clear on these facts that it would be wrong to allow the want of a quarter of a million pounds of money to prevent the mine being carried on to the point where we can determine finally the full information as to whether it is a viable enterprise or not.  In those circumstances we are prepared to support the Supplementary Estimate, but I would be glad to hear from the Minister the most comprehensive statement of the general history of the transaction he is in a position to provide.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking for this Supplementary Estimate of £170,000 for St. Patrick's Copper Mines the Minister indicated in his opening statement that the purpose is to provide money to assist the mining company over the coming few months when their resources will be unequal to their commitments. This is the third time the <Col N="445" /> Minister has come before the House asking permission to aid St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  In the first instance, in February, 1958, we were asked to guarantee £1,300,000 for these mines and that was approved.  Subsequently, in December, 1959, we were asked to guarantee £550,000 and that was approved.  Now we are asked to approve of £170,000 covering the period until the 1st April next and the Minister proposes to ask us again for a further £70,000 for the year 1962-63. Therefore, in all, the Minister will be asking this House to approve of a Supplementary Estimate of more than £2 million for this company which, it seems, has been insolvent for some time.</P>
      <P>However, that is the debit side of the picture.  So far as the credit side is concerned, I agree that, as far as we can judge, there is a reasonable likelihood that, when the development stage has expired, dividends will be payable on this money.  I appreciate the big employment being given in the area and the general help the expenditure of this money will be not only to the workers but to the business people of the district.</P>
      <P>My main reason for intervening is to ensure that the Minister is not devoting all the money at his disposal for mining development to St. Patrick's Mines in Wicklow.  We have other copper mines in this country which would need money for capital work just as much as St. Patrick's Mines. I am referring to the mining development in my own constituency of Cork South West where during the past six years a subsidiary of a Canadian firm has expended big sums of money on development work and has given immense employment in that district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>He does not have to deal with other mines, with respect, Sir.  He will have to deal with the principle of whether money passed for mining development by this House is going to be concentrated in County Wicklow or whether it is to become available for other areas with justifiable claims.  That is the question I am posing to the Minister.  I am sure to reply to it would cause him no embarrassment.  I do not want to dwell further on this matter.  I am asking the Minister to bear in mind that we will be approaching the Minister for a similar Supplementary Estimate and, if he feels the claim is justified, I hope he will come to this House for a Supplementary Estimate to help in the development of the <Col N="447" /> Allihies mines just as he has come to the House for three Supplementary Estimates to help St. Patrick's Copper Mines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening words on this Supplementary Estimate, said he wanted the House to be fully informed.  He cannot believe that the House is fully informed about this particular concern in view of what he said on February 15th last.  He now comes before the House, I suggest, with a ventilated point of view and tells us the company finds itself unable to meet its commitments and that it is faced with shutting down.  I do not know where he got that information because the first we heard of it was on the 15th February. He also told the House that the company had given an assurance that every effort would be made to keep the mine in full production but that they fear that for at least a few weeks production would have to be suspended.</P>
      <P>That means that sometime earlier than February 15th the Minister got that startling news and there was a grant proposed of £170,000 which we are now discussing.  Even with that, and the possibility that if losses continued at the rate they have been going, the mine will have to close down at least temporarily and some hundreds of workers will be put out of work.  That is a very serious situation and it is necessary to look a bit at the history of this affair.  In a debate that took place on the 8th February, 1956, the present Taoiseach, in the course of a long speech, said that the points made by the Opposition were aimed at justifying the selling of Avoca to the Canadians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At an earlier period, when there had been in the Estimates a sum of £85,000 for mineral development, which at one time I had decided to defer until I got better information about the matter, we had a lengthy debate on the whole business.  The present Tánaiste, Deputy MacEntee, said there were expert reports in the Department of Industry and Commerce which he put himself before the Dáil as having <Col N="448" /> read, and according to the Tánaiste's statement with regard to some of those, a well-known mining engineer had said that the Avoca area promised to be one of the richest mineral areas in Western Europe.  That was the area in respect of which we, as a Government, were first of all criticised for not expending £85,000 on exploration.</P>
    <P>We did spend it eventually and when the debate of the 8th February, 1956, occurred on a piece of legislation introduced by Deputy Sweetman, then Minister for Finance, giving temporary relief with regard to profits on certain mining enterprises, we were told what the situation was as far as the present Taoiseach was concerned with regard to Avoca.  At the time when the £85,000 was deferred, from an expenditure point of view there was very serious consideration given to the whole matter.  There had been these allegations made about expert reports which showed the tremendously valuable mineral deposits in this area.</P>
    <P>I remember speaking at the close of that debate and pointing out that we found three reports in 1948 when we were in Government.  One was from a Swede.  I said then, and still say it, that one could not have raised a pound sterling from the community on the strength of that report.  The second report was from an Englishman. It was not quite as devastating as the Swede's report but nobody could still go to the public with it as part of a prospectus and expect money by way of investment.  The other report, also from an Englishman, was better but nobody would think it was one with which you could go to the community and seek capital investment from the public.</P>
    <P>I remember a meeting attended by practically every member of the Government and the whole of the Board of Mianraí Teoranta.  There was the able advice of a Professor Jones who was a mining engineer and it was mainly as a result of his recommendation&mdash;in which he said that if he had any money to spare he could not see a better way to invest it than in Avoca&mdash;that we decided to go ahead with exploration work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="449" /> The exploration work went ahead, and in 1956 a lease was signed and arising out of the circumstances of the signing of this lease the legislation I have referred to was introduced.  The debate occurred on the 8th February, 1956 and is reported at column 72 of Volume 154 of the Official Report. The present Taoiseach rose to the debate and now I want the House to understand the position then in respect to the mine which, according to the Minister, is now at the end of its resources and was going to shut down were it not for the fact that the Minister had asked us to come to its assistance to the tune of £170,000.  The Minister even says that it may still have to close down even with the £170,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very valuable thing to fall into your lap.  At column 96 of that debate, there was a discussion about the Mogul Mining Corporation and the Taoiseach went on:</P>
      <P>Whatever they are investing, they can hope to get with the scale of operations they are planning and the present price of copper not less than £5,000,000 in profits during the four years that they will be operating free of tax.</P>
      <P>The whole trouble then was that the Government was selling this very valuable Irish property for practically no consideration to this Canadian company who were here to make vast profits for their parent company.  At the foot of column 96 and in column 97 the present Taoiseach continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Present indications are that the total supply of mineralised rock at Avoca is about 13,000,000 tons.  It is possible, and perhaps even probable, that the rock tonnage is <Col N="450" /> larger than that but the Mogul Mining Corporation are basing their plans on the assumption, according to the statements they published in Canada, that there are 13,000,000 tons of workable rock at Avoca. They, therefore, can hope that by the time they have worked out the whole of the 13,000,000 ton deposit they will have extracted profits from the operation of round about £10,000,000, £12,000,000 or £13,000,000 in the aggregate.</P>
    <P>At a later stage, in column 97, the Taoiseach refers to the way in which the mining company could make money out of this valuable concession and to what public money they could raise in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The first action taken by the Mogul Mining Corporation, according to a statement published in this newspaper from which I have quoted, the <i>Toronto Globe and Mail,</i> was to issue $3,500,000 in debentures; so hightly are the profit prospects of this Avoca operation assessed in Canada that, according to this newspaper, the issue was&mdash; these are the words they used&mdash;&ldquo;oversubscribed almost before the books opened to receive subscriptions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the picture presented against Deputy Sweetman's efforts in bringing in a Bill to relieve this company from taxes on its profits.  As I say, we were told we were selling out to the Canadians and that they would get £5,000,000 profits in four years.</P>

      <P>The agreement was so valuable we were going to get £5,000,000 in four years and as much as £17,000,000 profit when they worked out the contents of this mineralised matter.  The present Tánaiste&mdash;Deputy MacEntee, at that time&mdash;told the House that somebody had advised his Government that this area was likely to prove the richest mineral area in all western Europe; and, at the end of the debate on 8th February, the sneering comment came that all our arguments were to justify the selling of Avoca to the Canadians.</P>
      <P>May I take the Minister up on the line of his interruption?  Apparently it was a bad lease.  Was it?  If it was a bad lease, and the company are now in such a condition that they have to look for extra moneys, will the Minister get the lease improved, now that he is putting up an extra £250,000? Or is he just going to hand over the money and hope for the best?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was always in favour of mineral development.  It was alleged at one time that I was not. I remember in the Budget of 1948 reading out the statement made by Deputy Childers, now Minister for Transport and Power, quoting what the then Taoiseach had said.  That was to the effect: &ldquo;Look; the British geological surveys really gave more accurate information in regard to mineral deposits in Ireland than we had ever accepted.  We thought they were wrong. We thought they were politically biassed, but we have now mournfully to confess their reports were more reliable than the optimistic reports we got from our own Geological Survey.&rdquo; The Taoiseach at the time, and his successor, said that if we spent £85,000 on mineral exploration we would then have a picture of whether or not there were any minerals in the country worth developing; and Deputy Childers said his mournful conclusion was that there were not and on the whole, we would probably find there were no minerals worth developing, and the question was put: would it not be a good thing to spend £85,000 to have that issue settled once and for all?  We spend the £85,000.  The Canadians put up £2,000,000.  The present Government guaranteed another £2,000,000 and the present Government are now giving £170,000, with a promise through this House of a further £70,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>By way of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>On what are we basing that, I wonder?  Would the Minister look back on his speech with regard to this matter?  He said at column 269 of Volume 193 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was felt that... the prospects for commercial production would be good enough to enable the Company to obtain money from private sources to finance its continued operation. The Company did, in fact, negotiate in recent months substantial additional private investment but the making of this investment was dependent on the verification by further drilling of the Mianraí Teoranta findings.  The Company's <Col N="454" /> preliminary testing failed to substantiate the figures produced by Mianraí Teoranta in certain areas and, accordingly, the offer of private capital was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>So, again, there was apparently an effort to be made to get the private investor to put money into this. Mianraí Teoranta had optimistic views. They had apparently made some borings and based some findings on these. But the Company's new testing failed to substantiate the figures produced by Mianraí Teoranta and the offer of private capital was withdrawn.  We get then a sudden jump to the conclusion:</P>
    <P>The Company found itself unable to meet its commitments and was faced with the alternative of shutting down or securing further Government aid.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is to ask this House for more money.  What optimism can we have with regard to the future of this project?  He said:</P>
    <P>that ordinary shares in the Company up to the nominal value of the sums advanced will be vested in the Minister for Finance or his nominee should he at any time so demand.</P>
    <P>That is this £170,000.</P>
    <P>In this way, if this further injection of capital is successful in placing the Company on an economic footing, the State will be able to ensure a due return on its investment.</P>
    <P>By getting shares representing £170,000 in a concern that is capitalised apparently to the extent of £4,000,000.  The Minister then says he would like the House to be fully informed:</P>
    <P>so that Deputies may appreciate the position at Avoca, a position that is quite serious.  The money which it is now proposed to make available will enable production to be continued for the time being.  If further testing does not produce results nearer to the findings of Mianraí Teoranta, or if copper prices decline, or if the further development work encounters new difficulties, the whole future of the enterprise may be jeopardised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="455" /> Again, I say the Minister would not go to the public looking for money if that is the best he could do about this concern.  But it gets a little worse:</P>
    <P>Every effort will be made to keep the mine in full production as long as practicable but the possibility has to be faced that if losses at the level recently experienced continue during the next few weeks, production may have to be suspended in whole or in part until development work has reached the stage where more economic production is possible.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister just give us a few facts?  When did he get to know that loss was being incurred weekly?  Are these losses very substantial over the weeks?  How far are the losses being experienced for some time back likely to be eased by an expenditure of £170,000?  Have further borings been taken by the company?  Do they substantiate the figures produced by Mianraí Teoranta?  In regard to the vague phrase: &ldquo;If the further development were to encounter new difficulties,&rdquo; what difficulties have been encountered?  Are they in regard to employees' skill?  Are they in regard to machines or in regard to mineralised areas or to borings.  When we are presented, first of all, with a picture of a fine area of rich mineral deposits and a company that is helped to the point that draws from the Taoiseach the remark that we are selling Avoca to Canada and that gets guarantees from the Government as well, surely we are entitled to know the whole history since the last guarantee was given, whether these difficulties are ones that have been met previously or whether they have been surmounted at any time.</P>
    <P>There is one last thing.  This company is, as far as I can make out, inextricably entwined with the new fertiliser factory to be erected at Arklow.  That was to depend upon certain minerals that are supposed to be in Avoca not merely being there but having been extracted for use in the Arklow factory.  Does it mean <Col N="456" /> that however lame this particular duck happens to be, we have to keep it going in order to give some background to the very expensive factory that is to be put up in Arklow?  Can we separate the two or does the fate of the Arklow factory depend to any degree on what is happening at Avoca?</P>
    <P>The Minister should remember that so far as the start of this was concerned, the money for exploration and even the money for exploitation was provided by a Government to which he never belonged.  All he is doing now is coming to the rescue of something that at one time he expressed to be a very valuable concern.  He comes in now with a miserable statement in regard to the position into which this company has been allowed to get without any notice being given to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the debate on Thursday last and today, I find it very difficult to understand the Fine Gael attitude on this whole matter.  Deputy Cosgrave led off the discussion on behalf of Fine Gael; the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Sir Anthony Esmonde and Deputy O'Higgins also spoke.  With the exception of Deputy McGilligan who has just spoken, they all seem to be wholeheartedly in favour of making this money available for Avoca. Deputy McGilligan, as is typical of him, tried to start a hare.  We know the part he has played over the years in regard to Avoca and it is unfortunate that that trend has crept into the debate at all.  This is a very serious problem as far as Avoca is concerned, not only for the St. Patrick's Copper Mines people themselves but for the men working in Avoca.  I would ask the Minister, although he has already stated that even if given this sum today, the prospects are not that bright for Avoca&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would not make that statement &mdash;that even if he is given the sum asked for, the prospects are not bright &mdash;in asking the House to approve the allocation of this money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be wrong, but I think the Minister did indicate <Col N="457" /> in his introductory statement that unless things improved in Avoca within the next two or three weeks, there would be a likelihood of a close down or a laying off of some of the men. I think that was the gist of the Minister's statement.  This has caused a certain amount of worry to those of us who know this locality and the people who are employed there and who are aware of the amount of prosperity that has been brought to that part of County Wicklow by the operations at Avoca.</P>
      <P>I should like an assurance from the Minister that even if this amount of money being made available now does not solve all the problems, every effort will be made in the future to try to keep Avoca in production.  That is very important particularly to the people in the locality.  It is also important from the point of view of the proposed new fertiliser industry in Arklow.  I understand that industry is to be established in Arklow because the material for the production of the fertiliser is to come from Avoca.  If there is a close down in Avoca, it may mean a halt to the Arklow industry.  We have enjoyed an era of prosperity in that part of Wicklow.  Whether it was a Fianna Fáil or an inter-Party Government who were responsible does not matter.  The inter-Party Government initiated the deal with St. Patrick's Copper Mines. I am sure they made every effort to investigate the background of these people and were satisfied it was a reputable firm, capable of running Avoca economically.  The fact that this Government have come to the rescue on three occasions to the total tune of £2,000,000 is an indication that the Fianna Fáil Government have a certain amount of confidence in them also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in this together and I hope this Vote will be given with the goodwill of the House.  The Minister has been asked to make certain clarifications and this is very desirable. It is only right that the public should know the exact position in Avoca and I am sure the Minister will give all the information at his disposal to the House and through the House, to the people.  If that is done, it might help to clear the air somewhat.  I was <Col N="458" /> surprised that there was any need for financial help in Avoca.  I understood that things were going full steam ahead down there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I did not interfere with them; it was their business.  I was sure that Deputy McGilligan was satisfied with the situation in 1956 and 1957 and that successive Ministers were equally satisfied and that there was no reason why I should interfere.  The only occasion I got in touch with St. Patrick's Copper Mines was when I was recommending some men for employment.  There are 500 or 600 men in very useful employment there. Their pay packets mean a great deal to themselves and their families and the general public.  I sincerely hope nothing will happen in the near future and certainly nothing will happen in this House that will bring an end to that.  I trust the Minister will have the goodwill not alone of the Government side of the House but of all sides in getting this Vote and that we can look forward to a more prosperous time in Avoca.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with Deputy Brennan in his anxiety about the employment position in the Avoca area.  He is quite right in expressing his anxiety with regard to the future prospects of employment for the workers there but that is a problem which is not confined to Wicklow alone.  It is general all over the country but I think we shall have to examine a little further into the whole idea of mining development in Wicklow, apart altogether from the employment aspect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's statement here last week was brief and there was a great air of urgency about it.  I got the impression that he was most anxious that the House should have been sitting a week or a fortnight earlier so that this Supplementary Estimate might be disposed of.  He pointed out the dangerous situation that had arisen with regard to the company's prospects and the danger of a close down. <Col N="459" /> Having said all that and having said that the company found itself unable to meet its commitments and was faced with the alternative of shutting down or of obtaining further State aid, within 20 minutes, he announced that the debate could be adjourned and that the company had got outside accommodation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within 20 minutes of telling us that there was danger of a close down and that there was no capital available from private sources, he was able to tell us the situation had altered.  We shall have to know a little more about this before the Minister will get his money on that kind of approach.</P>

      <P>When we see the word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in any Government pronouncement, we can take it that is just what it means.  The word &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in this statement meant that the situation was one of great seriousness and that the likelihood of the company closing down was very real.  Today the Minister panicked and interrupted Deputy McGilligan.  I am not taking any sides in this at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;This is not my baby.  I have nothing to do with it.  Why are you blaming me?&rdquo;  That is a deplorable attitude for any Minister to adopt.  As he pointed out, he is on a very bad wicket and he wants to save his own bacon.  His attitude on this is that he is going to come clear out of it, whatever about the Ministers who went before him.  It means that the Minister has his mind made up that this is a bad venture, but, despite that, he is asking the House for £240,000 to add to the £2 million that has gone down the drain already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Am I right in my interpretation of the Minister's attitude?  I am convinced that if there was a likelihood that this further money would help the company over a difficult period, the Minister <Col N="460" /> would not be disclaiming responsibility as he has been.  He would be prepared to hold his fire on the basis that the future would be good.  I am afraid he has his mind made up that this is a dead duck.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>The two points the Minister made were, first, that there was a danger that the mining venture would close down and, secondly, that there was a conflict between the findings of the company's experts and the findings of Mianraí Teoranta.  We got no information from the Minister as to where the conflict lay.  He referred briefly to the fact that the Mianraí Teoranta findings were not similar to those of the company. Surely if the Minister is asking the House for a further £240,000, the least he might have done was to develop the point of differences between the findings of both groups.  Is it a fact that the findings of Mianraí Teoranta are faulty in the eyes of this Canadian company?  If it is so, let the Minister tell us and have it on record.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the company's preliminary testings failed to substantiate the findings produced by Mianraí Teoranta in certain areas.  At the end of the debate, before the House adjourned on the last day, the Minister said in reply to Deputy Dillon that that did not mean that the Mianraí Teoranta findings were not correct.  I hope he will explain what he means by that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon is more expert in mathematics than I am, but he made the extraordinary statement that this was on a fifty-fifty basis, that £2 million were subscribed by this company and £2 million by the Government. Now there is another quarter of a million being made available by the Irish Government in addition to the two millions already invested.  Yet Deputy Dillon described that as being <Col N="461" /> on a fifty-fifty basis.  Surely it is on the basis of two to two and a quarter?  It is not as simple as that.  I should like the Minister to let us know what benefits the State has received through this investment of £2,000,000 so far. Were there any returns in the form of profits given back to the Government by this company?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know what the present position is. A guarantee of £2¼ millions was given to this company.  According to the Minister, they put up six million Canadian dollars or £2 million sterling. Have they collected profits on their investment so far?  If they have, to what extent and where has that money gone?  Were they prepared to plough back any of these profits to help in the difficult position which has now arisen?  On behalf of the people I should like that question to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, I should like to know what benefit was conferred on the country by this venture, apart from the immediate employment that was given in the area.  To what extent was our mineral wealth increased for processing here in Ireland?  How much subsidiary employment was given in Ireland in processing the products of the mines?  Would it be correct to say that all that happened was that this Canadian company was allowed to dig up the minerals in Avoca, bring them to Arklow and export them abroad for processing?  Is that not what happened?  Was there any processing, smelting or other similar operation carried on in this country <Col N="462" /> as a result of the mining activities in Avoca?  I do not see what great benefit the mineral wealth is to this country if it is all to be exported without any processing taking place.  It is just as bad as exporting cattle on the hoof.</P>
    <P>My information is that first-class docking and shipping facilities are being made available and harbours are being improved simply to enable copper and other by-products to be loaded efficiently and economically after being dug out of Irish soil and exported to Canada or elsewhere for processing.  What benefit is there to Ireland in that kind of operation?</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that 500 men in Wicklow have pay packets but these 500 could be getting good pay packets from forestry or other employment in Ireland.  There is as much sense in this type of operation if we allow our mineral resources to be exported as there was in the Famine days in digging holes in the ground and paying men to fill them up.</P>
    <P>This position has come about simply because we have no confidence in the ability of our own people to exploit our resources.  There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that following the explorations and investigations by Mianraí Teoranta, an Irish company could have been established to deal with development work in Wicklow or elsewhere.  The technical advice and assistance of skilled personnel of Irish extraction would be available if they were invited to return from Canada, Australia, England and elsewhere.  We had such an inferiority complex, such little regard for our own people, that it was considered that only the Canadians or some other foreign group were fit to develop our resources.  To develop them for what?  &mdash;so that they would be taken out of the country and the only benefit to be derived by this country would be the immediate employment.</P>
    <P>Who was taking the risk in doing all this?  There were no profits, according to the Minister, as far as the State was concerned but there was nothing to prevent this foreign company from making profits and investing them elsewhere. The cost of speculation was being borne by the Irish people as a <Col N="463" /> result of the backing of the Irish Government.  If the thing went wrong, we paid for it.  While it was going wrong, profits were being made and the company was able at least to save part of its losses.  If things went right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>God help St. Patrick.  I shall not develop the matter except to ask, will it be suggested that the future of this fertiliser industry hinges on the success or failure of the mining venture in Avoca?  That is a very important question.  No matter how much we may desire to have a successful fertiliser industry, I do not think we should bolster up the mining industry in Avoca for the purpose of making a success of the fertiliser factory.  I do not know now whether there is anything in that suggestion or not but I should like the Minister, if it is within the rules of procedure, to comment on it.</P>
      <P>My belief is that the Government have learned a lesson; they have burned their fingers.  There is no use in the Minister saying at this stage, &ldquo;This is not my baby.  This was the result of activities of a former Government and I will not be responsible for it.&rdquo;  That is a deplorable outlook on the part of a Minister who is asking the House to give £240,000 for what he at the moment, according to himself, thinks will be a failure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be very brief and to comment on a few aspects of this matter.  Our good friend, the Minister, in repartee with Deputy McGilligan, was possibly a little annoyed by the analytical mind that Deputy McGilligan brought to bear on the Minister's speech introducing the Supplementary Estimate.  I would not like that the Minister's usual amiability and equanimity should be disturbed. I do not think Deputy McGilligan wanted to do so.  What he did want <Col N="465" /> to do, and produced a valuable contribution to the debate in doing, was to analyse and microscopically examine the Minister's speech.  He looked at it as a bank director might look at a request for a loan by a company in the commercial way.  I felt his contribution was extremely to the point.</P>
      <P>If the Minister came here last week to say that this was urgent, that there was a difficulty, that he was extremely perturbed, then it is quite right that, when we vote public money, we should comment upon that situation and analyse it for the public to see just exactly what it means.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan followed and, naturally, with from 500 to 600 men in his constituency employed in the venture, he would take a different line of thought.  That is entirely a local line.  It has no relation proper to the lending of this £250,000 as distinct from a guarantee or otherwise.  Deputy Dillon, Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that they think we should do this: as far as this party is concerned, this measure will be voted for by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may never have sought a loan for a business enterprise from a bank.  If he had, he would recognise in Deputy McGilligan's contribution the proper analytical approach of a bank director. The function of an Opposition is to analyse and look at every line of the Minister's speech and say that it is a calculated risk.  That is what he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I often heard the Taoiseach say in this House: &ldquo;We are taking a calculated risk.&rdquo;  The Opposition is quite prepared to back it but it is no harm to point out that it is a risk.  I do not think it is doing any harm to St. Patrick's Copper Mines or to the future of the employment of the people there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to talk about the disposal of products from that mine.  I would refer the House to column 260 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 15th <Col N="466" /> November, 1961.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>During the course of the second committee's deliberations it became obvious that nitrogenous fertilisers produced from a combination of the gasification of fuel oil and the sulphur content of Avoca pyrites would be a very economic undertaking because the prices would compare very favourably with the low prices of imported nitrogenous fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Out of that, we have a Board set up, a loan guarantee for setting up this nitrogenous factory at Arklow.  We have to look at the whole position. What does the Minister now feel about that project?  The Opposition wish to see this go through but it is our function and job to examine it, word for word, item by item.  The Minister must not&mdash;and I am sure that when he thinks again about it tonight, perhaps, in a more convivial atmosphere, he will not&mdash;take this analytical approach by us as something that should not happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy McGilligan should go his usual road of throwing a spanner in the works for the sake of wrecking, no matter what is at stake.  I am afraid that is what he has done.  I am rather sorry to have to say I am afraid it is all we can expect.  I wonder if he does not realise that in our modern context it is not debating points that matter: it is a solving of the problems that matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to that, the debate had taken a very reasonable line and I should like to get back to it.  I am sorry, also, that Deputy McQuillan was, I gather, ruled cut of order because I think the fertiliser factory has a bearing on this question.  The problem, as I see it, that has to be faced here is simply this. You have a mine which has been established and accepted.  A certain difficulty has arisen because of a difference in the reading of borings, as I understand the story.  There has been a question of the reading of two sets of borings.  The Mianraí Teoranta results have not been fully substantiated by the company's results and <Col N="467" /> there is need for further exploration. That type of thing is something that happens very, very often in mining projects.  As yet, technical developments in exploration have not reached the stage where one can tell the content and extent of all mineral deposit with the certainty that one would like before one is committed to substantial expenditure.  In other words, there is always an element of speculation in spending money on mineral development in its early stages&mdash;in the stages of finding out exactly what is there to be exploited.</P>
    <P>For my part, I sincerely hope that the more optimistic estimates of what ores are available in this mine will be borne out.  I hope that the ores are there in the richness and the quantity necessary to make them economic. That brings me to another point which Deputy McQuillan suggested.  When you have, say, a deposit of a substance like copper ore you have two problems. First, you have to get it out and, secondly, you have the problem of what to do with it.  As yet, it would appear that getting it out and a guarantee for the future of sufficient quantities to make the project viable is to some extent questionable.</P>
    <P>Assume, for the moment, that the copper ores are there.  What can one do with them?  We come up here, all too frequently, unfortunately, but I do not think there is anything any of us can do about it, against the problem that we have limited deposits of, say, some exploitable mineral and there are not sufficient to warrant the development of them completely at home.  In other words, they are not sufficient nor would it be economic to develop them&mdash;to process them, I think, is the phrase Deputy McQuillan used &mdash;at home.  That is an unfortunate fact that attends mining not only in this country but sometimes in others.</P>
    <P>You have to take into account also the economic environment.  As I understand the situation, we can, with development, extract copper ores from these mines which can be profitable in a double sense, that is, in the employment and development provided locally and profitable in the sense that they <Col N="468" /> provide an export.  Deputy McQuillan was rather scathing about the exploration of these ores.  To some extent, I sympathise with the basic idea that prompted him to make his remarks in that connection but he did not, and should not, forget the value of the local employment involved and he should not forget either that there is some value to the community in the export of that commodity.  It is a net export that helps the balance of payments problem that a country like ours has.  If it were possible economically to process those ores, to smelt copper and process it and, after that, produce copper goods, I do not think he would have to press me very hard for support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Not only would you have the problem of the availability and the quantity of the raw materials&mdash;the ores&mdash;but you would also have the problem of the size of the installations that would be necessary for the processing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would need £5 million or £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  The Deputy is making my point for me.  You would need very big plant and you would then have the problem of what to do with the output, granted you had the input.  From such little information I have, it seems that the processing of copper, the setting up of smelting plant, providing for production and an economic situation that would maintain the industry, is not a real possibility in the case of Avoca ores, and in the circumstances we are doing well if we are able to win them in the first place and sell them at a profit in the second.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the risk of being out of order, I really think that it would be a great advantage if Deputies had an opportunity of seeing some of the installations involved in such developments.  Any of the modern chemical, mining or industrial installations I have seen abroad have always surprised me by their size and I must confess that I have been somewhat discouraged at the magnitude of the problems we must face here at home.  Please do <Col N="469" /> not take me as being defeatist in that but there is a real problem in regard to these mines, giving due credit to anyone who deserves it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give the Deputy credit for approaching this matter with a sense of its seriousness.  He says himself there is a great amount of money involved, apart from anything else.  From the point of view of the development of the locality and employment, it is a big thing for the area and the country; as an export, it is important but it seems that it has another importance also.  The Arklow factory has been mentioned, something that can be of real importance to us.  I do not know how closely the Arklow site for this factory is bound up with the development of the Avoca mines but one part of that factory is independent of the mines.  The nitrogen, the ammonium nitrate unit and its plant are quite independent of pyrites from Avoca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other part of the fertiliser project, the sulphuric acid plant, is intimately and directly related to pyrites output.  It would be a pity if we could not use native pyrites for the production of sulphuric acid needed for the fertiliser industry and had to rely on imports.  Without detailed information, I cannot pontificate on the economics of the situation but there is this to be said&mdash;if we cannot use native sulphur sources, like Avoca pyrites, then we shall have to import sulphur from outside. Obviously, we would all prefer the native product to support the factory. Is it then a question&mdash;I am putting this to the Minister because I cannot answer it&mdash;that if it does not prove possible to continue exploitation of the copper ores at Avoca we must also forgo the development of the pyrites associated with the mine?  Does the fact that the development of copper <Col N="470" /> ores is in jeopardy also mean that the supply of pyrites to the new fertiliser factory is also in jeopardy?  If so, it is a pity but it is a greater reason why an effort should be made as far as possible to save this project and to help at this critical stage in maintaining the development of these mines up to a point where at least we can be more definite.</P>
    <P>I think that is the relation of the Avoca project to the Arklow project. If, as I suspect, a failure in respect of copper ores means that the use of pyrites available there will become uneconomic and that we may have to import pyrites or other forms of sulphur it is all the greater reason for giving this Supplementary Estimate. Athough Deputy McGilligan was more concerned with scoring debating points than dealing with the real problem I think everybody else in the House, including even Deputy McQuillan&mdash;who had his criticisms &mdash;is keen to have this project seen through to a conclusion and, we hope, to a successful one.  I think the House is unanimously behind the efforts that are being made to develop these mines.</P>
    <P>Mining operations, by their very character in modern circumstances are, up to the stage where development results in a steady, foreseeable output, a speculation.  This project was in the nature of a speculation when mooted and when the decision was made by the inter-Party Government to proceed with it.  It has been in the nature of a speculation all through its development and the two Governments have been conscious of that.  The interplay in the House may only have served to emphasise that.  Somebody used the phrase &ldquo;calculated risk&rdquo;: that is what is involved.  It is important that in doing this&mdash;and apparently it is being done with unanimity in the House&mdash;we realise clearly what we are doing, and that what we do, we do deliberately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it necessary to emphasise how concerned all of us are at the prospect of so many men being rendered unemployed by reason of a stoppage of the development of the Avoca copper mines.  We are also concerned, as Deputy de Valera said, about the decrease there <Col N="471" /> may be in our exports, if these mines are closed down.  I do not want to repeat or emphasise what has been said by other Deputies, but I want to express what to me is a matter of grave concern.</P>
      <P>I am informed that up to date the State, through various sources, is guarantor for something like £2 million to the Avoca copper mines.  It must be agreed that that is a very substantial figure, an enormous figure.  I should like to know from the Minister if we have any sort of contact with those who are responsible for spending that money.  Are we to be confronted in another 12 months' time with a demand or a request from the directors of the Avoca copper mines for £100,000, £½ million?  I know that such a request or demand cannot easily be resisted by the Government, or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has regard to the employment content and to the export figures, but I think it would be reasonable for the Irish people to expect from a Government, irrespective of what Minister and what Government were in office, that they would have some control in the spending of that money.  That should apply not only to the Avoca copper mines but to all concerns in respect of which the Government guarantee a substantial amount of money.</P>
      <P>I wonder is it the situation that it is only when a concern, a factory or an industry &ldquo;goes bust&rdquo;, or ceases its operations, that the Government know about it?  I do not say that has happened in any widespread fashion, but there are a few concerns which announced blindly, and without any prior notice, that they were folding up.  I wonder, therefore, what has happened or will happen in respect of the guarantee the Government have given for, in some cases, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Labour benches, we have advocated, from time to time, that where an industry gets substantial financial assistance, the Government should at least, in the name of the Irish people, have the right to appoint <Col N="472" /> a director.  I do not know the actual process by which that could be done, but I do know of at least one example where the Industrial Credit Corporation advanced money by way of loan to a certain concern and had the right, took the right, or was given the right by the directors of the Company, to appoint a director themselves.</P>
    <P>I put this to the Minister and to the Government: would it be unreasonable for the Irish people, or for Dáil Éireann, to expect in respect of a concern to which £2 million is being applied that we should have a director appointed by the Government or some other agency of the State.  That is my concern in all of this.  No one wants to see the Avoca copper mines close down.  I never thought that we would arrive at the situation so quickly in which certain Deputies started to blame one another for the Avoca copper mines.  The practice in recent years has been an effort to claim credit for them by different Deputies on both sides of the House.  The Minister is concerned about employment; Deputy Brennan is concerned about employment; I am concerned about employment; Deputy Norton is concerned about employment; and so is everyone in the House.</P>

      <P>In case any other Deputy has not requested him to do so, I should like to ask the Minister to give us some details as to why this apparent failure of the St. Patrick's Copper Mines has taken place.  My reason for asking is that I remember during one period of the inter-Party Government this venture appeared to be about to collapse.  As a result, the inter-Party Government made an attempt to decide once and for all whether or not there was anything worthwhile in the place.  The report we got from experts was that apparently deeper than the workings that had taken place up to then there was a very valuable deposit of copper, zinc if I remember correctly, and quantities of silver and gold.  Quite candidly, I did not follow the fortunes of that mine since that time because I took it for granted that things were going very well.  It came rather as a surprise to me when the Minister came here asking for money, indicating that the venture had not turned out the success we all hoped it would be.  I should like the Minister to give us a detailed account of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan asked why we are exporting the raw material instead of processing it here.  If the Minister has an explanation perhaps he would give it and I, for one, would like to know it.  It seems strange.  Unless the position is that we have not the experts or the cost of processing would be immense or something like that, I cannot see the commonsense of mining out our minerals and giving the raw materials over to some other place to be processed.  Perhaps there is a perfectly sound and valid answer to that question and I am anxious to hear it.</P>

      <P>When I introduced the Supplementary Estimate last week, I told the House there was a certain urgency about it.  In the course of the debate, some Deputies asked a number of questions, the answers to which I had available to me at the time.  There were some details of the questions I might not have been able to elaborate on but, nevertheless, having regard to the fact that the time at my disposal under the Orders of the <Col N="474" /> House was so short, I agreed to the suggestion made by Deputy Dillon that the debate might be held over until today.</P>
      <P>I gave as a reason for the urgency in bringing the Estimate before the House the fact that certain difficulties with regard to the continuation of operations at Avoca had arisen. Deputy McQuillan sought to cast doubts on the <i>bona fides</i> of what I said during the debate the last day. The fact is, during the course of the debate, I had it established that the company had got certain bank accommodation on the basis of the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate and, therefore, when I negotiated the introduction of the Supplementary Estimate last week, I was under the impression that it was urgent to that extent, but by reason of the accommodation given to that company the immediate urgency had passed.  Nevertheless, there is some urgency still because the accommodation is of limited duration.  I hope that disposes of Deputy McQuillan's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in my introductory statement that I would be anxious to give Deputies the fullest possible information and I still stick to that undertaking. I have tried to get as much information as possible in the interim in order to fill in any gaps that were in my knowledge of the history of the operation and the present financial position of the mine.  The debate was conducted in a constructive manner and it was my intention to approach it in that way.  In fact, on more than two previous occasions I handled business in connection with this venture in this House and on these occasions the contributions from both sides were very constructive.  Unfortunately, Deputy McGilligan came in to-day and poured invective on what I said and made insinuations which I found very hard to listen to.  Unfortunately, I lost my patience but I think I am entitled to flashes of temper on occasions when Deputy McGilligan puts me in the position he did to-day. I do not know what Deputy McGilligan's attitude is.  Deputy Donegan interprets it as being in <Col N="475" /> favour of the continuance of this mine and I suppose I shall have to accept that interpretation because I expect that he knows Deputy McGilligan better than I do.  Certainly, from what he said, he seemed to be prepared to go into the division lobby and vote against the granting of this money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not out of character.  I referred, when Deputy Corish was speaking, to a description Deputy Norton gave one time of Deputy McGilligan, but since Deputy McGilligan did pore back over previous volumes, I remember him being on record as stating that he, as a member of the Government, was not responsible for the employment of people in this State.  There are 500 people employed at this mine and I feel responsible, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, for their employment.  It is for that reason, as well as ensuring the viability of this mine, that I have come before the House on a number of occasions and sought further assistance for the St. Patrick's Copper Mines from the House, which has been readily forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy McGilligan tried to suggest that something had happened as a result, perhaps, of the advent to office of this Government that made this undertaking less viable than it was when he, as legal adviser to the inter-Party Government of 1954-57, negotiated the agreement with St. Patrick's Copper Mines and when he, as a voting member of the Dáil supporting that Government, supported the legislation that was necessary to execute that agreement. I take it that Deputy McGilligan and his associates at that time were quite satisfied with the <i>bona fides,</i> with the technical ability and with the financial set-up of the company with which he made that agreement at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly, as far as I know, there was nothing that that Government did then in relation to this agreement with that company which was in any way unjustifiable.  Certain criticisms were <Col N="476" /> made subsequently by the Taoiseach when he was in Opposition that at the then prevailing prices of copper it appeared that St. Patrick's Copper Mines were getting a very good bargain, and that was true.  The price of copper at that time was £430 a ton.</P>

      <P>I shall give the details later on.  It recovered to the present price of, roughly, £230, more or less, but it was not only the price of copper but the ore content of the deposits that were being extracted from St. Patrick's mines that caused the difficulties that have now arisen as well as other unforseeable incidents and accidents.  I shall refer to these later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back on the history of the mine which I have been requested to give, in the '40's there was a report by a leading British consulting engineer on the mineral deposits in Avoca. Following that report Mianraí Teoranta in 1947 commenced the exploration of the deposits in that area.  That exploration continued until 1955 and it cost Mianraí Teoranta, as supplied by the Government, £540,000.  It was carried out with the aid of these State funds by Mianraí own personnel and in 1954 a report was prepared, even before the exploration was completed, by Mianraí's own engineer and confirmed by a firm of consultants.  That report showed that there were 12 million tons of ore in West Avoca.  That quantity was in different places.  The main quantities, the major deposits, were in an area known as the South Lode and that was at a level of 1,670 feet below ground.  In that lode were some 9 million tons of ore which was assayed as grading one per cent. copper ore.  There was a small deposit of <Col N="477" /> 2,700,000 tons of ore in another lode called the Pond Lode, at a slightly lower level in a different area, that is at 1,300 feet.  That ore was assayed as grading 1.35 per cent. copper.</P>
    <P>After that report and in February, 1955, when the exploration operation was nearing completion, Mianraí advertised the mines as having reserves of some 13½ million tons of ore with its copper content at over one per cent. As a result of that advertisement there were a number of approaches from major companies who were interested in the project and they sent their engineers at different times to examine that report on the deposits at Avoca. During all these examinations and reports there is no evidence available that any doubts were cast on Mianraí's estimates.  In 1955 they commenced negotiations with the company mentioned here, Consolidated Mogul Mines of Toronto.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity Deputy McGilligan did not approach it in that spirit here to-day.  A mining lease was granted to St. Patrick's Copper Mines, a subsidiary of Consolidated Mogul, in January, 1956. During the following two years St. <Col N="478" /> Patrick's Copper Mines were actively engaged in the development of the deposits and in the construction of what is described for me as &ldquo;flotation plant,&rdquo; the object being to commence commercial production.  They spent somewhere in the region of £2 million of their own money in that operation.</P>
      <P>At that stage, there were certain credit restrictions in Canada, and certainly as far as the flotation of companies or the attraction of investment in any form of undertaking in Canada were concerned, many companies ran into difficulty.  So did Consolidated Mogul and so did St. Patrick's Copper Mines.  They found they were unable to attract further moneys beyond this £2 million they had already spent and they asked the Government in March, 1958, for certain assistance as a result of which the Oireachtas approved a Supplementary Estimate which provided for the guaranteeing of a £1,368,000 loan to be advanced by an independent Irish source.  That was necessary then to enable the development work commenced to be completed so that the mine could be brought into full production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this State-guaranteed loan was given the Government sought and was given a report on the Avoca mine, which was prepared by a well-known investment trust which already had substantial mining interests, including an interest in copper deposits, in various parts of the world.  The experts employed by the trust formed a distinctly favourable impression of what was going on at the mine, and so reported to the Government.  It was stated that the development work and the construction work at the mine were proceeding in a very workmanlike fashion, and these experts reported in particular that the work at the time was &ldquo;imaginative, yet sound&rdquo;.  As well as that, they confirmed that the estimates of mining and milling costs made by Consolidated Mogul before they entered into the agreement of 1956 were conservative.  Therefore, the Government felt justified at the time in coming before the House for approval, <Col N="479" /> and the House approved of the guarantee of this £1,368,000 loan.</P>
    <P>In October, 1958, the commercial production was commenced.  I might say that initially the commercial production was confined to areas in which Mianraí Teo. had not done any boring.  There were areas which were near the surface on which old workings had been carried out.  St. Patrick's had, perhaps, their own borings done in that area, but when they started working them they found, first, that the copper content of the ore was not as high as they themselves thought; and, secondly, as a result of these old workings there were a series of cavings-in, and that restricted considerably the output from that area. I am sorry.  The cavings-in did not occur then, but lower grade copper than they anticipated was found at that stage.  By reason of that, they found that their resources were not sufficient to carry on and they sought assistance again by way of a State-guaranteed loan of £550,000, which was duly approved by the Oireachtas in December, 1959.</P>
    <P>At that time, they decided to carry out mining on a more selective basis, particularly in East Avoca, by opening up an area known as Tigroney, where higher grade ore deposits were expected.  It was expected at the time that this proposal would lead to the production of higher grade ore which, at the price then ruling of £232 per ton, would enable the company in due time to discharge its liabilities in respect of the two State-guaranteed loans.</P>
    <P>During the past two years since the loan of £550,000 was made available to the company, again their prospects as to the grade of copper were not fulfilled.  It was in the past nine or ten months that the cavings-in in the old workings, to which I have already referred, began to take place.  This, of course, resulted in a considerable reduction in their through-put of ore and reduced the amount of ore extracted per month to 50,000 or 60,000 tons as against the target of 80,000 tons, while operating cost remained at a high level.  These two combinations of the lower grade ore <Col N="480" /> and the cavings-in incurred for the company heavy operating losses which ultimately drained away all the company's financial resources.</P>
    <P>Before I leave that aspect of it, I should mention that about 90 per cent. of the ores so far extracted in Avoca by St. Patrick's are in areas in which there was no exploration work done by Mianraí Teoranta.  The company are only now approaching the area in which Mianraí had proved the existence of major deposits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Minister leaves that point could he tell us how much of this ore was exported, what was its value, whether it was exported as ores or as concentrates?  If the Minister has not the information now, it will be all right later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be coming to it later.  Deputy Norton did ask other questions, which I think I will deal with as I have noted them.  In association with other Deputies, he asked questions about the accuracy of the Mianraí borings.</P>
      <P>First of all, I want to say that even though some of the test borings carried out by St. Patrick's in connection with the development work have not corresponded with the borings done by Mianraí Teoranta, that does not prove that Mianraí borings were inaccurate. Mianraí's borings were made here and there, as they are in any mineral exploration work, at intervals over the whole deposits.  The cores they extracted were assayed by their own experts and test-assayed in London by a very reputable firm of London assayists.  The results were only an indication of what there was in the area, but two boreholes side by side may produce different results.  I am told the ore in Avoca is like currants in a cake&mdash;a cake well endowed with currants&mdash;and that it is quite possible one borehole might miss a currant and that another might strike one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reason why it is expected some of St. Patrick's borings did not correspond with those of Mianraí Teoranta.  The borings Mianraí extracted were in the form of cylinders, which they cut in halves.  They sent one half to London for examination <Col N="481" /> by assayists there and they retained the other half so that their extracts were available for testing as being authentic and in no way misleading. St. Patrick's have not yet produced ore from the area in which Mianraí found the larger deposits but at the present time they are carrying out development work by way of tunnelling and by way of the installation of a conveyor belt and a crusher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this tunnelling under the river?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain about that, but some of it may be.  No; the tunnelling is at present on the far side of the river.  The tunnelling is intended ultimately to reach the South Lode and the installation of the crusher and the conveyor belt is expected to be completed by the end of April.  It was in connection with that development work that they carried out the preliminary check drilling which proved disappointing.  I understand, however, that St. Patrick's check drilling is far from completed and that there is no definite assertion as yet that the final results will not substantiate the Mianraí findings.  I should say in this respect that check borings made recently by St. Patrick's at the 1,300-foot level, where there are admittedly smaller deposits than where they are now boring, have confirmed Mianraí estimates of tonnage and ore content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the mineral content of the South Lode?  Was it not supposed that there would be 9,000,000 tons of mineralised ore there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>With the content slightly exceeding one per cent.  I am told that after extraction and dilution it would be reduced to 0.9 something per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that is lead as well as zinc?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  That question was asked.  Deputy Cosgrave asked what minerals other than copper are found.  There is of course the by-product of the copper mining, pyrites, but zinc and lead also occur but not <Col N="482" /> in sufficient quantities to make their economic working possible at present prices.  I should like to mention now the nitrogenous fertiliser factory.  A number of Deputies referred to it.  The availability of pyrites is not essential to the success of the nitrogenous fertiliser project.  The nitrogenous fertiliser factory committee, which recommended the use of pyrites from Avoca for the manufacture of certain nitrogenous fertilisers, reported that, given a continuity of copper mining in Avoca, the supplies and quality of the Avoca pyrites, as part of their mining operation, would give supplies and quality of pyrites adequate for the sulphur requirements of the proposed factory.</P>
      <P>I mention sulphur requirements because the sulphur extract from pyrites would be used only for the production of sulphate of ammonia. It would not be necessary to use sulphur for the production of ammonium nitrate or other forms of ammonia products.  In any event, the position is that the nitrogenous company&mdash;Nitrogen Éireann Teoranta, was set up to secure a binding tender for the erection of the factory and they are taking steps to ensure that the plant, tenders in connection with which they are seeking, can be converted if necessary, to the use of elemental sulphur for the production of sulphate of ammonia.  It was the proposition to base the fertiliser factory on Avoca pyrites because pyrites had a special economic attraction since it was being won with the copper ore from Avoca, but the position is that sulphur may be used instead.  The important thing to remember is that, whichever is used, the committee established to examine the setting up of the factory reported that, whether it is sulphur extract from Avoca pyrites or converted sulphur rock, this factory can produce nitrogenous fertiliser economically for the farmer, without subsidy or protection, at prices which compare favourably with current import prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say that they do not contemplate processing pyrites for the home or export market?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the terms of these discussions. The first I heard about the processing of pyrites was in connection with the nitrogenous fertiliser plant.  I am now reminded that they do export pyrites, but not processed pyrites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In what quantity, so far, and what is its value?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall come to that again.  In summing up this aspect of my reply, I should say that a substantial part of the production envisaged at the nitrogenous fertiliser factory at Arklow will not be affected in any way by the possible failure of production of pyrites at Avoca.  I mentioned already, I think, that sulphur comes from pyrites and is used only for the purpose of manufacturing sulphate of ammonia and not for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate, or other forms of ammonia, used for fertiliser purposes.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Dillon was speaking, I mentioned what the expenditure was, on one side and the other, on the copper mines to date.  The figures to date are £1,368,000, plus £550,000, making something short of £2,000,000; and the expenditure from moneys invested by Canadian sources is of a similar amount, almost exactly £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There was repayment of interest but not of capital.  In the context of the financial assistance given, I forgot to mention that in October 1947 there was a trade loan of £350,000 and in January, 1959 there was another trade loan of £100,000. Each of these was consolidated in the subsequent State guaranteed loans and, therefore, these are not additional and were, in fact, repaid out of the guaranteed loans subsequently given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Someone asked about the technical ability of the operators.  From the reports I have received, I am satisfied that the best technical skills available are being used.  I take it that the Government in 1956 satisfied themselves as to the technical capacity at that time. Monthly reports are submitted to me, together with reports by the Director of the Geological Survey, so that month by month we have a report of the output, of activities generally, and of income by way of sales of copper ore and pyrites.  These reports are offically commented upon and the Minister is thereby kept fully in the picture.</P>
      <P>As far as the appointment of the director is concerned, under the conditions of the trade loans and of the subsequent State guaranteed loans the Minister has power to appoint a director.  So far, we have not exercised that power.</P>
      <P>Coming to prices&mdash;these were raised, in particular, by Deputy Norton the last day&mdash;the price quoted on the London Metal Exchange stood at over £250 a ton during the first half of 1960. I am referring now to copper prices. The price dropped to between £220 and £230 in the latter part of 1960.  During 1961 prices generally were in the region of £220 to £230 per ton.  There has been a slight increase recently. The last quotation I have is the price on the 16th instant&mdash;£234 per ton.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the value of production is concerned I have some figures that may help Deputy Norton.  The financial accounts of the company are, of course, published and laid on the Table of the House. We have reports for the years ended 31st December, 1958, 1959 and 1960. The production of copper concentrates in the two months of production ending in 1958 was £103,194 and £10,500 for pyrites.  In 1959 the figure for copper was £841,731; copper concentrates £950,196.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is gross.  Are there any expenses in those figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The expenses are contained in the published accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>They are quite nice exports, if they could get a good copper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The exports for the three years of both copper ore and concentrates are as follows: in 1959 the value was £836,659; in 1960, £1,103,200; in 1961, £809,991.  I have not got the figures for pyrites.  They are not published.  The export of pyrites is rather intermittent.  It is difficult to get markets abroad.  At the moment there are 11,000 tons in stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of the future of the mine, I am, as I said, satisfied that the best technical skills are being used to make this mine economic.  The present difficulty arose largely because of the low ore content in the workings near the surface that Mianraí Teoranta had not surveyed and the cavings-in which occurred in the early months of 1961.  As soon as the new development work gets to the wider deposit in the South Lode, where 9,000,000 tons of ore have been proved exceeding 1 per cent. in ore content, there is a good chance that production of copper of an economic ore content will increase.  The company <Col N="486" /> are doing everything possible to achieve this development and get at this lode as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Originally, when they sought State assistance, the suggestion was made that they could carry on with production. Because of the low ore content and the limited amounts of ore, they were able to extract, they found they were losing some $50,000 to $60,000 a month.  To continue on that basis would be very uneconomic and they later suggested they should concentrate all their efforts, with the aid of this £240,000, on development alone. That would mean the laying-off of some couple of hundred men&mdash;electricians, mechanics, and so on.</P>
    <P>I asked the company to continue with production and not to decide to lay off men, unless that was absolutely necessary.  They decided to do that and it is on that basis I am coming before the House.  It may not be possible for them to go ahead with development work and to continue making losses on the basis of full production, but if they decided to lay off men again, I have asked the company to make the lay-off as limited as possible and for as short a duration as possible.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was made there might be more money coming from the parent company, by way of investment from Canada.  The Government have interests in this mine to the extent of £2,000,000 in State guarantees.  Were it not for that interest, the company would, if guided purely by commercial principles, concentrate on development work only which would necessitate this lay-off. It was in deference to the Government's wishes that they did not propose to proceed with that, unless it <Col N="487" /> was absolutely necessary and they could not find more equity, more investment capital from Canada or from some other source in the meantime. I think the operations there, having regard to the findings of Minaraí Teoranta, having regard to the investment already made in it, are worth pursuing and I believe in the end will prove economic, viable and worthwhile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £90,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1962, for the increase of the Grant to Local Authorities in Relief of Rates on Agricultural Land (No. 35 of 1925; No. 28 of 1931; No. 23 of 1939; No. 36 of 1946; No. 36 of 1953; No. 18 of 1956; and No. 11 of 1959).</P>
      <P>When the original Estimate for Supplementary Agricultural Grants was submitted the local authorities had not yet fixed their rates and, on the basis of experience in previous years, an average increase of 3% in rates was provided for and a provision of £5,160,000 was made in the Estimate.</P>
      <P>The rates actually struck represent an increase of about 5% on the previous year.  The additional amount needed is estimated at £90,000&mdash;the sum provided for in this Supplementary Estimate.  Allowing for the extra £90,000 proposed the total expenditure in respect of the Agricultural Grant for 1961-62 will be £5,850,000 of which £5,250,000 will be from voted moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agricultural grant is divided into two main headings, the primary allowance and the employment allowance. The primary allowance for this year will take £4,762,000, that is, as Deputies are aware, three-fifths remission of rates on the first £20 valuation of the holding, and the employment <Col N="488" /> allowance will take £1,062,000, that is, £17 per person employed by the farmer, whether the person is a relative or a paid employee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House welcome what is merely an automatic increase taking place as a result of the extraordinary increases in rates which have been largely borne by the agricultural community over a number of years.  It is now stated by the Minister that he has always budgeted for a three per cent. increase in rates but last year the increase was five per cent.</P>
      <P>Lest anybody should take the view that this is another grant to the farmer, I should like to point out that the farmer is the only citizen who pays rates on what I would call his stock in trade.  The factory owner, the business man, pays rates on his property but that has no relation to the earning capacity of that property.  A small jeweller's shop might have a very small rate but it could have an earning capacity far above the amount of the rates on the property.  The farmer is in a different position.  On the basis of his earning power, which is his agricultural land, he has been rated.  He pays rates on his buildings, out-offices and on his stock in trade.</P>
      <P>The crossroads has been reached and the arrival of this Supplementary Estimate is an indication of it.  The impact of the Health Act on the rates, which the Minister opposite said at one time would mean no more than 2/-and the regional water schemes which are now proceeding have pushed this Estimate of the Minister from three per cent. to five per cent.  I believe that this day two months the Minister's advisers will be in a position to tell him that the increase next year will be considerably greater and that the imposition which the farmers must face will result in a further Supplementary Estimate arriving during the coming financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of normal farming income, the present primary allowance referred to by the Minister is related to a valuation of £20.  It would be a great step to increase the amount of valuation upon which this two-thirds <Col N="489" /> remission would have effect.  There is also the point that the secondary allowance, namely, the £17 per year remission for a man employed, should take into account persons employed on seasonal work.  I could give an instance of a farmer who pays £4,000 for labour, on a particularly large farm, admittedly, who gets a remission of only £68 because quite a number of these workers are employed on horticulture and the harvesting of cereals.</P>
    <P>It is our considered opinion that next year a further Supplementary Estimate will be necessary unless something is done to remove from the farmer's back these impositions which have come about because of the greater demands placed on the rates through legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder does the Minister, in asking for this sum of £90,000, realise the situation that has arisen amongst rural dwellers?  I think the Minister is living in a fool's paradise.  He has not the least idea of what is happening in the country at the present time.  The only hope I can see of bringing the Minister to his senses is the way the farmers have gone into open rebellion against the rates. Our rates in County Mayo are 58/10d. in the £ this year.  I want to put this question to the Minister.  Do the Government of which he is a member think they can continue to raise taxation off the land to the extent involved in the legislation they have forced on it?  It is the legislation passed here by Fianna Fáil Governments that has driven up the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, when he was Minister for Health, came in here with the Health Act and said that he could not see the rates being affected as a result of that Act.  He said that its operation would not increase the rates by any more than 2/6d. in the £.  Does the Minister remember making that statement?  What was the health rate in County Mayo alone last year?  It was 22/7d. in the £ which is a pound and a penny over and above the Minister's optimistic estimate.  One of the causes of the rates being at their present level is that Fianna Fáil, since 1932, have been in the habit of forcing legislation giving benefits to certain <Col N="490" /> people and passing the cost on to the ratepayers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In deference to your ruling, Sir, I shall not go any further on that point, except to remind the House that it is legislation passed by the House that has left the rates in the deplorable condition in which they are today.  The time has come when the Government will have to face up to the complete derating of all the land in this country so as to put us on a level with the farmers of Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  At the very least, they will have to derate the land of the lower valuations.</P>
      <P>All our villages and townlands which were formerly full of happy homes are empty now because the people have been forced to emigrate. The pattern of emigration heretofore was that the youngest ones went but there was always someone left behind to carry on the family name and tradition. All that is changed.  Now they are all going and the houses and farms are left deserted.  I believe that to counter this, the Minister will have to shoulder the whole burden of the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What industry in this country is being taxed on its means of livelihood in the manner in which the land is being taxed?  Every other industry is being feather-bedded and bolstered, but it seems to me that the Government have an undying hatred for all those who live on the land.  Ever since they first came into power, they have hit the people living on the land blow after blow.  The result is that the land <Col N="491" /> is being completely depopulated.  The level of the rates has driven the people from the country with the result that the work of other Government Departments has been upset.  The flight from the land is making a huge joke of the work of the Land Commission.  The time has come when the Government will have to shoulder the burden of the rates.</P>
    <P>At the present time, the small holdings throughout the country would not be worth the rates being paid for them, if they were put up for sale on the open market.  That has all been brought about by the action of the Minister and his colleagues in giving gifts to certain people at the expense of the ratepayers.  If the Government want to give gifts and pay benefits to certain people, the best proof of their willingness to do this is to pay for them themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I still say it and I would be prepared to have an independent arbitrator investigate the matter and put £100 on the result.  In my own constituency, the increase in the cost of the Health Act since 1953 is 4/- in the £ and does anybody tell me that there were not increases to hospital staffs and others in that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan's suggestion of a £20 primary allowance would be a nice thing if we could afford it, but I doubt if we can.  I do not agree with the suggestion about the employment allowance.  I do not think we should give it for casual labour.  The primary object of bringing that in was to try to get farmers to give employment all the year round.  I do not think it is fair for a farmer to expect a man to be available for three or four months in the summer and to be able to look after himself for the remainder of the year.  It was to encourage farmers to give employment the full year round <Col N="492" /> that the employment allowance provision was made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blowick has been threatening rebellion amongst the farmers and stating that the farmers will not pay.  We have heard these threats from other organisations over the past 30 or 40 years and we are prepared to meet them.  They will not get anything by making such threats, even if they have the support of Deputy Blowick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £600,000 be granted to meet such of the charges as have not been otherwise provided for, which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of March, 1962, for Increases in Remuneration of Civil Servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the recent upward movement of wage rates generally which has become known as the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo;.  This movement has caused repercussions in the public service where, as I mentioned in my last Budget Statement, rates of pay are for the most part fixed by conciliation and arbitration machinery and a significant <Col N="495" /> influence is exercised by the level of pay in outside employment.</P>
    <P>Claims have been made on behalf of nearly all grades coming within the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service.  The pay of the bulk of these grades has already been adjusted by reference to the &ldquo;eighth round&rdquo;.  It is estimated that increases for grades covered by the scheme, together with consequential adjustments for higher staff, will cost over £2 million for a whole year and about £1 million in the current financial year. No provision was made in this year's Estimates for these increases.</P>
    <P>On some Votes, the additional expenditure can be met out of savings; on others, the amounts required for pay increases have been included in Supplementary Estimates which would, in any event, have been necessary. The present Estimate for £600,000 covers 12 Votes which otherwise would have required Supplementary Estimates solely to meet pay increases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House view with grave trepidation the fact that this Estimate is necessary. We understand the machinery that exists for bringing up Civil Service remuneration when there is increased remuneration in other occupations in the country but, in making observations on this Estimate, it would be wise to remember that the people about whom we have just been talking, the farmers, have had no increase in the price of their agricultural produce since 1953 while in my opinion, the increase in their costs of production could be measured as being between 40 per cent. and 60 per cent. since that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave figures in a recent statement, which I cannot extract, which indicated that the gross agricultural income has increased by some relatively small sum.  Of course, when the Minister says it, I accept that it is true, but it points to the fact that these people have much less to live on than they had in 1953 and that the self-employed people, who are catering for a smaller population, and <Col N="496" /> have a smaller range of customers, have smaller incomes than in 1953. I do not deliberately take the year 1953 except for the reason that the agricultural price index is fixed at 100 based on that year.  The Minister will understand that there is no political implication in taking that year.</P>
    <P>At this stage we should remember that there may be inflation at the end of the year and that we are approaching a Budget about which the Minister has expressed trepidation as to what he may have to do.</P>
    <P>It is a sad thing that the increase in remuneration throughout the economy has been restricted to those people who through their trade unions could get increases irrespective of the results in the prices of products and to people such as civil servants who have their arbitration machinery.</P>
    <P>In passing this Estimate, it is wise to draw attention to the people I have mentioned and, indeed, to pensioners and persons on fixed incomes who have not got increases corresponding to the increase that this £600,000 means to civil servants and to realise that we are not bringing up the people as a whole to the standard which is enjoyed by certain small sections of our community, which we do not grudge them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>As a matter of fact, I was making the case for the farmers.  I went on to make the case for the farmers and said they did not get the increase that others had got and I spoke of the difficulty in dealing with them because their prices are largely determined by prices on the export market.  That is why it is terribly difficult to do anything in that respect. To a certain extent, we can subsidise them.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be in order to deal with the whole agricultural position now.  I can only ask for this Estimate for increases.  There will be about £1,000,000 due this year for the Civil Service.  That would be about a half year on the increase &mdash; £600,000 here and another £400,000 to come from Departments where they had savings to pay it.  In a few cases, where Estimates are coming from the Dáil, for some other reason, a sum is put in for increased remuneration.  The Civil Service increase will be about £2,000,000 for the year&mdash;£1,000,000 which covers half a year in this financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Part III of the Cement (Amendment) Act, 1938, which incorporates Sections 12 to 17, inclusive, is concerned solely with the importation of cement.  Section 13 provides that it shall not be lawful for any person to import cement for use in this country save under a licence issued by me in accordance with the provisions of Part III of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the period of 24 years which has elapsed since the Act was passed Cement Ltd., the sole manufacturers of cement in the State, have, by and large, been able not only to supply the <Col N="498" /> full requirements of the home market but also to build up a substantial export trade.  In practice, therefore, and excluding the World War period and certain other short periods of exceptional supply difficulties, the necessity has not arisen for licensing any imports of cement.</P>
    <P>Cement Ltd., in common with other Irish industrial undertakings, are concerned to ensure that everything possible is done to enable the industry to survive and prosper in the conditions of free trading which will prevail in the event of our joining the European Economic Community.  In planning to consolidate the industry both technically and financially the company have represented to me that it is desirable to replace the existing protection which is, in effect, a total prohibition of imports, by bringing into effect now the customs duty of 30 per cent. full rate, and 20 per cent. preferential rate, which was imposed by Government Order some time ago, but which, of course, has not so far been applied.  Having considered the implications of the Company's representations in all their aspects, I am fully satisfied that it is necessary for the good of the industry and in the national interest, that the existing import control arrangements should be terminated and should be replaced, as proposed, by the lesser degree of protection afforded by the customs duty.</P>
    <P>Cement Ltd., consider that even though the customs duty of 30 per cent. (full) and 20 per cent. (preferential) on cement will, under Common Market conditions, have to be stepped down and eventually disappear, the protection of the duty should be sufficient to allow the company to consolidate itself in the intervening period to meet any competition, except aggressive dumping.</P>
    <P>Except in so far as it may become necessary to offset increased costs which are outside the control of the company, Cement Ltd., have undertaken not to increase their home market prices which, I understand, compare favourably at present with cement prices in Britain and on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to its early passage through all stages so that Cement <Col N="499" /> Limited may be in a position to proceed with their plans as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome a situation in which an Irish company has reached a stage of considerable export, at the same time providing all the goods required in its particular field for the country itself.  It would not be amiss at this stage to say that the services given by Cement Limited, to the country have been excellent. The quality of their goods is excellent and in every way in their employment and treatment of labour they have been very welcome here.</P>
      <P>This Bill is in line with future Common Market policy.  It is quite obvious that its purpose is to create a customs duty which will protect Cement Limited, and which will be ready for the progressive dismantling of such customs duties which will come when and if we become a full member of the Common Market.</P>
      <P>I think all nations in Europe, in the period before they enter the Common Market, have seen to it, in regard to particular industries, that where there was full prohibition or some form of protection other than customs duty, a customs duty was set up which, by progressive reduction, would give some protection during the years to come.  This is a wise measure and one which will commend itself to the House.</P>
      <P>The development at Drogheda, where Cement Limited, from their basic production, are now embarking on a new factory to make pipes, with a very considerable capital investment, is one that should also be welcomed. I am sure every member of this House will be glad to hear about it as well as its extra labour potential.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that if this country is admitted as a full member in the Common Market, tariffs and quotas on goods coming from member countries to this country will eventually have to go.  Over the past couple of years, industry in this country has been endeavouring to equip itself so that it will be capable of meeting the difficulties which will face it in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="500" /> It seems clear that to convince the European Economic Community of our earnestness in seeking full membership and of the ability of our industries to face up to competition outside, it is desirable that by degrees we lower the tariffs on goods coming into this country where the industry here producing similar goods is capable of standing up to this.  However, as this matter has a direct bearing on my constituency, I should like to make a couple of points.</P>
    <P>The cement industry in Drogheda has the greatest male labour content of any industry in my constituency. The economy of the town of Drogheda is dependent to a considerable extent on the employment in this particular industry.  That is not to say that other industries are not playing their part in the economy of the town but, because it has a mainly male labour content with a considerable number of families directly and indirectly dependent on it, it is understandable that I should be concerned with the possible effect of these proposals on employment.  The Minister has already examined this matter fully and I should like to know what effect the proposals in this Bill are likely to have on employment in the Drogheda cement factory.  Should they have a detrimental effect, I know that he will keep the matter under review.  I am glad to note that a tariff of 30 per cent. full rate and 20 per cent. preferential is being retained for the time being, because there was a certain amount of uneasiness in Drogheda regarding this matter. Having read reports about this Bill many workers in the industry feared that imports were to be admitted freely.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephRLeneghan" hpid="Mr. Leneghan Mr. Leneghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leneghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very little to say on the Bill and only two points to make against it.  It is an extraordinary situation that, since 1938, the cement industry was able to carry on without any such Bill being introduced. Evidently, the Minister could, at his leisure, control imports of cement until we reached a point at which it was possible to export cement.  When we are supposed to be entering the Common Market&mdash; one of the reasons given for introducing this Bill&mdash;we are putting on a <Col N="501" /> tariff, while we have been led to believe up to now that the tariffs would have to be wiped out if we went into the Common Market.  The Minister should not try to fool anybody.</P>
      <P>The only reason I see for this Bill is to give Cement Ltd. an opportunity to increase the price of its products. Somebody will now try to import cement and will, no doubt, get a permit and the price will be increased by 30 per cent.  Immediately, Cement Ltd. will have a very fine opportunity to increase its price so that it will make a further substantial profit and will then, of course, be in a position to compete when we enter the Common Market.  That is a very peculiar type of economics.  Unless we are given an absolute assurance that there will be no increase in the price of the products of that company. I shall vote against the Bill if the opportunity to vote arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will have no adverse effect whatever on employment in Drogheda.  On the contrary, by enabling the company to consolidate its position, it will serve to secure the employment of workers there and in Limerick.  In the period between now and our possible entry into the Common Market, the intention of Cement Ltd. is to make a further financial investment in the company, to make it more economic and competitive so far as imports are concerned.</P>
      <P>In regard to Deputy Leneghan's criticism, I doubt if anybody will want to import cement and sell it at a higher price than that at which it is available from Cement Ltd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>For one thing, the company have been controlled for some considerable time; secondly, they have given an undertaking that, with the removal of the import restrictions, they will not increase their prices, unless though force of circumstances outside their control, for example, justifiable wage increases.  I should like to point out that the most extreme and restrictive form of protection is quantitative <Col N="502" /> restriction of imports.  That is what is now being removed and replaced by a comparatively low rate of tariff so that the Deputy's fears are completely unfounded and his criticism unjustified.</P>

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Street and House to House Collections Bill, 1962.&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to provide for the regulation of collections of money from the public by way of what are commonly called flag days and by way of house to house visits.  Such regulation is becoming increasingly necessary, in the public interest, both to prevent collections becoming a public nuisance and to enable some control to be exercised over the objects for which collections may be held.</P>
      <P>At present street collections are subject to a certain measure of control under regulations made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána pursuant to Section 5 of the Police, Factories, Etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1916.  These regulations provide for the granting of collection permits by the Gardaí and for the prevention of inconvenience to the public but they do not empower the Gardaí to refuse permission to collect even to the most unsuitable persons. Furthermore, the regulations do not apply to house to house collections. The present Bill is designed to remedy the defects in the existing law by providing a modern comprehensive enactment to regulate both street and house-to-house collections and to enable the holding of such collection to be prohibited in specified circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Collection&rdquo; is defined in Section 1 of the Bill so as to exclude street trading, ordinary trade or business, collecting in accordance with a licence or permit under the Gaming and <Col N="503" /> Lotteries Act (which covers collections for non-stop draws, pools, etc.) and begging.  Accordingly, the Bill does not apply to these types of collecting. Furthermore, it will not apply to house to house collections unless and until an order is made by the Minister for Justice under Section 2 extending the proposed Act to such collections.  I am satisfied that while house-to-house collections at the present time may be a source of annoyance to some householders they do not constitute a widespread nuisance and that, generally speaking, the public is not being excessively importuned by them. Accordingly, I do not envisage the making of an Order under Section 2 in present circumstances.  At the same time I think it is desirable that I should have the power to regulate such collections if this becomes necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that an Order under Section 2 may apply the provisions of the Act to house-to-house collections generally, that is to say, throughout the entire country, or merely to such collections in a particular district or area.  Moreover an Order may exempt specific house-to-house collections or classes of such collections from control.  If it ever becomes necessary to apply the Act to house-to-house collections I envisage that collections made for religious and other obviously legitimate purposes would be so exempted.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill prohibits the holding of any collection in respect of which a collection permit has not been granted by the Chief Superintendent of the Garda Síochána for the locality in which the collection is to be held. Section 5 provides that applications for permits will have to be made in writing in the prescribed form and be accompanied by the prescribed particulars. Generally speaking applications will have to be made not more than six months and not less than 14 days before the collection is due to commence.  A Chief Superintendent will be obliged to grant every permit applied for unless in his opinion grounds for refusal exist as specified in Sections 9, 10, 11 or 12 of the Bill. <Col N="504" /> These grounds are: that the holding of the collection would be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order; that the collection is for an illegal or immoral purpose or for an illegal organisation; that the proceeds would be used to encourage unlawful acts; that the proceeds would not be used for the purported object; that the organisers would derive personal gain, or the collectors' personal gain other than a reasonable commission for their services, from the collection; that the applicant for the permit is not a fit person because he has been convicted of one or more of certain offences specified in the Bill; that the applicant, in organising a previous collection, failed to exercise due diligence in having it properly conducted in compliance with the Act; or that the applicant has withheld or has failed to furnish information requested by the Chief Superintendent.  Where the Chief Superintendent is of opinion that any of these grounds exist he will be obliged to refuse to grant a permit.</P>
    <P>In addition to refusing a permit, a Chief Superintendent may attach conditions to a permit, and he may revoke a permit granted in his division.  However, where a person is aggrieved by the Chief Superintendent's decision, provision is made in Section 14 for an appeal to the District Court and the Court is given power to direct the Chief Superintendent to grant a permit with or without conditions attached to it.  The Court may also amend or delete conditions attached to a permit by the Chief Superintendent.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it an offence for a person to act as a collector unless he is in possession of a written authorisation from the holder of a collection permit.  The issue of such authorisations to collectors under the age of 14 is prohibited.  The Bill also provides for the marking on collection boxes of the object for which the collection is being held and also for the keeping of full and proper accounts of the amounts collected.  Specific powers of entry and arrest and specific powers to seize money and collection boxes in certain circumstances are given to the Gardaí.  The Bill makes it an offence for the owners of certain public places to allow unauthorised collections to be <Col N="505" /> held therein.  The penalties for offences under any of the provisions of the Bill are set out in Section 26.  They are a fine not exceeding £50 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or both such fine and such imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the proposed powers and the penalties are no more than adequate to ensure compliance with the law.  Deputies will appreciate the difficulty which might arise in enforcing the proposed Act if organisers of unauthorised collections choose to ignore the law.  It is for this reason that the Bill includes the additional deterrent in Section 21, namely, the power given to the Gardaí to seize money and collection boxes in the case of an unauthorised collection.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to draw attention to the provisions in the Bill for proving offences.  In subsection (3) of Section 3 it is provided that a certificate of the Chief Superintendent, to the effect that a collection permit had not been granted in a particular case, will be evidence of the matters certified. This is a normal provision.  In subsection (5) of Section 15 and subsection (4) of Section 16 it is for the person charged with an offence to show that he held a collector's authorisation or that the collector was not under the age of 14 years, respectively. These provisions are required for practical reasons arising out of the nature of the offences.  On the other hand under Sections 4, 16, 17 and 23 a good defence against most charges under the proposed Act is provided for in cases where, generally speaking, persons charged can show that they were unaware of a contravention of the law or had taken reasonable steps to comply with the law.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which must be considered in Committee rather than on Second Reading. The Minister seems to present the Bill to the House as something in the nature of a new broom, so far as house to house and street collections are concerned.  I think that is taking a <Col N="506" /> rather exaggerated view of it.  There may be some new bristles in it, but it is certainly not a new broom.  As the Minister has pointed out, this question of street collections is, in fact, at the moment governed by the Police, Factories, Etc. (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1916, and regulations under that Act have been made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána as far back as 1930.  Very many of the provisions of this Bill are, in fact, provided for in the regulations made by the Commissioner.</P>
      <P>The Minister is quite right in stating that the 1916 Act and the regulations made under it do not deal with the question of house to house collections at all, and to that extent this Bill is a departure&mdash;and I think a very admirable departure&mdash;from the present position.  It is also a departure from the present position in allowing the appropriate Garda Superintendent discretion to refuse to grant a permit. There is also a departure on the question of allowing an appeal to the court from the refusal of the Chief Superintendent.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things in the Bill which I think will have to be considered rather more carefully in Committee.  It is right that we should at least take cognisance at this stage of what the Minister is doing in relation to the age limit of people who may be authorised to collect.  He is, in fact, reducing the age limit from 16 years to 14 years.  I think I am correct in saying that under the regulations existing at the moment, the 1930 regulations made by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, a person under the age of 16 years is not entitled to collect.  Under this Bill, that age is reduced to 14 years.  I do not think that is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to the fact that although this Bill contains the usual definition section, Section 1, the definition section is thrown overboard in Section 2. Section 1 defines &ldquo;collection&rdquo; as meaning a collection of money or an attempt to collect money.  Section 2, when the reference is obviously to &ldquo;collection&rdquo;, repeats again and again &ldquo;...collections of money or attempts <Col N="507" /> to collect money ...&rdquo;  It seems to me that the use of the phrase &ldquo;attempts to collect money&rdquo; is already covered by the definition in the definition section and need not be repeated.</P>
    <P>I think we should take another look at Section 3 to which the Minister referred.  Subsection (3) of that section provides that:</P>
    <P>In any proceedings under this section a certificate&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is, the prohibition of unauthorised collections&mdash;</P>
    <P>purporting to be signed by a Chief Superintendent and to certify that on a day or days or during a period specified in the certificate a person named therein was not the holder of a collection permit authorising him to hold on such day or days or during such period a collection or a collection for the benefit of a particular object, as the case may be, shall, without proof of the signature of the person purporting to sign the certificate or that he was a Chief Superintendent, be evidence until the contrary is proved of the matters certified in and by the certificate.</P>
    <P>I think we are going altogether too far along these lines and they have been laid down in recent legislation in this House.  We are providing here that evidence will be accepted by the courts on the certificate signed by a person who need not be a Chief Superintendent.  Provided it is purported to be signed by the Superintendent, it must be accepted by the courts and all it contains must be accepted by the courts and that document must be accepted without proof that it is signed by the Chief Superintendent and without proof that the person who signed it is, in fact, a Chief Superintendent.</P>
    <P>There are two other provisions in the Bill to which I certainly would take exception, unless the Minister can convince me that it is vitally necessary to retain them.  One is in Section 14, dealing with the question of an appeal to the district court.  It seems to me <Col N="508" /> that the provisions of subsection (4) of Section 14 completely take away any benefit which might accrue from this provision regarding an appeal to the court from the refusal of a Superintendent to grant a permit, because this section solemnly sets up the machinery whereby, in the event of a refusal, an appeal will lie to the court and then it goes on to provide &ldquo;without prejudice to the jurisdiction of the District Court to disallow on other grounds an appeal under this section, an appeal under this section shall be disallowed, if, on the hearing thereof, a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of Inspector states on oath that he has reasonable grounds for believing that the proceeds or any portion of the proceeds to which the collection permit the subject of such appeal relates would be used ...&rdquo; for the other purposes then mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would be going too far to suggest that the officer of the Garda Síochána concerned should be required to satisfy the court in some manner that he has reasonable grounds for feeling that the proceeds of the collection might be used for the undesirable purposes set out in the section.  I do not think it is right that we should arrive at a state where all an Inspector of the Garda Síochána has to do is to get into the witness box and say that he &ldquo;has grounds for believing,&rdquo; without presenting any evidence whatever in support of his statement, or without making any effort whatever to satisfy the court that his grounds for belief are reasonable.</P>
    <P>Again, in Section 15 and Section 16, we are once more legislating that with regard to a particular offence under this Bill a person is to be presumed to be guilty unless he can satisfy the court that he is innocent.  That kind of provision was incorporated in the Road Traffic Act which was passed by the previous Dáil.  Reasons were given then regarding particular difficulties involved by way of proof and so on, and the fact that there was no undue hardship being imposed on the defendant if he was in the right.  That generally was the type of argument put up in favour of a similar type of provision.  I do not <Col N="509" /> think those arguments apply here.  We should preserve as far as we possibly can the ordinary pattern and code of legislation that a person is presumed innocent until he is proved guilty.  In Sections 15 and 16 we are doing quite the opposite and we are saying that until a person satisfies a court that he is innocent he is presumed guilty. Subsection (5) of Section 15 reads:</P>
    <P>In a prosecution for an offence under this section, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that at the time he acted as a collector in the collection, the defendant did not hold a collector's authorisation granted to him by the holder of the collection permit relating to the collection.</P>
    <P>That, to my mind, is tantamount to saying that the defendant, the person being charged with the offence, is presumed to be guilty until he can show that he is innocent.  That is a complete reversal of the ordinary pattern of legislation in respect of those matters, in either statutory law or common law. An exactly similar position appears in subsection (4) of Section 16.  I should like the Minister to have another look at those subsections before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I should also like to raise with the Minister the question of the general obligation of accounting in respect of collections, which is dealt with in Section 24.  The authorities are entitled to be satisfied that the person who is applying for a collection permit is <i>bona fide,</i> or the organisation or body which he represents are <i>bona fide,</i> and that they are going to use the proceeds of the collection for the purposes for which they applied for it. The authorities are entitled to be satisfied on that before they issue the permit and I have no doubt they will discharge their duties adequately in that regard.  I do not appreciate then why it is necessary also to include provision in this Bill that after the collection has been made, presumably by a person who has, or a body which has satisfied the authorities of his or their <i>bona fides,</i> a strict account must be rendered to the authorities regarding the proceeds of the collection on <Col N="510" /> demand or, as I think it is provided, within a month of demand being made.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that under the present regulations, the 1930 regulations, the Superintendent has authority to require some type of accounting and I think there is generally a request in the form of application made for a permit for some kind of break-up of how it is intended to dispose of the proceeds; but here in Section 24 a very strict accounting is going to be required.  I have had association with collections of one sort or another from time to time, some charitable, some political&mdash; whether they are regarded as being&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in the same category or not, I do not know, but I do feel in relation to some of these collections, it would be imposing a very undesirable burden on those who undertake the collections, if they were required to make a strict accounting in this manner.  I feel that if the authorities are satisfied with the objects of the collection and the character and <i>bona fides</i> of the people carrying it out, that section is not necessary.</P>
      <P>This might be unworkable, but I should like to find out if the Minister might be able to provide in this Bill for the possibility of some central authority issuing a general collection permit for the country as a whole.  I appreciate that might involve some administrative difficulties and might involve the Commissioner, or whatever officer might have such authority, in making inquiries to make sure that collections did not clash in different Garda areas.  I think it would be a very great convenience for the person or body&mdash;again, I am assuming they are perfectly <i>bona fide</i> in character and everything else&mdash;to be able to get a general collection permit from a central authority which would entitle them to collect in all areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything else I want to say at this stage.  It will be <Col N="511" /> necessary to give the Bill more detailed consideration on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is timely, particularly from my point of view, because it affords me an opportunity of giving expression to a grievance under which the citizens of this city have been-labouring for a long number of years; and as each year goes by the grievance increases in size.  Like Deputy O'Higgins, I welcome these provisions.  But I am surprised that the Minister proposes to reduce the age of collectors, if what Deputy O'Higgins contends is correct.  I think that would be a very bad move.</P>
      <P>What I have in mind in relation to collections is the mass attack which is made practically every week-end on the unfortunate citizens of Dublin who repair to public houses for a quiet evening.  Many members of the House will agree with me that very often those who have recourse, as I have, to such places of public entertainment see children coming in at late hours with collection boxes or flags for many and varied causes.  Many of these causes are good, some obscure and some with vague names on many occasions known only to the organisers. We see the public house tenantry on these week-ends importuned, pressed, persecuted and interrupted by these people in their very often weighty deliberations.  There is no provision in the Bill to eliminate that abuse; and it is a definite abuse. I am sure the Minister himself has some experience of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious this Bill will not be taken through all its Stages to-night. I would suggest that the Minister might seriously consider the prohibition of collections on licensed premises by means of boxes or alleged flag days or sale of tickets or any other form.  Inherent in that are possibilities <Col N="512" /> of all kinds of dangerous and evil things.  It is a most unhealthy thing to see young people&mdash;say a child of 14½, as will be permitted under this Bill, or of 15 or 16&mdash;coming into a public house.  Very often the debate has got to a certain stage of heat or, perhaps, conviviality; and because the reasoning of the customer is not at its best, the opportunity is taken by these organisations to send in these young people to get the maximum amount of money they can out of the customers in these places.</P>
    <P>That is wrong and evil.  Only recently I saw an advertisement in one of the evening papers offering a commission of 33? per cent. to collectors who undertake this kind of thing.  The young people are hardly to be blamed for not losing an opportunity of earning what they regard as easy money.  But this is a bad thing socially and it is a matter of much complaint throughout the length and breadth of this city, and I am sure Deputies are aware of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware that this Bill is aimed largely at an illegal organisation, but I hope we are not going too far.  I can understand the responsibility the Minister feels, but I hope the Bill will not debar this same illegal organisation from collecting money for the care and welfare of the wives and children of people who may be in jail.  A distinction will have to be drawn between collections for that purpose and collections for the attempted aims of these organisations. I am told that there are now 80 persons in jail in the 26 Counties and maybe 100 in the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be 103.  We do not know.  We are legislating for the future.  After the Civil War, when there were large numbers in jail, members of the present Government had to make collections to help the families of those in prison.  I know it will be difficult to distinguish, but the Minister will have to consider the point.  If large numbers are in prison in Belfast and down here and certain <Col N="513" /> groups associated with these illegal organisations seek to collect money for the welfare of the families of those in prison, it would be unfair of the Minister to state that under no circumstances will those associated in any way with illegal organisations be allowed to collect a penny.</P>
      <P>The Act states that a collection means &ldquo;a collection of money&rdquo;.  I should like to know what is the difference between a collection of money and begging money?  You can beg money but you cannot collect money. If I were charged with collecting money, what is to stop me saying to the court &ldquo;I was begging money?&rdquo; The Act says I can beg money.  There is probably a difference, but to the simple-minded soul there is no difference. I am not simple, but I can pretend to be.  Anyway, I should like to know the difference.</P>
      <P>As regards the age limit of 14, I would ask the Minister to go further and reduce the age to 13.  As Deputies know, 14 years is the age for leaving school.  Schoolboys are the best collectors for charitable purposes.  In fact, adults do not like collecting money. As a rule, whenever I get a box, I give it to my young fellow to do the collecting for me.  He does the work and I get the praise.</P>
      <P>Most people get their young lads and daughters to do the collecting. When boys and girls reach the age of 14, they may become employed or maybe they start their social activities. Teenagers these days want to go to dances and meet company.  Accordingly, it is the boys and girls of between 13 and 14 years of age who are the best type to carry out these collection tasks.  It would give a chance to the charitable bodies.  The Minister must be aware that from time to time even school managers avail of the services of their pupils to carry out collections.  Under this Bill, they will not be able to do so.  I agree that the Bill should limit the age to 13 at the youngest, so I would urge on the Minister to subtract another year because when children reach the age of 14, they have not got time to do this work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> With regard to the provision dealing with persons who delegate their powers to others, the position arises that those others may also delegate their powers in turn.  I might be asked, as a member of the Corporation to collect for a charitable body.  I say I will but I give the box to my young fellow.  What will happen if a Guard asks for his permit?  The boy would not have a permit but I would.  Very often, people are asked to collect money but they have no time or, perhaps, they are bad collectors and they delegate the task to somebody else.</P>
    <P>Again, the age group enters in the matter of carol singing at Christmas for charitable purposes.  Among those singing groups one will find a number of young children.  They may not be doing the actual collecting but they are participating in an illegal act.  If they are singing and the older people of the group are doing the collecting, are the younger people not part of the conspiracy in the same way as accessories in serious crime?</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to street begging and to say that the public should be protected against beggars.  As soon as one of them finishes annoying a cinema queue, another begins.  Some of them are not very polite.  Some of them may be &ldquo;half canned&rdquo; and force the money out of one's pocket by making themselves a nuisance.  What protection have the public against these beggars, these drunks who make life a misery for those in a cinema queue?  Finally, I would emphasise the necessity not to interfere with people who are working for charitable causes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>It has now been explained in greater detail.  To my view, there is a very little to be said for any restriction on the increase in charitable giving.  At the same time, I do feel that people should be encouraged to give to charitable purposes for the sake of the objects concerned and not out of pity for the poor little collector who is trying to do his or her best.  I think that very often very charitable bodies do exploit young boys and girls so that money can be brought into their funds simply out of charity to the collector rather than charity to the actual object for which the whole operation is being organised.</P>
      <P>I personally would prefer to see greater restriction as far as age is concerned because I feel it would be all to the good.  Furthermore, I feel that the Chief Superintendents in this operation might well be given a rather longer time than that specified in the Bill.  Deputy Sherwin did refer to certain objects which might have some connection, however remote, with an illegal organisation and if a body such as that to which he referred were to make an application to a Chief Superintendent, I should imagine it would take very much longer than 14 days for the Chief Superintendent to sort out in his own mind as to whether he would be justified in giving a permit in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a collection has been taken up, accounts may be called for, but at <Col N="516" /> that stage, if the collection has been improperly authorised, it might very well be too late to undo any damage that had been done.  I would suggest, therefore, that this is another matter worthy of further consideration on Committee Stage, so that we might have a slight revision of the period set out for the examination of an application by any Chief Superintendent.  I would say a month should be the minimum&mdash;a month's notice given to a Chief Superintendent&mdash;and I cannot believe this would be any embarrassment to any charitable organisation trying to run a collection.  Any such body should be able to know a month in advance whether they intended to hold a collection and it would then be up to them to notify the authorities well in advance.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see provision is made for some supervision of the marking of collection boxes.  Very often, members of the public are approached by people with boxes, with or without flags in them, and they are quite unaware of the aims and objects of the collection.  At times, the collection boxes used at the moment are given very little attention by the organisers and I am afraid that at times information is deliberately withheld in certain cases because the organisers feel too much information might persuade people to refuse to contribute.  Every step should be taken before the public are asked to contribute to ensure that they are left in no doubt whatever as to the objects for which their charity is being solicited.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin has no reason for anxiety as to any confusion between collecting and begging.  Section 1 refers definitely to begging or receiving alms.  So long as a person is begging for some charitable object, he is all right, if he has complied with all the other requirements.  Begging for alms is quite clearly begging for oneself; such begging is not normally done with a collection box.  I agree with Deputy Sherwin that begging is quite a problem, particularly in the city, though it is also prevalent in rural areas and small towns.  My recollection of the law is that begging is controlled to a certain extent at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> This Bill is very necessary.  It should receive the full support of the House. If we can restrict to some extent the number of collections, we shall be doing a good job.  I cannot say that I have ever seen a collection being taken up which I would regard as improper. There are some collections one can avoid; there are others one cannot.  On the whole, greater control is necessary. I should hope that there will not be too much reluctance on the part of the Minister to extend the scope of the Bill in order to impose some restriction on house to house collections.  These can be quite a menace, especially when they are carried out at night.  Parents may be absent from home and the eldest child left in charge.  A collector at the door can be a source of great embarrassment, particularly if he is pushing, and the child may feel obliged to find some money somewhere in the house, in order to get the door shut again.  I hope the Minister will keep that in mind if there is to be restriction on house to house collection.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is passed in the form in which it is drafted, or even substantially in that form, a good day's work will have been done.  I am particularly glad that appeal from a refusal by a Chief Superintendent will lie to the district court.  In some legislation we have had, appeal lies to the Minister. I think it is better the Minister should have no further responsibility and that an aggrieved person should, rather, have access to the district court.  I welcome that provision.  There is very little danger that a Chief Superintendent will act unjustly, but, human nature being what it is, even a Chief Superintendent may err.  If there is a judicial hearing as a result of refusal, there will be no difficulty in reaching a fair conclusion.  All the evidence will be adduced to enable the district justice to make a fair decision.</P>
    <P>There is always the danger of the public being defrauded.  There are confidence tricksters of different kinds. I welcome the proposal that there should be a very definite restriction on the financial gain to individual collectors. I resent the advertisement to which reference was made where a very substantial proportion of the <Col N="518" /> takings can be regarded as the prerequisite of the collector.  That reduces charity to a very mercenary level.  I should prefer that collectors would be personally interested in the charity, anxious to support it by giving up their time to collecting.  Collecting is a very objectionable task indeed.  We are very often at the receiving end of a collecting box.  It is no fun to anyone to stand around in the streets trying to collect money.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be some amendment with regard to the age of those who collect.  It should be raised. Particularly attention should be paid to a clear statement on the box indicating precisely the nature of the charity for which support is sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to think that this Bill would interfere with or curb the number of certain well-known charitable collections.  I know the Minister has introduced it for the best reasons, but I think that, in curbing collections, we might go so far west as to end up east.  Prudence should guide the implementation of this measure.  Many of our well-known charitable organisations have done a great deal of good work for numbers of our less fortunate brethren down the years.  Deputy Booth mentioned collectors getting money for collecting.  I have no objection to that when a man is engaged full time in collecting.  Provided everything is above board, it must be remembered he has to live the same as Pat Murphy down the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always the charitable instinct of our Irish people when misfortune strikes a neighbour.  I have had experience of that in County Dublin as well as in other counties. When a neighbour is in difficulty, a few old friends will go out quietly and make a collection from house to house.  It may be to bury an old friend; it may be to buy a horse or a cow; it may be some other charitable purpose.  I should be very slow to interfere with that instinct in our people.  They never abuse these privileges.  I admit there are certain collectors who will not ask for a permit.  Collections have been made in Ireland for certain causes of which <Col N="519" /> possibly the people would not approve but I should like the Minister to have another look at the Bill to ensure that the organisations that have been functioning well over the years and have done so much for our people will not be curbed in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBarron" hpid="Mr. Barron Mr. Barron">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barron</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether it will be necessary for people who collect for the St. Vincent de Paul Society outside certain churches on a Sunday to seek a permit.  This is a charitable purpose and the collectors stand beside the collection box and do not ask any person to contribute.  I should like the Minister to give some undertaking as far as those people are concerned.</P>
      <P>There are other people who make collections and those collections may be for the families of people.  The Minister may not agree with the tactics adopted by those people.  That is another matter but the families of those people need to be looked after. The Government and the Minister may have reason to believe otherwise, but I think that collections for that purpose are of a charitable nature. There are people who will not ask for permits.  That is a matter for their organisations.  What I am interested in is that the families, particularly the children and the wives, of these people should receive consideration.  I hope the Minister will not allow anything to interfere with such charitable work and that he will give every consideration to these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I want to thank Deputies generally for the manner in which they have received the Bill and for the number of constructive comments which have been made.  Deputy O'Higgins is quite right when he points out that this is essentially a Committee Bill and that a most useful and constructive discussion on the Bill can be had on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill attempts to solve a problem.  We will all agree and recognise that in our society the custom whereby organisations of one sort or another are permitted to go to the <Col N="520" /> public and seek funds or subscriptions for their objects is a desirable one.  We all know the type of organisation, charitable, social, sporting, which is perfectly entitled to go to the general public and seek subscriptions for its purposes.  On the other hand, we as the Oireachtas have a duty to the general public.  We have a duty to ensure that the general public are not excessively importuned, are not annoyed or subjected to any excessive degree to a nuisance in this regard. This Bill sets out to reconcile these two conflicting factors and to solve that problem.  It is an attempt to keep a reasonable balance in that situation.</P>
    <P>We approached this matter by recognising at the outset the need for public collections.  Having regard to what I have said about the interests of the general public, we went further and decided that these collections should be controlled.  I think the provisions in the Bill are reasonable and fair.  In that regard, we attempt to control collections in two main ways: first of all, we attempt to control them in relation to the objects for which the collections are made; and, secondly, in relation to the manner of the collections.</P>
    <P>I think the House generally has indicated that they regard the Bill as a reasonable solution to these problems, subject to one or two individual suggestions. I also think that most of the points mentioned can be gone fully into on Committee Stage.  This is a Bill which has no political implications.  It is one in respect of which we can all combine our experience and pool our knowledge and try to come up in the end with the best possible measure.  I think that the discussion with regard to the minimum age of collectors is a useful one and a valuable indicator as to the manner in which we can discuss the Bill generally.  We have a clear conflict as to what exactly the minimum age should be.</P>
    <P>I should like to see us pool our experience and knowledge on that point and on other points in the Bill.  One can see arguments on both sides. Deputy Paddy Burke has made an eloquent plea for the old established charity.  I will come back to that in a <Col N="521" /> moment but at this stage I would say from my own personal experience that a lot of these very good, very old and very fine charities rely to a large extent on young people to do their collecting for them.  A number of Deputies will have the same experience that I have every year in seeing the annual collection of the St. Vincent de Paul Society taken up by the schoolboys of the city.  It would be very wrong to deprive these organisations of the services of the eager and willing young people.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must have regard to the point made by Deputy Dunne when he pointed out that he does not want to see young people going into public houses and other places collecting and being subjected to the sort of treatment which Deputy Dunne indicated.  We have a problem there.  When we come to the Committee Stage, I shall be very much guided by the House as to what age we should eventually settle upon.</P>
    <P>We arrived at the age of 14 years after consultation with various interests concerned and particularly with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána who was satisfied that it was a reasonable minimum age.  I think myself that it is the minimum age to which we could adhere but, again, I should like to have the considered view of Deputies on that matter.  I hope to approach the Bill entirely in that spirit and I am sure the House will bear with me in that and give me its full assistance and co-operation.</P>
    <P>Whereas most of the points raised here are more relevant to the Committee Stage, I might deal with some of them now so that we may clear up a few misconceptions and have possibly a more real discussion on Committee Stage.  Deputy Barron mentioned the question of the St. Vincent de Paul collectors who collect on Sundays outside churches.  I do not think we need worry about that particular matter. My experience is that the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other societies of that nature have their collections taken up inside the church grounds and Section 1 of the Bill definitely excludes churches or buildings used for public worship or the grounds of churches and such buildings from the operation of <Col N="522" /> the Bill.  The provisions of the Bill will not apply at all to churches or church grounds.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barron and Sherwin expressed some concern as to the fate of collections which purport to be for the use of persons committed to prison for certain offences concerned with unlawful organisations and illegal activities.  I think the Bill is quite adequate to reassure the Deputies on that particular matter.  If they study the section which sets out the reasons which would enable a Chief Superintendent not to grant a collection permit they will see that their fears in that regard are groundless.  I refer in the main to Section 9 which states that a Chief Superintendent &ldquo;shall not grant a collection permit for any collection in respect of which he is of opinion that ...&rdquo;  The section then proceeds to set out six distinct grounds on which a Chief Superintendent can refuse to grant a permit.  I shall go into this much more fully on Committee Stage but I want to mention this aspect of it here.  A Chief Superintendent shall not refuse to grant a permit unless he is of opinion that it is for one of these particular purposes.  The type of collection to which Deputies Sherwin and Barron referred does not come within the ambit of any of these six grounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about subsection (b) which states that he has power to refuse the permit for the benefit of an organisation membership of which is unlawful?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to enter into a Committee Stage discussion but I am quite certain that that does not cover the type of collection to which Deputies Barron and Sherwin have referred.  Deputy Burke was concerned, and rightly so, with the prospect that we might interfere with the activities and collections of some of the fine old charities to which he referred which have, down the years, been doing such magnificent work, work which we hope they will continue to do in the future.  Deputy Burke was rightly concerned to know whether the collections organised traditionally on certain days by these <Col N="523" /> organisations would be interfered with by the Bill.  I am very glad to be able to give him an assurance that there will be no such interference.</P>
      <P>Section 6 of the Bill provides that where there is a clash of applications for any particular day, the organisation which traditionally took up a collection on that day and, indeed, which took up a collection on the corresponding day in the previous year, will get priority.  That should go a long way to safeguard the traditional collections.  Even then, should something go wrong, there is a provision whereby the Chief Superintendent can grant authority for two different collections in the same area on the one day, if he thinks it is desirable.  I feel sure that in regard to the organisations to which Deputy Burke referred the Bill will work quite satisfactorily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne touched on an interesting aspect of this Bill, one on which Deputies would be legitimately entitled to have different opinions. Deputy Dunne does not like the idea of collections in public houses.  Let me say, first of all, that from the point of view of the Bill technically, public houses are public places and, therefore, collections in public houses are subject to the control of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If he studies the definition section, Deputy O'Higgins will agree that they are brought within the definition of &ldquo;public places&rdquo;.  However, apart from the technical provision at the moment, the decision the House would have to make in this regard is whether or not it is desirable that we should permit collections for charitable and other purposes in public houses.  I feel that, on balance, we should.  The drinking man is proverbially generous. Most charitable organisations would confirm that there is no more fruitful field to plough than public houses.  Of course, one must immediately have regard to the point made by Deputy Dunne that he does not want young <Col N="524" /> people going into public houses and being given scandal or coming to harm in some other way.  On balance, it would be undesirable to cut off from charitable organisations this fruitful source of income.</P>
      <P>I wonder if Deputy Dunne is really taking a broad view of the situation when he objects to the man in the public house being interrupted in his discussion?  I feel that the consensus of opinion would be that he should be entitled to be got at when he is in the frame of mind which will make him generous.</P>

      <P>One of the things to which we must have regard is the collection that political Parties take up in relation to general election campaigns. The 14 day period might give rise to some difficulty there.  It is principally in that regard that the provision was inserted in the Bill to enable the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to reduce that period, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth touched on a matter which is of considerable importance in connection with the Bill, namely, house to house collections.  I indicated in my opening remarks that we do not <Col N="525" /> propose to make the order contemplated by the Bill or to make any order contemplated by the Bill immediately.  I would certainly be open to persuasion in that regard in relation to a particular area, if there were any considerable volume of opinion in the House to that effect. There is a great deal in what Deputy Booth says with regard to a house to house collection in an urban area at night time.  Again, in this regard, I should be very glad to get the cumulative view of the House, to pool our experiences and see whether or not this problem is more serious than I believe it to be.  I believe at the moment that it is a nuisance but that it is not sufficient nuisance to justify our making these orders immediately. However, I shall be glad to hear more views from Deputies in that regard.</P>
    <P>I have a disagreement with Deputy O'Higgins about Section 24.  I think Section 24 is an excellent section and a very necessary section in the Bill. There is a similar type of provision in the existing regulations&mdash;No. 15&mdash; but it is desirable to have this provision and I do not think that the section which is framed fairly elastically will impose any undue hardship on organisations.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins quite rightly pointed out that the Garda Chief Superintendent should satisfy himself before the issue of the permit as to the <i>bona fides</i> of the applicant.  I fully agree. Nevertheless, it is very easy to visualise a situation where a reputable, or seemingly reputable, body of persons or an organisation would apply for a permit and whose <i>bona fides</i> were beyond question and the collection would be taken up and subsequently the Garda had reason to believe that something went wrong, through some action on the part of an individual member of the organisation, or otherwise.  It is possible to conceive of a deterioration, if you like, in the <i>bona fides</i> of an organisation between the time of collection and the time when the proceeds were distributed.  In the event of a case of that kind coming to the notice of the Garda, it is very desirable that they should have the authority set out in Section 24 to call for accounts <Col N="526" /> and to satisfy themselves that the proceeds were distributed as they should have been.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin asked me about begging.  Of course, this Bill does not deal with begging.  That is logical. Apart from the fact that the Bill sets out to deal with a particular problem and is confined to that problem and various aspects of it, the machinery of the Bill is designed to issue licences to enable people to collect.  We could not possibly envisage a situation where we would issue licences to enable people to beg.  For that reason, the machinery envisaged in the Bill is completely inappropriate to any problem which begging creates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Begging is something which we want to prevent.  Here, we want to legitimise collections for lawful purposes.  Deputy Sherwin also asked about an authorised collector being enabled further to delegate his authorisation to another person.  It is not envisaged that that should happen. Under the Bill, there will be persons to whom permits are issued.  They will authorise collectors and only those collectors who are authorised will be entitled to collect.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins raised a couple of points of principle with regard to the onus of proof.  I feel sure he will return to the attack on Committee Stage and I shall not attempt to go into the merits of the question now.  I shall confine myself to saying that the provisions are not new to the law.  Similar provisions exist in statutes.  One of the provisions to which he refers can trace its ancestry to the Road Transport Act, 1933.  We are doing no more in the Bill than we think is necessary for its practical working.  When we come to examine the provisions on Committee Stage I think we shall find that they do not really threaten the whole basis of our system of justice, as Deputy O'Higgins would seem to suggest.</P>
      <P>We shall have an opportunity on Committee Stage of going fully into all the points raised in the debate and, indeed, others which have not been made as yet.  I trust we shall reach substantial agreement as to the best type of Bill.</P>
      <P>I think the Bill is a reasonable attempt at a solution to a rather difficult problem.  We do not want to go too far one way or too far the other way.  We want to keep a balance between the interests of the general public, as such, and the deserving and well-intentioned efforts of a number of valuable organisations in our community. I commend the Bill to the House on that basis.</P>

    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit <Col N="528" /> the creation of ground rents and to provide for the extinction of existing ground rents.&mdash;(Deputy S. Dunne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I put this Bill down for discussion some time ago and its First Reading was opposed by the Government.  By virtue of that fact, I was denied the facility available to those promoting Bills after the First Stage has been passed, namely, the facility of circulation.  Therefore, the members of the House will not know until now what the Bill contains and, with the permission of the Chair, I propose to read the terms of the Bill. I assume the rules of order permit me to do so.  The Bill reads as follows:</P>
      <P Just="Center">BILL</P>
      <P Just="Center">
        <i>entitled</i>
      </P>
      <P>AN ACT TO PROHIBIT THE CREATION OF GROUND RENTS AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE EXTINCTION OF EXISTING GROUND RENTS.</P>
      <P>BE IT ENACTED BY THE OIREACHTAS AS FOLLOWS:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  As and from the date of the passing of this Act it shall not be lawful for any person to create a new ground rent.</P>
      <P>2. (1)  As and from the date of the passing of this Act any tenant may purchase all rights of his ground rent from his ground landlord by payment of a determined sum, and it shall not be lawful for the ground landlord to refuse to accept such payment.</P>
      <P>(2)  A ground rent purchased under <i>subsection (1)</i> shall be deemed to have been extinguished.</P>
      <P>3.  The determined sum referred to in <i>section 2</i> shall be a sum not greater than fifteen times the amount of the annual ground rent which the tenant is liable for at the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.  Any amount paid by the tenant in respect of any period of <Col N="529" /> tenancy prior to the passing of this Act shall be taken into account in calculating the sum referred to in <i>section 2.</i></P>
    <P>5.  This Act may be cited as the Ground Rents (Prohibition and Extinction) Act, 1961.</P>
    <P>The terms of the Bill are, I suppose, in need of some explanation.  I understand that, under the rules of procedure, I am entitled to make a statement explaining just what they mean.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey) Charles J. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be as brief as possible.  They mean simply that as and from the passage of this Bill the iniquity called ground rent, which is rooted in the conquest of this country, shall finish.  It means also that persons who have been in occupation of houses and paying ground rents for a number of years will have taken into account the amount of money they have paid by this annual extortion, in many cases by absentee landlords living in luxury in Mayfair, in the West End of London and in other cases by native landlords also living in luxury, and that in no case shall the purchase price of the ground rent exceed the equivalent of 15 times the annual amount paid.</P>
      <P>This, I should add, is possibly made more easy to understand when one thinks in terms of the 11,000 new ground rents that have been created in the suburbs of Dublin, in Churchtown, Dundrum, Walkinstown, Santry and other places well known to members of this House.  People who have availed of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts and endeavoured to build their own homes have been compelled by the existence of this iniquity to pay sums varying from £25 to £30&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. S. Dunne Mr. S. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply trying to let the House know what the Bill aims to do and the grievance it purports to remedy.  It may be said that the Government have set up a Commission to deal with this matter and that the Bill is, therefore, unnecessary. It is something of a coincidence that the Commission was not announced until almost the eve of the proposed discussion on my original motion about ground rents.  It is a well-known fact that the device of the Commission is a very powerful retro-rocket on any piece of progressive legislation.</P>
      <P>We have had Commissions in the past&mdash;I just want to make this point before the Minister makes his statement in reply&mdash;which have had time limits defined for their deliberations. I think the Intoxicating Liquor Commission got six months to make up their mind and some other Commissions had their terms of reference defined to be worked out over periods of 12 to 18 months, but in the case of the Commission set up to deal with ground rents I heard no mention whatever of any time limit to their deliberations. I should be satisfied if the Minister said that this Commission had been told it must deliver its report within a certain period of time, 18 months or two years, and that the Government would then act on the principle that ground rents should be finally ended and thereby also ended the inquity which is rooted in and stems from the historic conquest of the country.  But the Minister has not said that and, until he does, I feel compelled to press this Bill upon the attention of the House in an effort to get something done about this outstanding source of scandal which has gone on without hindrance and without being remedied or interfered with by anybody for the past 50 or 60 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is remarkable that, despite the great and valiant efforts that were made by the men who freed this country from the power of the landlords in rural areas, the very essential rights and needs of the people in the cities and towns seem to be overlooked. As a result, we still have this infliction on the hardworking and deserving people who live in houses <Col N="531" /> which they are trying to purchase themselves.</P>
    <P>That simply is the purpose of this Bill&mdash;to speed up, to get some action, instead of just leaving the matter to be discussed in an academic manner for the next five or six years in some obscure council room somewhere, as has happened to other Commissions and the report finally produced to be buried in some dusty library and nothing being done about it.  This Bill is designed to get results.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House that in normal circumstances there would be no question of my opposing the Deputy's motion for leave to introduce this measure and the House would have an opportunity of discussing it on Second Reading.  Unfortunately, any other action on my part at this stage would be incompatible with the establishment last December of a Commission charged with the task of inquiring into the very matters with which the measure is concerned and of indicating the legislative provision that should be made to deal with them.</P>
      <P>I can tell the House that the Commission has held several meetings and has, I understand, made arrangements for taking evidence, as Deputies who are members of local authorities may be aware.  In these circumstances, it would be invidious for me or any member of the Government, to commit the Government to any definite expression of opinion on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> Whether we like it or not, the fact must be faced that the ground rent problem is a particularly difficult and complex one, with wide social and economical implications and, with the best will in the world it cannot be solved in a single Bill in the way suggested by the Deputy.  Even if approval in principle were to be given, even if all of us here agreed in principle that we should have a scheme which would be fair to all the interests concerned and decided to proceed with a purchase scheme; even if we got that definite decision in principle a tremendous amount of work on the technical obstacles and problems of such schemes would have to be put in and the actual preparation of the requisite legislation could not be undertaken without prolonged study of the problems involved.  For instance, Deputy Dunne's Bill as he has read it to the House, takes no account of the numerous cases where there are several intermediate interests between the leaseholder who wishes to purchase his ground rent and the owner of the fee-simple.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The sensible thing is to wait for the report of the Commission. Deputy O'Higgins is not as innocent as all that.  He knows as well as I do that this problem cannot be dealt with in a Bill such as that read out in two seconds by Deputy Dunne.  That is the only point I am making.  The point I am making is that apart altogether from a decision <Col N="534" /> in principle&mdash;and goodness knows that is a difficult enough decision to take&mdash;the technical problems are so complex that they would require investigation by a skilled body of persons.  I think the Commission can give us the necessary machinery.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dunne, in reading out his Bill to us, indicated that it would be his intention that no future ground rents would be created.  I do not think anyone needs great powers of assimilation to recall that that was a clause in the Bill as read out by Deputy Dunne.  My simple reply to that proposition by Deputy Dunne is that that may or may not be a principle to which every member of the House would adhere.  The Government would not like to adhere to it until a full examination is carried out as to whether or not such a provision would result in housing for our young people who were getting married being put out of their reach.  That is a very reasonable view for me to take.</P>
      <P>I feel I am entitled to ask Deputy Dunne, and the House generally, to wait until they have received the report of this body of experts which was set up to deal with the problem. With regard to the Commission, I have already indicated that it has been set up, has already held a number of meetings and is in process of taking evidence.  Deputy Dunne asked me for an assurance that it would not take five, six or seven years to report. This is a committee of voluntary people.  They are doing this work voluntarily and this House cannot put a pistol to their heads, as suggested by Deputy Dunne.</P>
      <P>I want to point out one or two things with regard to the Commission. First of all, it is a highly skilled commission and membership of it is really excellent.  It is a commission of experts and, furthermore, Deputy Dunne can rest assured from the choice we have made of Chairman of the Commission, there will be no avoidable delay in its report.</P>

      <P>In his explanatory statement introducing the Bill, Deputy Dunne asked me for an assurance that the Commission set up by me would report.  I am endeavouring, to the best of my ability, to assure Deputy Dunne that the composition of the Commission is such, and the reputations of its members are such, that he can be sure it will report at the earliest possible moment, and that from what we know of the calibre of the Chairman, there will be no avoidable delay in producing a report, and producing a very good report.  I am paying Deputy Dunne the tribute of thinking that he is being sincere in his approach to this matter.  I hoped he would do the same for me.  He is doing himself less than justice, if he is sincere in his approach to the matter, by attempting to suggest we could deal with the problem in a five-section Bill such as he has put before us this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a simple Bill but, nevertheless, it is of vital importance to a large number of people throughout the country.  We are all aware that at present and for many years past the people have had certain advantages by way of grants and loans in connection with the building of houses.  Over the years these grants were increased by the various Governments.  It is known to all that a person building a house can avail of a State grant and a supplementary local authority grant. Further, should he find himself financially unable to meet the balance required for the building of the house, he can avail of the Small Dwellings Acts and secure from a local authority a loan for this purpose.  In <Col N="541" /> recent years such facilities have been extended to include people buying houses and also people carrying out reconstruction work on houses.</P>
    <P>The one section who are faced with the difficulty of meeting much more than they are ever likely to be able to provide by way of finances are those living in local authority cottages or houses which come under a vesting order made by the local authority in favour of the tenant.  A tenant of a vested house&mdash;vested in him as tenant by the local authority&mdash;may in the case of reconstruction or addition avail of a Government grant and may be able to avail later of supplementary grants.  That is undoubtedly a help to him, but the main problem in his case is meeting the balance between the grants and the total cost of reconstruction or addition.  From my knowledge the tenant of a vested local authority house in a rural area is never in a position to provide from his own resources the balance between the cost of the work he carries out and the grants received from the Department and the local authority.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the question of the cost of such reconstruction, we also know there is a big discrepancy between the cost estimated by the Department and the actual cost to be met by the tenant purchaser.  That in itself extends the gap because the Government grant and the local authority grant are based on the cost as estimated by the Department.  It all goes to show the awkard position the tenant is faced with in his efforts to bridge from some source the financial gap to which I have referred. Very often he finds it beyond his means.</P>
    <P>This does not worry the man living in a house not the property of the local authority.  Our concern should be, first of all, for tenants of vested cottages and houses in rural areas. We ask that the same provisions be extended to those tenants as are being given to people in other dwellings.  I feel sure the Minister and the House will agree there is nothing revolutionary in asking for this.  It is most difficult for a tenant to find himself faced with a bill for repairs to the cottage which <Col N="542" /> should have been properly executed by the local authority at the time of vesting.  In a short number of years he finds himself in the serious position of having to face further bills for necessary repair work.</P>
    <P>It is no use for such a man to appeal to the local authority or to a bank or to a building society to help him to fill the gap between the cost of such repairs and the grants available to him because under the regulations, and under the law itself, the fact that the house is a local authority house vested in the tenant automatically carries with it a mortgage, and the local authority, even though anxious to help the tenant, finds itself stopped, prevented by law and unable to help with a loan.  The bank manager and the manager of a housing society find themselves in a similar position.  It is not a case of their refusing the tenant's application on its merits: it is not a question of the tenant's honesty in repaying the loan but simply because the law points out that while the cottage is in the process of being vested it carries a mortgage.</P>
    <P>That is one point we are anxious to get over.  That is why we say such a tenant should at least be given the same favourable conditions as apply to other occupiers of houses.  Let us not forget that while a house may be vested in a tenant, so long as he is paying annuities and until he has paid the last penny, the local authority have a claim on that house.  It would, therefore, be a sensible principle for the local authority to be allowed to help him by way of loan even though the local authority has a claim on the house.</P>
    <P>There is another point in the matter of vested cottages which applies to rural and urban areas.  A tenant of such a cottage or house may want to leave the district.  There may be in the area a man with a young family living in very bad housing conditions and with very little hope of getting a new local authority house even though he qualifies for it under the Housing Acts.  Naturally, such a man, seeing a cottage vacant nearby, feels he has a right to get it; but he, again, is caught.  He finds, whether he <Col N="543" /> approaches the county manager, the local authority, the secretary, his local Deputy, or local county councillor, that the answer is still the same. Because the House is vested he cannot get a loan for the purchase of the interest of the outgoing tenant.</P>
    <P>It is only fair and proper to say that, if we were really interested in such a person and his housing needs, we would support this Bill.  If we are interested in local authorities helping so far as possible to ensure that their property is improved by the tenant purchaser then we must appreciate that this Bill goes a long way towards helping in that direction.  Perhaps the Minister, or other members of this House, may draw attention to the fact that there is provision in one section of this Bill to enable local authorities to provide these loans out of local rates.  Some may hold that this would be an imposition on local rating authorities.  I believe our answer should be sufficient to dispel any worry any Deputy may have on that score.</P>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House who come from the same county as I do know, not just recently but for years back, that the local authority in providing assistance under the S.D.A. loans, in providing a large amount of money over the years, have never found themselves in the position of not getting back the capital plus the interest. I cannot speak for other counties but I am sure the same position obtains; we know that the Cork local authority in providing these loans have never been at a loss either in regard to capital or interest because, while the local authority must pay a certain interest rate raising the money themselves or providing it out of the rates, the experience has been&mdash;I am sure it will continue&mdash; that the local authority charges roughly ½ per cent.  on the loans provided to protect the council in its administrative work and in the clerical and other work associated with the provision and collection of these loans.  From every angle, therefore, this is a safe bet for the local authority and, perhaps, with the help of God, it will be a good bet for the vested <Col N="544" /> tenant and the prospective tenant purchaser.</P>
    <P>Despite the &ldquo;yea&rdquo; or &ldquo;nay&rdquo; of the provisions of the Housing Acts in force at the moment, irrespective of whether or not they are broad enough or elastic enough in their scope in the view of local authorities, in some areas people are purchasing the interest in these cottages.  I do not propose to discuss whether that is wrong or whether it is right.  We all have our own views.  The matter is outside the scope of this Bill.  But people are buying the interest of outgoing tenants and, in some cases, paying a great deal of money.  They are people who could never get a cottage or a house if they were depending on the report of the local authority County M.O.H. and the other officials concerned.  Under the terms of the Housing Acts a person working for hire in rural areas can get accommodation.  I have seen some extraordinary cases.  I have known of a case of a man living in a fashionable quarter in a city and, because his business may take him around the country as a traveller, or in some other capacity, he can be and is being considered as a person working for hire in the rural areas.  There is a touch of irony about it.  It is ironic to see people with bank balances able to buy the interest in a vested cottage; it is ironic that they should qualify while an unfortunate farm worker, road worker, or casual worker living near the cottage, with a young family, in bad housing conditions, will never be in a position to ask the vested tenant: &ldquo;Are you selling?  What are you asking?  I am prepared to buy.  I am prepared to make a bargain.&rdquo;  He cannot say that because there is no way whereby he can get a loan as other people can get loans.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House on this.  As I said at the outset it is a simple Bill.  It is a commonsense Bill.  All we ask is that these people, the people who wish to carry out improvements, be given the opportunity of getting a loan.  All we ask is that the unfortunate person so anxious to buy the interest in a vested cottage for sale, and who has not got the <Col N="545" /> wherewithal financially to do so, should be given the opportunity and the help to enable him to stay in his own area and secure for himself that little comfort that should be given to him and which has been given by successive Governments to other sections of the community under the Housing Acts.</P>
    <P>Briefly, that is the idea behind this Bill and, in view of its importance, I would ask the House to give it full and sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>This Bill consists in the main of two provisions.  They are contained in Section 3.  The first is the proposal that a grant should be made available for the reconstruction or extension of local authority houses; and the second is that loans should be made available to approved applicants to enable them to purchase the tenant interest in a local authority house.  We are in complete agreement with the first principle; it is one that we enshrined in our programme before the last election.  We believe there is need for this type of grant to people living in local authority houses to enable them to carry out reconstruction or improvements.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second principle, the making of loans to enable a person to acquire a tenant purchaser's interest in a local authority house, we are more reserved.  The reason why we are more reserved is because we think that this proposal might very well raise the purchase price of such a house.  If it became known that loans were available that would, perhaps, enhance abnormally the value of the house and make it even more difficult of acquisition by the people for whom it is desired to make provision in this Bill. Subsection (2) of Section 3 may have a bearing on this restriction but we reserve our decision on that portion of the Bill.  This Bill proposes to do something we feel should be done and we have committed ourselves in this respect.  I welcome the measure on behalf of this Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this very necessary measure proposed by Deputy Desmond.  The Minister is <Col N="546" /> constantly making appeals to local authorities on the desirability of tenants purchasing their houses.  We have ideal schemes for the purchase of local authority houses and it is desirable that as many people as possible should purchase these houses.  We believe in the diffusion of private property of this kind.</P>
      <P>As far as I know, one of the real reasons why people are reluctant to purchase urban or corporation houses is the fear in regard to maintenance in future years.  Members will realise the high cost of repair and improvement in these times.  It is nice to know there are State grants and local authority grants available for this purpose. We desire that loans be made available to help people to purchase such property.  We think it is very wrong as matters stand that local authority loans for repair and improvement of houses are available under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to anyone who is in the process of buying his house, except the householder who is buying his house from a local authority.  This is an anomaly that needs to be rectified.</P>
      <P>In order to impress on people the necessity of purchasing their houses, corporations and local authorities have devised certain means which I regard as pressure of an unfair kind.  One instance is that priority is given for repairs to those who vest their cottages. That obtains in my county and I think obtains in many others as well.  There is a certain amount of coercion there inasmuch as if you do not opt for vesting, your cottage will go by default and virtually fall down around you.</P>
      <P>People are being forced into vesting today unintentionally.  When this vesting is carried out and repairs done, in a short time, further repairs are needed and these people are unable to find the initial money to carry out this work.  A cottier or a smallholder of this kind cannot go to a bank as he is not regarded as a good risk.  We feel there is only one resort for him, to call on the local authority to make such loans available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By reason of the indiscriminate vesting of cottages and the inability of people to maintain these cottages in <Col N="547" /> after years, there are scores of cottages locked up all over the country at a time when other people are in dire need of them.  Many of these cottages are coming on the property market and falling into the wrong hands.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out, big farmers' sons and professional people are among the categories gaining possession of council cottages to which they are not entitled by law.  These cottages were built primarily for the relief of the working classes and some of the categories we know to be living in council cottages would not be approved by the local authority nowadays.  These are some of the problems we seek to rectify in this Bill and we ask the House to give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Many more council and corporation houses would be purchased if people were given a loan they could avail of to purchase a house, in the first instance, and to repair it in after years.  Fear in regard to maintenance is one of the primary reasons why people are not purchasing such houses.  The Minister has been generous by way of State grants and local authority grants for the repair and maintenance of houses.  Without these grants, many of the streets in our cities and towns would be virtually derelict sites.  This is money very well spent.  It has been availed of wisely by our people and has brought a good appearance to hundreds of homes throughout our land and made for the comfort and happiness of the people therein.  We now ask the Minister to make it possible for the purchaser of a local authority house to have these facilities so that the benefits he has conferred on the private landlord will be conferred on the private tenant as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what the attitude of the Minister will be to this Bill.  As regards the question of loans, I believe the tenants of vested cottages should have the same rights and facilities in applying for the loans as other sections of the community, but I cannot see that should ever arise.  In County Limerick, if we vest cottages in our tenants, we ensure they are in good <Col N="548" /> repair.  There may be some instances where what we describe as a vested repair has not met the requirements of the tenants concerned.  They may be very exacting tenants&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but we have always given this great protection that they have the right to appeal to the Minister for Local Government.  If a tenant is vested and the repairs are not up to the standard demanded, the tenant may make an appeal within a month.</P>
      <P>Where we vest a cottage in a tenant in County Limerick against the wishes of that tenant, we notify him he has the right of appeal within a month to the Minister for Local Government who will send down one of his housing inspectors.  In all cases that have arisen, the appeal was sustained and the housing inspector from the Department was satisfied that extra repairs should be carried out and in all cases they were carried out.  That does away with the validity and the force of the point made by the proposer of the Bill as regards the necessity for loans.  Where repairs are carried out to a labourer's cottage, they should cover a period of at least ten years, that is, if they are done properly.  That safeguard is there to ensure they are done properly and are up to the standard of first-class workmanship.</P>
      <P>Another point made by Deputy Desmond is that if a vested cottage comes on the market and there is living in the area a married man who comes within the definition of an agricultural worker in a rural area, he has not the wherewithal to purchase the cottage.  In Limerick, we had a test case which was sent to the High Court and it was decided that we had the power to buy back the cottages.  We have already bought back such cottages in County Limerick that were offered for sale by the vested tenants.  We have met the requirements of the cases Deputy Desmond has outlined.  We, in Limerick, decided that we should not interfere with the rights of free sale and we regard the vested tenants as having the same rights as small or large farmers.  We give them the right of free sale.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins </NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes.  The purchaser should be qualified within the terms of the Agricultural Labourers Acts.  If we get a case of a person working or living in an urban area, we would be very cautious in accepting him.  It is possible to buy back a cottage in any county in Ireland if it is offered for sale.  Of course, if the seller can get a better price from a person qualified and in need of a house, he can sell it and the local authority comes in only where the person concerned fails to dispose of the property.</P>
      <P>I should imagine that Deputy Desmond's Bill should have gone a little further.  I have had a special interest in labourers' cottages all through the years and I may say that the loans would not be needed if in the first instance, the property were kept in repair.  That should meet the position.  I do not know the views of the Minister on this matter but, when the legislation which he has promised comes in, these points and some others should be covered.  I do not know that Deputy Desmond has any great cause for complaint, notwithstanding the keen and honest interest he has in this matter.  As far as our cottiers are concerned, there has been no cause of complaint up to the present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the Bill. I do not think there is any need for the enactment of this legislation at the present time.  Cottages are repaired and adequately repaired before they are vested and that is adequate for the moment.  If we decide to give the people loans and commit ourselves further, I think it is the thin edge of the wedge to remove from local authorities any control over these cottages at all.  Initially, they were built out of public funds and vested in the tenants and it is only fair and right to prevent racketeering, to stop it where there is any danger of its cropping up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Desmond's point that sometimes it is difficult for <Col N="550" /> the vested tenant to find the wherewithal to carry out the repairs but a Bill of this kind is not the best remedy for the problem.  I should be prepared to await the vesting legislation promised by the Minister under which the situation will be better met.</P>
    <P>We all know of these vested cottages in urban and rural areas and I notice that from time to time people whom I would not hold to be qualified seem to get possession of them.  It would lead to extensions of that abuse if this Bill were to go through.  I think it is a premature Bill and I would rather leave the matter over until the Minister has had time to examine the matter fully and see that the rights of the rate-payers are adequately protected and that there is no further expansion of the rights of vested tenants in these cottages.  It could well lead to pressure to have open dealing in these houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary) Mr. P. Hogan (South Tipperary)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(South Tipperary):</i> I agree with Deputy Jones in regard to the first part of the Bill relating to loans to bridge the gap between the double grant and the reconstruction grant.  That loan would be recoverable in full as regards principal and interest. The second part, that which relates to giving loans to prospective purchasers of vested cottages, raises a more difficult question.  If we give a loan to people to purchase these houses, it will be a temptation to vest and while vesting may be a desirable thing, it has its own difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One difficulty arises where the cottages are closed when the people emigrate.  The cottages are left there unused.  That is one of the obvious disadvantages of vesting.  There are difficulties as regards the purchasing of these cottages and our manager has advised us against it.  We could not see the sense of spending the council's money in bringing a cottage up to a certain standard of repair and then buying it back again.  You also have to ensure that when a person's cottage has been bought, that person will not become a charge on the rates within a few months of purchase of the cottage. That applies whether the county council purchases the cottages or whether a <Col N="551" /> private individual in receipt of a loan purchases a cottage.</P>
    <P>The second point we will have to see to is as to whether the prospective purchaser is a genuine tenant in the spirit of the Bill, that he is what we can describe as an agricultural labourer.  If these two points could be cleared up and if precautions could be taken in these two regards there would be less objection to the second part of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill presented by the Labour Party will require numerous amendments if it is to remedy all the defects that are now very evident in regard to local authority housing.  Deputy Desmond dealt with a number of them.  I wonder if the Bill is sufficiently specific to allow them to be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> In the first place there is the question of repairs prior to vesting.  There have been very many complaints about this matter.  There is also the case of owners who wish to repair their cottages and to obtain loans for that purpose in addition to the grants to cover, as Deputy Desmond says, the balance that has to be met.  The grants are given and the estimate is made on the reports of the Department's inspectors. These inspectors are changed very frequently with the result that an inspector who has been working mainly in the rural area may come into a city or urban area to inspect and he may fail to take notice of the fact that in the suburbs of towns and cities within the jurisdiction of the housing authority there are trade union regulations that have to be met. Very often, the inspector bases his calculation on the system obtaining in the rural area and the person who wants to repair a cottage cannot go ahead because of the financial commitment he would have to meet.  That is a problem that has to be met.  It is one that has come to notice very frequently.</P>
    <P>As regards compulsory vesting of council cottages the problem is that defects in repairs do not reveal themselves within one month, which is the time for appeal, and neither the council nor the Department has any method of dealing with it.  The time limit in that respect should be extended.  In regard to the building of houses, generally, there is a period which very often extends to six months before approval is given.  In the case of repairs to council cottages the period of one month should be extended to at least three months.  If appeal could be made within three months, there would be some chance of dealing with defects that presented themselves after the repairs had been carried out.  That is another problem that should be tackled.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Desmond mentioned, there is the question of grants and supplementary grants.  In respect of loans and grants the income limits have been raised in recent years but have remained static for supplementary grants.  Cases of hardship have come <Col N="553" /> to my notice frequently where people got a certain amount of overtime on a particular job in order to have it completed in a specified time, which they would not normally earn and would not earn again for a great number of years but, on account of having received that overtime payment for a short time, are deprived under the council's regulations of the supplementary grant.  That is a matter to be dealt with also when we are dealing with the question of housing.  Normally, the housing regulations would be coming up for review about this time. Over a year and a half ago the Minister promised that this problem would be dealt with in a comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the question of the council having the option to buy back cottages in a particular area.  There might be a tenant who needed a cottage and who was unable from his own resources to purchase, even though he was a qualified person. It is suggested that the council could recover these cottages for the purpose of housing qualified tenants.</P>
    <P>While there are many good features in the Bill, there are conflicting provisions in certain respects.  Sections 2 and 3 are somewhat in conflict and the Bill is not sufficiently clear or specific to deal with the problems which members of local authorities have to face daily.</P>
    <P>The general desire to get people to own their own houses is very laudable. <Col N="554" /> Every encouragement should be given to workers to own their own houses and an acre of ground, just as a small farmer works his land as best he can in the knowledge that it is his own.  We have another problem, of course.</P>

      <i>(a)</i> A comparison of the rate for Health in 1953-54 with the rate for Health in 1955-56 or 1961-62 would not be valid, since in the earlier yea r a wide variety of services later classified as &ldquo;Health&rdquo;<i>(e.g.</i> the general medical service, institutional services, other than for infectio us diseases, and institutional assistance) were classified as Public Assistance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(b)</i> For the year 1961-62 one rate was struck in respect of health and mental health while, for the two previous years quoted, there were separ rates for health and for mental hospitals.  This follows the change made in the Health Authorities Act, 1960 under which the mental health service ceased to be regarded as a separate service and was integrated with the health services generally in the interests of breaking down the distinction which formerly existed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>(c)</i> It should be appreciated that a large part of the increases is accounted for by increases in salaries and wages of staffs engaged in the p of health services, in common with increases in remuneration of staffs in other sectors of the economy.</P>
