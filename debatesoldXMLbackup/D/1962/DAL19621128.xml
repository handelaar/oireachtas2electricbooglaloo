      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that &ldquo;the report in the current issue of the <i>British Medical Journal</i> relating to possible dangers associated with the drug preludin&rdquo;, referred to in Question No. 2 is to a letter from two doctors in Britain <Col N="183" /> which appeared in the issue of the Journal mentioned dated 17th November. That letter dealt with the birth of two deformed infants to one mother and concluded with the words &ldquo;While it may be only a remarkable coincidence that the two pregnancies in which preludin was taken each ended in a similarly deformed infant, the possibility that preludin was responsible for the deformities cannot be ignored&rdquo;.  On the strength of the suspicion voiced in that letter, unsupported by any other evidence, I could not feel justified in taking the drastic action recommended in the question. In the last few days, however, it came to my notice that the same drug had come under consideration elsewhere and I have made an Order under Section 65 of the Health Act, 1947, providing as a precautionary, temporary measure, that the drug, or preparations containing it, may be sold in future only on the prescription of a medical practitioner.  I understand that the suppliers of the drug, which is a slimming preparation, are in process of circularising all doctors in this country advising them, for the present, not to prescribe it for women who might be pregnant.  The medical profession has not suggested that the drug may not safely be used in the treatment of men and, except during pregnancy, of women, and in these circumstances I do not feel that I would be justified in proscribing its use absolutely as the Deputy recommends.  In fact, the Deputy's proposal raises an important question of general principle: the right of the Minister for Health to determine what drug should or should not be used by a properly qualified medical practitioner in his treatment of a particular patient and so interfere with the practitioner's liberty to afford to such patient the treatment he thinks most appropriate. I am sure the Dáil will agree with me that this is a matter which should be left to the individual doctor concerned.</P>
    <P>My reply to Question No. 2 applies, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> to Question No. 3.</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 4, the public anxiety to which the Deputy has referred does not arise from any lack <Col N="184" /> of a recognised Irish standard relating to the manufacture and sale of drugs, but from the fact that drugs have been brought into use before all possibility of untoward results from their use by humans has been eliminated.  I suggest, therefore, that the latter part of the question does not arise in the present context.  In my reply last week to a question by Deputy Mullen and in reply to an earlier question by Deputy Kyne on 26th June last, I dealt in some detail with the whole complex question of the safety of drugs, particularly new drugs, in their clinical use. In relation to this particular aspect of the problem, it is pertinent to recall that preludin was in general use in very many countries for upwards of six years before its safety was questioned by any authoritative body of medical opinion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Omitting his <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> the Minister has in fact adopted the suggestion contained in Question No. 3 and prohibited the sale of this drug except on a doctor's prescription.  In regard to his reply to No. 4, however, would the Minister not consider establishing some section of his Department, for the time being at least, which would seek to collate all the literature being published in continental countries and the United States of America where warnings as to the untoward side-results of drugs are mentioned so that this literature would be constantly before the Department of Health, either for the purpose of taking such action as the Minister has decided to take in regard to this drug preludin, or alternatively, to enable him, where necessary, to invite the opinion of the Irish Medical Council on a particular drug which is appearing in the literature of more than one country as having dangerous side-effects?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would welcome these supplementary questions, if the Deputy would put them in instalments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It would greatly facilitate me, if the Minister would not answer three questions in a lump.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that the question of dealing with these synthetic drugs, many of which do <Col N="185" /> not occur in the ordinary way in nature has been under consideration in my Department for a long time and was one of the matters we had in mind when we asked the Oireachtas to pass the Poisons Bill of 1961 which set up a body, that is a fairly authoritative one, to consider the extent to which these drugs may be made freely available to the general public.  There has been in my Department a collation of all the available published matter in relation to these particular drugs.  I do not see how, with our resources, we can go further than that.  As I mentioned in my reply, it remains a very grave question as to whether any person or authority in this country would be competent enough to impose restrictions on the ordinary medical practitioner in dealing with his patients. Some of these drugs have been in use for a great number of years and it is only recently, arising from the experience with thalidomide, that attention has been directed to the fact that they may be a possible cause of genetical disturbance&mdash;I say &ldquo;they may be a possible cause&rdquo;.  In the particular case of preludin the only minatory statement we have before us is that which appeared in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 17th November, in which the two doctors who drew attention to the matter said that the possibility that preludin, which had been taken in the case of two pregnancies, had occasioned the abnormalities could not be ignored. That amounts to a mere suspicion and it is difficult, on a suspicion to proceed to the lengths which Deputy O'Higgins asked the Minister to proceed when he put down his Question, asking that we ensure that the drug be not offered for sale pending full investigation.  I have taken action which was long contemplated, and which has been under consideration by Comhairle na Nimheanna, to ensure that it will be available only upon certain prescribed conditions, that is, only on medical prescription.  I do not think it is possible for me to go any further than that.</P>

      <P>In the course of his statement in Brussels on 18th January, 1962, the Taoiseach said that &ldquo;in respect of revenue duties we anticipate that we shall be able to match the reductions already made by the member States and to keep pace with them in the future&rdquo;.  As the Deputy suggests, this may involve the elimination of such duties by 1st January, 1967.</P>
      <P>I should add that under Article 17 of the Treaty of Rome, member States may substitute for revenue duties internal charges on a non-discriminatory basis.  No net loss to the Exchequer is therefore anticipated.</P>

      <P>The question of my formally approving of any particular scheme of rationalisation does not arise, but I am satisfied that some degree of rationalisation of this industry is desirable, in view, particularly, of the continued decline in flour consumption which has resulted in an excess of milling capacity.  I understand that the proposals for the closing of the six mills put forward by the flour millers were based on the voluntary acceptance by the mills concerned of the <Col N="212" /> conditions agreed between the members of the industry themselves.  In the circumstances, and as assurances have been given that the closures will not affect the collection and handling of the wheat crop, the measures proposed for the elimination of some of the excess milling capacity seem to me to be reasonable.</P>

      <P>Is it sane to be giving grants and loans on preferential terms to locate industries in rural towns, while, at the same time, we are combining with the flour millers to close down old-established industries in the same towns?  Has the Minister considered not only the interests of the mill owners but the repercussions on the small towns where one of these mills was located and which provided purchasing power and employment? If they are closed down and the towns left half derelict, surely there is some social aspect to be taken into consideration as well as the flour millers' profit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is like a dream to me that I have heard a different type of argument advanced in this House over the years by Deputy Dillon in regard to this industry.  One thing which strikes me about a question of this nature is that we often find Questions on the Order Paper from Deputies on <Col N="213" /> all sides of the House&mdash;and they are entitled to place them on the Order Paper&mdash;suggesting that there should be rationalisation of these industries.  Here is a proposal made by the industry itself and agreed by the industry itself to eliminate what is known to be in existence&mdash;that is flour milling excess capacity&mdash;and if rationalisation is desirable anyway as we are led to believe, it is surely justified where it was arrived at by voluntary effort on the part of those concerned in the business.</P>

      <P>Is it not true that there are more means of producing rationalisation than wiping out six provincial mills and concentrating the milling capacity of the country in a relatively few city-situated mills?  Has the Minister had regard to the impact that closures of this kind can have on the small country towns in which in many cases the mills are practically the only industry operating in the area?

      <P>My approval was neither sought nor given for the scheme referred to.  While I have certain functions in relation to the control of the flour milling industry, it will be appreciated that I am not in a position to insist that particular flour mills must continue in operation if the proprietors of these mills decide to go out of business especially when, as in this case, there is considerable overcapacity in the industry.  Regarding the compensation to be paid to millowners and redundant workers this is being provided by the Irish Flour Millers' Association and I have not been furnished with sufficient information to enable me to state the total amount of compensation which will be payable in each case but I understand that the proposals for compensation have been discussed between the millowners and trade unions representing the workers concerned.</P>

They explained that since the negotiations leading to the closure of the mills were confidential, they could not take any overt steps to establish alternative employment, but they said that they were making every effort in consultation with the Industrial Development Authority to provide such alternative employment.  I might mention, to correct what the Deputy said, that two of the six mills are located in Dublin <Col N="216" /> city&mdash;it is not a matter of mills in six rural areas.</P>

I have put the same question down to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I knew that it was not by courtesy that this would be presented to him because the flour milling industry has been under strict control since 1933.  Therefore, the scheme had to be presented to him by compulsion. Now the Minister says that he did not approve of the scheme.  From the papers issued on 10th November, it appeared that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce had fully approved of this scheme.  In view of that statement of 10th November I cannot understand why the Minister says he did not approve of the scheme, especially since his Department is in complete control of the flour milling industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Revenue Commissioners were informed that certain logs were being exported from Donegal without an export licence they had an examination of these logs carried out.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the present number of registered motor vehicles in Dublin City and County, and the estimated number in the year 1972; and what steps are now being taken to provide within the next ten years ample off-street parking accommodation for those vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There were 101,958 mechanically propelled vehicles of all classes under licence in Dublin city and county on 10th August, 1962, the latest date for which figures are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a function of Dublin Corporation and, in so far as they are <Col N="222" /> concerned, the other road authorities in the Dublin area, to consider what steps should be taken to provide off-street parking facilities and for such purpose to estimate vehicle growth in their area.  The Road Traffic Act, 1961, contains provisions which enable local authorities to provide, and to assist in the provision of, off-street parking facilities.  Following the enactment of that Act, my Department issued a circular letter to local authorities advising them of their powers, urging them to survey the parking needs of their areas and even in the meantime to proceed with the acquisition of such sites as are available and may reasonably be expected to be suitable for car parks.  They were advised that they could submit proposals for the use of Road Fund grant allocations for such purposes. Various aspects of the Dublin traffic problem, including the question of parking are the subject of discussions between officers of my Department, the Corporation and the Garda from time to time.  Officers of the Corporation have undertaken a preliminary review of the parking question as it affects the central city and I understand that a report has recently been submitted to the appropriate Corporation committee. Grants have already been made available to the Corporation for the provision or improvement of off-street car parks at three sites.  The Corporation are carrying out, in conjunction with officers of my Department and the Garda, an examination of the problems involved in parking meters. The use of parking meters is generally regarded as a necessary adjunct to the effective use of off-street parking facilities.  The Corporation are taking other steps to deal with the problem, including securing provision for parking in conjunction with new building developments.  In this connection the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, which is at present before the Dáil, should be of assistance to the Corporation.</P>

The Finance Act, 1962, reduced the rate of duty on agricultural tractors from £8 per annum to £2 10s. per annum as from 1st July 1962, and provided that appropriate refunds be made in accordance with such directions as may be given by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been correspondence between Tipperary (N.R.) County Council and my Department, particularly since 1958, concerning the housing of small farmers.  In letters from my Department of 26th April, 1960, and 16th September, 1960, the council were requested to give a more precise indication of the financial assistance envisaged in their previous correspondence.  From a letter received in my Department on 30th March, 1962, it appears that certain suggestions were formulated by the council in November, 1961, the implementation of which, if accepted, would require legislation.  These suggestions, in conjunction with other similar suggestions were considered by me prior to submitting the Housing (Grants and Loans) Bill to the Oireachtas.  A number of the provisions contained in that Bill were designed to facilitate the housing of small farmers, including improved loan facilities, more flexible supplementary grant provisions, grants for experimental low-cost housing and <Col N="225" /> grants for essential repairs to rural houses.  These proposals were enacted by the Oireachtas and all housing authorities, including Tipperary (N.R.) County Council, were so informed by circular letter of 14th September, 1962, with which was forwarded a copy of the Act in question.</P>
      <P>The extent to which housing authorities might further facilitate the housing of farmers will come up for consideration in conjunction with proposals for further legislation.</P>

The circular did not contain any direction of a nature which would necessitate serious delay in the provision of cottages.  The preparation of general house plans has been engaging the attention of the Kerry County Council for a considerable time.  The final plans, received in my Department on the 14th November, 1962, were approved within three days.  Estimates of cost of erection of the different house types and of individual cottages have been received this morning and are being approved.</P>

      <P>No, and that, therefore, falls clearly within the prerogative of the Leader of the House.  I want to submit to the Leader of the House, and to the House in general, that, if Parliament is to function effectively one of the prerogatives of individual Deputies must be their right to constrain a Minister to come before the House in answer to a Parliamentary Question, to answer that question in public and submit himself to supplementary questions and, with the permission of the Chair, to a discussion on the Adjournment, if the individual Deputy is dissatisfied with the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I direct the attention of the Leader of the House to the fact that there is on the Order Paper to-day a long series of questions addressed to the Minister for Finance in the name of Deputy Oliver Flanagan.  For the first time in my experience in this House, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has resorted to the expedient of seeking the permission of the Chair to answer these questions by way of a tabular statement.  I submit to the House, and to the Leader of the House, who is responsible in these matters that this is to abort the fundamental right of Deputies to ask Ministers to answer questions in the House and to satisfy individual Deputies with their answers; and I would request the Leader of the House now to give an undertaking that the device employed <Col N="232" /> by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance today will not be employed hereafter.</P>

He knows, as well as I do, that these questions arise from a new departure initiated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance.  Many of us take the view that we have a right to approach either the ministerial head or the permanent head of a Department with a written inquiry and that ordinarily&mdash; certainly in my 30 years' experience of this House, any written inquiry I have addressed to the permanent head has been answered by the permanent head&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If they are addressed to the Minister, the Deputy is entitled to expect and, in my experience, has always received, an answer from the Minister.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is the first person who has elected to say that he forbids correspondence between the permanent head of the Board of Works in relation to employment schemes under the Board of Works, over which he presides as the Minister's deputy, and insists that all such requests should pass through him.  If Deputies do not choose to have recourse to that procedure, their alternative is to ask Parliamentary Questions. I think the Parliamentary Secretary's alteration of the normal <Col N="233" /> methods of procedure does create a problem by multiplying the number of Questions that appear on the Order Paper.  I am convinced that if the normal practice in the Board of Works were restored, this problem would not arise; but, pending a reasonable settlement of the situation, I want to put it to the Leader of the House, who, after all, may himself be one day Leader of the Opposition, that we have a mutual obligation to protect the fundamental rights of Deputies for, if these rights are not protected, Parliament cannot function.</P>

      <P>There are certain practices established in this House which make commonsense.  If a Deputy asks for information and that information involves the compilation of statistical tables, it is not reasonable that a Minister or Parliamentary Secretary should be asked the read out that reply.  The normal practice of making the reply available to the Deputy in the Official Report is a very sensible one.  Indeed, there are many questions on the Order Paper which should, in my view, be starred to permit of a written reply only being given.  If an oral reply is asked for such questions, it merely delays the time of the House.</P>

      <P>Yesterday, Sir, I asked the Taoiseach in connection with Vote No. 18, which relates to Law Charges, if it would be possible to arrange for a separate discussion on that particular Estimate and he suggested to me I could find means to bring about such a situation?  I put in a notice of motion in the Office referring back Vote No. 18 and that motion has not appeared on the Order Paper. I understand it cannot appear separately on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Last July, when this particular Estimate appeared on the Order Paper and in respect of it a motion to refer back was tabled, as it is here on the Order Paper for July, in the names of Deputy Dr. Browne and myself, the Taoiseach stated at Column 1956 of Volume 196 of the Official Report of 11th July last:</P>
      <P>If a separate discussion is desired on any particular Estimate that can be arranged.</P>
      <P>Then Deputy Sweetman intervened to say:</P>
      <P>As long as I have that undertaking from the Taoiseach, I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that the Estimate for the Department of Finance is one about which I have some little experience?  What has happened on previous occasions, and the present incumbent of the position will remember that it happened last summer 12 months, is that we discussed Vote No. 6, his Estimate, and then had a separate discussion on Vote No. 18. That is on the records.  We had a separate discussion on Vote No. 18. What we agreed to do was to have exactly the same sort of discussion now as we would have had last July, one discussion on No. 6 and on No. 18, as we had in 1961.  It seems to me the obvious way of saving the time of the House is that it be agreed that a token Vote No. 6 would cover all the Estimates for which the Minister for Finance is responsible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch) Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. J. Lynch)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to bring the law of copyright up-to-date to meet modern conditions and to have the law, which is at present spread over five enactments, comprised in a single statute separate from the laws dealing with patents for inventions, trade marks and industrial designs.</P>
      <P>The Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Acts, 1927 to 1958, and the statutory orders and regulations made under these Acts contain the law on these subjects as well as on copyright.  Parts VI and VII of the 1927 Act which relate to copyright were based on the Copyright Act, 1911, which continued to be the British law on the subject up to 1st June, 1957, and that Act was also the model on which the British self-governing dominions framed their copyright legislation.  The new British Act, which was enacted in 1956 following the report of a committee of inquiry, is a comprehensive measure and takes into account modern developments whereby ideas can be conveyed not only, as formerly, by printing and reading, but now also by radio, television, films and recordings. This British Act has been taken as a model for the consideration of proposed new copyright legislation in a number of countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and Ghana, and it is the basis on which much of the present Bill has been prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Copyright protects all kinds of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works including cinematograph films from unauthorised copying or pirating. It is necessarily the subject of international agreement as protection must be assured across national boundaries. There are two main multilateral agreements on this matter, namely, the International Convention for the protection of Literary and Artistic Works (the &ldquo;Berne Convention&rdquo;) and the Universal Copyright Convention (the &ldquo;Geneva Convention&rdquo;).  Ireland is a party to both and the Bill is in accord with our obligations under these Conventions.</P>
    <P>The development of broadcasting, particularly of television broadcasting, and the possibility of the recording or other use by unauthorised persons of broadcasts for commercial gain, have raised the question of giving broadcasts legal rights and protection distinct from any that the law already gives to the literary, musical or artistic works that may be elements of a broadcast. In other countries the view has been taken that broadcasting is a matter which should properly be given rights, in the nature of copyright, under the copyright law.  I share this view and the present Bill seeks to give effect to it.</P>
    <P>Two international agreements regarding the protection of broadcasts have been signed on behalf of Ireland, but cannot be ratified until the appropriate protection has been provided for by our law, and the benefit of it has been extended by Order to foreign broadcasts.  One of these conventions, the &ldquo;European Convention for the Protection of Television Broadcasts&rdquo; was made under the auspices of the Council of Europe and relates only to television broadcasts. The other is a wider convention concluded at Rome in October 1961, under the auspices of Unesco, ILO, and the International Bureaux for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  This latter convention covers the international protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations.  The proposals in this Bill relating to broadcasts will meet the relevant requirements of these conventions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="242" /> The Act of 1927, based, as already stated, on the Copyright Act, 1911, treated of cinematograph films and gramophone records as if the films were a kind of dramatic work and the records a kind of musical work.  Films and recordings have now developed to a stage where they cannot be regarded as a class of dramatic or musical works, being frequently concerned with neither one nor the other.  There is frequently no personal author in the sense in which the word is used in relation to dramatic or musical works. Nevertheless, it is considered that films and recordings rank as subjects proper to be accorded rights, on their own standing, under the copyright law and that the rights arising under this law should properly be vested in the maker, whether this be an individual or corporate body.  The State is committed under the international copyright conventions to the protection of cinematograph films, and, as I have said, the Rome Agreement for the international protection of performers, producers of phonograms, and broadcasting organisations requires us to accord protection on a reciprocal basis to records, or phonograms as the Convention calls them, of the participating States.  The provisions in the Bill regarding the copyright in sound recordings will meet the requirements of the Convention in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal with the question of rights of performing artists, also covered by the Rome Convention of last year; that will have to be the subject of a separate Bill.  I have this matter under examination.</P>
    <P>One of the rights established by the law in copyright works is the right to control the performance of a work as distinct from the basic right to control copying.  In the case of musical works, it is the practice of composers, lyric writers and music publishers to assign the performing right to a body composed of all three groups, known as the Performing Right Society Limited. This is a British-based organisation with representation in Ireland and it has its counterparts in practically all countries throughout the world.  The <Col N="243" /> effect of the arrangement I have referred to is that persons wishing to perform copyright music in public, e.g., at concerts, dances, cinemas, etc., or to broadcast such music, can secure a licence from the Performing Right Society for the performance of any music in its repertoire, on the payment of a fee graded according to the potential receipts from the performance. Practically all copyright music is within the control of the Society.  Without detracting from an individual composer's copyright, it is considered that the channelling of the control of the performance of practically all copyright music into one body constitutes a monopoly that ought to be subject to some review where a dispute arises between that body and any group of users over the schedule of fees, or with any individual who is refused a licence to perform such music in public.  It is considered that the appropriate appeal authority should be the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property who has somewhat analogous functions in the matter of patents.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes to re-enact the provision in existing law which requires publishers to send free to certain libraries a copy of every book first published in the State.  I know that this whole arrangement has been adversely criticised but after full consideration of the matter I am satisfied that it is in the national interest that it should be continued.  The list of libraries to which such copies must be sent is extended by the inclusion of the library of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  This is a recognised college of the National University of Ireland.</P>
    <P>A provision is contained at section 56 of the Bill enabling the Benchers of the King's Inns to dispose of any books in that library, notwithstanding any provision in any of the earlier Copyright Acts or in the King's Inns Library Act, 1945, which required any books obtained by the Library to be preserved in it.  The Benchers think that there are some books in the Library which could usefully be disposed of, and the proceeds applied in binding or cataloguing books of more <Col N="244" /> interest to the users of the Library.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes the establishment of a new copyright in published editions of works, for the benefit of publishers.  This new copyright will merely protect publishers from having their typographical arrangements copied by photographic means.  It will not necessarily prevent the publication by other publishers of the same material.</P>
    <P>An existing provision in the law regarding the false attribution of authorship of artistic works is extended to literary, dramatic, and musical works by section 53 of the Bill.  The Bill provides that offences under the section will be prosecuted not by the Minister, as at present, but by the person to whom the work has been falsely attributed or, if he is dead, by his personal representatives.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues the existing provisions under which the benefits of the protection established by it can be extended to other countries with which Ireland has entered into arrangements for the reciprocal protection of copyright.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed that the copyright to subsist in future sound recordings should not include an absolute right over the public performance of such recordings, but only a right to fair remuneration when the recordings are so used.</P>
    <P>Some further alterations of existing law are proposed which can be dealt with more fully at later stages, but they include proposals for a term of copyright of 25 years for such subject matters as recordings and cinematograph films to bring the period into line with that proposed for broadcasts. Because of the obvious relationship between films and photographs, the latter, it is proposed, should also be subject to the twenty-five year term. It is considered that a term of twenty-five years' copyright is more appropriate to such subject matters as recordings, films and broadcasts, than the term of 50 years, measured from the death of the author, which the law gives to original literary or musical works.  The shorter term <Col N="245" /> meets the obligations in this respect of any of the international conventions dealing with the subjects.  It is also more in line with the period of monopoly granted for inventions, 16 years, or industrial designs, 15 years.</P>
    <P>Some features of the existing law which are not proposed for re-enactment include the present limitation of a three year period in which to commence actions for infringement of copyright; the keeping of a statutory register of entertainments by proprietors of theatres, etc.; the keeping of a statutory register of artistic works by the Controller of Industrial and Commercial Property; and certain powers of seizure by the Gardaí of pirated musical works which originally derived from the Musical Act, 1906. I recommend the Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, this Bill brings the law up to date in relation to copyright and that is a desirable development.  Yesterday we discussed a separate Bill dealing with trade marks and, as I understand it, for the future, the provisions in regard to trade marks will be contained in a separate Bill and copyright will be contained in this Bill, whereas formerly they were both included in the Industrial and Commercial Property Protection Act, 1927.  There are one or two matters that strike me in this Bill on which I should like some amplification.  One is in relation to Section 39 which says:</P>
      <P> (1)  an appeal shall lie to the High Court from any order or decision of the Controller...</P>
      <P>(2)  a decision of the High Court under this Section shall be final and not appealable. </P>
      <P>Normally in a section of that sort where finality is imposed on an appeal, there is a proviso that an appeal can be taken on a point of law.  That might require consideration between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under Section 43, exemption is granted to certain international organisations, mainly, the United Nations, the organs thereof and the specialised agencies, and also the Organisation of <Col N="246" /> American States.  It is also possible under the section to specify other international organisations.  I should be interested to know if there is any special reason why the organisations named, the United Nations and its various organs and agencies and the Organisation of American States, are so specified and if there is any reason why a similar provision should not apply to, say, the Council of Europe, the Organisation for European Co-operation and Development, or any of the other organisations such as ILO.</P>
    <P>There is another matter referred to in the Minister's speech in relation to Section 53 of the Bill.  He says the Bill provides that offences under the section will be prosecuted, not by the Minister as at present but by the person to whom the work has been falsely attributed or, if he is dead, by his personal representative.  Take a person who has a large number of literary or artistic productions to his credit, say, a well-known author like the late Bernard Shaw who wrote over a long period and who has now been dead for some years.  Is it his personal representative who has the right to take action?  Is there any reason why under this proposed Act the change is being made under which this right is vested in the person or his personal representative rather than in the Minister?</P>
    <P>It is desirable to make the amendment which is suggested in Section 56. I have no doubt the Benchers of the King's Inns have a number of books which are of no continued use to the people who use the King's Inns library; consequently the power to sell or exchange these books is desirable in order to enable them to devote the money secured from such sale to the purpose either of acquiring additional books or binding or cataloguing existing books there.</P>
    <P>I agree also with the provision in the Bill obliging publishers of any book which is published in the State to deliver copies to the National Library and to the library of the universities, including now St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and Trinity College.  This involves publishers in extra expense but these libraries provide <Col N="247" /> a very valuable and useful service. Their funds are not unlimited and this will enable them to keep up to date with publications in a readily accessible manner.  For that reason, I think the practice should be continued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyBarry" hpid="Mr. A. Barry Mr. A. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear about the third point Deputy Cosgrave raised.  Why should a person to whom work has been falsely attributed initiate a prosecution?  Surely it should be the person who wrote the work.  I am not clear why the Minister should use those words.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Barry were a composer of note, composing works of high musical content and somebody composed what might be called a Tin Pan Alley ditty and put Deputy Barry's name under it, Deputy Barry in those circumstances would be an aggrieved party and would have the right to prosecute the person who composed this Tin Pan Alley ditty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is false attribution, that is, having the work falsely attributed to somebody other than the real author.</P>
      <P>The first point raised by Deputy Cosgrave is a good one, that normally speaking when decisions of the High Court are final there is a proviso that in the case of a point of law the decision need not be final. Therefore, I will have that matter examined between now and Committee Stage which incidentally I propose to ask for on a date after Christmas when the Dáil reassembles because, this Bill being rather technical, I should like to give those interested in it a full opportunity of examining it in all its details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the point as to why in Section 43 the United Nations Organisation and its different agencies and the Organisation of American States were specified, the answer is that these <Col N="248" /> organisations are those included in the Protocol to the Universal Copyright Convention.</P>
    <P>Those are the three main points that have been raised.  I have already answered the third point raised by Deputy Cosgrave in reply to Deputy Barry.  As I said, this is a technical Bill, one that must be passed in order to enable us to keep in line with international law and to enable us to adopt international Conventions to which we are a party.  Between now and Committee Stage, which will be several weeks ahead, I hope those individuals and organisations who are interested in it will have studied the Bill so as to make sure that all responsible points of view will be considered on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st March, 1963, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport and power including certain services administered by that Office and for payment of sundry Grants-in-Aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> The purpose of this token Estimate is to enable the Dáil to discuss the 1962-63 Estimate for the Department of Transport and Power.  The Book of Estimates shows a net Estimate of £5,004,740 for 1962-63 compared with the sum of £4,841,810 granted in 1961-62&mdash;i.e.  a net increase of £162,930.  The 1961-62 figure was increased to £4,851,810 by way of a Supplementary Estimate for £10,000 which was taken too late for inclusion in the Book of Estimates thereby reducing the increase of £162,930 to £152,930.</P>
    <P>The principal increases are in the provisions for Salaries, £105,000; Tourism, £359,000; Construction, Dublin Airport, £260,000; Working Capital for Catering Service&mdash;Shannon Airport, £110,000; Shannon Free Airport Development Co., £50,000 and Rural Electrification, £69,210. Increases on other Subheads amount to £84,130.</P>
    <P>This gives a total Increase of £1,037,340 as shown in the Estimate. The &ldquo;Late&rdquo; Supplementary Estimate in 1961-62 increased the grant for the year by £10,000 and thereby Reduced the total of the Increase to £1,027,340.</P>
    <P>The principal Decreases are in the provisions for Harbour Grants, £90,000; Construction&mdash;Shannon Airport, £75,000 and Cork Airport, £315,000.  Decreases on other Subheads amount to £40,170.  To these must be added an Increase of £354,240 in the Appropriations in Aid Subhead which is equivalent to a Decrease in the net Grant.  This brings the total of the Decrease to £874,410.</P>
    <P>The net increase in the Estimate for 1962-63 compared with 1961-62 is therefore, £152,930 as I have already stated.  The increase in the provision for salaries is due to recruitment of staff to fill newly created posts, mostly at Cork Airport, and to general increases in salaries and wages and normal incremental progression.</P>
    <P>The services of tourism for which £699,300 was provided in 1961-62 in the Vote for Industry and Commerce, £700,000 in Subheads H. 1, 2 and 3, less £700 receipts under Subhead S.3.  Appropriations-in-Aid, and the aviation and meteorological radio services for which £178,000 was <Col N="250" /> provided in Subhead F of the Vote for Posts and Telegraphs were taken over by the Department of Transport and Power and provision is made for these services in 1962-63 in the Vote for Transport and Power.</P>
    <P>As the House knows, it is my general policy to bring about a position where the State Companies should ultimately be able to remunerate at least the new capital invested in them.  It must be recognised, however, that there are special circumstances in the civil aviation industry.  We all appreciate its unique contribution to our tourist industry and are aware of the extremely rapid rate of expansion which has been imposed upon it.  In view of the international character of the service it is necessary to provide services capable of meeting the intense competition.  The fares structure is the result of international bargaining by air companies, many of which enjoy various indirect advantages, such as long haul rates, concealed subsidies for social or military reasons; use of airports which are themselves subsidised. Despite these advantages the world's airlines showed a record operating loss estimated at £50m. for 1961 as compared with an operating profit of £25m. in 1960 and in some cases their Governments have been called upon to come to the rescue.</P>
    <P>These losses have been attributed variously to excess capacity, the result of over-optimistic traffic predictions and fierce competition despite limitation of rates by international air agreements and the minimum fares prescribed by the IATA.  In the context of world aviation Aer Lingus and Aerlinte as with some other airlines have made a reasonably good job financially of their operations last year.  Aer Lingus showed a small operating surplus after allowing for depreciation but not for remuneration of capital, while Aerlinte in its fourth year of operation and in its first full year with its own jet aircraft earned a substantial operating surplus after allowing for depreciation at a time when other airlines long established on the North Atlantic were losing money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="251" /> Apart from the purely financial success, Aerlinte has made a notable contribution to the tourist drive and has well merited tributes for its publicity efforts in the US.  It is a cause of regret to me that neither company has yet been able to contribute towards the remuneration of its capital but I am keeping in touch with the companies about their future financial requirements and I hope that it will be possible to make some more satisfactory arrangements for the future.</P>
    <P>While the number of aircraft landing at Shannon Airport&mdash;7,406 in the year 1961-62&mdash;showed a decrease of 4 per cent. on the 1960-61 figure and the total number of passengers handled decreased by 5 per cent. to 376,000 the total number of terminal passengers &mdash; embarked and disembarked&mdash;increased by 17 per cent. to 149,000 and transatlantic terminal passengers increased by 17 per cent. to 92,000.  The total number of passengers going through the Airport represents about one-fifth of all the air travellers on the North Atlantic.</P>
    <P>At present, in addition to Aerlinte, the following eight foreign airlines are operating scheduled passenger services into Shannon Airport:&mdash; British Overseas Airways Corporation, Pan American Airways, Trans-Canada Airlines, K.L.M. (Royal Dutch Airlines), Swissair, Sabena (Belgian Airlines), Trans-World Airlines, Lufthansa, the German Airline.</P>
    <P>The Airport's total freight traffic in 1961-62 at 24,680 metric tons increased by 37 per cent. over 1960-61, terminal freight increasing by 44 per cent. and transit freight by 36 per cent. Cargo scheduled services are operated through the airport by Pan American Airways, Seaboard World Airlines and Alitalia.  Out of a total of 17 European airports Shannon is in seventh place as regards the level of cargo services. This indicates the very great importance of Shannon as a freight centre as all the ten countries concerned in these 17 airports operate thier own transatlantic cargo services.  An important element in the increasing terminal freight traffic during the year 1961-62 is the continuing development <Col N="252" /> of the Industrial Estate, the freight traffic generated showing an increase of 85 per cent. on 1960-61&mdash; 1,033 metric tons as against 559.</P>
    <P>Traffic during the current financial year apart from embarkations and disembarkations will show an inevitable decline due to the reduction in transit traffic and this calls not only for maximum tourist promotion by all the airlines and Bord Fáilte but also for far more joint co-operative tourist promotion on the lines advocated by the former President of Limerick Chamber of Commerce.  Shannon Airport is the centre for the scenic attractions of western Ireland and this is being highlighted in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Work on the construction of a new freight terminal building necessitated by the increased freight traffic has been completed.  A central turf-fired boiler house which will replace temporary and localised heating systems throughout the terminal area is expected to be completed by the end of this year.  Work on the construction of a new control tower which is intended to accommodate the air traffic control and radio service staffs at the Airport with a view to securing the efficient co-ordination of these services and the more economic utilisation of staff has commenced and it is expected that this will be completed by mid-1963.</P>
    <P>Contracts have been placed for the construction of a general purposes building which will include accommodation for an automatic telephone exchange and for a mail order stores which is required to meet the expanding mail order activities of the sales catering service.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the use of the Airport by jet aircraft it has been necessary to carry out extensions to the aircraft parking area and provide jet engine blast screens, in order to provide sufficient parking space and to enable the aircraft to be parked close to the terminal building.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware from recent press reports and publicity and my reply to a Parliamentary Question on 12th April, 1962, a new US owned organisation has been granted <Col N="253" /> a licence to operate at Shannon for the provision of full scale engineering facilities and to undertake a limited amount of traffic handling mainly for non-scheduled operations at the Airport. Conditions are attached to the licence to ensure that a satisfactory standard of engineering services is provided and to co-ordinate the traffic handling facilities of the new organisation with those already being provided by the national airline.  The new organisation hopes to provide certain repair and maintenance services which have hitherto not been available at the airport and extending to major overhauls and repairs.</P>
    <P>There have been extensive developments in the provision of navigational aids and communication facilities over the past twelve months or so.  At Shannon Airport an instrument landing system, a precision approach radar installation of the very latest types and distance measuring equipment are either installed or projected.</P>
    <P>Shannon is now the sole centre broadcasting meteorological information for the North Atlantic traffic on the European side of the Atlantic, and the quality of the broadcasts has been highly praised.  In addition, broadcasts on very high frequency are being provided as part of a broadcast plan for the European Mediterranean Region and these broadcasts are also used extensively in the North Atlantic Region.</P>
    <P>Despite a decrease in overall passenger traffic at the airport, there was an increase of over 7 per cent. in the turnover of the sales and catering services for the sales year to 31st January, 1962.  This increase was achieved by an intensified sales effort on the part of the service and by the development of departments which do not depend directly on passenger volume for their income.  Despite this effort there was, due to a further decline in transit traffic at the airport, a decrease in turnover since then.  While only provisional figures are yet available the indications are that turnover, since 31st January, 1962, has fallen by between 8 per cent. and 10 per cent. Adverse factors affecting the services <Col N="254" /> are the decrease in transit traffic and the reduction from $500 to $100 of the duty-free allowance of US tourists returning home.  These factors, together with the concentration of jet traffic into shorter periods of the day, have led to substantial staff redundancy in the catering service involving almost one hundred persons.  Every effort is being made by the Sales and Catering Service to ease the hardships which this redundancy will inevitably cause.</P>
    <P>A provision by way of a grant-in-aid for £110,000 has been included in the Estimates this year to enable working capital to be provided for amounts and periods as required by the sales and catering service.  Interest at the appropriate rate will be charged on the amounts outstanding from time to time.  This does not represent a new expenditure by the State but is merely an accounting arrangement, the expenditure being balanced by increased Appropriations in Aid from the Catering Service.</P>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on Shannon Airport up to 31st March, 1962, amounted to £4.9m. of which £4.6m. had been expended up to 31st March, 1961.  Total revenue at the Airport in the financial year 1961-62 amounted to £845,000 as compared with £728,000 in 1960-61.  The increased revenue was due largely to increased pilot training operations at the Airport during the year which yielded additional landing fees.  Operating expenditure at the Airport in 1961-62 amounted to £644,000 as compared with £580,000 in 1960-61.  Expenditure on air traffic control meteorological and radio services in 1961-62 amounted to £306,000.  The operation of the Airport in 1961-62 showed, accordingly, a surplus of £201,000 but this figure makes no allowance for interest on capital expenditure, depreciation or pension liablity, which amounted to about £490,000.  The overall deficit of the operation of the Airport in 1961-62 was, therefore, about £285,000, or about £22,000 less than the corresponding figure for 1960-61.</P>
    <P>There have been substantial increases in traffic at Dublin Airport. During the year 1961-62, there were <Col N="255" /> 16,700 aircraft landings, 963,600 passengers and 16,500 metric tons of freight representing increases of 8 per cent., 13 per cent. and 5 per cent. respectively over the 1960-61 figures.</P>
    <P>The car ferry service which was introduced by a British independent airline on the Dublin-Liverpool route in April, 1960, carried 1,500 cars in 1960 and over 1,600 during the 1961 summer season.  For financial reasons that company did not operate in 1962 but it was expected that a service would be introduced by another company. This service did not materialise.</P>
    <P>In view of these abortive attempts to provide an air car ferry service and having regard to its importance in the development of tourism, I directed Aer Lingus to undertake a study of the matter, as I felt that they alone could provide a viable continuous air car ferry, in conjunction with their normal passenger and freight services. The company's proposals for entry into this field were approved.  These proposals hold out the best promise of success because the future of an air car ferry service lies in its operation in conjunction with the normal passenger and freight services which Aer Lingus already provides.  Two Carvair ATL 98 aircraft are being purchased at a cost of £700,000 to be provided by way of share capital.  It is expected that the company will transport 4,000 cars between the two countries in the first year.  The British terminals are likely to be Liverpool and Bristol but Birmingham is also being considered.</P>
    <P>Passenger traffic at Dublin Airport doubled between 1955 and 1960 and it is estimated that an increase of a similar order will occur between 1960 and 1965.  It was necessary, therefore, to prepare a long term scheme to provide additional accommodation to cope with anticipated traffic developments.</P>
    <P>A pier building has been constructed for passenger movement ensuring flexibility of operation and permitting growth in traffic over a period. Other constructional works now in course of erection include a second pier building, permanent quarters for <Col N="256" /> the technical administrative and staff catering services, a central turf-fired boiler house, and extensions to the fire station building.  These works should be completed in the course of the next six months.</P>
    <P>At Dublin Airport, to provide for expansion of traffic, arrangements are being made for the installation of surveillance radar equipment permitting co-ordination up to 120 miles from the Airport, and also for the provision of new precision approach radar equipment.</P>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on Dublin Airport up to 31st March, 1962, amounted to £2.8m. of which £2.4m. had been expended up to 31st March, 1961. The total revenue at the Airport in the financial year 1961-62 amounted to £395,000 as compared with £337,000 in 1960-61. The increase was mainly due to increased receipts from landing fees. Operating expenditure at the Airport in 1961-62 amounted to £406,000 as compared with £340,000 in 1960-61. The operation of the air traffic control, meteorological and radio services accounted for about £117,000.  The operation of the airport, therefore, in 1961-62 showed a deficit of about £11,000, a figure very much reduced from earlier years, to which must be added a sum of £257,000 in respect of interest on capital expenditure, depreciation and pension liability, making an overall deficit of about £268,000 on the operation of the airport in 1961-62. This compares with an overall deficit of £229,000 in 1960-61.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the outstanding development in Irish Aviation during the year was the opening of Cork Airport on 16th October, 1961.  In the five months up to 31st March, 1962 there were 500 aircraft landings involving the carriage of 20,500 passengers and 100 metric tons of freight and mail.  In the 12 months up to 15th October, 1962, 76,335 passengers had passed through the Airport and 329 metric tons of freight were handled.  The airport has made a very promising start and the traffic returns for the first year of operation have been encouraging. Direct services are operated to the <Col N="257" /> Airport from Dublin and from the following ten points in Britain and Europe: Barcelona, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Jersey, Liverpool, London, Lourdes and Paris. There are connecting Aer Lingus services to Lisbon, Rome and Zurich.  In addition to Aer Lingus the following four British operators serve the Airport: Cambrian Airways Ltd., Airlines (Jersey) Ltd., Starways Ltd. and Derby Aviation Ltd.</P>
    <P>With the commissioning of the third State Airport at Cork, I believe that the country is now adequately served with major airports, having regard to traffic potential and the rights available for economic service. The Exchequer commitment to the operation of airports is substantial and before any further capital investment in airports can be undertaken, the concentration must be on the problem of achieving economic operation of those already in existence.</P>
    <P>The total capital expenditure on Cork Airport up to 31st August, 1962 amounted to £1.1m.  The Airport commenced operations on 16th October, 1961 and in the period up to 31st March, 1962 total revenue amounted to about £3,000.  Operating expenditure at the Airport in the period amounted to £38,000 of which the air traffic control, meteorological and radio services accounted for £15,000.  The operation of the Airport showed, accordingly, a deficit of £35,000.  This figure makes no allowance for interest on capital expenditure, depreciation and pension liability which amounted to £64,000 in the period.  The overall deficit on the operation of the Airport in the period from 16th October, 1961 to 31st March, 1962 was, therefore, about £99,000.</P>
    <P>The continuing loss on the operation of the three State Airports has been a source of grave concern to me.  As I have indicated, the total deficit on the operation of the airports in 1961-62 was about £652,000.  I have been examining ways and means of reducing this substantial deficit and, as a measure to reduce these losses, I arranged for the introduction as from 1st April, 1962, of a passenger service <Col N="258" /> charge which is levied on air passengers travelling abroad.  This charge is imposed generally at European Airports. It is estimated that this charge will yield about £150,000 in the current financial year and the receipts from this source will, of course, increase with the expected increase in air passenger traffic.  Apart from the efforts which have been made to increase the revenue at the airports it is my policy to ensure that the airports are run as economically as possible, consistent with the provision of adequate and efficient services both to the travelling public and to the air companies.</P>
    <P>I should mention that I am satisfied that the operations in comparable countries show that the cost of the Irish Airports is not unfavourable.  It is difficult to make exact comparisons, as there are different systems of allocating costs.  In some countries as in the United States and Britain for instance no charge, or a nominal charge only, is made against the Airports in respect of the cost of air traffic control, meteorological service or radio staff, whereas in Ireland these costs are debited in full in making up the cost of the Airports.  The total loss on the operation of Shannon and Dublin Airports in 1961-62 amounted to £552,000. If the cost of the air traffic control radio and meteorological services were deducted, the result would have been a loss of only £70,000, which is not unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The accounts of Aer Lingus for the year ended 31st March, 1962, show that the Company earned an operating surplus of £56,000 as against £277,000 in 1960-61.  Total Revenue increased from £4,970,000 in 1960-61 to £5,684,000 in 1961-62, but this was more than offset by increased operating expenditure which amounted to £4,693,000 in 1960-61 as compared with £5,627,000 in 1961-62.  The results of the company's operations in 1961-62 can be regarded as satisfactory in view of the increased competition encountered in the period both on the cross-Channel and Continental routes.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus at present operates an aircraft fleet consisting of eight 65-seater Viscounts, seven 40-seater F27 <Col N="259" /> Friendship and five 32-seater DC3s.  In the year ended 31st March, 1962, the company's passenger traffic increased by 9 per cent. to 779,000 over the year ended 31st March, 1961.  Freight traffic increased by 17 per cent. to 13,100 metric tons but mail carried decreased by 2 per cent. to 1,657 metric tons.</P>
    <P>In 1961-62 Aer Lingus continued to expand its European network by the inauguration of the new services from Cork to London, Bristol, Paris and Cardiff.  Boeing jets operated on the Dublin-London route during the peak summer period of 1961 and on this route also a first class service has been introduced.  Increased frequencies were provided on most of the cross-Channel routes during 1961-62 as well as on the Continental routes to Amsterdam, Cherbourg, Copenhagen, Lisbon and Paris.  I have now received long term plans for the future expansion of Aer Lingus on all routes.  In connection with this, I have directed them to carry out a joint research project with Bord Fáilte in regard to the potential tourist traffic originating from Northern Europe.</P>
    <P>The accounts of Aerlinte for the year ended 31st March, 1962, show that the company earned an operating surplus of £200,000 as compared with an operating deficit of £94,000 in 1960-61.  The total revenue earned by the Company in 1961-62 was about £4,167,000 as against £2,463,000 in 1960-61 and this very considerable increase reflects the extersive development achieved in the Company's traffic during the year.</P>
    <P>In the year 1961-62, Aerlinte's three jet aircraft carried 55,000 revenue passengers, 525 metric tons of freight and 53 metric tons of mail representing increases of 57 per cent., 136 per cent. and 20 per cent. on the previous year, which is highly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>On 1st March, 1962, very large reductions in transatlantic fares were introduced in respect of groups of at least 25 people.  Aerlinte hope that the reduction will result in their securing business from groups in Ireland and the US who are at present chartering aircraft for transatlantic trips.  This will help to utlise empty sectors of <Col N="260" /> extra transatlantic flights in the peak periods.</P>
    <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1961, which became law on 3rd August, 1961 increased the authorised share capital of Aer Rianta Teo. from £10m. to £13m. and provided for the issue by the Minister for Finance to the Company of repayable advances not exceeding £1m.  The funds are required mainly for the repayment of bank loan, for working capital and for fleet and ground equipment.  The Minister for Finance has agreed to subscribe a sum of £275,000 by way of share capital for investment by Aer Rianta in Irish and Inter-Continental Hotels Ltd.  The total amount has already been advanced.  The money is being used towards the construction of hotels in Dublin, Cork, and Limerick and these hotels will provide much needed additional first class tourist accommodation, the lack of which at present is undoubtedly retarding the air companies in their efforts to attract more tourists to this country.</P>
    <P>Six Western European countries met in December, 1960, to consider the problem of jet aircraft in upper airspace and signed a Convention relating to Co-operation for the Safety of Air Navigation over their combined upper airspace.  This Convention will shortly be ratified by these countries and a new organisation to be known as Eurocontrol will be established. The new organisation will co-ordinate upper air traffic control in the countries concerned.  The Government have approved the making on behalf of Ireland of the necessary application to accede to the Convention and the text of the necessary enabling Bill will be circulated as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A development of very considerable significance to aviation in this country is the manufacture of aircraft at Baldonnel by the Potez group to whom Deputies will wish me to extend their very good wishes.</P>
    <P>A new scheme for the initial training by the Air Corps of young men recruited by the national Air Companies for training as pilots is now being organised and will be effective in respect of the next intake of trainees. While it was necessary at the beginning <Col N="261" /> of 1961 for the companies to send a number of young men outside the country for their preliminary flying training, such a course should no longer arise with the introduction of the new scheme.</P>
    <P>At the request of the United States authorities, discussions were held in Dublin last December between representatives of both countries on the representations of the US Government that American planes be permitted to fly to Dublin and beyond. As Deputies will have noted from Press statements the Irish Government found itself unable to agree to this request and accordingly there has been no change in the pattern of USA-Ireland flights.  The agreement which regulates air traffic between the two countries provides that a revision of the agreement may be requested on 60 days' notice by either side and the US Government have reserved the right to re-open the question in accordance with the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Co. Ltd. continues to develop to the fullest extent the great national asset which has been created in Shannon Airport.  Its aim is to increase freight traffic, to encourage transit passenger traffic and to promote tourism.</P>
    <P>The company's main sources of finance are provided under the authority of the Shannon Free Airport Development Co., Ltd., Acts, 1959 and 1961.  These Acts authorise:&mdash; (i) the Minister for Finance to take up shares in the Company up to an aggregate limit of £3,000,000; (ii) the issue by the Minister for Finance of repayable advances to the company to meet one-half of the expenditure by the company on the provision of dwellings for workers employed on the Industrial Estate at the Airport.  The aggregate amount of advances shall not exceed £400,000; and (iii) the provision, by way of grant-in-aid, of sums which in the aggregate shall not exceed £1,250,000.  The total amount of repayable advances to the company to 31st March, 1962 was £310,000.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid moneys are voted annually by the Oireachtas and a sum <Col N="262" /> of £330,000 is being provided for the company in the current financial year, the money to be used for grants to industrialists and to meet the running expenses of the company.  Up to 31st March, 1962, £614,500 had been paid to the company by way of grant-in-aid. The total amount advanced by way of non-voted share capital to that date was £1,578,000.  This money is used by the company to acquire revenue-earning assets such as factory buildings and dwelling houses, the income from which will go to supplement the company's grant finances. Up to 31st March, 1962, the total State investment in industrial development at Shannon was, therefore, about £2,500,000.  This expenditure includes an investment of over £600,000 in the provision of housing and in community development.</P>
    <P>It was to be expected that a concept so revolutionary as an Industrial Estate on the fringe of an international airport would take some time to come to full fruition, but already the results recorded are heartening.  Over 1,300 persons are now employed in the Industrial Estate compared with 700 a year ago and the annual value of their salaries and wages is of the order of £500,000.  Eight manufacturing and five trading concerns now operate in the Estate and 22 factory bays have been constructed.  The contribution to air freight is notable and up to the end of September, 1962, a total volume of some 2,000 metric tons of air freight had been generated by industrial operations at Shannon.  An encouraging feature of the industrial development programme is that five of the existing firms have taken steps to extend their operations.  By March, 1964, it is expected that total employment in the industrial estate will amount to 2,000.</P>
    <P>To date ten houses and 137 flats have been provided for employees.  A contract has been placed for and work is well advanced on an additional 100 houses.  The normal community amenities are being provided.  The extent to which additional houses should be provided at the airport is at present under consideration.  It will be appreciated that the availability of a stable labour force is of the greatest <Col N="263" /> importance to the continued success and development of the industrial enterprise.</P>
    <P>While the development of an industrial estate has been the most spectacular feature of the company's work, other developments have not been neglected.  The company is co-operating with Bord Fáilte and other interests with a view to maintaining the flow of transit traffic and of increasing terminal traffic at the Airport and it has itself undertaken a vigorous Press and public relations campaign, both at home and overseas.</P>
    <P>Members who visited the Industrial Estate in April will have seen for themselves the developments which I have outlined and I think I am correct in concluding that they will have been very impressed with what they saw and will have satisfied themselves that the moneys being provided by the State including the grants, which are yearly provided in these Estimates, are being put to very worthwhile use.</P>
    <P>The world wide recession in tramp shipping freight rates which has lasted for over five years still continues and there is little sign of any sustained recovery in the immediate future.  In 1961 it looked for a time as if the shipping industry was at last emerging from the slump, freight rates rallied and there was a continued decline in laid-up tonnage.</P>
    <P>In December, 1961, however, a decline set in and since then freight rates have fallen catastrophically to levels which are the lowest recorded since the last war.  The British Chamber of Shipping freight index figures for August and September, 1962, were 79.4 and 81.0 respectively as against 100 for the base year 1960 and 106.8 the average for 1961.  When account is taken of the very heavy increases in wages and operating costs since the war it is clear that shipowners are facing a severe crisis.  The volume of laid-up dry-cargo tonnage has risen sharply, the figure at the end of September, 1962, being 2.37 million tons gross compared with 500,000 tons at the end of October, 1961.  The low freight rates generally and the decline since December, 1961, are attributable <Col N="264" /> to the continuing surplus of world tonnage, the earlier invasion of the grain trade by tankers, greater carryings by bulk carriers and a recession in certain sectors of world trade.  The overriding factor is the excess of tonnage over demand and as a large volume of new shipping is still under construction it will probably be some years before a state of equilibrium between supply and demand can be reached.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that Irish Shipping Limited benefited from the temporary improvement in freight rates in 1961. For the 11 month period ended on 31st March, 1962&mdash;the company having altered its accounting year, which previously ended on 30th April&mdash;the company showed an operating surplus of £279,000 compared with £238,000 for the 12 months ended 30th April, 1961. The depreciation of the fleet for the 11 months amounted to £691,000 and the commercial loss for the period was thus £409,000, compared with a figure of £515,000 for the previous 12 months. Total cargo carried during the period amounted to 1,466,000 tons, which is a rate of increase of about 4½ per cent. over the average monthly carrying for the previous year.</P>
    <P>Because of the recession in freight rates the company were forced to lay up temporarily two of their deep-sea dry-cargo vessels, one of which, however, is now back in service.  While the company hope that the lay-up of further ships can be avoided this possibility cannot be excluded if freight rates continue at the present low levels.</P>
    <P>The company's fleet consists at present of 17 dry-cargo vessels totalling 138,500 tons deadweight and three tankers totalling 39,400 tons deadweight. The dry-cargo fleet includes two recent deliveries of 15,000 tons deadweight each, the <i>Irish Rowan</i> which is a sistership to the <i>Irish Sycamore</i> delivered last year, and the <i>Irish Cedar,</i> the first of two sistership bulk carriers.  The second bulk carrier is due for delivery in March, 1963.  These bulk carriers will enable the company to participate in the growing development of specialised bulk carriage.  The operating costs of these four vessels relative <Col N="265" /> to their carrying capacity are substantially less than those of smaller vessels in the fleet and the company believe that they will prove a worthwhile investment.  With the delivery of the second bulk-carrier, the company's dry-cargo fleet will total 153,500 tons deadweight so that only a further additional 47,000 will be required to meet the target of 200,000 tons which has been set.  Replacement of a number of the existing older vessels will in the normal course also be necessary before 1970.</P>
    <P>The company's earnings represent a significant contribution to our balance of payments, the net contribution on current account for 1961 being £1,235,000.  The company gives direct employment to about 850 persons, and provides valuable training facilities for young men interested in a seafaring career.  Indirect employment is given in the repair, overhaul, bunkering and provisioning of the company's vessels which is carried out as far as practicable in the State.  With the establishment of the Verolme Cork Dockyard, the building at home of deep-sea vessels for the company is now also possible.  The <i>Irish Rowan,</i> which is the first ship to have been built at the new dockyard, reflects great credit on the management and workers and marks, I hope, the beginning of a long and mutually beneficial relationship between the two companies.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the container dispute at Dublin Port has at last been settled and that container services are now operating freely through the port.  The container service between Greenore and Preston has continued to expand and constitutes a very valuable contribution to the development of efficient and economic transport for our exporters and importers between this country and Great Britain.  I was also pleased to note the inauguration during the year of a container service from Drogheda to Preston. Another very welcome development is the provision of a refrigerated container service between Dublin and the Continent.  Shipping and port costs must necessarily play an important part in the ability of our exporters to compete with producers and manufacturers <Col N="266" /> of other countries and, particularly in the era of increased competitiveness forced upon us by the Common Market, it is essential that these costs are not inflated by restrictive practices or the retention of outmoded methods.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to cargo handling at a number of our ports is far from satisfactory.  It is clear that some dock workers persist in maintaining restrictive and outmoded practices and resist the introduction of modern methods.  This results in higher discharging costs and also in higher freight rates to compensate for delays in the turn-round of ships.  Such restrictive practices must in the long run operate to the detriment of the business of the port and ultimately to the detriment of the livelihood of those responsible for maintaining these practices. It seems clear to me that port workers cling to outmoded practices because they fear redundancy or loss of earnings.  The aim of the port users should be to try to secure a general acceptance by all parties of the vital necessity for higher productivity.  If the right mood could be created, it might be possible to achieve greater efficiency at ports and more rewarding conditions for all concerned.</P>
    <P>Whilst some progress has been made at the Port of Dublin I feel that the time has come when a serious attempt to improve matters at other ports must be undertaken.  While the initiative may lie with the employers of port labour the co-operation of the trade unions is also absolutely essential.  Port authorities are, of course, concerned at existing conditions, but they are not directly involved in the stevedoring business, and their unaided efforts cannot be expected to bring about improvement.  The Harbour Authorities Association offers opportunity for consultations on port workers' productivity. Labour relations fall of course within the sphere of my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I am sure that his Department and the Labour Court would be only too willing to render any assistance possible in order to resolve the problem.</P>
    <P>An international conference at which this country was represented <Col N="267" /> was held in London earlier this year to consider amendments to the International Convention on Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, to which effect has been given here by the Oil Pollution of the Sea Act, 1956. We have a considerable interest in this matter as our beaches are from time to time badly affected by oily residues washed up from the sea and anything that would help to minimise the discharge of oil from ships would be greatly to our advantage.  The Conference was unable to agree on a date for the complete avoidance of the discharge of persistent oils into the sea but adopted some important amendments to the 1954 Convention, including considerable extensions of the sea zones in which the discharge of oil from ships is prohibited and a complete ban on the discharge of oil from new ships of 20,000 tons gross and over, except in special circumstances. The steps necessary to implement the amendments to the Convention in so far as this country is concerned are under examination.</P>
    <P>My Department and Bord Fáilte have been constantly pressing for improvements in the cross-Channel services. It will be recalled that for the summer period of 1961 the number of sailings on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route was increased.  A further increase of seventeen sailings was provided for the summer period of 1962 and there were also eight extra sailings on the Rosslare route.  The additional platform at Holyhead, quicker customs examination, a reduction in the number of passengers per vessel and better catering facilities, all contributed to a better service.  The appointment of a Chief Shipping and Irish Traffic Manager by the British Transport Commission should lead to further improvements in the future.</P>
    <P>While the number of sailings on the Dublin-Liverpool route remained unaltered, this service in common with the others offered cheap mid-week fares on more attractive terms in a further effort to encourage more even utilisation of the services so as to relieve pressure on those dozen or so peak days when the services operate <Col N="268" /> under the pressure of acute demand. If the difficulties which arise on these peak days could be alleviated the basic problems in connection with the cross-Channel passenger services would be well on the way to solution.  It is, unfortunately, the experience of the operators that the mid-week fare concessions are not sufficiently availed of by the travelling public.  For that matter, the day sailings from Dún Laoghaire are also insufficiently utilised and in an endeavour to encourage better utilisation of these sailings the requirement of sailing tickets for day sailings at Dún Laoghaire was cut to the minimum this year.</P>
    <P>The point that the heavy concentration of demand on a relatively small number of days creates substantial difficulty on the cross-Channel services is strikingly illustrated by the fact that the passenger capacity for the 1962 summer season on the Dún Laoghaire service was almost exactly double the number actually carried on the route in the summer of 1961.</P>
    <P>The commencement two weeks in advance of certain industrial holidays in the British Midlands helped appreciably this year to ease the very high traffic demand which normally builds up around the August Bank Holiday week-end.  This change should make for greater passenger comfort on peak days and also help significantly to spread the load.  The re-timing of the industrial holiday period in the Birmingham area is of special interest in view of the efforts which, in conjunction with Bord Fáilte, I am making to extend the holiday season in Ireland.  I will refer to this matter in more detail when, at a later stage, I deal with tourism.</P>
    <P>I am informed that passengers using the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route could be further facilitated if they would travel by those sailings for which they hold sailing tickets.  While there are arguments for and against sailing tickets, they should in the normal way provide a reliable indication of the demand for service on peak days and also help appreciably to distribute the traffic.  Unfortunately each year's experience has shown that demands <Col N="269" /> for transportation which could not possibly have been predicted occasionally arise during the peak period.  One substantial reason for this is the high wastage of sailing tickets, which in 1961 was over 20 per cent., and reached 40 per cent. for some sailings.  The position in this respect, regrettably, did not show any marked improvement during the 1962 summer season.</P>
    <P>Improvements at the Mailboat Pier at Dún Laoghaire are continuing. Covered queuing space and improved toilet facilities have been provided, and two cranes which will facilitate the handling of cars have been delivered and are in course of erection. Improvements at Rosslare Harbour include the provision of increased space for customs examination and the marshalling of passengers.  New toilets have been provided and the refreshment rooms have been extensively improved.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the proposals for the introduction by Aer Lingus of an air ferry for cars next year.  I am glad to be able to say that the shipping service for cars is also improving.  The special car cargo-vessel which has been operating on the Dublin-Liverpool route was replaced this year by one with a capacity approximately 50 per cent. greater and taking account of an increase on the Rosslare service also the overall increase in sea capacity was of the order of 10 per cent.  Improvement in this traffic is demonstrated by the fact that the number of cars carried by sea for the first 9 months of 1962, 16,465, represents an increase of approximately 23 per cent. over the corresponding figure of 13,422 for 1961.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to achieve a more flexible and fuller utilisation of car-carrying capacity on the Dún-Laoghaire-Holyhead route when the cranes at present being installed at Dún Laoghaire Pier are in operation.  My Department and Bord Fáilte are pressing continuously for the introduction of a proper car-ferry vessel on the Dún Laoghaire-Holyhead route and I am hopeful that our efforts will eventually succeed.</P>
    <P>The provision of £150,000 for grants for harbour improvement works covers <Col N="270" /> works in progress, or expected to commence shortly.  The principal improvement schemes included are those for Drogheda and Galway, for which grants totalling £175,000 and £340,000 respectively have been authorised.  Tenders for the works at Galway have been received and are being examined.  This head also covers provision for the second of two new passenger liner tenders completed earlier this year by Liffey Dockyard Limited for the Cork Harbour Commissioners, of which the State is meeting half the cost.</P>
    <P>The provision in 1961-62 was for a total expenditure on harbours of £240,000, but expenditure in the period reached only £151,930 because certain works, contrary to expectations, did not commence within the year or did not proceed at the expected rate.</P>
    <P>In addition to the grants for harbour improvement works from the Vote for Transport and Power, there is also a provision under non-voted capital services, comprising a total of £106,000, for works at Dublin and Limerick, for which grants from the National Development Fund were approved.  These commitments were incurred before the winding up of the Fund on 31st March, 1957.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for maintaining and improving harbours rests by statute on the harbour authorities constituted under the Harbours Act, 1946. I should make it quite clear that the grant of State assistance for a harbour is now a very exceptional measure.  If proposed improvement works are of a productive nature, which they certainly should be, it should be possible for the harbour authorities to raise the necessary funds by borrowing, with the assistance of the local authorities or other local interests who stand to benefit from the improvements.  State assistance can be considered at all only for essential and productive schemes, the full cost of which, because of entirely exceptional circumstances, cannot be met locally.  Improvement works aimed at catering for existing trade, which is already being handled satisfactorily at another harbour, and which are not calculated to generate genuine additional trade, cannot be regarded as <Col N="271" /> justifying State assistance.  It would be foolish and wasteful to subsidise one harbour against another in this way.</P>
    <P>The present trend in international trading indicates clearly that more and more commerce is entering and leaving the larger harbours, creating a problem for coastal shipping and for the continued existence of the smaller harbours.  During the past year, I have thought it desirable to impress on port authorities that the old attitude towards harbour administration must now change.  Harbour facilities have to be sold just as air traffic and railway traffic are sold and the smaller harbours cannot be expected to survive unless there is active selling in every single case.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that the grant-in-aid provision under subhead F1 for Bord Fáilte for this year should be £725,000 which represents an increase of £153,500 on the amount allocated last year.  This increase is due to a general increase in the Board's activities as was contemplated under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1961, but one of the bigger items of increase &mdash; approximately £65,000&mdash;arises from the increased rate of investment in hotel development works which has involved Bord Fáilte in greater commitments in respect of interest grants on loans raised by hoteliers and guest-house proprietors for improvement and development works.</P>
    <P>Apart from this grant for general activities, Bord Fáilte also administer a special fund of £1,000,000 for the development of major tourist resorts which was established under Section 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959.  The amount being provided under subhead F2 of the Vote for this purpose this year is £174,000, which is nearly three times the amount actually expended in 1961-62.  Bord Fáilte are entirely responsible for the administration of this scheme which is now passing from the initial planning and consultative stage to a stage where the Board expect actual execution of development work to be speeded up.  This accounts for the fact that this year's provision is almost three times the amount actually spent in 1961-62.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="272" /> The holiday accommodation fund of £500,000 which was also established under the Tourist Traffic Act, 1959, and which is administered by Bord Fáilte is used to finance the schemes of cash grants in respect of additional bedrooms and general improvement works at hotels.  This year's provision under this subhead F3 is £160,000, an increase of approximately £40,000 over last year.  This increase also reflects the increased investment by the hotel industry in hotel development works.</P>
    <P>I have authorised Bord Fáilte to extend the grant schemes to cover the provision or improvement of bedrooms, diningrooms and rest-rooms for hotel staffs and, in the case of hotels outside the main urban centres, facilities for the entertainment and recreation of hotel guests.  Because of the calls on the existing bedroom and improvement grant schemes and the need to provide for the two new schemes, it will be necessary to increase the £500,000 fund established under the 1959 Act and I shall in due course be bringing legislative proposals before the Oireachtas for that purpose.</P>
    <P>A total of 2,850 rooms have been built since the Bord Fáilte grant scheme commenced of which 1,900 are of A class and 950 of B and C classes. Registered guest-house rooms have increased by about 20 per cent. and Bord Fáilte has prepared a list of almost 9,000 rooms in unregistered premises.  Bord Fáilte's targets for top grade accommodation are now in sight of achievement but there is still a deficiency in the number of grade B and C rooms available, particularly in some parts of the country.  I have directed Bord Fáilte to concentrate on the expansion and improvement of middle-grade accommodation and, with a view to giving extra encouragement to the small hotelier, the Board have reduced the lower limit on the cost of improvement works eligible for grant assistance from £2,000 to £500.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is a market for medium-priced accommodation in many centres which at present lack suitable accommodation for family and middle-class holiday-makers and I hope it will be possible for the hotel trade to eliminate this <Col N="273" /> deficiency.  I regard this as the most important problem now confronting the tourist industry, and, as I feel the problem may be too great for private enterprise alone, I have asked Ostlanna Iompair Éireann to go into the possibility of building new grade B hotels in suitable places where there is and is likely to be a continuing inadequacy of such accommodation and where block booking for package tours is required by travel agents.</P>
    <P>Related to this and also of great importance is the provision of a better standard of amenity at holiday resorts, particularly those frequented by families staying in caravans and guesthouses. I believe that it is possible, without spoiling the natural attractions of a resort, to provide entertainment of various kinds, including facilities for young people and entertainment during rainy periods.  This is a problem requiring the attention and effort not only of hotel and guest-house proprietors but of all the business and commercial interests in a resort.</P>
    <P>The total provision for tourism this year is £1,059,000.  While this is the largest sum ever voted for tourist development it is, I believe, a moderate provision when one takes account of the value of the tourist industry to the economy.  The 1961 income of £46.9 million from tourism and travel proved a most important factor in closing the gap in our balance of payments and comparisons recently made by OECD showed this country's net earnings from tourism as greater than those of Denmark and higher than the combined net tourist earnings of Greece, Portugal and Norway.  Of this over £25 million can be attributed to tourists as distinct from Irish people returning home for holidays.</P>
    <P>Reports about the 1962 season are conflicting, not only from different parts of our own country but from all over Europe and figures are not yet available to show the final picture of the year's tourist trade.  Recently, I gave the following provisional statistics in respect of the eight months period January to August: Total inward passenger movements by sea and air down slightly from 919,572 to 914,015&mdash;a drop of 0.4 per cent.; Arrivals at Dublin, <Col N="274" /> Shannon and Cork Airports up by 5 per cent. but sea traffic from Britain down by 5 per cent.; Disembarkations eastbound at Shannon up 18 per cent.; Total transatlantic traffic by sea and air up 16 per cent.; Cross-Border car traffic up 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>During the 12 months since I assumed ministerial responsibility for tourist development policies, I have given very close attention to the problems of the tourist industry and have given directions to Bord Fáilte regarding the lines on which future effort should be directed.  This has covered such matters as the need for greater publicity and promotional activities by regional hotel groups and other tourist interests, and the stimulation of increased tourist effort by local authorities and local development bodies.  I asked them to improve the standard of their main publicity material and to commence the highlighting of scenic roads by the preparation of a scenic road map and later by more imaginative signposting. Apart from the new grant schemes for hotel staff accommodation and guest entertainment facilities, Bord Fáilte have also, at my direction, undertaken a special study of the potential tourist traffic for this country in Europe.  Aer Lingus is co-operating in regard to this study.  I directed them to announce extensions to the Tidy Towns Competition designed to stimulate greater interest in the improvement of the appearance of seaside resorts and the provision of better amenities and they propose to organise a special competition for the coarse angling centres. The study of the needs of the tourist development programme continues to have my constant attention as I consider that the industry has not yet reached its potential in this country.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have also given special attention to the question of the staffing of hotels.  Following a study of the question by a representative working party, the Board formulated proposals for the establishment of a Council for Education, Recruitment and Training in the Hotel and Catering Trade.  The Council will be representative of employers and employees as well as the Department of Education and Bord <Col N="275" /> Fáilte and will have as its main objective the establishment of a system of recruitment and sufficient schemes of training to ensure an adequate supply of qualified workers to meet the needs of the industry.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems to which I am giving particular attention is the very short holiday season.  The majority of our people take their holidays within the late July and early August period and this period also coincides with the time when many of our visitors arrive.  During this short period our hotels, guest houses and holiday resorts are overcrowded and our transport undertakings over-taxed. In the case of the hotel industry, particularly, there is the associated problem of the short employment season and the difficulty of meeting the overheads involved in maintaining or improving the working conditions of staff.  This annual bottleneck, in fact, creates difficulties for all those catering for holidaymakers and is a limiting factor in the full use of holiday facilities.  Outside this peak period accommodation is generally going abegging.  As an illustration, in 1961 out of 4,174,000 bednights taken up in registered accommodation, 2,027,000 were recorded in the July-September quarter.  This figure represents over 48 per cent. of the year's total and was almost double the number of bednights recorded in the April-June quarter.  It is essential for the economic operation of our holiday services that the peak, to which I have referred, should be levelled off to give a greater spread of the demand and to promote a higher utilisation rate.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have, for some time past, been engaged in various activities to extend the holiday season, e.g., the development of special attractions during the early and late periods and the June Holiday Plan.  This Plan met with encouraging success when it was first introduced last year, and this year the overall increase in business in the nine resorts which participated in the June Plan is estimated to have been at least 31 per cent.&mdash;from 59,000 bednights in June, 1961, to 77,000 in June, 1962.  June holidays <Col N="276" /> give good value for money.  Apart from the discounts being offered by hoteliers, car-hire operators and others, records show that the month of June has longer hours of sunshine, lower rainfall and longer daylight hours than either July or August.</P>
    <P>On the average, duration of bright sunshine in June is at least 20 per cent. greater than in either July or August.  The average rainfall in June is lower than in either July or in August, being at least 20 per cent. lower than in July and at least 25 per cent. lower than in August.</P>
    <P>Additional efforts are necessary, however, if we are to overcome this problem of the short holiday season. One of the factors which tend to concentrate the bulk of holiday-making in Ireland into a very short period in July and August is the timing of the August bank holiday both here and in Britain.  One way of easing the situation would be the introduction of a fixed holiday on the last Monday in June in lieu of Whit Monday and the postponement of the August bank holiday until the last Monday in August.  If these changes were possible, the re-timed June bank holiday might, in time, become the main focus of Irish holiday-making and the late August bank holiday would secure the double purpose of attracting some traffic from the beginning of that month and providing a late-season break for people who had taken their main holiday in June or early July.</P>
    <P>An easement of the July-August peak on these lines would have the effect of giving the tourist industry, the industries which serve it and those businesses which derive essential income from the spending of tourists a more even flow of business throughout the holiday season and would also give us more room for holiday-makers. The harassments of crowding would be eased and both Irish people and people from abroad would benefit.</P>
    <P>What I have in mind is a tourist season based on five fairly evenly spaced bank holiday breaks&mdash;the British Whit Monday bank holiday, a late June bank holiday here, the July bank holiday of the Six County <Col N="277" /> area, the British bank holiday at the beginning of August and our own late August bank holiday.  There would be, throughout the season, a structure of demand based on bank holidays, which would enable our holiday services to be more economically maintained and, for both the Irish and foreign holiday-maker, the succession of bank holidays would maintain that sense of liveliness at the different resorts which makes holidays so much more enjoyable.</P>
    <P>There may be difficulties in bringing about these changes but from preliminary discussions which I have had with representatives of employers' and trade union organisations in the matter I have found that, generally, they are favourably disposed to the proposals in principle.</P>
    <P>The changing of the public holidays would constitute only one part of the overall programme for the extension of the season.  Another aspect is the problem of primary school holidays. At present, primary schools do not close until July and thus families with young school-going children are unable to take holidays in June.  In order to extend to such families the opportunity of taking June holidays, should they so desire, the Department of Education, at my request, undertook consultations with the interests concerned about the possibility of advancing the summer closing date in urban schools so as to take in at least one week in June.  The proposal has not won favour with a number of the organisations interested, notably the Irish National Teachers Organisation.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given by the INTO for their opposition is that very few large or moderately large families can afford holidays anyway and that those who take holidays do not occupy hotel accommodation.  They suggest that the numbers who would take early holidays because of a change in the school closing date would be insignificant. I would suggest, however, that a broader view should be taken of the question.  The numbers of our own people who take holidays away from home is increasing every year and this is a trend which every reasonable person will be anxious to help and encourage.  It is true that financial problems limit the holiday opportunities <Col N="278" /> of many families; so also do the problems of travel and accommodation during periods of peak demand. The June holiday plan is an effort to relieve these problems.  Reductions of 15 per cent. are offered in the resorts participating in the Plan.  These reductions cover hotels, guest houses and many unregistered boarding houses offering low-price accommodation and it must be remembered that these reductions apply to rates which are in most cases already below the July and August tariffs.  Persons travelling by CIE can get a 10 per cent. reduction of their bus and rail fares also and car hire firms offer similar reductions.  That there is a demand for this type of special offer is shown by the 31 per cent. increase in the number of bednights in the nine resorts which participated in the 1962 Plan.</P>
    <P>I think it is a great pity that so many families are denied the opportunity of benefiting from this scheme.  There are large numbers of fathers who have a choice as to when they take their annual leave but because of the existing school holiday arrangements they are confined in practice to the months of July and August.  The teachers appear to be concerned that an earlier opening of the schools will mean a return to school during the holiday fortnight which follows the present August bank holiday.  This, however, would not be the case.  A school availing of the eight week vacation period and allowing one week in June would not re-open until after the end of the present August bank holiday fortnight. This would mean that those parents who have a choice of holiday periods could get in at least one full week at the special June rates while those who are tied to the first fortnight in August would still have their families with them during their annual holiday.</P>
    <P>I have heard it suggested that the change would not be beneficial to the health of the children.  I think it must be remembered in this connection that an earlier closing of schools would, in conjunction with the June plan, bring holidays financially within the reach of many families which cannot take holidays away from home at present; this must undoubtedly redound to the benefit of the children, and nobody <Col N="279" /> will deny the benefits to children of the longer days and the drier weather of mid-summer.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into any further detail on this matter but I hope I have said enough to illustrate that the changes which I am proposing would be beneficial to our own people.  There is no question whatsoever of Irish families being forced to take holidays at times not suitable to them in order to leave more room for overseas visitors.  All I am seeking to do is to extend to Irish families a wider choice of holiday period than they have at present.  No doubt, many would still choose to take holidays in July or August but I am convinced that considerable numbers would be delighted to have the opportunity of the better weather and lower tariffs of June.  I hope very sincerely that the teachers will have another look at this question in the light of what I have said and agree to the change at least for an initial period of two or three years.</P>
    <P>The short holiday season here and the difficulties which arise during the peak period constitute one of the major problems now confronting the tourist industry.  I am confident that, with the support of the various interests concerned, the problem can be solved and I would appeal to Deputies to lend their active support in the matter.</P>
    <P>The results of the Electricity Supply Board for the year ended 31st March, 1962, showed a surplus of £572,322 in the Board's net revenue account, which is about the same as the surplus for the previous year.  The continued improvement in the Board's financial position is due mainly to increased revenue, and the fact that, as no new generating plant was commissioned during the year, increased production was achieved without any increase in the capital charges appropriate to generation.</P>
    <P>Electricity generated in the year ended 31st March, 1962, amounted to 2,450 million units or about 8.4 per cent. greater than 1960-61.  Of the 2,005 million units sold, industrial consumption was 684 million units, an increase of 6.6 per cent., while domestic consumption was 822 million units or <Col N="280" /> an increase of 6.8 per cent.  Other classes of consumption, comprising mainly general lighting and heating and also night storage heating, showed increases varying from 7.7 per cent. to 13.3 per cent. on the previous year. During the year the total number of consumers increased by 14,512 to 642,753.  In the first five months of the year 1962-63 consumption showed an increase of 11.5 per cent. over the corresponding period of the previous year.</P>
    <P>Last year, on this occasion, I pointed out that continued increase in demand for electricity tended to make more urgent the necessity for commissioning new generating plant.  During the year ended 31st March, 1961, new generating plant placed in commission comprised two 20 megawatt units at Rhode Station, Offaly, bringing the total installed generating capacity to 723.5 megawatts.  No additions were made to the Board's generating plant during the year ended 31st March, 1962, but steady progress is being made in the plans to add a total of 506 megawatts of new capacity by 1968-69.  The first of two 20 megawatts generating sets at Bellacorick, Mayo, was commissioned in October.</P>
    <P>The increased demand for electricity will also make it necessary for the Board to undertake substantial capital expenditure on the extension and strengthening of the transmission system within the next few years. Before the summer recess, I dealt at length in the course of the debates on the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1962, with rural electrification and the new directives to the Board for its further extension as well as the capital requirements of the Electricity Supply Board and I am sure that Deputies will not wish me to cover that ground again.</P>
    <P>Since the 31st March, 1962, when 754 rural areas out of a total of 792 had been developed, a further 12 areas have been completed.  There appears to be an increase in the numbers now taking supply in the developed areas as a result of the increase in the subsidy to 75 per cent., but in view of the short period since the increased subsidy was introduced no reliable indication of the trend is available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> I trust that there will be propaganda by local organisations encouraging those people in the developed areas who are still unconnected to seek new estimates for the installation of electricity. The number of unconnected houses which could be connected at the standard rates is now about 77,000 and a further 23,000 could have electricity if they pay special service charges which would not be more than half their standard charges.</P>
    <P>I am now seeking financial provision in respect of the £10 grants for bottled gas which are being given to those who can obtain connection to the electricity supply only if they are prepared to pay high special service charges.  No provision for these grants could have been made when the Estimate for my Department was prepared. The extra sum now sought is the nominal figure of £10 as it is now clear that there will be savings on other subheads of the Vote which will be adequate to cover the probable expenditure in the current year.  It has not so far been possible to reach a firm estimate of what this expenditure may be but it is not likely to exceed £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Electricity Supply Board, on behalf of the Government, have been keeping in touch with work being done in various parts of the world in the application of nuclear energy to the production of electric power.  It is clear that, so far, conventional fuels are cheaper than nuclear power for electricity generation.</P>
    <P>The year ended 31st March, 1962, was another unfavourable year for Bord na Móna.  The harvesting season was affected by bad weather so that the production targets were not attained, although production did show an increase on the previous year. Output of sod and milled peat exceeded two million tons as compared with some 1½ million tons the previous year but was almost 15 per cent. short of the target aimed at.  Production, however, was sufficient to meet the demand for electricity production.  Included in the production target for 1961-62 was a figure of half-million tons of milled peat to be held in reserve to augment production in a <Col N="282" /> year of unfavourable weather.  It was not possible to build up this stock pile during the year.  After paying interest and allowing for depreciation the Board showed a loss for the year of about £95,000.  It should be pointed out that in relation to total sales of £4,316,000 this is not a serious deficiency.</P>
    <P>During the 1962 harvesting season, overall production showed a further increase but the bad weather in the latter part of August and in September will prevent the attainment of targets.  Bord na Móna estimate that they will have produced roughly 900,000 tons of sod peat and 1,800,000 tons of milled peat.  Of this production about 560,000 tons of sod peat and 1,000,000 tons of milled peat will be used for the production of electricity. The Board expect to go some distance towards building the stockpile of milled peat against a year of low production.</P>
    <P>During July and the earlier part of August this year, there were representations, both in this House and direct to my Office, in regard to the fact that Bord na Móna were using machines where formerly manual labour was employed.  People who had been expecting a prolonged spell of employment on the Board's machine turf bogs found that they were not required because additional machines were being used for the work they used to do.</P>
    <P>I explained in reply to these representations that the recruitment and employment of workers on their bogs is a matter solely for Bord na Móna and that the Board, which must sell machine turf in competition with other fuels, must take all possible steps to remain competitive in a highly competitive market.  Only by mechanising production as far as possible can the Board keep the price of machine turf at such a level that it will sell against coal.  To illustrate, machine turf in the Dublin area is offered at £6 or £6 2s. a ton.  In general, in terms of calorific value, one ton of coal is equivalent to two tons of machine turf.  The prices for coal in the Dublin area vary from about £8 12s, per ton for Polish to about £12 per ton for British.  American <Col N="283" /> coal is available at a little over £9 a ton.  While close to the bogs Bord na Móna have an advantage, the main centres of fuel consumption over the country in general show the same pattern as Dublin.  To sell at all, therefore, the Board must keep their price at a minimum and must take all possible steps to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>The Turf Development Act, 1961, raised the amount which Bord na Móna may borrow for the performance of its functions from £19m. to £24m.  The capital will be invested in the development of bogs for the production of fuel for electricity, based on directives given to Bord na Móna and the ESB.</P>
    <P>Sales of machine-won turf in 1961-62 were approximately 845,000 tons as against 860,000 tons the previous year, while milled peat sales increased from 800,000 tons in 1960-61 to roughly 1¼ million tons in 1961-62.</P>
    <P>The demand for briquettes continues to increase and is now five times higher than what it was three years ago.  Sales of briquettes in 1961-62 amounted to 180,000 tons compared with 120,000 tons in the previous year. Exports of briquettes to the Six Counties increased from 6,000 tons in 1960-61 to 11,000 tons in 1961-62. The new briquette factory at Croghan. Offaly came into operation in April 1961.  The rated output of the Board's three factories is 250,000 tons per annum but they are capable of producing up to 280,000 tons.  The Board are pursuing a vigorous sales campaign, including the use of television advertising, on the home and export market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost concluded last night when the debate was adjourned.  I should like, however, to refer to remarks made by the Minister in the course of this debate. <Col N="284" /> As I mentioned yesterday, I should like to see CIE paying their way as early as possible.  We all agree that subsidies are bad, if it is possible to avoid them. In the 1958 Transport Act, CIE were given the task of becoming an independent body, so far as State subsidy is concerned, by 1964 but we believe that the present trend indicates clearly that that cannot be done.  If it were done, it would, indeed, be a miracle or it could result only from drastic measures being adopted by the Board such as they are adopting at the present time which may have an adverse effect on our national position later on.</P>
      <P>The position was that for the year 1961 the deficiencies fell to a figure of less than £250,000 but we find that for the following year, 1962, the adverse balance was £1,696,000, which, indeed, is a sharp increase.  As well as that, the Minister informed us that about as much more money was required from the central Exchequer to pay the charges on subventions to CIE over the past years.</P>
      <P>In the Minister's remarks, the emphasis is on the closure of railways. He feels that the only way of making CIE a paying unit is to give them the unlimited powers they hold in closing railways which may be deemed to be uneconomic.  I am satisfied that the Minister's view may be a sincere one and that he feels, with the trend of changes in transport, that it is just as well probably to close a railway completely as to wait for three or four more years, but in any case it is peculiar to find a man with that outlook making the statement he made on 14th November.  I quote from Vol. 197, No. 7, column 1224 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan spoke as though CIE were determined to close the whole rail system.  It would be impossible for me to say what the railway system is likely to be five or ten years from now.  I do know that CIE have asked for large capital grants in order to improve rolling stock and their premises and to modernise the whole system.  We are lending millions to CIE for the improvement of their rail services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> That is a most peculiar statement in the light of the other statements made by the Minister in which he has approved wholeheartedly of the CIE policy of closing rail lines and that it is difficult, as he states himself, to anticipate what the situation in the country will be in five or ten years' time.  Yet with such doubts in his mind, it appears that he has approved of lending millions to CIE to improve their rail services.  Surely that is not a consistent policy?  That part of the Minister's statement, to my mind, needs explanation.  If the Minister has such faith in the railways that in the not too distant future the railway system will be wiped out save for the lines connecting the major towns in the country, why then is public money being utilised at the present time in handing over capital to CIE to improve its system?  I think there is an obligation on the Minister to explain that reasoning of his, because I think there should be no need now for lending millions to CIE, in view of the policy which they are adopting.</P>
    <P>If they are short of rolling stock on some lines at the present moment, will not the rolling stock used on the West Clare line, the West Cork line and on the other lines likely to be closed in the not too distant future be available to supplement the CIE service in any place where they need additional rolling stock?  Indeed, it is very peculiar also to note that even though the Minister approves of the lending of millions to CIE he states that, by 1970, one person in every eight will have a car in this country.  I hope that prophecy will come true because it would be a sign of progress, but if that is the position, it is evident that the need for a public transport service whether by rail or road will diminish seriously.  I am sure the Minister took some time in making this calculation. If, as he feels, private cars will increase by more than 80 per cent. within the next eight years, why should he, as I mentioned, approve of big capital expenditure by CIE now on developing their rail service when he feels that rail service is likely to come to an end in the not too distant future in this country?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not in the course <Col N="286" /> of his lengthy statements make a case against this measure.  I believe that the motive of the sponsors of this measure was to ensure that CIE would not adopt drastic measures that could not be repaired with a view to improving their financial position sufficiently by 1964 to warrant no further subvention from the State.  The Minister did not answer the case made by the sponsors of this Bill.  He mentioned that subsidies were bad and led to inefficiency and that where the State intended to wipe out any adverse balances in public companies it was not the best method of doing business.  At the same time, he said that while there may be an arguable case now or later for amending or modifying this section in some very limited respects, to delete it altogether would be plain silly.  The Minister clearly does not believe that CIE will be able to pay their way before 31st March, 1964.  This section embodied in the Act is only wishful thinking.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention again the capital expenditure approved for CIE at present.  Will the loan charges on that expenditure not be charged against CIE in the ensuing years, or will those loan charges be added to any adverse balance they may have on their operations for that year?  It seems to me that, instead of the adverse trend moving downwards, it is likely it may move in the other direction.  CIE's main outlet for improving their revenue, increased charges, will soon defeat its own ends. Transport charges by CIE are exceptionally high.  If they were to be increased any further, it would mean a loss of business to CIE.</P>
    <P>I should like to elaborate on that. The single fare by road transport from my own town of Schull to Cork city is 17s. odd and about 35/- return.  This is a rather steep charge.  If three or four people turn up at the bus stop in Schull or Ballydehob and find they all intend to go to Cork city for the day, they may decide it is much cheaper to go along to a hackney owner and hire him to take them to Cork and back rather than avail of the CIE service. That is a big difficulty facing CIE service. present.  It is difficult for them to stand <Col N="287" /> up to that type of competition, which arises because of the sharp increases they have made in their road transport charges in recent times.</P>
    <P>The people accepted the subsidisation of CIE because they felt CIE were providing a regular service in districts which could not be described as economic.  Undoubtedly, there were a number of areas serviced by the CIE road and rail system which would not be economic propositions.  Naturally, the people were inclined to subsidise CIE so long as they declared some of the services they were providing for the public were uneconomic.  Now, however, they have turned over a new leaf.  They state they are going to manage their business on economic lines and will wipe out all uneconomic business in future.  Wherever a rail system is uneconomic&mdash;and, I understand, wherever a road system is uneconomic&mdash;they will delete it from their list.</P>
    <P>If that is the case, the further question arises as to why CIE should enjoy the monopoly of transport they hold at present.  The Minister states that this monopoly is of no great advantage to them.  He states there are large numbers of public vehicles, merchandise plate vehicles and privately-owned vehicles, with all of which CIE have to compete.  Despite the Minister's assertion, CIE have a certain monopoly, which they got from this House at a time when they were providing a national service.  It appears CIE are no longer obliged to provide a national service but only to provide an economic service in areas where they can produce a favourable balance sheet.</P>
    <P>Within the past 12 or 18 months, the Board of CIE have had to retract statements they made last year to the effect that once the three uneconomic lines&mdash;West Cork, Waterford and West Clare&mdash;were closed, no further rail closures would take place before 31st March, 1964.  The people who made such statements did not display much keenness or foresight, because they had to retract them within 12 months and say it was necessary, if they were to achieve the target set them by the Transport Act of 1958, to examine the <Col N="288" /> position of further railways with a view to closing them down.</P>
    <P>Would not the best solution to this problem be a new Transport Bill, in view of the changes that have taken place in the past few years and the rapid changes that are taking place at present?  Then the House would have an opportunity of examining the advisability of the Minister's policy in lending millions to develop CIE rail services and in continuing the monopoly CIE hold.</P>
    <P>On this question of monopoly, every citizen who does not own a vehicle himself must have his goods carried for him by CIE or by the holder of a merchandise plate.  They are the two sections at present enjoying privileged treatment under the Transport Act of 1934.  We have had many changes since that Act was enacted 28 years ago.  There is a completely different position now.  There has been talk of economic methods of doing business. If I, as a private citizen, have goods to be carried to the market, to the fair or to the town, I should be allowed to decide the best and most economic method of transporting them.  It is well known that, were it not for the restriction on transport here, goods from the farming community or any other section could be hauled at much cheaper rates than those of CIE or indeed those of the holders of merchandise plates.</P>
    <P>If uneconomic districts will not get any preferential treatment in future, why then should monopolies continue? There is no case any longer for their continuance.  Everybody knows that the merchandise plate, or plated lorry system, has been grossly abused.  Those who had these plates in 1934 were entitled to preference, but it is a well-known fact now that some of these fortunate people are not now carrying on any transport business at all; they are remaining in their homes and enjoying an income of £1 daily for lending their plates to others in order to measure up to the requirements of that Act.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether that practice is strictly illegal, but I certainly think it is a doubtful practice. Throughout the length and breadth <Col N="289" /> of the country at the moment, we have these favoured people under the 1934 Act making good money from lending plates at £1 per day.  So far as I know, the rate is more or less standard and, therefore, the holder of a merchandise plate enjoys a very special preference indeed.  He enjoys a special type of treatment because the market value of his plate is £1 per day.  I do not know if we should continue that type of treatment for such a person much longer.  He has had the plate now for 28 years, right since the passing of the 1934 Act; he has been amply compensated and I think he should now be put on a par with every other citizen who might like to engage in the transport business.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister now to give serious consideration and thought to this matter.  I am asking the Minister and his Government to give serious thought to the introduction of a new Transport Bill and the implementation of provisions to cover our existing transport difficulties and solve our existing transport problems&mdash;road transport, rail transport, the monopolisation of transport by CIE and certain privileged citizens, the removal of certain illegalities that are known to exist in transport as it obtains at the moment, and the giving to private enterprise of the same opportunities to get into the transport business as CIE now hold.</P>
    <P>I know that CIE must retain the railways because they cannot be managed by private enterprise.  CIE have made it clear that they will maintain the economic lines but will have nothing more to do with the uneconomic lines.  That is their business, but why should they have a monopoly of the road transport service?  Why should they have a monopoly of the road freight service throughout the country? CIE are making a case for dismantling themselves.  If they cannot do business economically, without the help of State subventions and without making drastic changes, and if they cannot cater for the lean areas as well as the fat ones, then the preferential treatment they receive should be removed. I have not the slightest doubt that, if that were done, transport would not suffer to any great extent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> I admit that CIE are providing regular services in all areas, and that is an advantage.  At the same time, I feel that equally good services would be given in such districts if CIE were never operating.  It is peculiar that such services are, in fact, being given at a rate in the neighbourhood of 50 per cent. of CIE charges, so that, if we are making the transport business an economic proposition for CIE and for everybody, it possibly would be a good idea to do away with monopolies. It would also be a good idea to give me, or anyone else, who requires the service of some person engaged in the transport business the opportunity of getting the man who will give that service at the most economic figure possible.  Under the existing law, it is not possible to do that.  Every private lorry owner is hounded by the police whenever he appears with a few pigs, a few cows, or some other type of goods in his vehicle.  The law does not empower him to carry such goods for reward and that kind of traffic is, as I have said, left to CIE and those people who have enjoyed preferential treatment since 1934.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask that the House should consider very carefully the implications of the Minister's statement and the inconsistencies contained in his statement.  On the one hand, he tells us there is not much of a future for the rail system, that it will possibly be closed down by 1970 and, on the other hand, he tells us that they are lending money to CIE for development. The Labour Party decided to support this measure because, having given it close attention and consideration, we felt that it was impossible for CIE to make ends meet before 1964. We also discount the statement made by the Minister that, if there is no fixed date for CIE to become an economically paying proposition, that would be likely to lead to inefficiency. I believe CIE is inefficient already.  I am surprised to hear the Minister make such a statement because if, despite all the subventions CIE receive from the State and from the public purse, inefficiency exists, that is the responsibility of the Minister, of the Government and of the Board of CIE.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> It is the Government and the Minister who nominated the Board.  If the Board are guilty of inefficiencies in the discharge of their duties, it is the Minister's responsibility to report such inefficiencies to the Government and change the personnel of the Board. Possibly it would not be a bad day's work if the personnel of the Board were changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has served a useful purpose in getting discussion on some very vague aspects of public transport in the Republic.  From that point of view, I think it has been well justified, though it is regrettable that the Minister's contribution, covering a 17-page speech, was devoted largely to muddled thinking, evasiveness and a mulish refusal to face the position as it is in our transport services and face the realities of our transport services as they are.  He made the remarkable and quite unsustainable charge that we had not read the speech made by Deputy Lemass as Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1958, that we had ignored the speech and ignored the fact that it had been made in the context of the Beddy Report.  That was a very extraordinary statement because the Minister was here in the House when I read out for him the speech made by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I think the speech is worth rereading.  I shall read exactly the same passages.  The reference is column 1598 of volume 167 of the Official Report.  He said:</P>
      <P>I know that at the present time there are few railway systems in the world which are not losing money and that in expecting the Board of CIE to achieve solvency it may be said that we are asking them to do something that other railway executives are not able to do even under more favourable circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then he went on to say that that may be true and that we must not allow ourselves to be concerned with the experiences of people in other societies. Later on, he said that we must have evidence that the system is being worked in an economical and efficient <Col N="292" /> manner and that the prospect of recurring losses will be reduced.  At column 1599, he said that it was possible that the subvention of £1,000,000 a year would not be sufficient to close the gap between receipts and outlay in 1959 and 1960 and that CIE might have to resort to temporary borrowing to tide them over these years and went on:</P>
    <P>I would hope, however, that this fixed subvention of £1,000,000 a year for five years will be more than sufficient in the latter years and that CIE will be able to pay off any temporary borrowing incurred in the earlier stages and have something left to carry on with, if complete solvency has not been finally reached by 1964.</P>
    <P>These annual payments must cover all the needs of CIE including payment of interest on their stocks, all outlay other than expenditure on capital account.  The dieselisation of the undertaking is, as the House knows, now nearly completed and it is not anticipated that any further capital expenditure will be required during that period.</P>
    <P>That statement is particularly important and I said so at the time because it does represent as clearly as it is possible to represent or demonstrate to the House, that this sense of certainty, this aura of infallibility with which the Taoiseach, then the Minister for Industry and Commerce, surrounds himself is completely unmerited.  He has been shown, out of his own mouth, to be a person who makes wildly unreliable assumptions and equally wild unreliable promises.  It is now four years afterwards and there is one year left to 1964 and the Company is making one of its highest losses, £1.7 million, in addition to the £1,000,000 subsidy. We have, on the other hand, the fact that he was quite wrong when he said the dieselisation programme was complete and no further capital outlay would be required.  Last July, we voted £6,000,000 to pay General Motors for a number of diesel electric locomotives which is a further instalment of capital outlay which he did not foresee at the time.  I am not saying that nobody can be wrong but the Taoiseach seeks to give the impression <Col N="293" /> that he is never wrong and that what he says must be accepted.</P>
    <P>The present Minister dealing with his critics has adopted an old stratagem, and a particularly silly and childish one, that when one has not got an argument, one simply abuses one's opponent.  The abuse he has levelled at members&mdash;he probably had Deputy T. Lynch in mind&mdash;was that the people concerned about the railways were concerned as railway hysterics because they were concerned about the reduction in the extent of the railway services.  As Deputy O'Connor, one of the Minister's colleagues, said, it is very likely if we go on at this rate, we will end up with the railways at Kingsbridge, a gradual retraction so that there will be no railways left.  But Deputy Lynch and these other Deputies are not the only admirers of the railway services.  I wonder could anybody believe who made this statement?</P>
    <P>I do not believe that railways are obsolete.  I want to state a personal conviction in this matter.  I believe that, as a technical device for the transportation of traffic, the railways are superior to road transport for most classes of traffic and certainly when the problems of peak requirements are taken into account.  I expressed the doubt here in November whether it would be physically possible to handle our grain harvest, our sugar beet harvest, the pilgrimage traffic that develops during the year and the other special traffics in respect of goods or passengers that arise from time to time, without railways.  It would be most detrimental to the development of our tourist trade if it became known abroad that no railway services were available in Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is at column 1681, Vol. 167 of the Official Reports and it was the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, who made the statement.  I think if anybody else had said that, he would have been charged by the present Minister for Transport and Power with being a railway hysteric.</P>

      <P>I do not regard him as a railway hysteric for having said that.  It is a realistic statement of the facts and I think it is cheap and petty for a Minister, when he finds himself in a position such as the Minister finds himself in, to attack the sanity, as in this case, of the individual.  He has referred us back to the then Minister for Industry and Commerce and he is quite right.  As everybody knows, there are in the theatre what are known as play-doctors and in the newspaper world, there are newspaper doctors and in the transport world, it could be said there are transport doctors and specialists and the Taoiseach can claim to be such a person.  I think it was Deputy Burke who was the first to pay him this doubtful compliment when he said, &ldquo;nobody in Ireland has more experience than you have&rdquo;&mdash;that was Deputy Lemass&mdash;&ldquo;in dealing with matters of transport&rdquo;.  I think the Taoiseach would readily accept that as a statement of fact.</P>

    <P>The position is that he has been called in on a number of occasions to try to diagnose the malady and provide the treatment, but it can be honestly said, whether it was Milne, or Beddy, or Lemass, or Andrews, going back to the 1920s or the 1930s and the whole way through, that there was a constant bungling and mismanagement in relation to the whole question of transport.  Various reasons have been given for its failure but even Dr. Beddy has said that for 40 years there has been a dreary tale of losses.  That was a confession of the fact.  The position is that this specialist, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Lemass, was called in in 1958 and he devised this new 1958 Act which <Col N="295" /> was to be the Transport Act to end all Transport Acts.  In fact, of course, it seems to me it has tried to amalgamate the worst of at least three different kinds of proposal.  It is one of the appalling mythical monsters, the three-headed hydra: it is neither private enterprise controlled, nor public enterprise controlled, nor will they accept the question of subsidies. He attempted to ignore the economic losses and to take the attitude of some character who said in Alice in Wonderland: &ldquo;If I say a thing, then that is so.&rdquo;  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce said: &ldquo;If we put this hotch-potch together, we will make it into a Transport Act&rdquo; but he was wrong in regard to the capital outlay, the dieselisation programme and the company breaking even by 1964.  He was wrong on every point as we have quite clearly demonstrated.</P>
    <P>The number of apologia submitted by the Minister is indicative of the superficial and blind thinking that went into his brief.  He suggested that we have a difficult problem in Ireland because of the sparsity of our population. By that, he left himself wide open.  That is the result of the failure of our politicians to face up to the many problems of the world to-day.  Whose responsibility is it that a country which supported three or four million people not so very long ago should now have the large proportion of its population concentrated in one or two large centres?  This problem is caused by the failure of the politicians, just as they have failed to deal with agriculture, industry, the provision of employment and the provision of adequate health services. There is always that consistent adherence on their part to conservative policies, no matter what the consequence.</P>
    <P>One of the most astonishing of the Minister's statements on this matter was contained in the earlier part of his speech when he said that this section, which this Bill now proposes to delete, is not mandatory.  How can one hope to achieve any particular end when one says that the achievement of that end is not really mandatory? What is the use of putting a <Col N="296" /> section into a Bill and then saying that one does not expect it to be binding in law?  On any occasion on which I have seen or read of any negotiations between the trade unions and CIE, every report has contained a reference to this section, that the directors of CIE must break even, that they are in a very difficult position and that much as they would like to increase the wages of the workers, reduce the working hours, give better schedules and better timetables to the travelling public, they cannot do it because of the imposition on them by the Dáil of the obligation to break even by 1964.</P>
    <P>This has been used since 1958 as the big stick to justify the repressive policies of CIE over the years, as a justification to the public and to the trade union movement, and in newspaper headlines and editorials, that they have been ordered to break even by 1964, that the deadline is 1964 and that they must meet it.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that such a provision was there before, that there was such a provision in the 1948 Act.  The provision in the 1948 Act was to secure that revenue would not be less than that sufficient to meet the charges properly chargeable to revenue.  The then Minister for Industry and Commerce discarded that provision in the 1958 Act because he wanted to put in quite a different proposition, that is, that they break even by 1964.  If that provision is not mandatory, why should it be put in?  If the Board of CIE have a discretion in this matter, why should this section, which we seek to have taken out, be put into the Bill at all?  Why try to shelter behind it?  It appears now that it is completely unimportant and irrelevant.  That is the only meaning that can be taken from the Minister's suggestion, that this is not mandatory, that it has no force in law and that it can be ignored.  Is that not all we are asking the Minister to do in this amending Bill?</P>
    <P>Has the Minister not made the best case for accepting our Bill?  He has spoken for days trying to defend a section which he says has no meaning, no binding power at all, which carries no weight and is not worth the paper <Col N="297" /> on which it is written.  Why has he attempted to defend its inclusion in the Act?  Surely that is absurd.  There is only one important consequence which must arise out of it, that is, that the trade unions may now ignore that section.  It is no longer a binding force and they can all ignore it.  The suggestion now is that it was put into the Act as an <i>in terrorem</i> provision, as a sort of bogyman for the Chairman of CIE and the Board of that body, and that the Oireachtas were not really insisting on the financial results mentioned in the section when they inserted it.</P>
    <P>The Minister protested against the legitimate criticism which we levelled at Dr. Andrews' administration of the transport service but I think that very little more insulting could be said to a man than to tell him that a particular clause was put into an Act in order to ensure that he should achieve a particular end and then to tell him that that clause had no meaning.  Does Dr. Andrews know that this section has no meaning, that it has no power in law, that it is not binding?  Can he ignore it?  Can we ignore it or is that why we are paying £1.7 million to CIE this year?  Was this section inserted so that the Chairman of CIE could use it as a device to harry the trade union movement, quoting the Oireachtas, and saying it is because these people have put these impossible conditions upon them?  He shares this secret with the Minister for Transport and Power that he can snap his fingers, that it has no validity at all.  Is that the position, that Dr. Andrews&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the Minister's favourite gambits is to quote somewhere else and to tell us that things are not too good in Milan or Madrid, Hong Kong or Singapore, and to try to engender some sympathy in the minds of the Irish public because this <Col N="298" /> is so.  In other circumstances, we might be concerned with that, but in the present context we are concerned with the position in Ireland.  He did attempt, in order to try to justify the position in CIE, to suggest that the fares in Dublin could be compared favourably with those in provincial cities in Great Britain.  Of course that again is not a valid comparison because in Britain, even if the fares are comparable, there are many other advantages in the life of a person which we do not have here.  Consequently when a person pays a lot of money for a fare for his child to go to school there, there are many other things on which they do not have to spend money, such as health services, education services and so on.</P>
      <P>That is why I deprecate these comparisons with other countries.  They are, in effect, useless.  There was the comparison in regard to the sparseness of population here in Ireland and that was given as the reason why we are losing money on our transport services. As I said, the fault is our own, but again it shows the futility of comparisons. Great Britain is a highly industrialised country, over congested, and yet its transport services are losing money, so in no way could that be taken as a defence for the failure of CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister shared the confusion of a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Noel Lemass, on the whole question of the purpose and function of public services, including public transport services.  It is astonishing that the Minister, who is in a position of absolute control over a public service, should be so confused as he appears to be in relation to the position. The Minister says there are many socialists in Europe who believe that State companies should pay and that it is extremely bad for them not to pay.  Deputy Lemass said something to the effect that they should show a profit.  I wish to quote from a speech by Dr. Andrews which draws attention to his misconception&mdash;and I do not think I am misrepresenting him&mdash; in regard to the purpose of public transport.  I quote from <i>&ldquo;The Role of State Sponsored Bodies</i> by Mr. Lemass, with comments by Dr. <Col N="299" /> Andrews.&rdquo;  With all the pseudo expertise of the politically illiterate man, he says in page 15 of this document in regard to the objectives and aims of the public company as compared with those of private enterprise:</P>
    <P>I think a classical profit and loss account is one of the best yardsticks of the efficiency of a company.</P>
    <P>I think that all adds up to the fact that there is considerable confusion in the Minister's mind and in the Chairman's mind as to the proper function of a public transport corporation.  The Minister is wrong to suggest that CIE is in any way a socialist company or a State company.  It is certainly a public controlled company.  It possibly could be said to be publicly owned in so far as we pay for it in subsidies and otherwise but we do not control it in any way.  It is merely an example of State capitalism that is frequently seen in Russia.  For that reason it is undesirable because it is State capitalism rather than a truly socialist enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Minister is quite wrong in his suggestion that any substantial body of socialist opinion believes that the criterion of efficiency in a public company is that it should pay its way. There are various authorities for that and I should like to quote some of them for the Minister's edification. There is a book by Mr. W.A. Robeson called <i>Nationalised Industry and Public Ownership.</i> He says in page 416:</P>
    <P>Since profitability is not a primary aim of nationalised industry, it cannot be regarded as a valid test to measure the efficiency of public enterprise.</P>
    <P>He goes on:</P>
    <P>Where a monopoly exists annual surpluses would tell little of their efficiency in view of their monopoly position.</P>
    <P>Lord Latham, a former Chairman of London Transport, insisted that:</P>
    <P>Profitability is not a reliable test of efficiency in a nationalised industry.  If circumstances are favourable, satisfactory profits mask <Col N="300" /> inefficiency, while in unfavourable circumstances, a proper degree of efficiency may be achieved despite absence of profits.</P>
    <P>That is contrary to what Dr. Andrews says:&mdash;&ldquo;I think a classical profit and loss account is one of the best yardsticks of the efficiency of a company.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wish to quote Professor Herbert A. Simon.  These are all relatively right-wing authorities, I need hardly say.  I do not think any others would greatly impress the Minister.  Professor Simon in a book called <i>Administrative Behaviour,</i> 2nd Edition, says at page 173:</P>
    <P>The concept of efficiency must be given a much broader meaning than that accorded to it in profit-making concerns if it is to be applied to undertakings in which factors are involved which cannot be measured in money terms.</P>
    <P>Again, Lord Latham says:</P>
    <P>Economy and efficiency are synonymous.  In a public transport undertaking, for example, there must be unremunerative services to outlying areas or in off-peak periods and these can only be supported by heavy traffic in peak hours.  The claims of economy must be balanced constructively against the demands of efficiency. </P>
    <P>Again, in another book called <i>Management and Accountability in the Nationalised Industries,</i> at pages 44 and 45 D. N. Chester says:</P>
    <P>The absence of loss in the trading operations of a public corporation is not truly comparable as an index of efficiency to the size of the dividend made by a joint stock company. Among the criticisms which can be levelled at the validity of the analogy are that the balanced accounts may reflect high prices made possible for monopolistic exploitations rather than efficiency... that social needs rather than economic consideration should determine the policies of public corporations.</P>
    <P>William Robeson went on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The National Coal Board could have made a profit of £300,000,000 in the first decade of its existence by exploiting its monopolostic position for services or commodities for which the demand is relatively in-elastic.</P>
    <P>Of course it is quite absurd for Dr. Andrews to say that the profit and loss account is one of the best yardsticks of the efficiency of a company. He is a very lucky man that we are not using that yardstick too strictly on him in his own concern.  In a State company which is either a public utility company or a company which is concerned only with the social needs of society, and it could be a productive type of company, it would be quite a different thing altogether and profit would be of importance.  In the ordinary public utility company, one is primarily concerned with getting an efficient service.  In a transport service, you want a fast, comfortable service with reasonable fares.  If there is a surplus&mdash;and you may make a surplus &mdash;there is no difficulty whatsoever in disposing of it.</P>
    <P>The difficulty we are in is that the service we are discussing is neither one thing nor the other.  I should like to quote one other authority.  It is conceivable that a number of Deputies may not like the fact that these are mostly British authorities, but they are people who have considerable experience of this problem, and because of that they are perfectly legitimate quotations for our purposes tonight.  One of our own company directors, Mr. Paddy Lynch, in a book called <i>Planning for Economic Development</i>, a <i>Tuairim</i> pamphlet, at page 11 talks about the question of profit as an incomplete test.  He says:</P>
    <P>It is all too easy for public enterprise to secure undeservedly a bad reputation when it is compelled to undertake the salvaging of an industry in which private enterprise has failed or in which the possibilities of productive development are remote.  If public enterprise is to be fairly tested the experiment must take place in circumstances that permit of economically rewarding <Col N="302" /> expansion.  The criteria by which its performance is to be tested cannot be borrowed from private enterprise, competitive or otherwise. </P>
    <P>There is no doubt that whatever our opinions may be, the whole history of the attempted control, by piecemeal methods, of public transport in Ireland over the years bears out Mr. Lynch in his assertions and completely refutes and contradicts the statement made by Dr. Andrews in his contribution.  It is very serious and dangerous that a man with his completely mistaken views should be allowed to do so much damage to our public services.  If we are to look at the yardstick of profitability in relation to CIE, all anyone can say is that they are a disastrous failure.  Looking at that simple, crude yardstick, which is completely unacceptable to me, they are a failure. No one expects them to pay their way by 1964.  All we are concerned with really is the size the debt will be.  Will it be £2,000,000 or will it be £1.7 million, or what size will it be?</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about the position in relation to nationalisation and rejected it.  Our difficulty is that the Minister and the Government will not take either pure private enterprise or pure nationalisation or draw a line through the middle and accept the consequence that we must subsidise.  They will not take either of those alternatives and they are the main alternatives facing us.  We can assume that private enterprise will not try again. GNR or GSR clearly will not try again.  I believe the Minister must face the question of accepting full responsibility for public transport, or carry out, as he is carrying out at the moment, the truncated service which CIE operate, and make provision for a subsidy at the end of each year. That is absolutely inevitable and I do not think there can be any denying it.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that the economy must determine the present situation.  CIE are operating in an impossible position.  The 1964 deadline is an impossible provision.  The Minister has conceded that himself, and I think he made possibly the best case that we have heard for this Bill, that the section has no validity and consequently <Col N="303" /> should be amended.  CIE are operating under a disability imposed by the Minister and the Government and they are competing against private transport.</P>
    <P>There are a number of private transport concerns which, I suppose, for conditions of service, pension rights, security of employment, conditions of maintenance of vehicles, hours of work, and so on, compare favourably with CIE conditions of work, whatever one may say about the conditions of work in CIE.  At any rate, they are a base line from which one can operate.  There is a minority of private hauliers who can guarantee their employees largely the same conditions as CIE, people like Guinness and Roadstone, but I do not know them well enough to be sure. I presume there are reasonable conditions of employment in these concerns. In the vast majority of companies, the conditions of employment for the men on transport services are far inferior to those which obtain in CIE.</P>
    <P>That is a costly overhead.  CIE must maintain, because they are a form of State company, a certain standard in the treatment of their employees and because of that, they carry this overhead. Because of the fact that private enterprise lorries can compete with any kind of lorry that can get by the traffic inspections, a company does not need to spend much money on maintenance. There is no question of security of employment, very rarely a question of pension rights, protective clothing, a helper on the lorry and so on.  That is a very considerable disability against which CIE have to operate.  It is a disability of the Minister's creation and it is one which only the Minister can remove.  It is there.  It is one aspect of the economic considerations which CIE have to bear in mind when they are competing for business.</P>
    <P>Again, CIE face the problem that the private haulier can pick and choose his business.  Broadly speaking, he can charge anything he wants, if he does not want a particular job.  If, in his opinion, it is uneconomic, he quotes an impossible figure.  He does not have to take that job.  CIE have to take it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> We are in the position that CIE are competing against a colossal preponderance of private haulage.  We worked the ratio out at one to 80.  There is nearly anything up to one hundred times as many private lorries on the road as there are CIE lorries.  There is this colossal competition against which this relatively tiny transport undertaking have to try to operate. They cannot do it unless the Minister takes one or two decisions&mdash;unless he is going to take into public ownership the whole of the transport service; I do not mean the grocers' delivery vans but lorries over a certain tonnage and so on, and make more stringent the conditions for private haulage&mdash;in fact, take into public ownership the greater part of the haulage of the country.  He says he believes in private enterprise. He allows private enterprise to operate and CIE to operate at a disadvantage. We must pay a subsidy in order to make it possible for CIE to keep going at all.</P>
    <P>It is typical of the empiricism of Deputy Lemass as Minister and of the present Minister and of their approach to every problem&mdash;a sort of make-shift decision hoping it will be effective but a refusal to face the fact that their solutions have failed because they conflicted with the economic laws.  It is impossible in a society such as ours to give a public service the rump of the transport service and expect it to survive.  The whole history of transport has shown that it is impossible to operate in that way.</P>
    <P>Again, we have had suggestions made by very conservative people in CIE over the years.  Again and again, we had recommendations from the boards of CIE asking that some sort of restriction should be placed on private haulage.  The CIE report of 1951 advocated restriction on private transport as the only practical alternative to the continued subsidisation of public transport.  Here we are ten years later and the Minister will not accept that.  In 1952, proposals were made by CIE for drastic reductions on the operations of private freight vehicles.  Again, the annual report for 1952 asked for a limit on the operation of all vehicles over two tons unladen of 20 miles.  In another annual <Col N="305" /> report in March, 1954, they advocated: &ldquo;Whatever steps may be necessary should be taken to transfer to the Board's rail services the heavy long distance loads at present carried by road.&rdquo;  Again in 1956 the report advocated: &ldquo;Economies by change over to diesels.&rdquo;  These were the extremely conservative recommendations of directors and Board members of CIE.  They would not have been there otherwise.  They went on to say:</P>
    <P>... and otherwise, will not, of themselves, be sufficient to eliminate losses in the undertaking.</P>
    <P>If the undertaking is to pay its way, steps must be taken to divert to the Board's rail services all the traffic&mdash;particularly the heavy long-distance traffic&mdash;which these rail services can carry.</P>
    <P>In another part of the same report, it was said:</P>
    <P>CIE informed us that restriction on private transport could result in a reduction in rail charges.</P>
    <P>That is a very important consideration from the Minister's point of view but from the point of view of the public, it is even more important.  Of course, that was rejected.  The Minister and his predecessors, as I say, were begged and pleaded with by these people who should have some knowledge of the problem of transport.  They simply could not continue to operate unless they got a subsidy or got the whole transport undertaking in the country. Clearly, the Minister must face that decision.  It is one or the other.  It is either public ownership of the whole concern and acceptance of the repercussions or else the present situation of continued losses.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been particularly inane in his references to the whole question of subsidy.  He is very abstruse in his reasoning on the undesirability of the maintenance of subsidies where these subsidies need to be paid over a number of years.  He says they should only be for certain reasons and in very special circumstances. Nobody in his senses, no politician in his senses, would advocate the payment of subsidies merely because he believes that subsidies are a good thing, merely because he has a doctrinaire <Col N="306" /> belief in the idea of subsidies or because there is not a real need for them.</P>
    <P>We all know quite well that there is a great need for money for education, health, old people, better schools, housing and so on.  We all know that. We are not making suggestions in relation to subsidies just for the fun of the thing.  We are saying it is part of an economic law which stares one in the face.  You cannot get around it. They tried to do that in the past but always they have come back to us.  In his report, Dr. Beddy refers to the dreary tale of loss.  It is a reality.  It is a fact that must be faced and it has to go on being faced by the Minister or by whoever is in charge as an inevitable part of the handling of a public transport service in this and most other countries.  The subsidy idea is one of the oldest political ideas since Governments attempted to try to control society in a civilised way.  It is conservative.  It was a liberal idea in the beginning.  There is nothing left-wing about subsidies.  They are part and parcel of the whole fiscal set-up of our society and have been since the State was established.</P>
    <P>I suppose one of the crudest forms of subsidy&mdash;it is certainly a subsidy&mdash; is the acceptance of a tariff system.  The protection of industry costs us money in one way or another.  The fact that we should protect our industries is in effect, a subsidy.  That is a tariff policy which has been accepted for very many years.  We accept the subsidisation of our air transport services.  We have to do it and have accepted that for a long time.  I am quite sure if Aer Lingus start making an operating loss, the Minister will not come in and suggest we should close it down.  The position in regard to the farmers is that we subsidise certain fertilisers to stabilise prices and it can be said that we subsidise in part the wheat crop. There are certainly subsidies in relation to butter.  Is it the suggestion that unless we withhold from CIE this idea of a subsidy, the CIE workers will not work quite so hard?</P>
    <P>The Minister said it had no meaning at all, that we were to take no notice of it.  Is the Minister suggesting that the CIE workers and Dr. Andrews&mdash;<Col N="307" /> and nobody can say I am a great admirer of his&mdash;have worked better by virtue of the fact that this whip is held over them?  It is in existence but is not binding on them at all.  Is there any sense therefore in maintaining this illusory goad for these stupid people who would not work unless it were there?  That is the implication in the Minister's statement.  Why did the Minister not devise some such goad in relation to the other subsidies I have mentioned?  Why have they been quite ready to give them subsidies to help them sell their produce on other markets and have exonerated them from this insulting position imposed on the CIE workers?</P>
    <P>We believe a subsidy is the best way of helping industry and the social needs created by running an efficient public transport service.  The Minister's approach to the matter is to tell the travelling public to pay the subsidy.  He asked how would the public like it if the Minister came in here and asked for increased taxation to the extent of £2 million.  It is the public who are paying anyway, except it is a tiny handful of the public who are paying in increased fares.  That is demonstrated in the Minister's figures.  All we want is that the burden of the subsidy should be spread over a much greater number of people so that there will be a more socially just division of the subsidy.</P>
    <P>What would happen if the Minister for Agriculture came in here and said he intended to give a subsidy to the farmers for butter amounting to £2 million and proposed to get it from a special tax imposed on dairy farmers and on the farming community generally? That would be impossible to suggest.  It would be politically mad to do so.  That is part of the Minister's empirical approach to this matter.  He knows the travelling public are not organised and he thinks he can do what he likes with them.</P>

      <P>Are you going to take the attitude in relation to wheat growing that if you cannot make a go of this without a subsidy, there will have to be an end to tillage?  That is the logical conclusion of the Minister's approach to these matters.  If you carry it through to its logical conclusion, we suggest you would find yourself faced with these absurd dilemmas.  Because you are refusing to face these dilemmas in relation to public transport, you are depriving the community of a most important and valuable asset, and you are contributing to the rapid and wholesale depopulation of rural Ireland.  I am not saying that is a preponderating factor, but it is one of the factors which makes it difficult for anybody to go on living in rural Ireland&mdash;the fact of not having access to nearby surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister tried to make some point about county councillors.  He said that if they were brought up to a branch line before it was closed down and faced with the cost of putting it there, they would be horrified at the thought of providing it.  That is an absurd suggestion by the Minister.  We are concerned with the maintenance of these branch lines; there is no question of creating new ones.  We are facing the reality that we have these things as a capital asset from other generations. The suggestion is completely absurd. It is as if the Minister were to say that buses were a silly form of transport and it was ridiculous to have a colossal place like Arus Mhic Dhiarmada in order to maintain them, so we should get rid of them and use helicopters. The branch lines are there as a capital asset.  It is possible for them to be operated in an efficient way, to be brought up to date and brought into the general transport service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes the extraordinary <Col N="309" /> suggestion that a subsidy is unreasonable and can be justified only in very special circumstances. We make the case that there are very special circumstances obtaining in a community such as ours, faced with continuing emigration and rural depopulation.  We think the necessity of trying to restrict this is as good a justification as it is possible to have.  He suggested the direct and indirect taxation necessary in order to find this money would be a burden of £2,800,000 on under three million people.  What I said in relation to rural depopulation also applies here. We have only 2,800,000 people in the country because at least one million have been hunted out in the past 40 years by these same dogmatic ideas and conservative social and economic policies.  Those one million people would have created a population of five or six million, who would have had no difficulty in providing the money with which to subsidise the public transport service.  No matter what Minister is sitting there, whether it is Transport and Power, Industry and Commerce or Education, the chickens always come home to roost&mdash; your own failures over the past 40 years and your refusal to face facts as a result of those failures.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested the question of subsidy is something obscene or something unclean.</P>

      <P>When I reported progress, I was giving the House particulars of the production in Bord na Móna and I pointed out the progress being made in the sale of briquettes. The Board have informed me that in the next two or three years demand for briquettes from new industrial and institutional users is likely to represent sales of about 30,000 tons per annum.  In the same period, new outlets for up to 16,000 tons of machine turf are in sight.  The biggest of these is the new central boilerhouse at Dublin Airport, expected to be in operation next year, which will use up to 10,000 tons of machine turf per annum.  Further in the future, the Board have quite firm prospects of more large consumers whose demand will be nearly 20,000 tons of briquettes per annum.  All the time, of course, smaller establishments, using say less than 200 tons a year, are commencing to use turf.</P>
      <P>Exports of milled peat for the upgrading of gas coke continued as in former years.  The export of milled peat for foundry use has now ceased but the processing of this product, which was formely done in Britain, is now being carried out at Drogheda and the finished product is being exported.  The export of peat moss continues to grow and in 1961-62, 216,000 bales, or 80,000 bales more than the previous year, were exported.</P>
      <P>The Board's Research Station continued to do valuable work during the year particularly in the operation of the Fuel Advisory Service.  At University College, Dublin, research studies of milled peat are continuing while further studies were made for the Board in the handling and packaging of briquettes and in the application and uses of the seed and potting compost produced at Kilberry, County Offaly.</P>

    <P>Home production of semi-bituminous coal in the Arigna area in the <Col N="311" /> year 1961 was about 51,000 tons.  The investigation into the possibility of utilising deposits of low grade semi-bituminous coal at Arigna in an additional electricity generating unit is still in progress.  It has been established that there are sufficient reserves of lower ash content coal but before any decision could be taken in this matter it must first be established that the coal can be extracted economically on a regular basis over the life of a new station.  The necessary investigations are being carried out by an expert from the Netherlands who has been retained by my Department as consultant in the matter.</P>
    <P>Anthracite production for 1961 at 135,000 tons showed a fall of about 30,000 tons on production in 1960 due to interruptions in production at one of the principal mines.  Imports of anthracite did not increase, however, and at 55,000 tons, were approximately the same as in 1960.  Exports of anthracite increased from 10,000 tons in 1960 to 17,000 in 1961.  The bulk of the exports went to the Netherlands and the mine owners concerned are to be complimented on their enterprise in building up this export business.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the anthracite mine owners and the coal trade are co-operating in an endeavour to further the sales of anthracite.  This co-operation is directed towards the stimulation of the demand for the smaller sizes of anthracite.  These small sizes of anthracite are automatically produced when anthracite is being crushed and screened at the mines for grading purposes.  Hitherto, it had been rather difficult to dispose of such small coals but it is hoped that their use in suitable domestic central heating systems will increase the demand for them.</P>
    <P>Coal imports for 1961 at 1,780,000 tons showed a slight rise on the imports for 1960, which amounted to 1,660,000 tons.  Great Britain maintained her position as the largest supplier and exported 1,140,000 tons to the Irish market during 1961.  Nevertheless, since the price of British domestic coal was increased in July, <Col N="312" /> 1961, this country has been buying coal extensively from non-British sources.  Imports of non-British coal rose from 474,000 tons in 1960 to 648,000 tons in 1961.  The further increase in the price of British coal has added impetus to this trend and in the first six months of 1962, the proportion of our requirements of large and unscreened steam coal, including household coal, imported from Britain was only half what it was in 1961.  Coal of non-British origin was supplied to this country in 1961 mainly by the United States, 200,000 tons; Poland, 191,000 tons; Belgium, 141,000 tons; and Germany, 111,000 tons.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to my special interest in the efficient use of fuel particularly by industry.  Fuel users in other countries are very much alive to the significance of the efficient use of fuel in reducing production costs and thereby rendering industrial products more competitive.  The importance of this factor has not, however, been properly appreciated in this country except by some of our more progressive industries.  To stimulate interest in the efficient use of fuels I have engaged the National Industrial Fuel Efficiency Service, a non-profit making organisation which specialises in fuel efficiency, to carry out a promotional drive.  The drive consists of a free inspection of the heating and power plants of some 70 industrial firms, with a view to a rough appraisal of their efficiency.</P>
    <P>I understand that there was quite a number of firms in which efficiency could be improved to a greater or lesser degree and that fully instrumented surveys would be justified in several cases.  Firms which decide to have a survey of this kind carried out will be able to recoup one-third of the cost of the survey under a Technical Assistance Scheme operated by my Department.  This scheme was recently extended to include fuel efficiency surveys for hotels.  The implementation of the survey recommendations and the wider interest in fuel efficiency which the promotional drive should stimulate should benefit consulting engineering services in this country by <Col N="313" /> whom most of the follow-up work would be carried out.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that these steps will lead to a lasting awareness of the importance of fuel efficiency and that industrial and commercial firms, hotels and institutions with large heating installations will, on a regular basis, avail of the expert consultancy services at their disposal in this State to ensure the maintenance of a high standard of fuel conversion efficiency.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that all the State companies within the ambit of the Department continue to develop Work Study through the employment of outside Consultants and staff Work Study Officers trained for continuous operation.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to give Deputies as complete a picture as possible of the operations of my Department during the past year without going into such detail as would make my speech of an inordinate length.  There is one aspect, however, which I have not covered and that is the operations of CIE.  I feel sure that Deputies will agree with me that it is unnecessary to do so in view of the fact that the operations of CIE have been the subject of extensive debates in connection with the Private Members' Bill during the past four or five weeks.  I shall, of course, deal in my reply with any matters affecting CIE which may arise on the debate.</P>

      <P>Motion No. 39, which is being discussed with the Supplementary Estimate, reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann protests against the recent increase in bus fares and calls on the Government to introduce legislation so as to ensure that <Col N="314" /> the poorer sections of the community are protected against the hardships which have resulted.</P>
    <P>This motion was put down some time ago and because of the exigencies of the Order Paper, it has not been reached until to-day.  All the same, I am glad that we have an opportunity of discussing a problem which, whilst not perhaps in the same rarefied atmosphere to which we have been brought by the Minister, is one of great practical interest and concern to the citizens of our cities, and particularly of Dublin.  I want to say at the outset that the increases in bus fares which have occurred in the past few years have resulted in real suffering and hardship in this city and I feel that Dáil Éireann should protest against this hardship in the strongest possible terms.</P>
    <P>Anybody connected with what has occurred in the city will know only too well that when I talk of the hardship which has resulted, it is not to talk in hyperbole or exaggeration in any way.  There is not a Deputy or councillor in this city who does not know what happens, for example, to the old age pensioners living in the city of Dublin whose children are married and living in the suburbs.  They are in fact not able to visit them as often as they would like because of the bus fares.  Families are parted and they are unable to keep in contact because the old age pensioner, the mother or father, is unable to afford, out of his or her meagre allowance, the bus fares to Ballyfermot, Finglas, Crumlin or other such outlying areas.  The problem of persons living in suburbs is one which should concern us and should be the object of immediate action by the Government.  I am sure Deputies who are familiar with the circumstances in which many people live in the city of Dublin know of cases similar to the one I am now about to cite, of the widow who works in the city as a cleaner and whose bus fares amount to £1 a week. Anybody who knows of conditions in the suburbs, in the housing estates of Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council, where workers and pensioners live, and come into the city <Col N="315" /> know that the burden of bus fares involved in coming into the city is very great indeed.</P>
    <P>We have had a considerable number of figures here today from the Minister. May I give him certain figures also?  Between 1953 and the present time, bus fares on the rural and city services have increased between 50 and 51 per cent.  The increases which have occurred in recent years have been as follows: in 1949, a minimum fare was introduced and the distance of all fares reduced; in 1951, the distance for all fares was reduced; in 1953, there was the same thing, and again in 1955, 1958, 1960 and 1962.  By this means, the bus traveller is required to pay larger fares for the distance he has to travel.</P>
    <P>This motion is, in effect, in two parts.  It asks the Dáil to protest against what has occurred and asks the Government to take action.  I am aware of the type of reply which can be made to this motion, the type of reply which it is reasonable to anticipate may be given, namely, that this is a matter for CIE and that the Dáil has in fact told CIE what they have to do and if there are operating deficits in CIE, they have a statutory obligation to get rid of them and how that is done is a matter for CIE.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>I want to say here that we are a sovereign Parliament and that if we believe a thing is wrong, we are entitled to amend the legislation.  That is what I am asking the House to suggest that the Government should do.  I am asking the House not to accept the excuse that CIE has a statutory obligation but to say that if they have, it is time we changed it and changed it in the way suggested in this motion.  I want to see at least as a way of assisting the weaker and poorer section of the community legislation introduced to permit special fares for recipients of social welfare payments and special workers' fares in the morning and in the evening.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is what other countries have adopted.  Undoubtedly there are administrative difficulties. <Col N="316" /> Undoubtedly it will cost some money but the Dáil is entitled to express its opinion that the recipients of social welfare payments are entitled to get this benefit so that they can travel at reduced fares on our public transport. It is also reasonable that workers' fares should be introduced at the busy early hours of the morning and evening.  This of course will cost money and it is a matter for the Dáil to consider whether this should be paid by the taxpayer or by the bus travellers mainly in the city of Dublin. I want to state categorically that the poorer and weaker sections in the city of Dublin are bearing too high a share of CIE deficits.  In fact, as we all know, there is an operating surplus on buses, a surplus which helps to reduce the deficit.</P>
    <P>It is perfectly reasonable to suggest that in respect of the weaker sections of the community, this should not be permitted.  This is an opportunity for Deputies to express their views and, by their votes, to make clear their position on this matter because we have all from time to time attended meetings at which this matter has been raised.  There is probably not a Deputy, from the city of Dublin at any rate, who has not within the past year or so been at tenants' associations meetings, or local residents' associations meetings at which the problem of bus fares has been raised and at which he has at least made sympathetic sounds.  Now is the time to stand up and be counted.  It is all very well to go to meetings throughout the city and to say it is too bad about the increase in bus fares but now is the time to give expression to that sentiment in a concrete way by asking the Government to bring in legislation so that the weaker sections of the community can get a reduction in bus fares.</P>
    <P>Again I can anticipate the sort of argument that can be made: it is much better to increase pensions and we will consider this when the Budget comes around in conjunction with other claims; the wage earners have in fact got increases and we feel that in the ordinary way of negotiation through their unions that is the best manner in <Col N="317" /> which they can compensate themselves for any rise in the cost of living.  We all know the sort of arguments which are made and who in fact suffer from those types of arguments.  It is the old age pensioners living in Fishamble Street in the city of Dublin who cannot take the bus to Ballyfermot or Finglas. It is the workers in the outlying areas whose wages are cut down by the great demands made on them and the people like the widow I have mentioned who has to pay £1 a week out of her small earnings to go to her work as a cleaner.</P>
    <P>This Dáil, being a national assembly, has to debate matters of high policy and high finance and to discuss these matters in millions and hundreds of millions.  I am talking about seven-pences, ninepences and shillings but I am talking about the things that matter to the poorer sections of the community, the people who cannot afford a ninepenny bus fare.  This Dáil should take cognisance of that situation and remedy it.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position to give details to this House as to the manner in which these schemes are operated elsewhere but I know there are such schemes.  In France, for instance, there is a considerable reduction for persons in receipt of social welfare benefits, for people whose families are of considerable size and for other such people when they travel by State transport. It should not be beyond the power of the Minister and his Department to devise a system which would not be too difficult to operate by which the old age pensioners and the people on the unemployment register, the people in receipt of widows' pensions and tuberculosis allowances would be able to hand up a card identifying themselves and get a reduction in the fare.  Nor would it be too difficult or too costly to devise a scheme by which, at certain periods of the day, when the workers are going to work, they would be given a concession because of the large amounts they now have to pay.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say about this motion.  I feel that anybody conversant with conditions&mdash;I speak for the City of Dublin, but this must apply to other large cities and towns as <Col N="318" /> well &mdash; will know that I am not exaggerating when I suggest that what has occurred in the transport industry in recent years is a very considerable hardship.  We should consider the best way of assisting the people in most need of assistance.  It is possible that there may be other means of doing it. I appreciate that the directors of CIE have considerable difficulty in carrying out their statutory duties.  I know it is a comparatively simple matter to turn to bus fares and increase them when they are faced with a deficit as a result of increased wages.  I know the argument will be made that because of increased wages bills, fares must go up but I do not think that is a valid argument.</P>
    <P>If the Government have so mishandled the situation that prices continue to rise and if, as a result, the unions have to obtain increased wages and if the deficit of the State companies is increased because of that, the people to bear the burden should not be the weakest section of the community.  I feel it would not be uncalled for for this Dáil to call on the Government to introduce legislation.  Indeed, I feel that legislation is needed, that the answer to this debate will be that CIE have their statutory functions to carry out.  If that is the answer, then we inform the Government that as a sovereign Parliament, we wish that position to be changed.  I want to say a few brief words on the Estimate and to move to refer it back.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> There is another simple matter to which I wish to draw the attention of the House with regard to CIE.  We all have our problems in our constituencies but if one raises them in the Dáil one leaves oneself open to the allegation that we are looking for support in our own constituency.  Even at the risk of that, may I mention this? There is not one single bus shelter in the whole suburb of Finglas. That may be a matter which the Minister may think should not be raised on this Estimate and which is a matter of CIE policy but I want to say this&mdash;this is symptomatic of our whole approach to the transport problem in Dublin and of the Government's whole approach to the transport policy as it relates to the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>I repeat, there is not a single bus shelter in the whole of Finglas.  I am sure there is not a Deputy who could not say the same for many parts of his own constituency.  We have here a large State organisation and if the Minister responsible for that organisation allows things to develop so that the needs of the people are neglected, we are entitled to draw the attention of the House to the matter.  I charge the Government with failing to look after the real needs of the people.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about Aerlínte. We have a luxurious transatlantic air service and we have not a bus shelter in Finglas.  I think there is a connection between the two.  We are concerned with prestige matters and with these magnificent planes but we forget the real needs of the people.  I want so say categorically with regard to the transatlantic airline that it is a luxury this country cannot afford.  I think it is a prestige symbol.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the opinion of Fine Gael?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanCostello" hpid="Mr. D. Costello Mr. D. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my opinion and I am entitled to give it.  I am also entitled to make my speech here.  We are too poor a country to afford this luxury.  We talk about an operating surplus of approximately £200,000 in regard to Aerlínte.  I want to express myself as reasonably as I can <Col N="320" /> in this matter and not make any false charges.  This talk about an operating surplus of £200,000 is a strange way of expressing our situation because it does not take into account the interest invested in Aerlínte.  The phrase that is used, that sort of nice-sounding phrase, has a connection with all this. That phrase is that it is hoped that the capital being invested in these transatlantic aeroplanes will be redeemed at some time in the future.  What does that mean?  It means that the State has to borrow millions of pounds, invest in Aerlínte, pay interest at the rate of over 5 per cent. and get nothing in return for it.  I want to say categorically that in fact the operations of the transatlantic airline cost us probably something over £400,000 a year, which is not included in these accounts.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting the people who have drawn up these accounts have done anything wrong because that is the statutory position, but we should tell the people and not be talking about this £200,000 operating surplus.  There is an operating surplus because Aerlínte has not to pay interest on capital. If it had to pay interest, there would be no operating surplus.  As I understand the position&mdash;here I am very much subject to correction and I am sure the Minister will correct me, if I am wrong&mdash;in other airlines, the interest on capital is included when arriving at the operating surplus.  Quite recently, it was pointed out that a great loss had been suffered by one of the big British airlines and it was necessary to take drastic steps, but that loss arose because of the interest that had to be paid on the capital invested in it.  If that interest had not been payable, then it would have had what we would call an operating surplus.  When the Minister talks about the large operating deficits of the other airlines, are these operating deficits made up as our accounts are made up or do those figures include interest on the capital invested in them, because if they do and if in fact we are not comparing like with like, then we are certainly misleading the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding of the position is that no airline on the North Atlantic <Col N="321" /> route makes money.  When I say &ldquo;makes money&rdquo;, let me make it clear I do not think we should get involved in juggling with accounts.  I am talking about making money as an ordinary commercial venture.  In an ordinary commercial venture, you take into account depreciation and your capital and interest charges.  As I understand the position, no airline on the North Atlantic route makes money and Aerlínte does not make money by that criterion.  It would be as well if we and the people were told that.  We have seen these headlines in the paper: &ldquo;Aerlínte makes operating surplus of £200,000.&rdquo;  People who read headlines and do not read very much besides will say: &ldquo;The airline is not too bad anyway.  It is not costing us any money.&rdquo;  In fact it is.  It is costing the taxpayer considerable amounts every year.  I do not know what will happen in the future.  I do not know what will happen when these planes have finished their useful life.  How shall we replace them?  The replacement cost of these planes will probably be enormous.</P>
    <P>This whole matter is one of which the public should be given a very full account.  I do not think it is a matter on which the public should be left under any illusion.  I do not think there is much advantage to be gained by the Minister making debating points: &ldquo;Is that the policy of your Party?&rdquo; I think we are long past the time when the public are interested in debating points being made in this House.  The public are interested in bus fares; they are interested in the price of butter; they are interested in proper housing.  The Government have gone far away from the realities of present-day Ireland.  One of the symptoms of that is the manner in which this Estimate is being approached.  One of the symptoms of it is the Government's whole approach to our transport policy.  The Dáil should indicate its view on that by supporting this motion and referring this Estimate back.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I and my colleagues, Deputy McAuliffe and Deputy Treacy, put down a motion to refer back the Estimate and in fact the reason for Motion No. 46 on the <Col N="322" /> Order Paper is to give to those of us who are interested an opportunity of indicating to the House the serious position that faces a great number of counties throughout Ireland because of the proposal by CIE to close down the railways completely.</P>
      <P>Not many weeks ago, indications appeared in the public press that CIE intended within the very near future, amongst many other things, to deprive county Waterford of all its railway lines.  The railway line that links Tramore with Waterford, which runs right through the county of Waterford, was to be wiped out.  I should like to avail of this debate to give to the Minister and to the House the reasons why the Act which gives to CIE power to take these decisions went through Dáil Éireann without a division on the relevant section of the Act.  It went through because the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Taoiseach, gave it as a solemn undertaking on behalf of CIE that before the closure of any line came into operation, there would be full consultation with local representatives and local bodies, that all the facts would be fully investigated before any decision was taken.  Unfortunately we have learnt a lesson.</P>
      <P>We in county Waterford learned it the hard way.  We learned it by the sudden statement that the railway line from Waterford city to Tramore was to be closed and by the brutal onslaught made on the railway bridge within minutes of zero hour so as to prevent action being taken by the corporation and county council of Waterford who at that time were endeavouring to by from CIE, if possible, the right to run the railway line in the interests of the people of the city and county of Waterford.  No chance was given.  It looked as if CIE were anxious to close the line, irrespective of any representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember taking part in a deputation which comprised the then Mayor of Waterford, a number of aldermen and councillors and the four Deputies who at that time represented the constituency. We met the secretary and various officials and we were warned that when we went into the conference <Col N="323" /> room, we were not there to discuss whether or not the line should be closed but only to put forward suggestions for what alternative services we required.  In other words, the decision to close the line was made.  There was no consultation; we were being informed that it was closed, and all we were permitted to do was to make suggestions as to what alternative services we required.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is the proper way to deal with a problem such as this.  I want to put the case for the Tramore line.  Other people from West Cork and from Clare at the time had equally good and valid reasons why, in their opinion, the railway lines serving their constituencies or counties should not be closed.  Tonight I speak mainly from the point of view of Waterford county and city.  From Fermoy at the extreme end of the county to the city of Waterford, a distance of approximately 60 to 70 miles, the various small stations which are the nerve centres of the whole county will be deprived of a railway service. You may as well say you are cutting the main artery of the industrial life of Waterford by depriving the county of a railway.  That is being done in the name of economy, without thought, consideration or even courtesy for the inquiries made by the local representatives of industry or anything else in the county.</P>
    <P>The combined county council members of Cork, Waterford and other interested places have met on several occasions and endeavoured to get from CIE either agreement to receive deputations or information regarding losses on the lines.  It is true that CIE gave to that combined group information as to losses, but when we sought to get either direct from CIE or from the various stationmasters throughout the affected areas information as to the actual receipts paid in at the various stations, we were met with a stone-wall refusal, by a blank refusal, under instructions from headquarters to give no information as to receipts.  We got the suggested losses, but, when we endeavoured to put against what we were told were the losses, the actual receipts for individual stations, to build up a <Col N="324" /> picture in our own minds and to satisfy ourselves that there was, in fact, an actual loss, or the amount of the actual loss, we were met with complete and utter refusal by CIE officials to give any information at all.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that attitude of mind is completely wrong.  No one denies that CIE have responsibility.  No one denies that if there is an actual operating loss, and a continuous operating loss, CIE may in some circumstances be justified in proposing to close down, but before they do that, I suggest, to implement the promise made through the Minister here, there is an obligation on them to satisfy public representatives and local interests of the need for it, to co-operate with them in endeavouring in every way possible to give all the information they have available, and to listen to any suggestion that might improve the position.</P>
    <P>I can think of many ways&mdash;and I am sure my colleague, Deputy Lynch, has already put them to the Minister&mdash; in which the Tramore line could have been made to pay.  One very simple way was instead of scrapping the line, to increase the fares by a small amount.  That would have overcome the deficiency which, I understand, was between £400 and £500.  That was the maximum.  A small increase in fares would have met that rather than the 300 per cent.  increase we now have to suffer in bus fares for an inferior service which deprives the working class people of an amenity to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>That does not strike the moneyed classes; it does not strike the man with the motor car; it does not strike even the young single man who can cycle.  It effects an economy at the expense of the working classes, the man, his wife and family, because the bus service provides no means of transporting that which is most essential if you have a young child, a pram, so that you can keep your youngest child by your side while keeping an eye on the other children running about the beach.</P>
    <P>It was crazy of CIE to close the line, in the face of the fact that the corporation and the county council were actually considering offering a subsidy <Col N="325" /> to run that service, or even to buy it out and run it as a private service. While that consideration was going on, there was this brutal assault on the railway bridge within a few minutes of zero hour.  I suggest to the Minister that he has a responsibility to demand from CIE that they meet the local representatives of Cork, Waterford or any other area where there is a proposed close down.</P>
    <P>We were informed by CIE that £21,655 was the loss on the Mallow-Waterford line.  Would it not be possible for us to be permitted to find out how that figure was arrived at?  I am aware that the Minister, in reply to a Parliamentary question dealing with the railways, indicated that, in his view, Deputies or the local representatives would be unable to assess that information if they got it, that it is a complicated business which only properly trained auditors could understand. That view of high finance is, to my mind, a bit haywire.</P>
    <P>I believe that if you know what income is and if you know what outgoings are, a very simple sum in subtraction will give you an approximate idea of either the loss or the gain.  It is true that to find out the overall picture of costings and overheads would be a complicated job, but a very rough picture would do to find out whether it was absolutely essential to close the Tramore line in face of the fact that the railway line from Waterford is a social amenity and is absolutely essential for the industries of the country and for tourism, in view of the fact that it is a vital link with London, through Munster, Rosslare, Dungarvan, Fermoy, Mallow and right up to Cork&mdash;and into Killarney, as Deputy Lynch says.  It is a vital thing for tourism and for industry, both present and future.  If my county is to be left without a railway line, can we hope to attract American firms, German firms or anyone else in our drive to keep our position in EEC conditions?  This action of CIE, with the approval of the Minister apparently, is going to deprive us of that right.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a responsibility to see that that does not happen without <Col N="326" /> our being given an opportunity of endeavouring to show what improvements could be made.  What will be the impact on the ratepayers of Waterford?  Who will pay for the increased tearing up of the roads when all the traffic&mdash;there will be considerable traffic because I have figures to prove it&mdash;goes out from the station in the town of Dungarvan?  Thousands of tons of beet are transported to Mallow by rail.  The co-operative creamery, the slate factory and the apple factory have given me proof in relation to £8,000 and £10,000 paid out into Dungarvan station alone. Where is all that traffic to go but to the main roads?  Who will be responsible for the upkeep of the main roads but the ratepayers of Waterford?</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that it is being seriously considered by the ratepayers' representatives in both Waterford and Cork that if this is insisted upon, they, in turn, will endeavour to see that they are not compelled to provide a road service for CIE lorries to carry the produce that was formerly carried on the railways so that a saving can be made at the ratepayers' expense. I do not think it reasonable that they should be asked to do it.  If such a proposal goes forward, even though I normally advocated that we should give full maintenance to our roads, I will now be forced to accept the fact that these representatives are within their rights.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that one of the reasons for this wholesale closing down is that section of the Act which insists that compensation for redundant employees will be paid only within a specified limited number of years, up to, I think, the end of 1964 and that should any other redundancy occur, as and from that on, this compensation will not be available from Government sources.</P>
    <P>I think CIE are acting on the basis of discharging all they can now, giving them their compensation and then, if they want them, taking them back.  I am quite well aware that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are not a bit happy with the consultation or, rather, should I say, lack of consultation between the Congress and <Col N="327" /> CIE headquarters.  I am authorised to say that they are not at all happy that consultations at the level they believe was necessary have taken place. They believe that adequate consultation has very rarely taken place between them but rather that they met and were informed of a decision come to by CIE headquarters in much the same way as the local bodies and public representatives are being informed either by newspaper announcement or a speech made at some dinner of some society or elsewhere that it was proposed to close down or they were, in fact, closing down.</P>
    <P>It was said to me that a number of highly skilled workers trained in CIE workshops, young men between 25 and 30 years of age, have been let go with a pension of so much per week, while at the same time, in the same industry and in the same particular trade in CIE, overtime is being worked and, further, while young men are being let go, finished coaches are being imported from other countries.  Surely there is something wrong somewhere?  The administration must be wrong.</P>
    <P>We are quite satisfied that the Chairman of CIE has the responsibility put on him by this House to endeavour to make CIE as a whole pay, balancing one part with the other. I do not say he is doing wrong in what he is doing but I do say that it is hard to get the public to accept all these economies which inflict so much hardship on them.</P>
    <P>During the period from 1st June to 1st October, we have rail hostesses. That period is very significant.  The universities close in June and they open in October.  Probably it is only a coincidence that the period covers the holidays but it has been suggested to me that our rail hostesses are paying their university fees from the £8 or £10 per week they get during that period.  If that is so, good luck to them, but I suggest that there are very few countries in the world with rail hostesses.  Here we have a country where the maximum distance between any two places is no more <Col N="328" /> than 312 miles.  If you travel in one State in America, you would travel twice as far as you would travel on a day's journey here.  I never saw rail hostesses in the United States.  I saw a negro porter who brought you a drink or cleaned your shoes if you wanted that service.  I do not understand&mdash;and the public do not understand&mdash;this urgent drive for economy, in view of the fact that CIE can apparently afford the luxury of train hostesses to take care of the children, I am told, of elderly people travelling between Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>I do know from my own experience of crossing from London that at Rosslare station and between there and Cork city, or, perhaps, Killarney, there are many mothers with tired children who, after a rough sea journey, need as much attention from the rail hostesses but, unfortunately, it is not thought necessary to put them on that particular line.  Do all good things come from Dublin and go to Cork or <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister thinks of all this but I know what I think of his attitude.  I asked the Minister a very simple question.  I asked him whether he could inform me or get information for me as to the loss on the rail service between Fermoy and Waterford.  It was my job as a Deputy to try to find that out.  That is what I am elected to do.  The answer the Minister gave me was that it was a function of CIE, that he had no function in the matter at all.  When I went to CIE, they told me they would not give me the information either.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister relate that to the fact that the Dáil is supposed to be the master of CIE and not the servant?  The Minister represents us in his dealings with CIE and he is the servant of this House.  We have to foot the bill if there are losses, we have to meet all accounts.  We have as our watch dog the Minister, and when we ask our representative for an explanation on behalf of our people who will be vitally affected, his answer is that he has no responsibility. Does it mean that from now on CIE can decide the economic fate of <Col N="329" /> any county without Dáil Éireann having a right to do anything about it?</P>
    <P>Is it correct that the Cork-Youghal line is not now to be closed but that it will be continued for passenger services? Deputy Corry is announcing that throughout the length and breadth of the Cork constituency.  He is holding it out as something he has won. If it is true, I welcome it.  There is a vital necessity for the people of Cork to have this link with Youghal just the same as it is necessary for the people of Waterford to have a link with Tramore.  Due to political pressure, perhaps, or second thoughts, CIE have now apparently changed their mind.  If they have had second thoughts in regard to this, they may have second thoughts also in regard to Waterford.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a duty as our representative not only to see to it that we get fair play but to examine with CIE whether the loss of these lines is justified because of the danger of paralysing the entire industrial future of a district.</P>
      <P>I notice that in his speech the Minister devoted scarcely more than a few words to Rosslare.  He said there was provision for extended queuing space for passengers and that some of the toilets were to be enlarged.  Did the Minister ever travel third class or second class from London to Rosslare, preferably with a couple of children accompanying him?  Did he ever get on that boat and have to lie on the deck with people seasick all around him?  Did he ever realise what a difference even 100 deck chairs would make to the people who have to travel on this boat?  Does he realise that most of the people who once travel on this boat say they will never travel on it again?  Is it not possible to provide not even a deck chair, but simply a box on which a tired mother can sit down with her child in her lap?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is permitted on the boats between Rosslare and Fishguard is <Col N="331" /> simply criminal.  I said on this Estimate last year that there was severe overcrowding on these boats and that if a disaster should occur, the lifeboats or liferafts would not be able to take half or quarter of the people aboard.  I have travelled that route a dozen times and I know what I am talking about.  If there is ever a disaster on that boat, heads will roll. There is a lack of supervision.  I have that from people who serve on these boats and who are nervous of the risks they are continually taking at peak periods.  I would suggest there is a need for investigation and a need for precautionary measures before something tragic happens.  I trust the Minister has listened to what I have said and will endeavour to discharge his responsibility to the people of my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister began his statement with some words on civil aviation and airports.  It is obvious from the figures he has given that colossal expenditure is necessary to maintain our airports.  This can be justified on either one of two grounds: by the demand for the services or by the necessity of providing for the future economic growth of our major cities.  On the second ground, it is obvious that Dublin Airport is necessary and that if extra services are needed, we will have to extend the airport to meet the demand.  The same applies to Cork.  The decision to have an airport there was a good one. I observe there has been an operating deficiency of £99,000 to date.  I have used the airport myself twice in the last month or so and it does not seem to be very busy.  At the same time, if we are to develop Cork as the southern capital, it is necessary to have an airport there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question mark in regard to our airports is Shannon.  That, however, cannot be laid at the Minister's door. The fact is that in the era of less efficient aircraft, Shannon was the logical port of call on the transatlantic route.  It is extremely doubtful whether it will continue to be so.  It is true that the Government have spent <Col N="332" /> large sums&mdash;I shall deal with that later&mdash;in an effort to develop industries at Shannon and create a situation in which Shannon will prove an attraction. In doing so, they have, I think, pinned a great deal of their faith on air freight.  In my opinion, air freight, considered from the point of view of a Government setting up such a service and from the point of view of an air company, is a ghastly and a costly failure.</P>
    <P>If one wants to check whether or not air freight is a success, all one has to do is to look at the costings.  If one wants to send something to New York at the moment, one finds that air freight costs roughly two and a half times as much.  With regard to air car ferry, that will not compete successfully in the foreseeable future with water and ships will, on either long or short haul, defeat air freight always over the next couple of decades.  It seems clear to me that the setting up of an air freight service is not of any consequence.</P>
    <P>The figures we see here in the Minister's speech&mdash;13,000 tons for Dublin Airport and 337 tons for Cork Airport&mdash;are so relatively small in comparison with the port of Dublin or the port of Cork that my argument is proved; we must discount air freight as a means of revenue.  From that point of view, it is possible that a great deal of the development brought about at Shannon may&mdash;I hope it may not&mdash;prove abortive because the building of houses and factories there is largely based on the assumption that one can make one's product, roll it out on the tarmac and put it on the plane.  Most products would be more advantageously put in America or on the continent by rolling them out on to the tarmac, putting them on a truck and bringing them to either Limerick or Cork for shipment. That may be a revolutionary idea but, from what I know of air freights as a business man, that is how I see the situation.</P>
    <P>From that point of view, I question the wisdom of the purchase, which the Minister has authorised, of two aircraft at a cost of £700,000 to provide a car ferry between Dublin, Liverpool, Bristol and, perhaps, <Col N="333" /> Birmingham.  The first comment on this project is that private enterprise has already abandoned it twice.  That is the Minister's statement.  The second comment is that we need at the moment a very much improved delivery service between Britain and here for agricultural goods, if it is our desire to provide those goods fresh in Britain.  It is questionable whether or not a ship, or two, would not be a far better investment, remembering that they could bring the tourists' cars here at a much cheaper rate than they can be brought here by air.  I know there are certain physical difficulties because the suggestion is that a tourist who drives a car to Speke wants to drive the same car away from Dublin Airport. That is a difficulty, but it is not an insurmountable one.</P>
    <P>It is quite right that we should have a company such as Aer Lingus.  We have to bring our tourists in and out on short hauls but I do not agree that it is necessary that we should walk into further colossal expenditure of this kind when we badly need a proper cross-Channel service.  We have not got one at the moment.  Aer Lingus was a sensible project and it is a pity that it cannot&mdash;the Minister expressed regret because of this situation&mdash;repay its interest on capital and, indeed, the capital itself.  As the Minister pointed out, of course, that is a feature of all air companies all over the world.  That feature has in fact been accentuated in the past 12 months by a reduction in fares.  However, all of us have gone to a bad fair at times and all of us have had to take a bad price at times and we cannot, therefore, be hypercritical about that situation.  But we can be hypercritical about policy and, while a small operating surplus was indicated by the Minister in regard to Aerlínte, an operating surplus is far from a profit because interest on capital has not been charged, though depreciation has been.  The capital charge on these three jets is colossal, something in the order of 63 to 64 per cent.  While we have charged in depreciation, it is questionable whether that depreciation will replace jet aircraft, which will be much more expensive, I am sure, when we come to buy them again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> It appears to me that this Aerlínte project is a highly-expensive excursion into transatlantic air ferry business, I wonder whether there was any need for it.  I do not think there was.  If we had made arrangements with the other transatlantic companies to provide a service giving a certain number of seats, I think we could have saved a great deal of money.  We need a colossal amount of capital investment here in sensible things, things related to our industries and our agriculture, not to mention our social difficulties, such as lack of housing.  Many young families find themselves short of housing at the moment.</P>
    <P>We have, too, the decision to allow Aer Rianta, the third of the triumvirate, to build large luxury hotels in centres where they can be fed by potential customers from the airports.  That is an ill-founded project, in my view.  I shall be saying something about tourism later.  Is it not true to say that we fail in our tourism because we have provided too many bedrooms with baths, too many luxury hotels, too many places where you pay too much for too little?  I remember being on the continent last Easter staying in a first-class hotel, paying approximately 12/6 to 15/- a day less than I would be paying for the same accommodation here.  I believe that what the people want is the small hotel with a reputation for excellent cooking and reasonable prices.  The great majority of people coming here want clean accommodation and good food, well-cooked and well served.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated a change of policy in this regard.  To my way of thinking, the change comes too late. The Minister says:</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte's targets for top grade accommodation are now in sight of achievement but there is still a deficiency in the number of grade B and C rooms available, particularly in some parts of the country... I have asked Ostlanna Iompair Éireann to go into the possibility of building new grade B hotels in suitable places where there is and is likely to be a continuing inadequacy of such accommodation and where block booking for package tours is required by travel agents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> He also says:</P>
    <P>I have directed Bord Fáilte to concentrate on the expansion and improvement of middle-grade accommodation and, with a view to giving extra encouragement to the small hotelier, the Board have reduced the lower limit on the cost of improvement works eligible for grant assistance from £2,000 to £500.</P>
    <P>I can give the case of one hotelier who is operating a first-class hotel and who has refused to take any grant from Bord Fáilte, refused to have anything to do with them because he felt that the terms and conditions laid down were so stringent that he was far better off without any assistance of this kind.</P>
    <P>I honestly believe, if you go to France or Italy, that the small hotel, if it is clean and the food is good, is streets ahead of, or certainly as good as, any of the first-class hotels that have been heavily subsidised in capital expenditure by the Minister and the Government.  I think we were completely wrong and that over the last six months the criticisms we have heard about the fall in receipts from tourism, and the answers to questions asked by Deputy Sweetman, for instance, which made available to us the details of the grants given to hotels, indicate that the stringent conditions laid down by Bord Fáilte meant that the grants were given in all or almost all cases to luxury hotels.  That is policy, something for which the Government have to answer and something in respect of which, in my opinion, they have been sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>The question of all the money that has been spent on the Shannon Free Airport Development Company is something which has to be examined. It is a highly expensive experiment and I would not like to say that it is a failure.  I hope it never will be but we had an industry for chinchillas and for bowling alleys and they are both gone.  In my view, both those projects could be put in the same category as the Minister's previous excursion, in a previous Ministry, in the realm of fish ponds.  We have to see whether <Col N="336" /> this idea of an industrial town, sited in a free airport where air freight can be provided, will work.  I think perhaps it will work if you can pay the freight you want to pay in the case, say, of a piano, one of the industries operating down there.  While it may work, I will guarantee it will not work where you have to sell on the basis of paying £1 per ton less or more on a product in America or on the continent, or perhaps £5 per ton.  I have not got the freight rates at my fingertips but I would almost say that the difference between sea and air freight at the moment, between here and the continent, is almost £5 per ton.  If it is, then this experiment may or may not succeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech at page 20 indicates that we are now building a colossal number of houses and of flats for the workers who we hope will be there.  I hope they will be but I reserve the right to be extremely critical if they are not there this day 12 months.  I reserve the right to say that the unfortunate boys and girls in the towns of Drogheda and Dundalk, who have been waiting for five years for houses, will also have something to say if there are empty houses at Shannon.  Remember all the stringent conditions laid down for the housing of people who need houses, have to be gone through before these people can get houses but we here are trying to build up something which is artificial. I hope the Minister will be successful but I do warn that it is an experiment. We have had cases of industries folding up and all that we can hope for is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An independent administration, but we were discussing, not this actual problem but something the Minister was thinking about not so very long ago, on the Estimate for Local Government.  There is a cake and you can call that cake &ldquo;housing&rdquo; and that cake is divided into slices. Some people get a slice and some people do not.  Therefore I reserve the right, whether or not the Minister <Col N="337" /> says it is a different slice, that if those houses are empty this day 12 months, or this day two years, to come back and charge the Minister with making a mistake, but I hope that I will not have to do so.</P>
      <P>Irish Shipping is in the position of all shipping.  It has part of its fleet laid up and it is not making money. Again it is very easy to be wise after the event and very easy to be critical, but there is a line of thought which holds that the first thing we should have done after the war was to provide a really good cross-Channel and continental service for our agricultural goods, even if we lost money at the start.  Remember we are losing a lot of money at the end.  I do not think tramp steamers chartered for various freights all over the world, and in very few cases plying to our shores, are anything more than a status symbol. I do not think they do anything for us; they are losing money; they do not help our products to be sold anywhere in the world and they are plying perhaps from America to Australia, or from the Continent of Europe to America, but they are not doing anything for us.  At the same time, we need capital to develop our resources and extend our production.  That situation is wrong.</P>
      <P>As I say, it is quite easy to be wise after the event but on page 20 of the Minister's speech he says:</P>
      <P>...replacement of a number of the existing older vessels will, in the normal course, also be necessary before 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite certain that statement is true because older vessels will come to be replaced, but the Minister in his reply should tell us what the future policy of Irish Shipping is to be.  Is it the intention to bend the policy to the view where it will do this country some good, or is it the intention to allow their policy to proceed on the basis of building ships, paying for them out of the Exchequer and leasing them out as tramp steamers carrying freight from one country to another and losing money or, alternatively, tying them up?  I would prefer to see a boat leaving every day from Dublin to <Col N="338" /> Liverpool, as it does, with perhaps refrigerated goods and I would prefer to see that boat losing money for a few years in an experiment to see if we could develop our fruit trade perhaps, or our vegetable trade, or, say, develop the fresh meat trade to a greater extent, than that we should have that ship plying from one country to another and losing money abroad.</P>
    <P>I would far prefer to see it that way for some years because then at least at home we would be developing production and businessmen, and co-operative societies which process agricultural products, would know that that service was available to them. What use is a service from the Continent of Europe to America on which the Exchequer loses money at a time when we are paying our old age pensioners something like 32/6d.  a week? It does not make sense to me.</P>
    <P>I welcome the mention by the Minister of the Greenore-Preston container service.  I think the reason why the dispute in relation to the handling of the containers came to an end was the Greenore-Preston container service.  I am going to be quite blunt and say that I think the port of Greenore was used as a means of ending that dispute to the advantage of my constituents and I am glad of it.  I want to say that I hope, now that the port has been got going, every effort will be made to keep it going and that if there is any need for a subvention, the same sort of approach will be made to that service as is obviously being made to the accounts of Irish Shipping Limited.  The port of Drogheda is a good port.  At low tide, without dredging, we can get in a boat of 3,000 tons and tie it up.  There are not many ports on the east coast of which that can be said.</P>
    <P>The Drogheda-Preston container service I welcome.  Unhappily, the volume of trade in Drogheda port declined during the year.  I think one of the principal reasons for that is the start of shipments of stone from Dundalk so that the twin ports are still paying.  The grant given to Drogheda is not money badly spent.  There is one thing about that port: any money spent on Drogheda is well spent <Col N="339" /> because you have the river Boyne, a large fast-flowing river, running into it that will keep it scoured out, once it is dredged.  Dredging of the port of Drogheda becomes more or less permanent, unlike cases where it has to be repeated in five or ten years' time.</P>
    <P>I take the Minister to task for one statement in relation to harbours at the end of page 22 of his supplied statement in which he says that if proposed harbour works are to be of a productive nature, as they should be, it should be possible for the harbour authorities to raise the necessary funds by borrowing with the assistance, if possible, of the local authorities.  We did a good bit of that in Drogheda but we could not do it all.  If you take the cost of removing a cubic yard of mud or silt in relation to the income of a harbour, you will find that dredging is something that must become a charge on the Exchequer, whether the money is to be guaranteed in the banks by the Government or the local authority. There is very little relation between the income of most of our harbours and the cost of major dredging work. That is something that should be remembered.</P>
    <P>The Minister is extremely enthusiastic about turf development.  I think it is good that we have developed our turf resources, as it does give employment to a lot of people.  The Minister has mentioned that as mechanisation progresses, he gets representations from various bodies and political persons who are accustomed to making such representations that the people disemployed by the machines should get their jobs back.  The day of the fellow spading out the turf is going. At the stage when turf development was a source of good employment, employment was most needed and turf development in this country was largely along social lines.  We must face it that if the theories of the hard Manchester school of economics had been applied, much of our turf development would never have been done.  We are now going into machine-won turf and the number of men who will be engaged on the various jobs in connection with it will be relatively few.</P>
    <P>Again, the sales of turf are almost <Col N="340" /> entirely dependent on Government-sponsored bodies and the greatest purchaser is the ESB.  In addition, there are the hospitals, institutions and the local authorities who, when they get the money from the Government, find a little tag on it which says that they must buy a turf-fired boiler and that they must use turf.  The Minister said that to heat Dublin Airport would take 10,000 tons of machine-won turf per year.  I look on that with horror because almost in the same page he gives the price at £6 per ton.  I cannot believe that to heat Dublin Airport will cost £60,000 a year.  It does not make sense to me and I would like the Minister to let me know how much it will cost to heat Dublin Airport.  I am quite certain the figure he has given is ridiculous.  If it is not, there is something wrong and very seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>Let us face up to it now: turf development as mentioned by the Minister will not give the level of employment it once did.  The electricity produced from it is produced in small generating stations such as the one at Screebe, or at Spanish Point near where the Minister for Education lives.</P>

    <P>The Minister devoted about 40 pages of his speech to various matters and then said that as there was a Transport Bill before the House, he did not think it necessary to deal with CIE and he skated through that.  I do not think the House will let him get away with that.  CIE have failed to live up to the conditions imposed on them in 1958.  Up to last year, it looked as if they were getting down their losses, but if you read the balance sheet for each year, you found that they <Col N="341" /> were writing off liabilities to the Government in respect of money advanced.</P>
    <P>When they reached the end of that, there was again a rising loss.  Last year, it was £500,000.  Now it is up to £1,700,000 and the reasons given are restrictive practices and the eighth round of wage increases.  I do not believe that.  I have seen the new lorries they have purchased and I know the operating economics of those lorries.  They are much more efficient than those they had previously.  Depreciation has been charged on them but it seems to me quite extraordinary, while I do not doubt the statements of the auditors for the previous year, that they did really cut down the loss to £250,000. I did not believe that at the time and many people in the country did not believe it.  The chickens have now come home to roost and we have to admit that, in 1964, the transport system will not be paying for itself.</P>
    <P>In this set of circumstances there has been a wholesale shutting down of lines, whether justified on economic grounds or not.  I hear on the grapevine&mdash;and it is only on the grapevine &mdash;that the shutting down of the Drogheda-Ardee line is being reconsidered. If anybody had asked me about that line before or after the decision was made to close it, I would have told them it must pay.  At the end of that railway property, there is one of the biggest wheat intake stations in the country where the Ardee Grain Company takes in 60,000 to 80,000 barrels of wheat.  There is also the heavy production of beet of which Deputy Corry is so fond.  There is heavy agricultural production for which the railway is used.  Magee's Stores is there, one of the biggest purveyors of agricultural machinery in the country who also use the railway for the movement of their agricultural machines as far down as Deputy Corry's constituency and further. There is the Castleguard Textile Company who use the railway for the movement of their goods in and out. There is only one train a day and the line is only nine miles long.</P>
    <P>I believe there have been second thoughts about that line.  I want to <Col N="342" /> give my support to keeping it open only on the basis that I think that if you look at the figures&mdash;I have not got them&mdash;you will find it is paying.  If anyone can produce figures that will convince me that there were large losses there, I will certainly not support keeping the line open.  However, I think the second thoughts which rumour has it are being had about that line should result in its being kept open.</P>
    <P>This Vote is rather like the Vote for the Department of Local Government in that we vote a figure of £5,000,000 but taking the operations of CIE, the Airports and aircraft companies, the Industrial Credit Company, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company, and so on, we are really talking of expenditure which would take a considerable amount of time to work out but which is certainly not less than £20,000,000. Taking one year with another, we do not know how such capital expenditure and losses go.  You have to take the operations of commercial banks and all these funding organisations which are used to further the intentions of the Minister for Transport and Power.  It is a very important Ministry.  When I look down the line at those sections of it referred to in the Minister's speech which require subsidisation and some of which might appear not to require it, I find that civil aviation, Shannon Airport, Dublin Airport, Cork Airport, Aer Lingus, Aerlínte, Aer Rianta and Irish Shipping, all have substantial losses.  A lot of good work could be done to retrieve these losses or to reduce them.  At the same time, there is the Shannon Free Airport Company, the Potez factory and turf development, where quite a lot of Government investment is involved.  That makes this Vote a very serious one indeed.</P>
    <P>This is one of the places where the Government are slipping.  I have tried not to be too critical but the Minister for Transport and Power is expert at glossing over the facts, at giving us the good side and forgetting about the bad side.  I have indicated certain places where all does not seem to be right.  I accuse the Government of bad housekeeping.  One of the wors <Col N="343" /> things a Government can be accused of is bad housekeeping because it means wasting not their own money but the people's money.  The Minister should reply not only to points that came from this side of the House but to those that came from the Deputies on his own side and also from Independents and Labour Deputies, so that we shall have more detailed information on the losses that have been mentioned and the expenditures that have not been justified.</P>

      <P>Deputy Costello opened the debate and spoke largely on the motion in the names of a number of Fine Gael Deputies.  I notice that the motion is in the name of Fine Gael Deputies from Dublin city or Dublin county.  There are no country Deputies' names there.  While those who signed the motion are Dublin Deputies and obviously only interested in Dublin and the increase in Dublin bus fares, it is strange they should have put down such a loose motion which makes it rather difficult for me to support it.</P>
      <P>The motion says:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann protests against the recent increase in bus fares&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>It does not say in Dublin.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and calls on the Government to introduce legislation so as to ensure that the poorer sections of the community are protected. ...</P>
      <P>Again I am rather mystified.  They do not say what they mean by &ldquo;the poorer sections&rdquo;.  Do they mean the unemployed, the old age pensioner or do they mean some of the employed workers?  They do not give any indication of what ought to be done.  If the motion is intended to come to the assistance only of the poorer sections, how could CIE know whether the person who boards the bus is a poor person or a well-to-do person?  The motion is not specific.  It does not say what it would appear to want to say, in the light of the fact that these are all Dublin Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If CIE have to meet almost £1,000,000 of an increase, mostly due <Col N="344" /> to the last general increase in wages, it stands to reason they must put up bus fares.  Everyone else increased the costs of production because they had to give increases in wages.  To suggest that CIE should not increase bus fares when they have to shell out another million pounds is ludicrous.  It is all very fine for Deputy Costello to say &mdash;and he was rubbing at me&mdash;that he hoped Deputies who attended meetings on the outskirts of the city would support him.  He was thinking of a meeting which he and I attended in Finglas a short while ago.</P>
    <P>It is my opinion that Deputies are not honest with the people.  I am not suggesting that particularly in relation to Deputy Costello but I remember at this meeting the crowd wanted all sorts of things and they were being promised all sorts of things by the representatives who were present.  One Deputy said something that did not please them and he was nearly &ldquo;lit on.&rdquo;  Another Deputy said: &ldquo;Do not say those things; say what they want to hear.&rdquo; Quoting what people say or are alleged to have said at gatherings in, say, housing estates is all nonsense.  I have long since learned all about politics.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by something I read in President Kennedy's book which was published some time ago.  He said that public representatives are frightened people and that they must go with the crowd.  That is true.  I have no faith in half the things that are said outside the House or in it.  I have no one to protect.  The one thing about being an Independent Deputy is that you have no one to protect.  If you are a member of a Party, you must protect the Party.  One man cannot say what he thinks, unless he is certain that he will not hurt another member of the Party.  He has to back down.  I do not have to back down.  I speak for myself and I can give as good as I take.  Parties have to protect their colleagues and I have to protect no one.  That is the difference between an Independent and a Party Member.</P>

      <P>If this motion were honest, as it is signed by Dublin <Col N="345" /> Deputies, it should protest against the increase in bus fares in Dublin, and it should be specific.  It should make reference to the poor sections in Dublin and provide against increased fares for the old age pensioners and the unemployed.  That would be specific. We had a deputation to CIE and the point we made was specific.  We said that certain people should have weekly tickets&mdash;that is specific&mdash;that whereas people who pay 1/- and upwards can have weekly tickets, we thought people who pay 8d. and upwards should have them.  That would cover the workers in Finglas and Ballyfermot, the people with whom we were largely concerned. They might save 1/- a week.  We also asked for a concession for the old age pensioners and disabled people.  We made a specific request that they should be allowed to travel at half fare.  These were specific requests but this motion does not say anything specific at all.  It protests against the increase in bus fares and refers to the poorer sections of the community all over the country.</P>
      <P>It stands to reason that if CIE have to pay an extra £1,000,000 as a result of a general increase in wages, the fares must increase, but specific concessions can be asked for.  I do not care so much about the country because the country Deputies can speak for themselves. I am concerned about Dublin because we are keeping up the whole country by paying for all the &ldquo;bum&rdquo; railways we hear all the talk about. Because the railways are losing money, we have to shell out in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I read in the Press that in the past nine months there was an increase in income of about £75,000 and it was stated that two-thirds of that increase came from Dublin, which means that we are actually paying twice as much as the rest of the country put together on those figures. Therefore we should have some grounds for asking for some concessions for the goose that lays the golden egg.  We ask simply that the workers should get a worker's ticket on which they would save 1/-.  That would be the same concession as the people who live in Portmarnock have who now pay <Col N="346" /> 1/- and upwards.  I ask the Minister at least to consider the point that the people in Dublin who pay 8d. and upwards and who live in Ballyfermot and Finglas should get a worker's ticket.</P>
    <P>I will go further and say that the people who have an income of only 32/6d. a week should not be asked to pay the same fares and the same increases as a worker earning £10 a week&mdash;and I am not saying he is earning a fortune.  The old age pensioner or the disabled man who has an income of only 32/6 or £2 a week should not have to pay the same fares as an unmarried man earning £10 a week.  That is not fair.  I am asking for these concessions which are already granted in some of the cities in England.  I am being specific.  I am not generalising like this motion, which means nothing, like the speakers at those meetings to which I referred.</P>
    <P>Be specific and say what you want. Let people know what it will cost. Do not make ludicrous generalisations which will read well in the newspapers but will not get anywhere.  I believe in a policy of getting somewhere.  I have had experience for ten years of the organised Parties demanding big reductions in differential rents.  I have never put down such a motion in my life because I know the local authority has no power to make such reductions, and such motions are only put down to cod the people.  I asked that the increase in social benefits should not be taken into account and the city manager agreed.  I have got four concessions in the past ten years for the worst off sections of the community and all the Parties never get anywhere because they just talk big to make an impression.  I agree in principle with the proposal in this motion but I do not agree with the motion because it is not specific.  It does not say what it wants.</P>

      <P>The motion simply refers to railways in particular.  There may be grounds in some cases why a particular railway should be saved but I accept the policy that where they do not pay, they should be closed.

      <P>We will probably be talking about taking up the tracks and paving the area for autobahns for heavy traffic.  All that will come.  To suggest that we should continue to maintain them because a handful of people want them is ludicrous.  If they are not paying, as a Dublin Deputy who speaks on behalf of the people to whom I have referred, I will not object to their being closed, unless there is some very good reason why a particular railway should be subsidised.  Generally speaking, they should be closed because they are obsolete.  I can understand that certain Deputies who represent certain areas have to shout, as the Dublin fellows have to shout.  They all shout, depending on who is shoving them. The rest of us have to see things in an overall way and make up our minds, if the company can economise and even make a small profit by providing a different service, such as a road service, whether it is better that it should be done in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all nonsense. The roads will pay for themselves.</P>
      <P>The only other point I want to raise is in relation to the ESB.  The Minister made a claim here that he cannot interfere with the day-to-day affairs of the company.  I can understand that but we expect him to have some influence and if we make a good point, that he will go along and use his good offices to get the ESB to give serious thought to what we suggest.</P>
      <P>I made the case before that it is a disgrace that the ESB should make a charge of 11/- every two months on an electricity meter.  I believe the gas company make no charge for the meter.  I understand that the gas company meter costs twice as much as the ESB meter.  While the cost of the meter, included in the cost of consumption, may not in round figures be a lot for people who have money, it means an awful lot to the poorer sections and by the poorer sections I mean the people on social benefits. Not all workers are poor and there is no use in saying they are.  The people in receipt of social benefits are certainly poor.</P>
      <P>It is a shame that people should be asked to pay 11/- every two months for something they may not use.  In the summer, they certainly will not use any electricity.  The old people go to bed early.  It is possible that with a view to economy, they would use very little light at any time.  All the time they are burdened with this 11/-, even if they only use a bob's worth of light in the two months.  Something should be done about the matter.  I raised this matter before and I shall continue to raise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person is using a lot of electricity, it does not matter, but where it is known that a person is just living on his own, and especially where it is shown that he is not using any light worth talking about, something should be done.  Would it not be possible for the ESB to instal a pay-as-you-use meter?  Whenever a person wants gas, all he has to do is put in a bob and he is finished with <Col N="349" /> it.  There are no meter charges.  I do not know why the ESB cannot do that.  I do not know why they expect 11/-, even if only a bob's worth of light is used.  I can understand it where electricity is being used but not where it is not being used or where it is little used.</P>

      <P>I should like to deal first with the position regarding Cork Airport and I should like to have some explanation from the Minister in regard to the reason for the big disparity in charges as between Dublin and London and Cork and London. As a matter of fact, I think the Cork-London charge is practically double. We in Cork are a go-ahead people and we believe in capturing all the markets we can.  I suggest to the Minister that it would be a very wise thing if he would arrange a proper freight service by air from Cork.  My friend, Deputy Meaney, can tell you that we are a sporting people and we keep a lot of greyhounds.</P>

      <P>We are not interested in the type of dog in which Deputy Dr. Browne or the Minister for Justice are interested.  We are interested in greyhounds. A friend of mine who had to send a greyhound to London recently found that the greyhound had first to go to Dublin.  He had first to come by air to Dublin and then go to London.  The sooner that condition of affairs is rectified the better.  Greyhounds are not always valuable animals.  In some cases people are likely to get rid of them sometimes. When you find that it costs more to send an old dog to London than it costs to send a human being, I suggest there is something wrong and I ask the Minister to rectify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, some of our people succeeded in getting a fairly considerable market for mutton and lamb on the continent, particularly in Switzerland. They encountered enormous difficulty, even if there is an airport in Cork, in getting any air transport to take the mutton and lamb to Switzerland, or even to France.  Here is an opportunity for air transport which, to my <Col N="350" /> mind, should be developed and very greatly developed.</P>
    <P>You have the same position practically in regard to early potatoes and fruit and vegetables.  A neighbour of mine, a small farmer with 22 acres of land, goes in fairly considerably for this kind of product.  He got £107 a ton for his potatoes last May in London but he lost £13 a ton because there was no freight transport by which they could be conveyed from Cork Airport to London.  That market took close upon 20,000 tons of early potatoes.  If there were proper freight facilities from Cork Airport, we would catch the market.  It is the same thing in regard to fruit and vegetables.  I would urge the Minister to speed up the freight services of Cork Airport. If he does that, I think that, when we come here next year, we will not have this great loss.</P>
    <P>I regret and deplore the Minister's attitude in regard to figures he was asked for in this House.  He told us point-blank that he would not even ask CIE to give them.  I cannot understand why another State body can supply us with figures.  I have here CIE figures in relation to the Mallow-Waterford line.  Here we have, for example, in relation to Castletownroche, 7,601 tons of beet with £1,710 4s. 6d. paid for it in Mallow. You have the same thing right down along.  You have listed every station with the tonnage of beet loaded and the amount paid for it.  We have what amounts to deliberate sabotage&mdash;I cannot call it anything else.  I have here one item which concerns 11,000 tons of beet signed for at Fermoy and Clondulane to go by rail.  CIE sent out their lorries and conveyed that beet by road, thus creating a loss of £5,000. There is £5,000 out of the £21,000 loss. Those people wanted to convey their beet by rail and signed a contract to have it conveyed by rail, but CIE conveyed it by road.  That is unjust.</P>
    <P>As the elected representatives of the people, we are entitled to get the figures.  It is no use for the Minister or CIE to tell us we are invited up for consultation.  We are prepared to consult, but we want to know what case we have to meet.  We want to <Col N="351" /> know the figures.  The Irish Sugar Company can give us the total figure for their share of the transport on that line&mdash;39,228 tons of beet at £22,229 10s. 3d.  That line stops in Mallow, so the figures in this case cannot be said to be financing any other line.  The revenue from the Kanturk-Newmarket line as given by CIE amounted to £1,300.  The Kanturk merchants alone brought in net receipts for £7,046.  What is wrong with those figures?</P>
    <P>We discussed most of these figures before and I do not want to keep at this matter here.  However, I honestly think the Minister's attitude should be different.  The Minister said he was ashamed of me.  I can honestly tell him that he brings the blush of shame to my cheeks more often than I bring it to his.</P>

      <P>I would remind the Minister of a statement made by the former Taoiseach, now the President, which should remain in the mind of every Deputy: &ldquo;Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.&rdquo; When the Minister is put in the position by any board of standing up here and saying there was an excellent bus service from Cork to Cobh, a place where no CIE bus service has existed for 25 years, he should not be fooled a second time.  My only regret is that he is so gullible.</P>

      <P>I find myself in the unusual position of reiterating what Deputy Corry has said, only I am tempted to do so in stronger language. However, I shall refrain from using the language I should use to the Minister.  The Minister's conduct in regard to this House, in regard to Deputies and in regard to me in particular has not been the conduct appropriate to a Minister of State.  I have been asking the Minister for a simple figure.  I have listened to a Government Deputy saying he has been refused the figure.  The Minister said he had no function and referred Deputy Corry to CIE, but CIE refused to give him the figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> Deputies have a right to ask the Minister for the figure.  If the Minister could say that he was embarrassed by the question because he had not got the figure, there would be something in that, but here we have the famous statement in page 5, paragraph 3, of the 12th annual report of CIE for the year ended 31st March, 1962.  I said in the House previously and I reiterate now that this is a dishonest figure. The statement says road services were substituted for rail services on the West Cork section as from the 1st of April, 1961, and goes on: &ldquo;Operating results during the year showed that the financial betterment from this substitution and from the substitution of road services for the West Clare and Waterford and Tramore railway lines last year was approximately £90,000.&rdquo; The Minister has the figures but he has boxed them all up together.</P>

I realise that the debate on the Transport Bill and the debate on the Estimate are separate, but I should like to know, for the sake of my reply, whether I may take it for granted that everything said on the Transport Bill can at least in theory, and therefore in practice, be restated in so many words on this Estimate.

I asked the Minister, as I was entitled to ask him, whether the bus service to Tramore is showing a profit.  I asked him that question on three separate occasions at Question Time, but on each occasion I was shelved off.  I asked him that question when the Transport Bill was before the House and he said he had given a reply last July.  I do not want any replies for last July.  I want the figure to the nearest available date.  I want the Waterford and Tramore figures separated from the West Clare and Cork figures.  I want the Minister to come in here and say we are losing money on the Waterford-Tramore bus service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister never told me whether or not the service was making a profit.  I am so anxious for the Minister to answer me that I will give way to him.  I ask the Minister if he will tell me whether the Waterford-Tramore bus service is paying.  The Minister has not yet answered that question.</P>
      <P>We were told before the wreckers went into operation that the Waterford-Tramore railway was losing £3,000.  We were then told it was losing £11,000.  We were lulled into a false security by the fact that the Taoiseach in 1958&mdash;he was then Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash; guaranteed to the House when the 1958 Bill was under discussion here that there was no use in Deputies coming in and putting in small provisos, and so on; no railway would be closed down without full consultation with the people concerned.  That is what he said.  I heard him myself and it is on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of those whose railways are now due for execution, I want to explain what that consultation was <Col N="354" /> in case they may be going for consultation with the connoisseurs at Kingbridge, believing that the consultation will be free, and they will be able to discuss the railway system.  In the consultation we had at Kingsbridge, we were not allowed to mention the word &ldquo;railway&rdquo;.  The railway was still in operation, but we were not allowed to mention it.</P>
    <P>I happened to mention the Chairman of CIE the last time I addressed this House and, before I got any further, the Minister jumped up and said he would not allow me to attack the Chairman of CIE.  I rather wondered why the Minister should have thought I was going to attack the Chairman of CIE.  All I was going to do was read a statement he made.  On that occasion, I gave way to the Minister and I said I would not mention his name any more.  But I will mention it now.  He is a public servant and we are paying him £5,500 a year.  I do not see why we should not mention his name.  We come here as Deputies and we are vulnerable to the slings and arrows of anyone who wants to attack us.  We stand up to it.  If we want to criticise a public servant, I do not see why we should not criticise him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Minister said.  There are 14,000 people working on the railway.  The Minister said I was a railway fanatic.  I want to repeat here that there was a small railway between Waterford and Tramore ; it was supposed to be losing £3,000.  In a speech made here by the Minister last week on the Transport Bill, he said he did not want trains going up and down the country with nobody in them.  But look at the railway the Minister picked on.  The Minister says he has the responsibility. He picked on this small railway.  There are only two stations on it&mdash;Waterford and Tramore.  I have the figures here; 550,000 people travelled on that railway in the last year of its operation. It was alleged to be losing £3,000.</P>
      <P>Deputies might think that I am overdoing it coming in here and speaking on this matter but I will never get over the injustice of this.  I see from the Minister's brief that he thinks nothing of spending half a million pounds on Shannon Airport which was used by only a comparatively few of our own people in the year.  We can lose anything we like on Irish Shipping.  I have nothing to say about that.  We have to keep all these prestige companies attached to the Minister's Department for which he says he has responsibility but for which he will not stand up here and take responsibility when he is asked a Parliamentary Question about them.  If he says that he had to close down the Tramore Railway because it was losing a miserable £3,000, he should be ashamed of himself.  Since this session opened, I have asked the Minister consistently if the bus service he substituted for the Waterford-Tramore railway service has shown a profit.  He has the figures and I know that if he could turn up and proudly say the service had shown a profit, he would throw it at us but it has shown a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he has responsibility but he has put up the fares by 1/-a head.  Deputy Kyne said, and practically all Deputies know, that this small railway line was a great amenity for the mothers of young families who could bring their children to Tramore <Col N="358" /> by train in safety.  The Minister said that the bus service was bringing the people nearer to the beach.  That is in the Official Reports.  I said at the time that he did not know what he was talking about, and he did not know what he was talking about because the bus service does not bring the people nearer the beach.</P>
    <P>The Minister last year made wisecracks about the Tramore Workers' Association who chartered a bus for themselves and who, thank God, skimmed some of the cream off his bus service.  That bus service travels to and from Tramore and members of the association are able to travel four journeys a day for 10/- a day.  The Minister says he has a better and more adequate service but he is charging 18/-.  I hope Deputies in Cork will remember this and that if they take up the lines between Youghal and Cork, the beet growers, who have a good association, will form themselves into a group and hire their own lorries to carry the beet.</P>
    <P>The Minister might say that I have gone to war with CIE.  I have not done so but I have gone to war with the man who said here tonight that he is responsible for the policy of CIE. I have here the Waterford edition of the <i>Evening Herald</i> published on last Monday night which contains an extract from a speech made by the Mayor of Waterford, Councillor John Griffin, at a meeting in Youghal on Saturday last, presided over by Deputy Corry.  This is interesting and I would like the Minister to hear it.  The Mayor said:</P>
    <P>It is clear now that an autocratic decision of a transport official or officials can spell the social or economic degradation of a selected region.</P>
    <P>The Mayor went on to refer to Dr. Wade of Cambridge, who was invited here by the Minister for Local Government and whom many Deputies may have heard lecturing on town planning.  Recently he went to various centres and I attended a lecture given by him illustrated with plans and slides.  He showed the great problems of the roads and traffic and the actual planning of housing schemes and factories <Col N="359" /> and so on.  This is the important extract from the report:</P>
    <P>Dr. Wade, the eminent planner of Cambridge, has publicly stated, as editorially commented upon in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, that Dr. Beeching who is busily closing the railways of Britain&mdash;</P>
    <P>he is the counterpart of the Minister here&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has no counterpart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThaddeusLynch" hpid="Mr. T. Lynch Mr. T. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that Dr. Beeching would answer Parliamentary Questions about British Railways, if he were asked them.  He would not do what the Minister is doing to this House.  But Dr. Wade went on to say that this policy is injuring Britain very seriously and said that a halt should be called to the closing of railways and the taking up of railway lines.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have said, as I myself have said, that the Minister should channel more of the heavy traffic on to the railways, even by means of legislation and he would be serving the country well.  He should consult the Minister for Local Government to see what could be done in this regard.  I came up today from Waterford and joined the usual funeral procession behind a CIE lorry which was belching fumes and poisoning everybody on the road.  It was pulling an enormous trailer and it was an enormous lorry.  We are told that many of our bridges can carry only 20 tons but CIE, for which the Minister is responsible, is putting 40 tons on some of these lorries.  That traffic should be channelled back on to the railways and so make the roads safer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can get these nice balance sheets from the gentleman I am not allowed attack but I will mention his name, Dr. Andrews, and we can come into this House and protest when the Minister says that a rail line is to be torn up.  Somebody tonight said you would then have to call on the ratepayers. It does not matter whether you call on the ratepayers or the taxpayers <Col N="360" /> because they are all the same. The taxpayers have already been stabbed.  For the past four years, there has been a new subvention from the Department of Local Government which was forced out of that Department by the Minister we are allowed to attack.  I remember the Minister for Local Government being brought in to this House by Deputy Kyne and myself and we warned that if the Minister for Transport and Power tore up the Tramore-Waterford line, a substantial amount of money would have to be spent on the road from Waterford to Tramore.  Both the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Transport and Power said there never would be any such thing but a sum of £22,000 has already gone on taking one bend from one bridge.</P>
    <P>That is not a big amount of money in terms of the Road Fund.  It is not a big amount of money compared with what Shannon Airport is losing but he could not lose £3,000 on the Tramore railway.  In the past four years, the action of the Minister in tearing up railway lines has compelled the Minister for Local Government, according to the figures he has given me&mdash;we can get figures from some Ministers&mdash;to spend £1,300,000 which has been taken out of the Road Fund for what his officials call special road-railway grants.  That money would be better spent doing the secondary roads and the boreens up to the farmers' houses.</P>

      <P>Yes, to be sure.  I have been told by reliable authorities, by people who have spent their lives at this business, that it is recognised now by the great experts at Kingsbridge that they made a blunder when they took up the Tramore railway but the Minister is still unconverted.  He will come in here and try to justify the brutal tearing up of that line and I will keep on saying what I am saying, as long as the Minister holds the position he is in, that the disruption of this line was an insult to the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was done in an insolent and <Col N="361" /> vicious way, in an arrogant way. Local representatives were not allowed to say a word about it, even though we had the Taoiseach's word that there would be prior consultation.  The Taoiseach's word was broken by this Minister because there was no prior consultation.  Waterford County Council and Waterford Corporation bravely said that they would pass an estimate to cover the alleged loss, in order to allow it to stand for one year.  But the decision to close it had been made by the Minister; he had his mind made up and would not reprieve the line.  In case any pressure might be brought to bear on him from his own side of the House or from this side, the railway was closed at 2.30 p.m. on a Saturday in December and, in the teeming rain on Monday morning, the ganger was sent out with his full gang and they were paid a bonus and overtime to tear down the railway bridge.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will keep on repeating it.  I have been sent here by the people of Waterford to do so.  The Minister went to Waterford to a chamber of commerce dinner and when he came back, he said he had not heard any complaints there about the tearing up of the railway.  He must have a very good public relations officer in Waterford because none of the people he met there travelled on the railway or know the people who travelled on it.  The railway was able to do for some what the bus service is not able to do.  The ordinary working man's wife was able to pack four or five children into what was called a Tramore pram&mdash;it was not the best pram in the house&mdash;wheel the pram to the station, throw it into the van and bring the children into the carriage with her.  She was able to do this at a fraction of what she has to pay now. She will be charged 3/6 to bring the <Col N="362" /> pram out in the bus.  Needless to say, the bus is like any other bus but they have built on a kind of a boot which will take about four of these prams.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that more people use the bus service.  I asked him how many more people and he gave me a kind of a figure of 40,000. One might think that strange but he included in that figure the people who travel by the workmen's bus.  He has nothing to do with them at all.</P>

It was a purely passenger railway.  The kind of passengers for whom the Tramore railway was a great public amenity are no longer able to travel.  I know what the people on the Rialto in Waterford are saying but, when the Minister went to Waterford, he went to the Doge's palace and would not know what was happening on the Rialto.</P>

The first I heard that there might be a danger of the Waterford-Mallow line closing was on the Rialto.  I was told there was a man breaking up engines on the railway and he had gone to the big railway bridge in Waterford to do some hammering.  He was heard to say that it would take boats to take it down.  If they were going to take <Col N="363" /> that down, it would be a great opportunity to bring the boats down to where the three noble rivers meet and take down the great Barrow bridge also.  There would be many ships under flags of convenience sailing back to southern European ports loaded up with this material for Czechoslovakia where they sold the rails before.</P>

      <P>Somebody must be responsible.  CIE are responsible or else he must be pinching the rails from CIE.  We are entitled to talk about this because with the big programme of railway wrecking that is before us, we would not want to have this happen again.  All these rails were sold to some Czechoslovakian; they were not sold by public tender and on the Rialto I was told there were many Irish firms that would like to have tendered for them.  When the Tramore railway was destroyed, I brought this matter before the Minister who has admitted he was responsible.  The Tramore rails were sold by tender and an Irish firm got them.  It is very important that if the wrecking goes on and if an Irish firm wants these rails and can use them in some manufacturing process, whether for rolling mild steel or for uprights for cow houses, the Irish firm should get a chance of tendering for them.  When the famous deal came off with the Czechoslovakians, it would appear our rails were <Col N="365" /> being smuggled out of the country the way the job was being done.</P>

      <P>It was a very doubtful proposition.  Some kind of Czechoslovakian ship came into Cork, flying a Puerto Rican flag or, as they say, a flag of convenience.  These goods were put on this boat and irate Deputies from Kerry, Deputy Palmer and Deputy Spring, drew attention to it in the House.  They put down Questions to the Minister as to where this boat was going with the rails and, true to form, he would not tell them.  If the Minister thinks we have anything in for him, he is right.  I am looking at some of his colleagues there with whom I have had many a hard clash, but to give them their due, when I put down Questions asking for figures I got them.  This Minister comes in here and brazenly tells the House he is the man responsible.  If he is responsible, why does he not give us the figures?</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry seems to be a better accountant of the CIE figures than the Minister for Transport and Power and seems to know a great deal more about their ramifications.  I am thinking the wrong man was appointed Minister for Transport and Power.  I heard a Dublin Deputy stating here tonight that he was sorry that nobody but the Dublin Deputies had put down a Question about bus fares, that nobody down the country <Col N="366" /> bothered about it.  I did not see the Dublin Deputies coming into the House and supporting my colleagues and me when we were making a fight for our small railway.  I was interested in the way this Deputy was defending the Minister and conveying to the Minister that he need not bother about us fellows, that he would vote with the Minister on this.  He said we should always propose something specific and concluded by saying that something should be done.  I do not intend to say something should be done.</P>
      <P>I shall have a lot more to say tomorrow about these railways but I shall say this much to the Minister. He said tonight that he is the man responsible but at Question Time he says he has no responsibility.  I invite him to introduce some measure into the Oireachtas to give the Oireachtas the supreme responsibility of the genuine ultimate control of the national transport system.</P>
      <P>The Mayor of Waterford said last Saturday that the Government should set up a small commission served by experts but not dominated by them to report on the changes necessary in our transport system in the light of rural, social and economic conditions.  Pending the commission's report, CIE should be required by an emergency Act of the Oireachtas to see that no further dismantling of the existing transport installations takes place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Questions which I tabled today and which, with your permission, Sir, I now raise on the Adjournment, relate to the sale of a drug known as preludin and to the absence of any bureau of standards for drugs and medicines.  The House generally will recollect that some time ago here and elsewhere there was considerable public anxiety in regard to the effects on expectant mothers of a drug known as thalidomide.  In different parts of the world, those effects are still felt in human misery and in fearful social problems.  Fortunately we <Col N="367" /> in this country were spared the effects of that drug and, indeed, the Minister for Health very properly took action in regard to it.  He banned and prohibited the sale of all drugs which were in any way associated with thalidomide.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, I received a telephone call from a representative of a well-known paper, the <i>Evening Herald.</i> The person who phoned me asked me whether I had taken any action as a Deputy about the drug known as preludin.  I had to confess to him that I was not aware of that drug or of any queries about it.  He informed me that a day or two before, there was a news item in the English <i>Daily Mail</i> about that drug and reference to a comment in the current issue of the British Medical Journal, and that it was reported that the drug had been banned by the Ministers of Health in Italy, Denmark, Spain and Sweden.</P>
      <P>Having learned of that situation I tabled Questions Nos. 2 and 4 on today's Order Paper.  Following the tabling of those questions, and before they were answered, I read in today's paper a statement issued by the Minister for Health in which he, in effect, exercised the powers available to him to ban the sale, except on medical prescription, of preludin and also a drug known as meclozine.  I should say that on Saturday this drug meclozine was also banned on the Continent.</P>
      <P>I want to assure you, Sir, that the Questions which I tabled on this matter were intended to direct the attention of the Minister to the possible dangers arising from the possible use or consumption of these drugs.  I am glad that he took action but I now raise the question of why this action was taken.  I cannot help feeling that were it not for the telephone communication which I received, were it not for the Parliamentary Questions which I tabled the prohibition which the Minister announced this morning might not have been announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That raises a very serious problem in relation to the possible hazards to the people of this country from a drug <Col N="368" /> which may be purchased in any chemist's shop without any doctor's prescription.  I do not know whether the Minister was in his office in the Custom House last Saturday.  If he were, he would probably have been informed of these two Questions, but if he was not there on Saturday and went in last Monday, he would have heard of them then.  That raises with me the necessity for insisting on having what was the subject of Question No. 4 today, a bureau of standards to deal with drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>I have raised the question of a bureau of standards on a number of occasions in this House.  I want to remind the Minister that in 1960 when certain tariffs were being imposed on imported drugs and medicines, it was suggested that some standard should be applied to the medicinal preparations which were available to our people.  It was first raised in a Parliamentary Question to the Minister on 2nd March, 1960, by Deputy Dr. Browne who asked the Minister if he was aware that the President of the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland had recommended the establishment of a pharmaceutical control laboratory. The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>... although I have seen a Press report of a statement attributed to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is, the President of the Pharmaceutical Society&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in October last, when a customs duty was imposed on certain imported medical preparations, which mentioned that we have no bureau of standards for drugs here.</P>
    <P>I am at present giving urgent consideration to the question of the provision of a service of the type which a pharmaceutical control laboratory could provide.</P>
    <P>Shortly afterwards in the same month, I raised the matter on the Imposition of Duties Bill, 1960, with the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Indeed, he is reported in the Official Report, Volume 180, column 1233, as saying:</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it would be a good thing to establish a bureau of standards here <Col N="369" /> and he goes on to refer to the fact that the matter is engaging the attention of the Minister for Health.  Then at Column 1257 in the same volume the Minister for Industry and Commerce said:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health has stated that he envisages an even more technical type of organisation. In reply to a Question by Deputy Dr. Browne some few weeks ago, he stated that he was giving urgent consideration to the establishment of what he described himself as a pharmaceutical control laboratory. The Minister made that statement on 2nd March, and when he says he is giving urgent attention to the matter, I am sure he means what he says. </P>
    <P>And so did everybody else feel that, when the Minister gave that undertaking on 2nd of March, he meant what he said.  I am troubled and concerned that now, over two and a half years later, there is no pharmaceutical control laboratory.  There is no bureau of standards.  The prohibition of a drug which was extensively used in this country only took place following the tabling by an individual Deputy of a Parliamentary Question in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that at a stage and in an era when the entire world is being snowed under by expensive advertisements of one kind or another for magic drugs and wonder pills of a variety of kinds, when all these pills and drugs can be imported and purchased at any chemist's shop without the intervention of any medical prescription, there is obviously a danger&mdash; and a very grave danger&mdash;that serious harm may be done, as was done to countless hundreds of unfortunate families on the Continent of Europe, unless there is some form of investigation.</P>
    <P>May I remind the Minister that thalidomide, which ravaged England and the continent, did not affect us. That was our good fortune.  Thalidomide was never sold in the United States of America.  It was not sold there because one doctor&mdash;a lady doctor who held an important post in America and who had the giving of a <Col N="370" /> licence for its sale&mdash;had certain reservations in regard to its properties.  She withheld the giving of the licence and it was never issued.  By the time considerable pressure was being brought to bear on her Department, the whole story had emerged.  That pinpoints the fact that in the United States a very strict supervision is exercised with regard to medicinal preparations and drugs of different kinds.  No drug or medicine may be sold in the United States except by licence issued by the appropriate health authority.</P>
    <P>In this country, unless there is actual <i>ad hoc</i> interference by the Minister for Health, the only legal sanction that could be exercised in relation to the sale of medicinal preparations is that contained in the Food and Drugs Act.  It is merely a right of action in relation to the sale of a particular preparation on the basis that it does not correspond with the nature and substance of that which, in fact, was ordered.  That is very much a case in which water has gone under the bridge and flowed away.  It certainly does not protect the people in relation to a whole variety of new medicinal preparations with fancy names, wonderfully advertised, the properties of which may not be known.</P>
    <P>The Minister said at Question Time today that I was, perhaps, unaware of his recent statement at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fhéis.  I want to assure the Minister that I follow him everywhere he goes, although I stop short of the doors of the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis.  I watch everything he says and I read with interest what he said at the Árd Fheis about the difficulties of establishing a bureau of standards here.  I can see those difficulties and I concede they exist but if there is not to be a bureau of standards, if that is impossible from an administrative point of view, then at least some other form of scientific screening should be available in this country.  At least, can we not act automatically in relation to the steps taken by health authorities on the continent or elsewhere at the moment?</P>
    <P>If, before the Minister's ban, thalidomide had been refused a licence in America, nothing would <Col N="371" /> have been here to prevent its sale in our chemist shops.  I heard the Minister say to himself: &ldquo;That is untrue&rdquo;.  It is not, in fact, untrue. The fact that at the moment a licence is withheld in another country does not prevent the sale of the particular drug or medicine here.</P>
    <P>I am glad of the fact that most manufacturers of drugs and medicines act in a responsible and public-spirited manner.  In fact, if any question arises to their knowledge in relation to a particular preparation, they withdraw it from sale.  That is fortunate but it does not guarantee that in all cases that will be the position.  There is a grave and definite margin for error here.  The matter is too serious to be allowed to stay in the situation it is in.  The Minister said in March, 1960 that this whole problem was engaging his urgent attention.  That is two and a half years ago.  Certain things have happened since that should not have happened.  All I am anxious to ensure is that as a matter of urgency some such bureau be established here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, in a manner which I think is unworthy of a person who held the office of Minister for Health and who knows that the Minister for Health must act in a responsible manner, has endeavoured to prejudice consideration of this question by harping and reharping on the tragedy of thalidomide.  Thalidomide has nothing to do with the question he is raising on the Order Paper.  The question on the Order Paper related to a drug of another kind, preludin.  The Deputy says that were it not for the fact that he put a question down&mdash; inspired, apparently, by the <i>Evening Herald</i> on information supplied to him by the <i>Evening Herald</i>&mdash;I would not have acted in relation to preludin as I did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, let me say this.  When the Deputy informed this House that the <i>Evening Herald</i> had told him on Friday that this drug had been banned in a number of countries, including Italy and Spain, this statement was not accurate.  It was banned in Italy but <Col N="372" /> it was not banned in Spain and, I believe, is not yet banned in Spain. When the Deputy comes in here and accuses me of being lethargic and of being absent from the Department on Saturday, he should at least base his allegations upon a fact and not upon a misstatement.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to preludin?  What has happened which moved certain health authorities, including this health authority, within the past few days&mdash;not over the past month or two months but within the past few days dating from the week-end&mdash;to take action in relation to preludin?  It was a letter which appeared in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> on 17th November, 1962, over the names of two doctors, one I think a general practitioner and the other a specialist brought in on a case.  I had better read part of this letter:</P>
    <P>In 1958 a 35-year-old woman was delivered spontaneously of a full term, male infant which showed evidence of blue asphyxia at birth and died an hour afterwards.  The following year she had a normal child.  In 1960 an apparently normal pregnancy ended in the spontaneous delivery of a full term female infant which was cyanosed and died within a few minutes of birth.  By a previous marriage she had had three normal children and two miscarriages.</P>
    <P>Almost identical abnormalities were found in the two infants which died.  While no external malformation or defect was present, there was in each a huge defect of the left diaphragmatic leaf with herniation of the stomach, ileum, proximal colon, pancreas, and spleen into the thorax, and displacement of the normal intrathoracic viscera to the right.  The left lung was rudimentary in each instance.</P>
    <P>In the fourth to twelfth weeks of the two pregnancies which ended in a malformed infant, and not in any of the other pregnancies, the mother took &ldquo;preludin&rdquo; (phenmetrazine hydrochloride) one tablet (25 mg.) thrice daily.  The drug had been obtained without prescription and was taken, on the advice <Col N="373" /> of a friend, on account of weight gain, the mother not realising initially that she was pregnant.  It is noted that although phenmetrazine was added to Part I of the Poisons List and placed in Part B of the Fourth Schedule in 1960 obesity in pregnancy is still listed as one of the possible indications for its use. </P>
    <P>That is the occurrence.  I do not want to dilate on the fact that there were some other abnormalities in the case of infants born to this woman which were not traceable to preludin, though it is not insignificant that there were.  With regard to the drug, however, the two doctors went on to say this:</P>
    <P>While it may be only a remarkable coincidence that the two pregnancies in which preludin was taken each ended in a similarly deformed infant the possibility that preludin was responsible for the deformities cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>Was there ever a milder statement of a suspicion than that?  The doctors were quite careful to say no more than that in their view the possibility of a casual association between the drug and the deformities could not be ignored.  The drug in question is being made by a reputable firm and they, having regard to the history of thalidomide, immediately took steps to try to make the facts known wherever the drug was sold.  So far as I am aware, the drug preludin was banned in Italy either on the 23rd or the 24th of this month, that is, either last Friday or Saturday.  Since then another drug, not preludin, was banned in Denmark and Sweden, and also in Holland.</P>

      <P>I take my information from official sources.  It would be well if the Deputy would verify the accuracy of his statements&mdash;I do not want in any way to suggest that he tells untruths&mdash;before he makes them.  We should not have had this manifestation on his part of, if I may say so, vanity.  The Deputy comes in and puts down a question on Saturday and subsequently I take action, which was responsible and well considered action, action which had been under consideration for days before.  From this Deputy O'Higgins wishes the public to infer that I took action because he put down a question! He suggests that if he had not put down a question, the action would not have been taken! Could there be a more <Col N="375" /> absurd example of the fallacy <i>post hoc, propter hoc?</i> This has been under consideration in my Department for a long time.</P>

      <P>It is such a difficult problem that even the British, with all their resources, have not yet been able to deal with it.  If the Deputy is so well informed, why did he not read the report by Lord Cohen of Birkenhead about the bureau of standards.  What did that report of a sub-committee of the Advisory Council&mdash;a sub-committee which consisted of the most eminent representatives of the medical, surgical and pharmaceutical professions in Great Britain&mdash;say?  It said the sub-committee had carefully considered the matter but for the <Col N="376" /> present firmly rejected as neither desirable nor practicable the suggestion that at this stage of their evaluation the responsibility for testing drugs should be transferred to a central authority.  The very thing Deputy O'Higgins proposes has been rejected by this body of professional experts.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins is a very good and sound lawyer.  He is excelled by no one at making a bad case appear to be a good one and making an unsound case appear to be a plausible one, but I cannot rate him very highly either as a medical practitioner or as a therapeutic chemist.</P>
