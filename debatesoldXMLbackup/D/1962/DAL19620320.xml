    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state (a) the date upon which Paul Singer was first arrested; (b) the date upon which he was first returned for trial to the Dublin Circuit Court by the District Justice; (c) the date upon which an indictment against Paul Singer was lodged in the Dublin Circuit Court; (d) the reason for the delay in lodging the indictment in the Dublin Circuit Court; and (e) what directions (if any) have been given to ensure that indictments against persons returned for trial will be lodged without undue delay, and the date upon which such directions were given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Paul Singer was first arrested on 30th May, 1959.  He was first returned for trial to the Dublin Circuit Court by the District Justice on 23rd January, 1960.  The indictment against him was lodged on 27th April, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The delay in lodging the indictment <Col N="2" /> arose because of the enormous number of depositions and exhibits which had to be copied.</P>
    <P>I am aware of no undue delay in lodging indictments and no special directions in this regard have recently been found necessary.</P>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the number of counts in the indictment against Paul Singer which were quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that such counts were bad for duplicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Four counts on the indictment against Paul Singer were quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground that they were bad for duplicity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the grave public anxiety resulting from the failure of the court to be given an opportunity to adjudicate these matters on their merits on account of the technical difficulties <Col N="3" /> which the Taoiseach has mentioned in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt whether I could or should say anything that would appear to be a reflection on the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Taoiseach to consider whether in fact the technical difficulties described by him in the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal must not be regarded as some reflection on the efficacy of the law officials of the Government in preparing this case for submission to the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that may be so, but I do not think that the verdict of the court could have been anticipated.  I am afraid it is too technical for me to offer an opinion on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach how many days or parts of days were occupied in connection with the criminal proceedings against Paul Singer (a) in the District Court in taking depositions on the first occasion; (b) in the <i>Habeas Corpus</i> proceedings instituted by Paul Singer (i) in the High Court and (ii) in the Supreme Court; (c) in the District Court in taking depositions on the second occasion; (d) in the prohibition proceedings; (e) in the first trial in the Central Criminal Court; and (f) in the appeal brought by Paul Singer to the Court of Criminal Appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information required by the Deputy is as follows: (a) 63 days, (b) (i) 2 days, (ii) 6 days; (c) 26 days, (d) 10 days, (e) 26 days, and (f) 27 days.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the foreman of the jury in the first trial of Paul Singer was an investor in Shanahan's Stamp Auctions Limited, and had a claim against the Company in liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to both parts of the Deputy's question are in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach <Col N="4" /> whether the prosecution in relation to the jury panel in the first trial of Paul Singer took any steps to determine who, if any, of the jurymen on the panel they might challenge when a jury was being empanelled to try Paul Singer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure was followed in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the Taoiseach's opinion that it was a very strange dereliction of duty on the part of the law officers of the State to allow a jury to be empanelled, when they had a right to object, which contained not only a man who was a servant of the liquidator but a man who had a personal interest in the transactions in respect of which the defendant was being tried?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that a member of the jury was an employee of a firm of accountants concerned in the liquidation proceedings became known some days after the trial began but was not regarded as being important by prosecuting counsel, the Registrar or the trial judge, nor was it the reason for the subsequent appeal, which was based on the fact that this member of the jury was found to be an investor in the company, a matter which was not known to the prosecuting counsel or the judge or, if we accept his affidavit, to the defendant himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the fact that the man in question was indirectly a servant of the liquidator and the company in respect of which many of these charges were being tried was a matter that should have been brought to the attention of the trial judge the moment it became known to the law officers of the State?  Is it not a fact that after this information became available to the law officers within 24 hours of the proceedings having commenced, they were not brought to the attention of either the judge or the defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the trial judge was so informed. The point I am making is that the subsequent successful appeal was <Col N="5" /> based on the grounds that the individual concerned was personally involved as an investor in the company. If the Deputy studies the judgment of the Appeal Court which I had placed in the Library at his request, he will find that the appeal was upheld by the judge on the grounds, first, that the juror should have himself indicated this interest in the case and, secondly, that the trial judge should have warned all the members of the jury panel of the obligation to reveal any such interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely in view of the very peculiar circumstances surrounding this case in which so many people have suffered loss, it was an ordinary precaution for counsel for the State to ascertain if any of the members of the jury were themselves losers or were interested parties in order to take the necessary precautions to ensure that nobody with an interest in the case should be a member of the jury?  Even if it had happened after one, two or three days of the trial, it would have been a valid case on which counsel for the State should seek the discharge of the jury and to ask for a trial with a fresh jury which would not be open to any challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the responsibility for the preparation of the jury panel rests on the county registrar but I think it fair to point out that it would be a difficult task for him to check each juror, in view of the fact that some 30,000 people in Dublin were said to have been interested as investors in this concern.  The fact that the juror in question was interested in that way did not come to light until after the trial was over.  That applies not only to counsel on behalf of the State but it was not known to the defendant, as was stated in his affidavit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will agree that if the fact was known to counsel for the State at any stage in the trial, it should have been brought to the notice of the trial judge and indeed of the defendant also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  The trial judge would have been informed of it.</P>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the liquidator of Shanahan's Stamp Auctions Limited gave evidence at the first trial of Paul Singer and was called as a witness on behalf of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to both parts of this question are in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Attorney General was made aware in the early stages of the first trial of Paul Singer in the Central Criminal Court that the foreman of the jury was a member of the staff of the firm of accountants, one of whose partners was the liquidator of Shanahan's Stamp Auctions Limited; and, if not, at what date the Attorney General was first made aware of this fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 7 also asks for the date on which the Attorney General got the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the Attorney General was made aware of the fact that the foreman was employed by this firm of accountants a couple of days after the trial began but it was understood that he had nothing to do with the firm's handling of the affairs of the company.  The matter became known through the county registrar who also, I understand, informed the judge, and it was assumed that any action necessary would have been taken by the court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that at that stage something ought to have been done by the Attorney General to inform the court, through counsel for the State, of this fact and that the defendant should certainly have been warned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am told that the trial judge was informed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Was he informed in open court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. This had nothing to do with the <Col N="7" /> appeal.  The appeal was not on the ground that the foreman of the jury was employed by Craig, Gardners, but that he personally was an investor in the stamp auctioneering company. If the Deputy will study the decision of the judge in the Court of Criminal Appeal, he will find that no importance was attached to the character of the juror's employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that and I have read the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The Taoiseach will agree with me that it is unfortunate that this information was not elicited in public court and communicated simultaneously not merely to the court but to the defendant and, if necessary, a new jury empanelled to try the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether a count in the indictment on the first trial of Paul Singer covered a sum of nearly £800,000; and whether this count &ldquo;overlapped&rdquo; other charges and because of such &ldquo;overlapping&rdquo; and other defects the Court of Criminal Appeal held that it could not order a re-trial on this count involving nearly £800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to both parts of the question are in the affirmative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree with me that where a man <Col N="8" /> stands charged with being concerned in the disappearance of £800,000, it is unfortunate that these charges could never be determined clearly by the court on account of technical defects in the indictment and that the matter of fraudulent misrepresentation was never raised and, if so, would the Taoiseach agree with me that these defects reflect gravely on the law officers of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the first trial of Paul Singer and that verdict was set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal on the ground I have mentioned, namely, that a person interested as an investor in the business was a member of the jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And also for the reasons stated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Deputy to read the decision of the judge in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I do not think it would be right for me to attempt to interpret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach be prepared to say that he agrees that the general conduct of the proceedings does suggest some grave inadequacy on the part of the law officers of the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. One of the characteristics of our system of law is that where a person is charged with a criminal offence, he is deemed innocent until proved guilty, and he must be proved guilty in accordance with evidence produced in court and very complicated procedures and rules designed to protect the interests of the defendant.  The fact that the State failed to get a conviction, whether on technical grounds or otherwise, does not necessarily indicate any defects in the State's procedure.  Also, I think we should be very careful ourselves not to do an injustice as, no matter what suspicions may be held, the fact is that the individual concerned has not been found guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I entirely sympathise with the Taoiseach's view of the extreme care necessary in these cases, <Col N="9" /> which largely accounts for the delay in my raising the matter as I have now done.  Bearing in mind all the Taoiseach has said, does he advert to the fact that a young man, who can be described as little else than the innocent servant of the defendant, has served 15 months' hard labour for charges arising out of identical incidents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate issue.  On the main issue, may I again refer the Deputy to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal?  He will find quoted in that judgment&mdash;and I only learned of this myself when I read it&mdash;a very large number of references to somewhat similar cases where the verdicts of court were set aside because of technical considerations of similar character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not aware of the fact at this stage that a considerable number of honest credulous Irish citizens have been financially plucked and the State's legal machine has done nothing to protect them?  Its chief achievement appears to me to be&mdash;and I think others hold the same view&mdash;to make a legendary character out of the chief plucker of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The State took the proceedings open to it in this case.  It tried to secure a different outcome by reason of the evidence produced and the arguments advanced.  I would ask the Deputy to keep in mind that in this community it is not merely enough to suspect someone&mdash;it must also be proved in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not an obvious fact that charges involving £800,000 were so framed, handled and dealt with, that no verdict on the merits of those charges was possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="The Taoiseach Seán F. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not perfectly clear to everyone in the country, even if it is not to the Taoiseach or if he will not admit it, that what happened was that the courts were not able to give a verdict on the merits of the charges <Col N="10" /> involving £800,000 as to whether they were true or false?  Is it not a fact that the matters were so handled by someone that there could not be an indictment?</P>

      <P>The Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1952, made under section 44 of the Health Act, 1947 (as amended), apply to a person who is prevented, by reason of treatment for a specified infectious disease, from making reasonable and proper provision for his own maintenance or the maintenance of his dependants.  The determination of the amount of allowance to be paid in any particular case rests with the local health authority who must decide what allowance, if any, within the maximum prescribed in the Regulations, would be appropriate having regard to the purpose of the Regulations, and it follows that income from other sources must be taken into account.  In a reply to a recent question from the Deputy about these allowances, I explained that where, in exceptional cases, a health authority considers that undue hardship would be caused by adhering strictly to this policy, they have discretion to disregard such other income in whole or in part.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the people of Crossakiel, County Meath, are disturbed at the proposal under consideration that Crossakiel dispensary district and the bordering dispensary district of Clonmellon, County Westmeath, might be served by the same district medical officer.  It is understood that this proposal was unanimously agreed to by the members of Meath County Council at their meeting of 5th February last.</P>
      <P>As there were only 291 persons covered by medical cards on 27th October, 1961, in the Crossakiel dispensary district it was suggested that the appointment of a separate district medical officer for the area was not warranted as the area could be served conveniently by the district medical officer of the Clonmellon dispensary district which had 657 persons covered by medical cards on 13th October, 1961.  The doctor would give the same service in the Crossakiel area as given by the doctors previously appointed for the area and would in fact reside nearer to Ardglasson, where the dispensary for the area is located, than his predecessors who resided in Kells, nine miles away.  It is understood that Westmeath County Council propose to build a residence for the doctor in the town of Clonmellon. which is only five miles from Ardglasson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With the premission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 to 28 together.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the relief of distress is a matter for local initiative in the first instance.  In so far as it might be necessary for local authorities to borrow for the purpose, the Government would be prepared to facilitate them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in reply to similar questions by Deputies last week, the Government is unable to accept liability, by way of the creation of a fund or otherwise, for compensation to private individuals or business concerns <Col N="19" /> who suffered losses as a result of the recent flooding.  The creation of a fund by the State to meet possible future losses would also be impracticable.</P>
    <P>I wish to repeat that it is open to persons who have suffered damage of a structural nature to their private dwellings to apply to the Department of Local Government for a grant under the Housing Acts towards the cost of repairing the damage.  Local authorities are empowered to make supplementary grants for the same purpose, and may apply for loans from the Local Loans Fund to cover the capital cost involved.  Losses sustained by traders as a result of stock being damaged by flooding would be allowable for income tax purposes in so far as they are not covered by insurance.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>The repair of damage caused by recent flooding is a matter in the first instance for the persons and bodies concerned.  I have no funds at my disposal for the making of grants to local authorities to remedy or repair flood damage, and no arrangements are contemplated for special financial assistance by way of grants or lowinterest loans.  State subsidies are of course available towards loan charges on approved schemes for the prevention or relief of flooding in urban areas.  Repair grants under the Housing Acts are available in cases of structural damage to private dwellings. Road authorities may also avail of their Road Fund allocations to repair damaged roads and bridges in appropriate cases.</P>

I can see that the desirability and the feasibility of framing enforceable bye-laws on this subject would require very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>At present an approach is made by way of propaganda on the advantages to pedestrians themselves of following such a rule on roads where a footpath or footpaths are not provided.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we adjourned this debate, I was raising the question of employment on the roads.  I should like to make my position clear on that.  I take the view that in many areas where agricultural workers are available, it is a good thing to raise the general standard of efficiency of the road authorities, with a view to turning the road worker into a skilled worker and paying him accordingly.  However, it would be well worth while considering on its merits, if it is necessary to improve efficiency, the linking up of two, three, or more road authorities in order to make it possible for them to carry out their work more efficiently, with more efficient methods and with a corresponding higher standard of employment for the people engaged on road work.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any inconsistency between holding that view and at the same time saying that we have in certain areas a special social pattern which we desire to preserve, that is, the social pattern based on the property owning farmer who owns his own holding and who works it himself with his family.  I believe that in the areas where the small farm, that is, a farm of less than 50 acres, represents the social foundation of the community, one of the problems that exist is that at certain times of the year that family farmer has to work 12 or 14 hours a day if he is to get the maximum return from his holding while, at other times of the year, owing to seasonal and climatic conditions, he has not enough work to occupy his time.  That situation results in his total family income comparing very unfavourably with the family income of people engaged in industrial work.  It is reasonable and right to say that in areas where those circumstances obtain it is a good thing to provide road work as a supplement to the income of the property owning farmer which is available to him at times of the year when the proper working of his own holding does not fully employ him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure you that the only subject relevant to the Second Stage of this Bill is how the money is to be spent.  Are we to spend it on buying machinery or are we to spend it on hiring men?  I am making the case that it ought to be prudently spent for both purposes but that a different approach is proper in one part of the country from the approach which is appropriate in another part of the country and that we should not put ourselves in the straitjacket of saying that in respect of the whole country we should concentrate on efficient machinery or, on the other hand, of saying that in respect of the whole country we should give an absolute priority to manual work.  There are areas in which the latter course is appropriate and there are areas in which it is not.</P>
      <P>It is a pity to jeopardise the prudent employment of road workers on manual work by seeking to take up the absurd position that all developments towards efficiency are in themselves bad.  That is a Chartist attitude which history makes manifest is absurd.  I am trying to argue on a middle course which will serve the legitimate cause of efficiency and economic disbursement of public money while at the same time, in pursuit of that end, avoiding the creation of a much worse social problem by an excessive deployment of machinery in areas where the seasonal labour content of road work is an essential element in the social pattern of the congested area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to raise another matter.  One of the strange consequences, in my opinion, of the discovery of modern earth moving machinery is that people have become mesmerised by the potentialities of some of this machinery. It is now almost true to say that if you want to buy machinery on a large enough scale you can almost move mountains.  When certain county engineers become possessed of such machinery or have access to it, they suddenly get extravagant ideas of the scope of road improvements upon which it is desirable to embark with the result that one sees gargantuan undertakings up and down the country <Col N="32" /> which must cost incalculable thousands of pounds, which provide relatively little employment but which involve an immense outlay on the purchase or hire of machinery.</P>
    <P>The end result produces in that particular section of the road something of the appearance of an autobahn; curves are removed; but, when one thinks of what could be done in the improvement of road surfaces and in the lesser works of widening existing roads by spreading the surface of the road back on to what we in the country habitually call the long acre, one often wonders if a wholly disproportionate amount of money is not being spent from the Road Fund on these large road improvement works.</P>
    <P>I take the view strongly that with the traffic density that exists on our rural roads, trunk and county roads, it is very much more important to ensure that surface and width of existing roads are adequate than it is to convert them all into autobahns.  We are a long way from the autobahns of the Continent or even Great Britain. It is important to remember, and I think many people forget, that the great through ways known on the Continent of Europe as autobahns and in America, as toll roads, or the like, have in those countries a very large element of subvention from the Defence vote.  In fact, these great highways are very largely part of the strategic defence of the countries in which they have been built.  They are for the movement of troops and munitions in the event of war.</P>
    <P>I do not know how many Deputies have had occasion to travel upon them, but certainly my limited experience of travelling on such roads does not suggest that they are any added attraction to the tourist industry.  They may facilitate the transfer of heavy traffic such as exists in a densely populated industrial country like Germany, France or the United States; but as a tourist amenity, I cannot imagine anything more horrible, because travelling on them is, in my experience, a very much more unnerving experience than travelling in an aeroplane.  One feels imminent disaster <Col N="33" /> is waiting around the corner; and, in fact, I think the accident statistics go to show that on these great throughways, the incidence of accidents is very much higher than on the normal road system.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that we should keep under very careful review proposals for large schemes of road improvement and insist consistently on the maintenance of road surfaces as a prior charge on the Road Fund, the development of the general width of the road on the available ground as a second charge, and the undertaking of large schemes of road improvement, the removal of substantial hills and work of that kind, as a very distinctly third charge, to be undertaken only when the other two charges have been fully covered.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another point.  It is perfectly true that most local authorities can buy stone cheaper from large companies who operate quarries with the most modern machinery; and no one can complain if a prudent county engineer, desirous to get the best value he can for the ratepayers' money, considers and accepts the tenders of these companies for his supplies of road stone.  But here again I believe consideration should be given to a middle way.  Perhaps, it would be justifiable to say that the time is past for the opening of new quarries in rural Ireland by the local authority, as was the practice in the past.  But there are a number of existing quarries in various areas which have given employment to the local people.  They are being closed down with grave consequential hardship on the neighbouring small farmers, who have habitually looked to such places for some employment during the year.</P>
    <P>I feel it may be true that it is possible for the local engineer to get stone cheaper by buying it from the large contracting companies who bring it from some distance, but it is also true that the local authority gets a much better price from the large contractor so long as the competition of the local quarry is operating and that it is very frequently true that when the local quarry is effectively closed down, the large contracting firm's quotation for <Col N="34" /> stone begins to rise.  But, over and above that, the employment provided for the local people in the local quarry is a valuable consideration.  If it is right, and I think it is right, to provide substantial capital grants to industrial units to transfer themselves out of the cities down into the rural areas in order to provide employment for the people upon the land without removing them irreversibly from all contact with the land, it must be true to say it is equally desirable on social grounds to maintain a small local industry like a quarry, providing it does not involve an element of subsidy out of all proportion to the social benefit conferred.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister, if he inquires into it, will find that in many parts of the country the tendency is to close down entirely all these local quarries. I suggest to him, that for the present in any case and certainly in regard to the undeveloped areas, engineers should be advised that where a reasonably competitive price is to be had from the local quarry, they are entitled to preferential consideration above the tenders of road stone contractors&mdash;I am not referring to any particular company; I am referring to road stone contractors in general&mdash;at least until the quarries at present in existence are exhausted.  It can then be considered afresh as to whether the social value of local quarries would justify the opening of others, if it has transpired that local supplies have cost substantially more than what the contractor is prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, when referring to the various counties in which it is proposed to make supplementary grants from the Road Fund, said there would be a total additional allocation of £900,000 over a period of three years, and went on:</P>
    <P>From this sum, substantial grants have been allocated to the county councils of Cork, Clare, Westmeath and Waterford and to Waterford Corporation for the improvement of roads affected by recent railway closings.  In addition, substantial grants for roads affected by major industrial undertakings have been allocated to Cork <Col N="35" /> Corporation and the county councils of Louth, Kilkenny, Offaly and Laoighis.</P>
    <P>Monaghan is a county in which every mile of railway line that existed there has been torn up in the past three or four years.  Monaghan is unique in Ireland in that it is the only county that has not a yard of railway in it.  I should be glad to be reassured by the Minister for Local Government that, when he is making provision for this grant for Cork, Clare, Westmeath and Waterford County Councils and Waterford Corporation for the improvement of roads affected by recent railway closings, he will be sure to consider also the circumstances of Monaghan and make whatever provision may be necessary to deal with the road problem they are trying to grapple with there, bearing in mind two factors, (1) that it has the largest road mileage of any county in Ireland with a similar population, and (2) that it is, as the name implies, a county of little hills.</P>
    <P>The result is that roads have to be taken in devious courses, and thereby constitute a very heavy burden on the ratepayers.  They have now the additional burden of road traffic thrown upon them because of the closing of the railway.  I know they have received some supplemental road grant to help them in this respect.  I trust that in the years that lie immediately ahead, in which the consequences of the removal of the entire railway system will be a growing problem for Monaghan, the circumstances in County Monaghan will be kept before the Department of Local Government when the allocation of special grants of the kind referred to by the Minister is under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to a matter I have never fully understood.  To me, it is one of the principal mysteries of political administration.  I refer to the manner in which the Road Fund is administered.  Why is it divided in such a peculiar fashion?  Why are some counties treated so well and others treated so ill?  Why are some areas treated so ill and others treated so well?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> Waterford is my constituency; I live in Waterford city.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the fact that, when I first came into this House and he was over here on these benches, he tabled a Parliamentary Question on 9th May, 1956, seeking full particulars as to how the Road Fund was allocated.  The reply&mdash;it was in the form of a tabular statement&mdash;was an eye-opener to me. It was probably an eye-opener to the Minister also because he made no further reference to it, and he was never shy of the supplementary question. Presumably he observed how well his native county was being treated by his predecessor, Deputy P. O'Donnell.  I am not criticising Deputy O'Donnell too much; neither do I criticise the present Minister.  Everybody must look after his own.  It is quite normal for a Minister to do whatever is within his province for his native place.</P>
    <P>The reason I raise this is that I want to point out to the Minister now that in the year in which he asked this question his native county got something in the neighbourhood of £290,000 in road grants.  They were beneficiaries in everything possible.  For the upkeep and improvement of main roads&mdash;I am quoting from column 280 of Volume 150 of the Official Report of 9th May, 1956&mdash;they got £291,000; they got £55,000 in tourist road grants; they got £14,500 for employment schemes; and they got £14,000 for schemes for the improvement of roads in Gaeltacht areas.  Waterford got £137,000 for the upkeep and improvement of main roads.  Instead of getting £55,000 for tourist road grants&mdash;that was the sum a number of counties got&mdash;they got £5,000.  For employment schemes, they got not £250,000 but £250.  I am sure the county councillors went out to celebrate in Dungarvan when they got the good news.  I am sure they wondered what they could do with this enormous sum of £250.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned allocations to be made to Waterford city because of the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, has destroyed the Waterford-Tramore railway <Col N="37" /> line.  I have some interesting figures here at column 321 of Volume 193 of the Official Report of 15th February of this year.  From 1950-51 to 1960-61, Waterford city got in road grants £41,043.  During the same period, Waterford city contributed more than £528,000 to the Road Fund. We will, I am sure, get the usual explanation: the citizens of Waterford use the roads all over the country. That may be so, but we have to pay for the roads all over the country and we do not find anybody from any other county paying for one inch of the roads in our own area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon referred to Monaghan not getting the railway road grant.  This year in Waterford we are getting a railway road grant.  The Minister told me about that also; in 1960-61, we got £6,043; in 1961-62, the amount has been increased to £32,726 in order to build up the roads to carry buses.  The Minister is charged with providing money to improve roads for bus traffic because the railway was done away with.  I do not think cognisance was ever taken of the amount of money these small railways were losing <i>vis-á-vis</i> the enormous amount of money the Minister now has to provide to improve the roads for bus traffic.  In the case of Waterford, there is an increase of £26,000.  The railway was losing £3,000 per year.  I do not know if the railway in the Minister's constituency was losing, or how much, but the Minister has told us that he has allocated £75,000 per year for five years to Donegal County Council to make good the roads.</P>
    <P>It is a dreadful state of affairs to play ducks and drakes with public moneys in this manner.  There would have been no necessity to give us the grant for this purpose but we would have liked to get the grant increased in order to put the roads within the city into such a state that they would be able to carry the traffic which is now on them.  Why should not the citizens of Waterford get an increased grant to have the city roads either widened or re-metalled, in view of the fact that, as I mentioned, over some ten years they <Col N="38" /> have paid in £520,000 and have got back only £41,000?</P>
    <P>The Waterford city rate was struck last night at 57/- in the £.  The enormous burden being put on the people down there was mentioned, in view of the fact that they had been revalued in 1926.  I would point out to the Minister that the Waterford Corporation, composed of all shades of political opinion, went about their business in a sound and businesslike manner.  They struck the rate last night and I would draw the Minister's attention to the fact that that was done at a meeting which did not last more than two and a half hours. When a council as businesslike as that face up to their obligations, as they have done over the years, they deserve a better allocation from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>Waterford county has always been a mystery to me.  I even read in our local papers some time ago that there was an increase in the allocation from the Road Fund and that it was good news for us and we would now get £122,000. I do not know how that comes about because in the year when the Minister asked the question of his predecessor, in 1953-54, Waterford city was allocated £142,328 from the Road Fund; in 1954-55, it went down to £141,000; in 1955-56, it went down to £137,000; in 1956-57, it went down to £127,000; in 1957-58, it was again £127,000; in 1958-59, it was also £127,000 and in 1959-60, it was again £127,000.  Now, in 1960-61, I read that it is £132,000. I do not know where the local people got £122,000.  The official figure is £132,000 and I am quoting from the Adjournment Debate on 19th July, 1960, at Column 1829.</P>
    <P>During the years 1954 to 1960, the road allocation to other counties has been substantially increased.  I have been continually asking these questions of the Minister because the majority of counties seem to have received increased Road Fund grants while the Waterford grant decreases.  It is interesting to see that in 1953-54 Waterford was getting £144,000, while Donegal was getting £249,000.  Now, at 31st March, 1960, Waterford got £127,000 in the year ended 31st March, <Col N="39" /> 1960 and Donegal got £431,000.  As I say, the Road Fund grants to many other counties have been continually increased.  That is only right because the number of motor cars on the roads was increasing each year, but what I could not understand was that while the other counties were getting splendid allocations and much better allocations every year because, as I said, the number of vehicles on the road was consistently increasing, over that period of the consistent increase in the number of vehicles, the grants allocated from the Road Fund to Waterford county decreased consistently.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at Waterford county with some realism. We get £5,000 as a tourist road grant but we have other fortunate counties which get magnificent sums in tourist road grants.  Take the case of Cavan, which gets £10,000.  I heard it asked here if that grant, which was supposed to be given to counties with Gaeltacht areas, was given to Cavan, and was consistently kept up, because Cavan had a big Gaeltacht area, or was it because a Cavan man had been Minister for Local Government.  Cork gets £55,000; Donegal, £55,000; Galway, £55,000; Kerry, £55,000; and Waterford is down in the &ldquo;also rans&rdquo; at £5,000.  Only last Sunday, I drove over a mountain road in County Waterford.  I had often driven over that road before but never on such a fine day and I saw more beauty and wonderful scenery than I have ever seen in any part of Ireland.  That road, however, is a road fit only for testing tanks.  Here are we in Waterford paying the taxes and not getting a return for them.  I have been on some of the roads in the more fortunate counties and goodness knows where they were going and why they were put there.</P>
    <P>I have something to say, too, about these allocations.  The allocations are made to the county councils and the county councils arrive at a decision. They put their case to the Minister and his officers who say: &ldquo;Very well; cut away that turn&rdquo;, and a good deal of good work is being done in this way. I am glad that good work is being <Col N="40" /> done on the way out of Dublin and in areas where there is very heavy traffic, but there are many turns and bends on which hundreds and thousands of pounds have been spent which were not so dangerous at all. I submit to the Minister that he should, as he is constantly being asked to do from all sides of the House, have work done for our own people.  We are prepared to build roads, as it says here, for factories which Japanese, Chinese, Czechs, Germans or men from God-knows-where, will build but we will not put up roads leading to the homes of our own people.  We should do that.  When the Minister is making these allocations to the county councils, he should bear in mind that it is not a case even of the secondary roads. It is not a matter that some people have paid money to have the roads done.  These boreens should be done. They would be of great help to the farmers, especially now that there is so much mechanisation on farms and that people have to bring out heavy loads of beet and wheat.</P>
    <P>Now that our railways are wrecked, it would be well that the roads were done in view of cattle transportation. I may be asked why should the roads be done for these lorries.  This is a convenience for farmers.  They would not have to carry stock to the end of the lane or to drag a crop to the end of the lane if the lorries can go up and down these bad boreens.  This money could not be spent in a better way.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party room looks out on work being done at present by mechanised monsters.  I do not know what is being paid for them.  These monsters are now on the roads and we are paying for them.  However, the monster which can be seen from the Fine Gael Party room has been digging for the past six weeks.  The cost of its hire and operation must be extremely heavy.  I am sure there are many men still in this country who would be glad to get a job with pick and shovel and who would dig that out faster and cheaper than it is costing to operate one of those mechanised monsters.  I have often pulled up my car to look at big machinery at <Col N="41" /> work on big road schemes between here and my constituency.</P>
    <P>Calculate the normal capital cost of this machinery.  Take into consideration the fact that it lasts only a year or two, with only a few men operating it, and has then to be written off completely.  Then bear in mind that there are men walking past it on their way to the labour exchange. Surely that is something to set one thinking?  We should call a halt to this.  There are many parts of the country where men are available to work at the county council rate and who would be glad to take the work.  Too much money is being put into road-making machinery.  I would again say to the Minister that I am not altogether criticising him for giving a good vote to his constituency. His predecessor did it in his own Party and his predecessor in my Party did it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PhilipBurton" hpid="Mr. Burton Mr. Burton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of Cork County Council, I should like to refer to a few matters.  I support very strongly the suggestion that there should be a reclassification of the roads.  It is not meeting with the wishes of the council or the people to have big amounts of money buried in short stretches of roadway in order to straighten a bend or two.  We have discussed this at length with the council. Unfortunately, we have not arrived at any way of improving it because our engineers, naturally, have to carry out the work according to the policy of the Department.  I am informed that this work is designed with what is called the speed design in the Department.  I think <Col N="42" /> that design is too elaborate and too exaggerated altogether for the requirements. It would be quite possible, if roads were reclassified, to have such work carried out on major roads.  It is not necessary to carry out such huge works on every second road.</P>
      <P>I think I should not be living up to my responsibilities as a Dáil Deputy and a member of the Cork County Council if I did not express on behalf of that county council grave dissatisfaction as regards the small grant allocated in view of the closing of our railways.  Our acting County Engineer carried out a survey.  I can assure the House that that man did what he considered right.  There was no necessity to pad or increase his estimate.  He gave thought and consideration to every matter.  We thought, and are still of the opinion, that he brought in a modest report.  He recommended that we should apply for a grant of £75,000 for five years.  During the debate, it emerged that that was what was actually granted to Donegal.  I was not aware of it until now.  We were of opinion that our demand was modest.  Our grant is, I presume, £60,000 for three years which is totally inadequate to meet the work necessary in view of the closing of such a long stretch of line.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister, even if it is not possible to give us £75,000 for five years, to give us £60,000 for three years.  In all probability, that may do a fair job.  The grant allocated will be very far short of meeting requirements. There are too many railway bridges to be removed in this long stretch of line and very little of the money will be spent on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also suggest that more discretion be given to the council as regards expenditure from the allocation from the Road Fund.  We often hear the word &ldquo;hidebound&rdquo;.  I think that in this instance the phrase should be &ldquo;Department-bound&rdquo;.  In view of local knowledge and local advice from experienced engineers, I am of opinion that it would be possible to get a lot more done if the council had more of a say and could use their discretion. Therefore.  I appeal to the Minister to consider that point of view.  I am certain it would ensure that we would <Col N="43" /> have more work done, at least economically.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy Burton in referring to the offer which the Minister has made in relation to the grant to the Cork County Council consequential on the closing of the railway line in that county.  The pattern was set in Donegal when £1,100 per mile was allocated by the Minister&mdash;a sum of £75,000 for five years.  That was given at the time when that amount could get done much more work than could be done with it now.</P>
      <P>When the Cork County Council yesterday discussed its annual estimate, it had to provide a sum in excess of £53,000, not to do work additional to what was done in previous years but to do as much work.  That additional money had to be voted, mainly on the rates, as a consequence of increased wages to road workers, increased prices for materials and higher hire charges for machinery.  I want particularly to stress the point of the increased costs of executing road works now by comparison with the year in which the Minister made the allocation to Donegal and to point out that the offer he has made to Cork is entirely inadequate.</P>
      <P>The acting county engineer, as Deputy Burton has said, made a very careful estimate of the consequences on the local authority of the obligation to recast their roads for the carriage of the additional traffic consequential on the abandonment of the railway line which was not a branch but a main line.  That is the most important feature of the closing of the Cork line.  The consequences are quite apparent to anybody who tries to travel from the town of Bandon to Cork city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may take it the Minister's offer is intended merely for capital works because our engineer has advised us that the money will be absorbed in the elimination of bridges which create hazardous turns on the main road.  A considerable amount of traffic has been diverted from that main road to parallet roads because motorists and drivers of other vehicles are today by-passing <Col N="44" /> the main road in order to get quicker access to Cork city because of the hold up by convoys of heavy traffic on the main road.  The effect is already noticeable on the side roads and it will be necessary for the county council to expend more money on the maintenance of these roads as well as on bringing them up to the standard required for the provision of a bus service for the people as an alternative to the facilities they lost when the railway was abandoned.</P>
    <P>Where the main road runs absolutely parallel with the defunct railway line, no problem arises because an alternative bus service is provided, but where the main road veders away from the former railway line, the people living along it have not yet been provided with a service by C.I.E., for the reason, we are informed by the company, that the roads are incapable of carrying the vehicles necessary to transport those passengers.  On my way here today, I picked up passengers on that road who had no means, other than by thumbing lifts, of getting into the city of Cork. The reason is that they are living some miles from roads carrying bus services. Consequently, Cork County Council must bring that road up to such a standard that we can secure agreement with C.I.E. for the provision of a service as an alternative to that enjoyed by the people when the trains were running.</P>
    <P>I consider that the submission by the acting county engineer of a figure of £75,000 for a period of five years was, if anything, conservative, because we know that even on the termination of that period, the rates which Cork County Council will have to strike must include provision for the maintenance of those roads which will then have to carry vastly increased traffic.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister, therefore, to revise his offer to Cork County Council because it is far short of the figure necessary to maintain the roads to meet the new challenge.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister has left the House, though I know he cannot remain here for every contribution, but I would again emphasise this aspect of increased costs, consequential mainly on the increased wages to <Col N="45" /> road workers and on other charges which will, to a very great extent, reduce the amount of work that can be done with the figure the Minister has offered.  On that score alone, it is very essential the Minister should step up his figure so as to make it possible for us to do the work that was anticipated when that niggardly offer was made.</P>
    <P>It has been proved to the Minister and his Department that the council are pulling their weight in trying, notwithstanding the higher costs involved, to maintain the remainder of the road in that particular area, but it is not enough that we should be given money to remove some of the hazards on this main road.  We should be enabled to widen the roads sufficiently to carry the traffic necessary if the people are to enjoy a service alternative to that enjoyed when the trains were running.</P>
    <P>It is therefore an exaggeration for the Minister to say in his opening statement that the money being provided for the purpose of compensating county councils in areas where railways have been removed has been in any way adequate.  The grant made in Donegal appeared at the time to be adequate but that standard has certainly not been maintained in other areas and particularly in a county where for the first time in this country, a main line was completely abandoned.  I hope and trust the Minister will review his decision and will hearken to the unanimous wishes of the Cork County Council in their appeal to him to raise the level of grants to the county to such an extent that it will provide schemes which will give the people of the area the service they are definitely entitled to but which, at the same time, will ensure that a heavy impost will not fall on the rates through additional maintenance charges consequential on the heavier traffic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should not let this opportunity pass without congratulating the Minister on the very marked improvement in our main and county roads, that has taken place in the past five years in County Cork as <Col N="46" /> well as in the rest of the country.  It is true, of course, that, no matter what improvements have taken place, the job is not yet finished but the improvement during the past five or seven years has been well accelerated.  I believe credit should be given where credit is due and that the Minister and his Department should be congratulated.</P>
      <P>Many of our roads were not originally constructed to take anything like present day traffic.  I cannot understand the grousings and criticisms of some people against the policy of the Department in the widening of some of the roads which is being carried out at the moment.  Any of the roads that I have seen widened have been improved considerably by that operation and while they may not at present be in the category of major roads, they will eventually, in my opinion, reach that standard.  I think it is a good thing that the Dublin-Cork road, the Cork-Killarney road and the Mallow-Killarney road have been widened and adapted to take the heavy traffic that will go over them in the years to come.  The trouble about some people is that they only look as far ahead as the course of their own lives No matter what generation passes, the world still goes on and the people of every generation should do some little thing not only for themselves but for the generation to come.</P>
      <P>I would join with other Deputies from County Cork in asking the Minister to reconsider the amount set aside for the improvement of the roads in the West Cork area, due to the removal of the railways.  With all sincerity I would ask him to review that position.  If he does so, he will be working along the right lines.  I know the assistant engineer since he entered the service and he is not a man to underestimate or overstimate.  He is a man on whose judgment and opinion I would rely very much.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make, one of which is that the whole road policy is completely wrong and is contributing to a large extent to driving the people in the backward areas out of the country, giving them <Col N="47" /> a disgust, in a way, for where they are living.  All our main roads are being improved enormously but all our secondary roads, the county roads, both steamrolled and unsteamrolled, are going down day by day.  The Minister would be well advised to give the main roads a rest for a while and devote some of the money to the other roads.  The main roads are not so bad at the present time and if he devoted some of the money to the less important roads it would relieve the rate-payers of the enormous burden placed on them.</P>
      <P>We all know that traffic is increasing rapidly and becoming heavier.  A few years ago, it was unusual to see a three-ton lorry on the roads but now it is nothing to see a matador trailer carrying up to 20 tons.  We would all like to see our main roads improved but the more we improve them, the greater the number of accidents that happen.  Perhaps, the good conditions of the roads contribute to higher speeds and to neglect on the part of some drivers.  That point is worth looking into.</P>
      <P>Something better than this Bill is needed, if the roads other than the trunk roads are to be kept in condition. The roads in my county have got into a deplorable condition due to the heavy traffic and the inability of the rate-payers to put up the necessary money to keep them as they were a few years ago.  I regard the Bill as a device to allow the Government to escape making the contribution to the rates they ought to make.  The Government are treating a serious matter in a jocose way.  Something should be done about the roads other than the trunk roads.  Paying a miserable sum like this into the Road Fund is only playing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the rates meeting of the Mayo County Council the county engineer said that the county roads could no longer be held together even though we have the second highest rate in the Twenty-Six Counties.  Since the traffic cannot be controlled, it is high time that the Government took over a large proportion of the roads because it has <Col N="48" /> gone beyond the capacity of the rate-payers to maintain them.  What is happening is that the small farmers now have a burden of rates which they cannot carry.  We hear them saying that the average small holding is not worth the rates which have to be paid on it.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that holding after holding is being closed down and that fathers, mothers and children are clearing off to England and leaving them derelict.</P>
    <P>Off our main roads, there are holdings serviced only by bad, dirty boreens.  We cannot blame our people, and particularly our young people, for flying from the country when the Special Employment Schemes Office is unable or unwilling to make decent roads leading to their holdings.  There are people living a quarter or a half of a mile from a main road but cars cannot get to their houses, lorries cannot get there to collect their beet or other crops, and threshing machines cannot reach them, because the by-road is so bad.  I know of many cases where the doctor can bring his car to within only a quarter of a mile of the houses, and when a death occurs, the coffin has to be carried for a quarter or a half of a mile.</P>
    <P>We must not forget that those people pay rates and pay their share of taxation, just as do their brothers who live beside a main road.  There should be a more equal distribution of money spent on the roads, instead of copying Germany and Italy and providing autostrada and autobahns.  While we would all like to see fine trunk roads such as they have on the Continent, nevertheless the policy carried out here at the present time is helping to drive the smaller people in the backward areas out of the country, and giving them a disgust for the very name of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems this country will have to face sooner or later is that of the increasing motor traffic on all our roads.  The small roads and the by-roads will have to be widened.  That was very forcibly brought home to me only the other day when I was motoring on a very <Col N="49" /> narrow road in a seaside area.  No money has been spent on that road, whereas running parallel to it is a main road on which huge sums of money have been spent on widening and taking off corners.  That in itself may be desirable but it also leads to inequities.</P>
      <P>I am told that there is a scheme whereby a road which has been straightened to a certain degree constitutes what is known as a 60 miles per hour road.  It is considered safe to travel on at that speed.  The greater part of the road which I travel coming to Dublin to the Dáil is in County Wicklow.  Some of it is in County Wexford.  Great sums of money have been expended in taking off corners and taking large portions of land beside the road.  No general reconstruction has taken place on the surface of the road.  Coming here today, I paid perhaps undue attention to this road because I intended to speak on road making this afternoon.</P>
      <P>About one-third of that road needs resurfacing.  It seems to me that ambitious schemes for widening the roads and taking corners away are unwise spending of money.  I do not know who is responsible but I understand that such decisions are taken at Government level.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the funds which come to the Central Fund for the purpose of road making, other than what is collected from the rates, come from the motorists.  We are not obliged to cater from the Central Fund only for motorists who drive at 60 m.p.h. along the main roads.  We must cater also for the motorists who contribute money for the development of our by-roads.  The Minister and his officials should take a completely new look at their policy in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem to make sense that by-roads should be tarred and, when tarred, constitute a hazard to a certain degree if they are too narrow.  There are innumerable by-roads which are so narrow that only two motor cars can pass on them.  It seems to me that it would be far better policy to widen those roads than to spend huge sums of money on other ambitious schemes.  I do not know if the Minister is aware <Col N="50" /> that one of the problems in regard to the big trans-continental highways in Europe is that the long straight stretches have been responsible for many accidents.  If you have a straight stretch of road four or five miles long, as they sometimes are&mdash;I have seen a stretch of nearly ten miles&mdash;and if you are travelling at night with literally hundreds of cars coming the other way, there is danger because you are blinded by the oncoming traffic.  I saw in one of the Sunday papers lately that on the Great North Road in England, which is the road that was supposed to do away with accidents, there have been more accidents than perhaps on any other road in Europe.  They are now planting hedges and other things to divert the lights of the oncoming traffic. In Europe, they are creating artificial bends.  Of course, the volume of traffic there is very much heavier than it is here, but the volume of traffic is increasing here all the time and we are adhering to a policy which is obsolete. I should like the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>Last Sunday, I was on the road from Arklow to Brittas Bay, known as the coast road.  All traffic from Dublin on Sundays and holidays travels on that narrow road.  In my opinion, that is a far more hazardous and dangerous road than any of the roads on which corners were taken away.  We must move with the times. Twenty years ago, there was not very much traffic on these roads but today it is almost as heavy as it is on the main arterial roads.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of lay-bys. I have heard it said in this House that there are plenty of lay-bys in Ireland.  They are essential for safety reasons.  There are a number of lay-bys on the Dublin-Limerick road, and I have seen a few between Dublin and Naas.  There are many places on the road on which I live in which lay-bys could be provided, as a result of reconstruction work and the removal of corners.  Far from turning them into lay-bys and leaving the ends open for cars and lorries to park, in order not to interfere with the free flow of traffic on the road, they have been closed up.  The Minister might direct his attention to that <Col N="51" /> matter.  If he has the time, he might come down in the State car and take a look at the road from Gorey to Wexford.  If he does, he will see that it would be possible to provide 12 or 14 lay-bys by opening up those portions that have been closed off.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister last week about Rosslare Harbour road.  I know there has been correspondence between the Minister and the county council in which it was suggested that something might be done about that road.  My colleague, Deputy Corish, referred to it on the last occasion and I was glad to note that, as a result of supplementary questions, the Minister said he would be prepared to receive a deputation of Deputies from Wexford.  There is a lot of traffic on that road and it is not a modern but a narrow and badly-surfaced road.  At present it is the main gateway of entry for tourist motor-cars to Ireland.</P>
    <P>In replying to the question, I think the Minister said he did not consider that there was sufficient traffic on the road to justify a special grant for it. I do not think that is in accordance with the facts.  There is very heavy traffic on that road, including a good deal of container traffic from Rosslare Harbour.  It seems to me this should be one of the priorities if we are endeavouring to correlate road development and increased traffic into the country.</P>
    <P>The Rosslare-Fishguard Company, which is a combination of C.I.E. and British Railways and is responsible for this harbour and the traffic there, have spent a good deal of money to bring it up to date with the result that traffic has considerably increased. That has happened only in the past two years and far more traffic is being routed that way now than heretofore. I ask the Minister to consider that seriously and to bear in mind, whether he receives a deputation or not, at least two of us have made it clear that a particular case exists for a grant here.  I think the Minister should be generous and give us an allowance.</P>

But I should not wish to let the opportunity pass without correcting some misunderstandings that seem to be all too general among Deputies who, in addition, are members of local authorities.</P>
      <P>Running through the various speeches have been suggestions that county councils and road authorities have not sufficient discretion in regard to road schemes; that over-costly work of realignment is being done; that county roads are being neglected and that main roads are being made into autobahns and boulevards and so on. By and large, those are some of the headings under which I, and my Department, and finally the Government, are being taken to task.  It has been, and is being, asserted that all of these faults&mdash;if faults they are&mdash;arise because of Government policy and direction and because of my Department telling local road authorities what to do and what not to do, giving the House to understand that local road authorities have practically no voice in their own road schemes.</P>
      <P>So much did I consider this matter that I was not very long in the Department when, in 1958, I issued a special circular to local road authorities directing their attention to the fact that I had become aware, from personal experience of councils, of a practice that had grown up of the county engineer or engineering staff drawing up a scheme, submitting it to the Department and then presenting a <i>fait accompli</i> to the local council.  In my circular I informed the local authorities that they were entitled to, and should get, an opportunity of examining all these problems before they reached the Department and that if they did not agree with them and could not resolve differences with the engineering staff, they had the opportunity of submitting alternative schemes to those proposed by the local engineers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A rather strange feature of the whole <Col N="53" /> situation since is that my Department and I have not had to deal with any real problem of differences between elected local road authority members and engineering staffs in regard to proposals for road schemes in any part of the country.  That seems to copperfasten the refutation of the suggestion made here that road authorities have no disretion.  If they have no discretion, if they ignore the opportunity given to them by the direction of 1958 and if all that amounts to what is asserted here&mdash;that money is being wasted in road work, jobs not done properly, widening carried out where unnecessary&mdash;it should be clear to them that if there is something wrong, it is wrong with themselves and not on some other level.  I suggest they should examine their conscience in the matter and I think they will find that if there are faults, the faults rest with themselves in not doing the job properly.</P>
    <P>In 1958, I brought to the notice of local authorities&mdash;lest there should be costly or over-costly work undertaken &mdash;the need for very careful and critical examination of all proposals regarding realignment jobs and that, by and large, the rule of thumb would be that only stretches of road with a bad accident record should be considered for costly realignment or, alternatively, where a road surface had deteriorated to such an extent that in modernising it and bringing it up to a good surface it would be wasteful not to take away bends and realign it at the same time, and thereby avoid making two jobs out of what should be one.</P>
    <P>These were two guides issued by me in 1958 in regard to this problem of the use or abuse of money for road jobs.  Everybody knows we have not anything like all the money we would wish to have for this purpose and it is a big problem from the national Exchequer and the local taxation points of view.  Having those matters very much in mind, the road authorities and my Department feel that, as pointed out by the Department, care should be taken not to carry out over-costly jobs.  At the same time, instructions have been given that local representatives&mdash;who I believe should know best&mdash;should have the final say in all <Col N="54" /> cases where proposals seem to be too elaborate and costly and that they have recourse to me and my Department if they do not agree finally with their local engineers' proposals.  What more can I do other than take away discretion and power from the council? I have no intention of doing that, but if I were to do anything to meet these arguments which are being made, if they were well based, which they are not, the only solution would be not to give more discretion to the local authority but to curtail it.</P>
    <P>Then we come to the question of neglect of the county roads and overemphasis on main road works.  Various arguments have been made that certain county roads today are as important as our main roads, that in some cases the main road has dropped in importance below the adjoining county road, and that by and large the whole system of our roads requires reclassification.  I entirely agree as regards reclassification, but I do not agree that the figures support the contention that our whole energies are being directed to the main roads to the exclusion of the county roads.</P>
    <P>If we look at the allocation of road grants in round figures in the present year or in the year to come, we find that the amount for main road improvement works is somewhere in the region of £1,200,000; for county road improvement works the sum is £3,000,000.  That surely refutes the views being expressed here about our complete lack of thought for the county roads and our entire obsession with main roads and, as we have been led to believe here, main roads for the sake of calling them main roads even though they are not important for carrying traffic or on which the traffic has dropped to a certain extent that they can no longer be regarded as main roads.  I do not understand how anyone can be so confused in his thinking as to make arguments like those made here when there are so many people who know the answers which are different from the arguments being put forward.</P>
    <P>In passing, may I refer to the suggestion which has been made that not enough lay-bys are being provided.  A <Col N="55" /> special provision has been made to which we have drawn the attention of the local authorities in respect of lay-bys and, indeed, hard shoulders on the main roads which would be equivalent to lay-bys, continuous lay-bys, if you like, which are to be charged from the 100 per cent. grant.  That does not agree with the complaints being made here that no provision is being made for lay-bys.  If they are not being made there is not very much that can be done from the Department or that I can do.  All I could do would be to direct local detailed planning in this respect in each county which, as I say, I do not propose to do.</P>
    <P>A wail has been raised by various Deputies about the special grants to which this Bill applies.  The special grants which have been provided by special funds from the Exchequer supplemented by moneys from the Road Fund help, and I emphasise the word &ldquo;help&rdquo;, to overcome the problem where railways have been abandoned or closed.  However, I would point out that it never has been the intention of the Department or the Government that these railway road grants should put into proper or desirable condition every road in any county where railways have been closed down.  They are merely there as an additional aid to help counties.  It was never intended that they should meet the complete cost of modernising roads within range of any railway line that may have been closed.</P>
    <P>Apart from the type of expenditure that would be shot into the Department overnight if such grants were available as to 100 per cent., we must have regard to the fact that the figures absolutely refute the suggestions being made in regard to the additional traffic generated on our roads as a result of railway lines closing. We have heard on many occasions about this question of the total bill submitted by the Cork County Council as to what they require in order to put their roads into a proper state where railways have closed.  If we were to relate the grants only to the additional amount of traffic arising from the closing of the railways <Col N="56" /> their grants would be very much smaller than the amount they have been allocated.  It is true the amount allocated is substantially smaller than the amount claimed but they did not claim merely for the amount that would seem to be due for the repair of the roads and relate it to the extra traffic arising from the closing of the railways.  The estimate and the calculation that has been voiced here several times in this House is the total amount required to maintain all the miles of road in Cork which these people in Cork feel have been affected by that closure.</P>
    <P>I should like also to bring to the notice of the House and to the Cork Deputies, in particular, that far from their being badly served by these special grants I have been somewhat amazed to find that Cork, when this Fund is finished, will have got the highest allocation of any county in Ireland.  They will have got or have earmarked for them £660,000 out of a total fund of £3,000,000.  What more do they want?  It would appear as if they want the whole lot.  Even Cork people will admit, when they see those figures, that they have got a fair share from it, and I do not think they will try to make any comparisons with any other counties and allege that these other counties have got more.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that my own county got far more than Cork.  The total allocation made to my county is £375,000.  The total allocation for Cork is £660,000.  I think Deputies should check up again and see what can be regarded as fair play because if they are not getting fair play out of that I do not know who is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Has the Minister anything to say about fair play for County Monaghan where there is no railway at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Sweetman also quoted from what I had said about substantial grants in my introductory remarks on this Bill, and referred to the fact that Monaghan was not mentioned in this context of substantial grants.  The Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Sweetman, in a more <Col N="57" /> sarcastic tone, noted I did not mention any substantial grants having been made to Donegal.  Both Deputies should re-read what I said, from which they purported to be quoting.</P>
      <P>I was talking of the substantial grants made from the new additional supplemental fund of £900,000 and did not refer to the amounts allocated from the previous fund created under the 1959 Act.  Under that Act, both Monaghan and Donegal undoubtedly would have come to be mentioned as counties that benefited.  The reason I did not mention it in this context in my introductory statement is the fact that neither of those counties comes within the allocations made or being made at the moment from the £900,000. That is the only reason for their absence.  They do not come within the £900,000 supplement to the special fund but were dealt with under the original £2 million fund created under the 1959 Act.  It was not an oversight and not any device to mislead that they were left out of my introductory remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Monaghan will be getting supplemental grants, then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I have not said that and far be it from me to wish the Deputy to misunderstand me again.  I have not said anything of the sort. What I have said is that Monaghan and Donegal were not mentioned in the context of my introductory speech because of the fact that they are not getting moneys from the £900,000 additional supplement of which we have been talking but had already been allocated moneys under the 1959 Act and that these moneys were spread over a number of years and are continuing. In fact, as a matter of interest, the amount granted to Monaghan is £225,000 in five annual payments starting in 1959/60 or 1960/61, and continuing, in addition to which there was a small grant of approximately £3,500 made, as the Deputy may be aware, to a road leading to the gypsum mines.  That grant has been spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain observations were made in regard to the question of manual <Col N="58" /> labour <i>versus</i> machinery.  I should like to say, first of all, that there is a clamour all the time for more and more roads to be done.  Let us forget our arguments about how they are being done.  No matter how many miles of roads are done in a year, there is the clamour that more and more should be done.  That is one side of the story.</P>
    <P>We come to look at the other side, the question of employment being given varying degrees of importance in our entire roads programme.  Some people say there should be a balanced approach.  That is a fairly reasonable suggestion.  There are others who go to the extreme and would seem to imply that the Road Fund and road works are an employment relief agency.  If it were an employment relief agency, all the arguments being made about getting rid of machinery and doing things by manual labour would be very proper but it is not supposed to be and never has been so regarded and it has never been stated in this House by any Minister to be an employment relief sort of grant or agency.  Its prime function and prime importance are to get more and more of our roads done and put into proper shape.</P>
    <P>It is difficult, in fact, impossible, to reconcile the two extreme views: one, that we must have more and more miles of roads done as fast as possible, which means as economically as possible, and the other, that we should provide as much manual labour as it is possible to give with the money at our disposal.  You cannot have it both ways.  I do go quite a bit of the way with those who appeal for a reasoned approach to this question and for a compromise, the middle way, where possible.</P>
    <P>An example of the type of thing we have been up against is Deputy Tully's statement that if work can be done as well and as cheaply by manual labour, the Minister should step in, but, immediately after, the Minister is accused by Deputy Tully of causing unemployment by insisting on the most economic method.  There is an inconsistency there and it is this <Col N="59" /> inconsistency I find impossible to resolve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have said &ldquo;Quote `economic method' &rdquo;&mdash; these were the Minister's own words.  It is not always the most economic method.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thing I can do is to leave it to the Deputy to work out.  I have tried and I just cannot reconcile the approaches.  I am not quoting Deputy Tully more than I might quote others.  I just happen to have a note here of what appear to me to be two irreconcilable approaches expressed by the same person.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to say to Deputies who are members of local authorities that when machinery is being purchased, there is the question of raising a loan.  The elected county council must make provision for and agree to the raising of that loan.  If it is being done from revenue, the local authority again must make the provision for that revenue.  Could we not have it that the local authority again in that matter would exercise the restraint that is being called for in this House by many Deputies who themselves are county councillors rather than saying with one breath that the Minister should step in to stop what they feel is wrong and in the next breath, that county councils should get more discretion?  You just cannot do both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to Deputies to have another little thought and another look at these things.  Do not try to precipitate the Minister for Local Government into curtailing the powers of county councils and, the next day, decry the fact that county councils have not enough power.  I want them to retain the powers they have and, indeed, anywhere that it can be shown that it would be useful, helpful and desirable that they should have more powers, I <Col N="60" /> certainly will not be the last to support such a change or such a move. But do not precipitate the Minister into curtailing their powers.</P>

      <P>Not since he left, no. I decry the idea of Deputies who are councillors and who should know better coming in here and to a large degree with their tongues in their cheeks, merely in order to make a good case on the side from which they are talking, playing ducks and drakes as to what councillors are doing and what they are prevented from doing and confusing everybody, without having regard to the facts.  I do not like to see that done and would appeal to Deputies who know the facts not to try to confuse the House because I can honestly assure them they are not going to confuse me on the matter of what county councils can or cannot do.  They cannot get away with charges directed at me as to the powers of county councils in matters of detail, when, in fact, the reverse is the fact.  I have gone out of my way on many occasions in my time in Local Government to point out to local authorities what they may <Col N="61" /> do and what they may assert.  I shall continue to do that and hope to get the support of Deputies regardless of the side of the House on which they sit.</P>
      <P>Another matter was mentioned here by Deputy Lynch of Waterford. Deputy Lynch has a mystery which he apparently cannot solve, in regard to the amounts of money being paid to Waterford County Council over the years.  He says, and I do not doubt his good faith in saying it, that he can see over a number of years where the amount of money the County Council of Waterford has been getting in grants has been decreasing progressively, while at the same time other counties and all other road authorities are getting more.  In 1957-58, Waterford county received £127,420 and the figure for 1961-62 is £164,316.  The in-between figures follow this pattern: 1957-58, £127,420 and 1958-59, £140,921.  I should say that included in the grants for that year was a special bridge grant which was non-recurring. In the following year, 1959-60, the grant reverted to £127,000, as in the two previous years.  In 1960-61, it was £127,000 and it went up to £164,316 in 1961-62.  I hope those figures clear up the apparent mystery Deputy Lynch had on his mind and about which he expressed himself very forcibly a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P>We also had the inimitable Deputy O.J. Flanagan talking, as only he can, of the depression felt by people who come on to a main road from a county road.  According to him, the main roads are too good and too much is being spent on them.  But he went on to suggest that they should be enhanced by such things as trees, flowers, shrubs and lay-bys, although he had already complained that the improvement of these roads was too costly.  I have as much experience as anybody in regard to county roads and by-roads. I come from a county which, unfortunately, because of its indented coast line and general terrain, has an unduly high road mileage related to population.  Therefore, our road problem is an unduly costly one.  The amount of rock alternating with bog on many of our roads plays havoc, so far as the money is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="62" /> Having regard to the fact that we have not endless money to spend on roads and realising the colossal mileage yet to be put into proper repair, we have to ask ourselves: do we go all out for making roads in the most backward places first, with no link between those and the more important roads; or do we, as has been progressively done over a number of years, do the roads in the order of their importance, starting with the one carrying the greatest amount of traffic and from which practically everyone gets some service, even though he may not actually use it personally?  From those, are we gradually to branch out into the next most important main and county roads and finally get to the isolated culs-de-sac on which a great number of our people live?</P>
    <P>Nobody in his sane senses would start with the culs-de-sac, so that when we got off them with dry feet, we would no longer have a main road on which to drive.  That would be ludicrous, and nobody would push conclusions so far as those complaining about the condition of our county and by-roads would appear to do.  We are all aware that a lot remains to be done, that the cost is very great and that it will be a number of years before all that is required to be done can be done.  We must have regard to the pool at our disposal and also to the priorities based on the usage and the service which the various roads give. By and large, that is being done.  If it can be shown in any particular roads programme by the elected representatives that what is coming up to me for sanction is other than what it should be, then they have a perfect right&mdash; and they would be negligent in their duty to their councils and their people if they did not assert that right&mdash;to correct what they believe to be wrong in the proposals of their engineering staff and to submit alternative proposals.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware from what I said at the outset, the moneys being provided in this Bill are needed as an addition to the fund created under the 1959 Act.  That fund was created to help repair and improve roads in counties where railway lines have been closed and where some traffic has been <Col N="63" /> diverted to the roads.  In addition, it was to meet the need in places where new industries were of a nature and in such a location that they required new roads to facilitate their more economic working.  Special moneys are being made available for that purpose.  As I say, this Bill is to supplement that fund in order to continue to some further degree road improvement and road making under the headings I have referred to.  In spite of all that has been said, I feel that this is, in essence, a Bill to which the House will readily agree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress last week, I was dealing with the facilities for tourists in my constituency. Because of the efforts made locally in Carlow, we have succeeded in attracting tourists to the area for coarse fishing and other sports.  I am wondering if we advertise the country sufficiently.  I am sure Bord Fáilte are doing good work, but I sometimes wonder if we are getting the message over.  Mention was made of the weather.  We have had some bad summers.  Why not utilise our hotels in winter for hunting, fishing and shooting?  I think there should be more concentration on advertising those attractions.  That would help the hoteliers in the lean season.</P>
      <P>With regard to the smaller hotels, I wonder are we giving sufficient help?  I have in mind the hotel which caters for the family man who cannot afford the luxury hotel.  Grants or loans should not be made contingent on the number of rooms and the facilities and amenities.  Certain standards must be preserved, but there should not be too great an emphasis on the highest standards in every case.  Those are the main points I wish to make.  I would ask the Minister to do all in his power for these smaller hotels throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that Bord Fáilte are doing good work. We have the facilities and the tourist trade is developing, which is something we are all glad to see.  Anything spent on helpful advertising or publicity will be money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that I agree entirely with Deputy Governey. I do not think we have ever fully got under way in publicising our fishing amenities.  I remember when I inaugurated the Inland Fisheries Trust, we were primarily preoccupied with trout fishing.  That was in 1951. When I came back to office in 1954, considerable progress had been made in clearing trout waters of the predator <Col N="68" /> fish and it then struck me that in confining our attention to trout, we were overlooking what might be in fact an even greater tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>I remember inviting the directors of the Inland Fisheries Trust to meet me and immediately we ran up against the snag that from the funds then available, it was taxing our ability to do the minimum of work necessary to serve the trout fisheries.  In fact, I had on my hands one conscientious public servant who said he wanted to resign because he felt his salary was too heavy a charge on the funds available. I then consulted with the Tourist Board and I must say I found a splendid atmosphere of cooperation. They appreciated the value of the fishing industry, the fishing amenity, as an adjunct of the tourist industry and we started on the work of developing coarse fishing on which substantial work has been done in certain areas. The coarse fishes fall broadly into pike, perch, bream, roach and tench.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland are most familiar with perch, pike and bream.  There are many elements in England who regard tench and roach as very important adjuncts but the queer thing in Ireland is that there exists a peculiar kind of tacit prejudice against coarse fishing.  Possibly it is because we call it coarse fishing but the interesting fact is that it is probably true to say now that pike, perch and bream are a greater tourist attaction than trout or salmon.  It is true to say that we have in this country trout and salmon fishing probably cheaper than you would get anywhere else in the world and that we have in many parts of the country free trout fishing and, I think, even some free salmon fishing.  Of course, a great deal of the salmon fishing is privately controlled but we must be almost unique in Europe in having free trout and salmon fishing in certain areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trout and salmon fishing are very much an art and an art very much confined to a relatively narrow section of the community.  The number of persons who enjoy fishing for perch, bream, pike, roach or tench&mdash;and I am deliberately trying to avoid the expression &ldquo;coarse fish&rdquo; because I believe it has a pejorative sense which is doing <Col N="69" /> damage&mdash;is infinitely greater and the congestion in that type of fishing in Great Britain is reaching saturation point.  I do not believe that we have ever made it known effectively to the people of Durham, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Staffordshire that there are in this country almost unlimited fishing facilities for these types of fish.  I believe if effective measures were taken to that end, a vastly increasing number of tourists could be attracted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Governey mentioned that one of the special attractions of this type of fishing is that it will draw tourists to Ireland at a time when no other tourist traffic is probable.  Of course hunting will do the same, but the number of people who want to hunt in terms of the tourist industry is strictly limited but the number of people who will go out in February to fish for pike is fantastic, if incomprehensible to most of us.  You will see people sallying forth in weather which is next to freezing and standing in what seems to be utter misery on the bank of a lake or a canal or a river, patiently fishing for pike on the shortest day of the year.  That traffic can be captured for this country.</P>
    <P>Mark you, heretofore one of the great problems of that kind of traffic was that you had a relatively short period of daylight and the question of occupying their evenings away from home presented a problem.  Cinemas and pike do not ordinarily share the same abode but with the advent of television, there is no part of Ireland so remote that the person coming from Birmingham or elsewhere on a fishing holiday will not find occupation in the evening time, either through the medium of television or the ordinary social intercourse of the country house which will make his sojourn here quite agreeable and quite practicable.  If we could draw that kind of traffic, particularly into the country areas where very elaborate accommodation is not sought but where comfortable accommodation is available, we could bring a very valuable supplemental income to a part of the country which badly needs it.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has transferred his <i>lares et penates</i> from Longford-Westmeath <Col N="70" /> to Monaghan, he will see in his new constituency the benefit of the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust with special reference to cultivation of this type of fishing amenity.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that the Inland Fisheries Trust and Bord Fáilte be exhorted to publicise, for one year at least to see what results there would be, on an intensive scale, the perch, pike, tench and roach fishing available in this country through the medium of the popular <i>Anglers' Journal</i> in Great Britain.  I believe the result would be most gratifying.  I believe that if a campaign were conducted there&mdash;which provided for a follow-up and invited persons to get in touch with Bord Fáilte either by correspondence or personal call&mdash;we could develop a growing influx of tourists of a very desirable kind, which would represent a very substantial asset to the country.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the problem which I must have mentioned 20 times before in this House, but it is very often difficult to get anything done, is this.  Has anybody seen in any advertisement of this country any reference to the fishing amenity of the Royal and Grand Canals?  I do not think a lot of Deputies regard that as serious.  I think that is one of the most effective tourist attractions we have in this country for the type of tourist I have in mind.</P>
    <P>Many a fisherman, going out, does not mind clambering over hedges and ditches along the bank of a river. However, we have, ready-made, two canal systems with free walking accommodation and fishing accommodation along their entire length. Yet, I have never heard anybody refer to it as a desirable site for fishing.  I should have imagined we would publicise that as one of the principal fishing assets of this country.  I know it to be true that the people living in the Black Country of Northern England are at present fishing in canals like the Manchester Ship Canal.  Each man there will have a beat about five yards long on the bank allocated to him by the local angling group of which he is a member, on the strict understanding that he will carefully remove any perch or other fish <Col N="71" /> he gets from the hook and put it back again.  They do not bring the fish home, lest they fish out the canal.</P>
    <P>I think that if you made it known to these people that here nobody gives a fiddle-de-dee whether you take home a ton of fish, provided you catch it legitimately with rod and line, they would hardly believe it.  I would direct the attention of the Minister to the exceptional amenity represented by the canal.  I should like to say a few words on the potentialities of the canal as a centre for swimming but I could scarcely bring that within the scope of tourism.  I shall discuss that on the Local Government Vote. It breaks my heart every time I see the children of this city leaping into the canal in its present condition: there is nobody there to clear it up and make it safe for children to swim in.  That is another story.  I am now asking about the coarse fishing of the canal. I exhort the Minister to urge Bord Fáilte adequately to exploit it.</P>
    <P>I come now to the subject of guest houses and small hotels.  I am prepared to stand over substantial grants to big companies to help them to build substantial hotels.  That need is there and, provided it is not carried too far, it can be justified.  That kind of expenditure should not be to the exclusion of the small hotel and guest house.  Is it not a queer thing that if you go to France for a holiday and you come back and say you stayed in a <i>pension</i> it is quite fashionable but if you go to Connemara for a holiday and say you stayed in a guest house you immediately drop three steps in the social scale?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>To be serious, I think we underestimate the potentiality of the Irish equivalent of a <i>pension</i> in the country.  There are many country houses in Ireland which could be made very comfortable.  I admit that in the case of many of these houses the people have not adverted to the fact that there is available to them this source of income.  I have seen it happen in the constituency represented by the Minister and myself.  I think the danger is that when some of the people wake up to the potentialities, they make the mistake of being too ambitious in the initial stages.  They want to convert the houses not into <i>pensions</i> but into hotels and the capital investment may very well cripple them.  It would be much better for them to recognise that there is a place, a very well-recognised place, in the tourist industry for a <i>pension.</i></P>
      <P>I suggest that, perhaps, one of the mistakes Bord Fáilte make is that they dwell too much on the concept of the hotel.  In fact, they make provision that you must have certain minimum standards in order to put up &ldquo;Hotel&rdquo; outside your house.  Bord Fáilte would be better employed in saying: &ldquo;We are concerned for accurate description of the kind of accommodation you offer to your prospective clients.  There is nothing inferior in the accommodation provided by a <i>pension</i> but it is different from the accommodation ordinarily offered by a hotel.  Do not call your premises a hotel but call it a guest house.  You will find Bord Fáilte are just as ready and willing to convert your house into a suitable guest house as it is to help a hotelier to expand his hotel.&rdquo;  These people have to get help from Bord Fáilte as to the kind of accommodation appropriate to a guest house&mdash;minima or maxima.  They want to be warned not to provide too much and warned also that certain minimum standards are indispensable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So what I would say to the Minister is that Bord Fáilte require to be reminded that in areas where tourism <Col N="73" /> could, perhaps, be the greatest advantage of all-country towns&mdash;there is room for guest houses and small hotels and that very often encouragement in the effort, even persuasion, may be required on the part of Bord Fáilte in order to get the people to avail of the facilities Bord Fáilte are prepared to offer in order to bring the accommodation they intend to provide up to the standard appropriate to the category in which they wish to be recognised, whether it be hotels or guest houses.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to mention is this.  We have discussed repeatedly the facilities for bringing motor cars to Ireland.  It is a most mysterious thing that, although we have several shuttle services operating between this island and Great Britain, both for passengers and cars, it is extremely difficult and very expensive to bring a car to Ireland. I have never been fully able to understand that.  Not only that, but if you overcome the difficulties and the expense, the inconvenience is very great.  I am told if you want a motor car carried from Liverpool to Dublin, you must leave the car in Liverpool five hours before the boat sails.  The net result is that you are rambling around half the day waiting for the boat to sail because it is necessary to have the car there several hours before sailing time.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, if you are going to France you can drive down onto the boat and when the boat arrives at the jetty in France you can drive off again.  Why is that?  It surely ought to be possible that all the agencies at the disposal of the Minister, the Department of Industry and Commerce and the shipping companies would be brought together to provide that people could enjoy at least as good a service during the tourist season between Great Britain and Ireland as at present exists between Great Britain and France. Only persons expert in transport matters can provide an effective answer to the problem, but I must say that if I were Minister for Transport and Power I would call all the boys together and say to them: &ldquo;I do not keep a dog and bark myself.  All I am asking is that there should be provided <Col N="74" /> here the same facilities as are provided between Britain and France. I want the same facilities for persons who desire to come here as are enjoyed by people who wish to go to the Continent and between all of you you should be able to provide it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think that would be a reasonable requisition to the shipping companies and the civil servants.  Unless a pistol is put to somebody's head nothing will be done; everything will jog along as at present because the people who suffered the inconvenience are mainly people who are here for a period.  It is people who will not face the inconvenience who constitute the real loss which we are suffering because, remember, it is virtually certain that every car that comes here brings up to four tourists and it is not only the person who drives the car but the people who come with him who spend the money; and it is not only the petrol that is consumed but the expenditure of the party during their stay here.</P>
    <P>For years it was possible to allow a bus with anything up to 30 tourists to come into the country but when that was stopped the result was that a vast volume of that traffic was diverted to the Continent.  Somebody then said: &ldquo;This must stop&rdquo;, and they have been rolling in since to the advantage of everybody and the detriment of nobody. If it is possible to get a bus in here simply because an organised and powerful body in Britain sent it, surely it should be possible to get cars in more conveniently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving the Minister a rude or a short answer when I say that when people tell me they are making a tremendous effort, I always get a little sceptical.  I would prefer rather the attitude of the late M. Talleyrand who, approached by his Queen, said: &ldquo;If it is very difficult, it is done; if it is impossible, we shall see&rdquo;.  I do not see why the thing is not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see how it can be done by Great Britain and France.  I do not <Col N="75" /> see how it can be done in respect of a bus, when it cannot be done with a car.  The Minister says a great effort is being made, but I think he should make it clear that it is the source of perennial embarrassment to have to say that although we have a shuttle service between Dublin and Liverpool, Dublin and Holyhead, Rosslare and Fishguard and Cork and Fishguard, we are still in the position that it is impossible to accommodate tourists' cars.  Having said all that, I do not think it would be right to conclude without making it clear that in my experience Bord Fáilte is a co-operative body doing on the whole a good job.  Mind you, I do not think it is fair to look down our noses and say that 90 per cent. of the tourists are our own people.  I suppose they are, but, nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that on the whole Bord Fáilte is doing a good job. If half the tourists are coming to visit their relatives, the other half are of great importance and the more we get of them the better it will be.  I think it is terribly bad that our advertising in Great Britain particularly, and in the U.S. also, should operate to draw people to the offices of Bord Fáilte unless these offices can be adequately staffed.  It is a great mistake&mdash;and I want to emphasise this &mdash; to open scratch offices in rural towns in Ireland and put in them inexperienced staffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a case in a rural city where there is a quite attractive office of Bord Fáilte.  Certain people of my acquaintance were anxious to travel from a particular area in the south-east of Ireland to Connemara.  When they approached me, I said they were out of their minds to travel from that <Col N="76" /> part of Ireland to Connemara, without taking two bites at the cherry.  They came to me seething with indignation and said that they had met at the tourist office a nice little girl who said they could not get to Connemara from that place at all.  It was a pretty adequate reply but it was not communicated properly.</P>
    <P>If you want to travel from the south-east of Ireland to Connemara, you have quite a job on your hands but this is not the only part of the world where that happens.  You will have the same difficulty if you want to travel from Cornwall to Birmingham or from West Durham to Somerset but it creates an unfortunate position if you set up a tourist office like that to which people go expecting to get expert advice only to be told that the people there know as much about it as you do and the best thing to do would be to inquire from the local stationmaster.</P>
    <P>If you set up an official branch of Bord Fáilte in an area that does not justify the employment of highly skilled personnel you do more harm than good.  Where you have these offices you should also have highly skilled personnel to meet tourists, to meet people who want unreasonable facilities.  It is the unreasonable people who create trouble and one of the sad facts of public relations is that 100 satisfied customers never mention you afterwards but one fellow who imagines he has not been fairly treated will mention you ten times as often as the hundred who were satisfied. One dissatisfied person coming out of a Bord Fáilte office talks more than 100 people who have been adequately looked after.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think you cannot lay too much emphasis on the necessity of having properly trained staff in offices of this kind.  That is not so easy to do but what is vitally important is to persuade the staff in the Bord Fáilte offices that if they have not got the information the visitor seeks they should never let that person leave the office without having gone right to the top to make sure that their inability to give him all he needs is not due to <Col N="77" /> their own ignorance.  It is vitally important that when people go to a Bord Fáilte office they should get whatever they want or else an explanation from a sufficiently experienced member of the staff to satisfy them that what they seek cannot be made available and that that is not for the want of the will but for want of the way.</P>
    <P>I think, bearing in mind that one hears more of complaints than of anything else, that the facilities provided by Bord Fáilte are good.  I have heard complaints from people who have come in contact with inexperienced personnel and, as a result, have been allowed to leave the offices with a feeling that they had been treated with something approximating indifference. That does much more harm than good and it is a danger against which we should provide.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister what report he had from visitors who approached Bord Fáilte offices for information and advice as to how they could spend a holiday here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this House is to trace trouble to its source and to deal with it.  Somebody is operating these offices and, to the average tourist, it looks as if they are <Col N="78" /> branches of Bord Fáilte.  That is what matters.  When the tourist goes to a tourist office, he feels that he is going to Bord Fáilte.  I find it hard to believe that an agreement could operate that we vote large sums of money to the Tourist Board and, at the same time, allow these offices to be operated by the Irish Tourist Association without trained personnel.</P>
      <P>It is Bord Fáilte's responsibility to come to the Minister and tell him that this system is not working and that unless they can get skilled personnel into these offices harm will be done instead of good.  I am not trying to censure anybody but I am trying to find out what is wrong.  The Irish Tourist Association are not a body with a large staff of trained personnel such as the Tourist Board have.  It is very understandable that a local body anxious to promote its own district should seek to set up an office quite unconscious of the fact that without skilled personnel they would be better off without such an office at all.  If the Irish Tourist Association would approach Bord Fáilte in these matters we would have the assurance that the thing would be competently done and that the kind of difficulty to which I referred would not arise.</P>
      <P>How useful it is to have discussions and find out what is wrong so that effective measures can be taken to put it right.  I hope the Minister will consider the suggestions I have made to him.  On the whole, I realise that Bord Fáilte are doing a good job and, as I say, in my experience, trying to help everyone who approaches them. They are prepared to listen sympathetically to any serious suggestions for improving the tourist industry.  I think it is right on occasions of this kind to pay that tribute to them because if the obligation of commenting adversely upon them arose, I hope we would discharge it as faithfully. All criticism and no praise never got anyone anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to pay that tribute to Bord Fáilte and I hope they will take to heart what I have said about the canals, the boarding houses, <i>pensions</i> or guest houses or whatever you want to call them, and the information <Col N="79" /> centres, which, in my opinion, stand urgently in need of reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel I should comment on what Deputy Dillon said about the information centres.  I want to make it clear to the House that the Irish Tourist Association and Bord Fáilte are two different bodies. They help each other, and finance is given by Bord Fáilte on occasion to the I.T.A., but the I.T.A. are responsible for the running of the information offices referred to by Deputy Dillon.  The people who run them are employed by the I.T.A. but, unfortunately, the I.T.A. are not in a position to pay them adequate wages and consequently do not get adequate staff.</P>
      <P>We must not lose sight of the fact that the I.T.A. obtain their money more or less by scrounging all over the country, and particularly from the local authorities, some of which are generous and others not.  I appreciate that Deputy Dillon was not attempting to ridicule&mdash;although I use the word &ldquo;ridicule&rdquo;&mdash;Bord Fáilte.  I appreciate that it is necessary to have some adjustments made in the running of the tourist information centres because they are essential to the whole tourist business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice that unfortunately a number of people are somewhat cynical about tourism and it is time we got away from that attitude.  In my opinion, the importance of tourism to the nation's economy cannot be overstressed. Having said that, I also believe that we should not lose sight of the fact that it is a highly competitive business.  In view of the fact that it is a highly competitive business, it is very important that we should gear ourselves properly to compete.  We must not take the tourist business for granted.  As a matter of fact, if we enter the Common Market, it might be one of the main answers to the problems that will confront us by way of industries shedding employees. While that is so, we must watch out for interlopers in the tourist industry. Far too many of them are coming into the catering industry and regard the catering industry within the <Col N="80" /> tourist industry as &ldquo;an easy cop&rdquo;, something that can be used to be milked dry.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat intrigued by the suggestions made by Deputies on this Vote as to what should or should not be done in the matter of shortages of staff.  There were suggestions that we should utilise students to help us out of our difficulties.  I would not mind students being used if we could not get other staff, but I think it is essential that we should have competent staff and competent managers.  Up to recently, very little care was taken in the training of managers for the catering industry.  It sometimes happened that the person who moved into the management sphere of the catering industry was someone who had failed to become a lawyer, a doctor or something else.</P>
    <P>While I say that, I appreciate that there are a number of competent young men training in hotel management, but the encouragement they receive is not very good.  It is somewhat ironical to expect a young man to train to become manager of a Dublin hotel at £3 10s. a week and his keep, and gain the confidence of the people he is in charge of who have three times his salary.</P>
    <P>During the debate there was a lot of talk about the standards to which we should aspire and the cuisine standards we should have.  I think we should aim at having at least set standards, standards whereby we will display to all concerned that we in tourism know our job and are not setting out to cod the people.  If we have that standard, we can provide for the simple as well as the elaborate person.  I also believe that we should spend a lot more time in promoting Irish dishes.  It appears that in the catering world and the tourist world the tendency on the part of the proprietors of establishments is to go over to French menus.  I think that is very wrong.  It is essential that our people should know French menus and Italian menus and know as much as possible about these types of dishes. A competent chef will be familiar with Escoffier, but at the same time, our people should be encouraged to promote Irish dishes.  You do not travel miles and miles to get a meal you could <Col N="81" /> get at home, and yet some people believe that if you do not provide foreign dishes, you are bad news.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, an attempt was made to disprove that type of contention.  In the city of Dublin a catering exhibition was held by interested people, workers and employers.  French students were brought over to judge the exhibition and it was a proud moment for the Irishmen when they were told that all the items were first class.  It was also said that there had been one significant mistake which was that they had indulged in French cuisine instead of Irish.  The French experts pointed out that with perfect vegetables, perfect meats, perfect game, and all the other requirements, there was no necessity for us to camouflage our products.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we are to make the progress which we should make, or if we are to maintain the progress already made, if at all possible, the Minister should arrange with his colleague, the Minister for Education, to have some lessons introduced into school curricula dealing with tourism and its importance. I also believe that we should invoke the aid of the technical schools, some of which are being utilised in that regard at the moment in some places and not in others.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate, suggestions were made as to what we should aim at and what type of person we should aim to bring into the country. Above all, I believe we should not ignore the English working man who has a penchant for saving for holidays and who, having saved, has what is called a &ldquo;beano&rdquo; and spends it.  He behaves as if he were the manager of the establishment in which he works. He lashes it out and is found to be a man who looks after himself on the occasional holiday he takes, and can be very advantageous as a customer of any hotel in the country.  Similarly, we are inclined to ignore the English middle-class people and concentrate too much on the Americans.  The Americans we seem to get now are the poor type, those who give more bother than it is worth, the fellows who come on package deals and expect everything in the package.  They pay for these holidays on the never-never system <Col N="82" /> and it is unfortunate that some of those so-called Americans are people who once lived in this country, emigranted and made good over there.  They come over here for a holiday and lord it over the people here.</P>
    <P>As regards grants for hotel improvements, it is being suggested that more attention should be given to the smaller hotels.  I believe we should get away from this business of front. We seem to be anxious to put on a front of pretence.  It is rather significant that there is little or no difficulty if any hotel wants a grant for a lounge bar or to improve the restaurant proper but, up to the present, there is no provision to my knowledge for grants to be given to improve the back of the premises, the staff quarters, for instance.  It is very important to provide the staffs in these hotels with ample, decent accommodation.  These staffs are becoming more important daily having regard to the importance of the tourist industry.</P>
    <P>There has been some talk about what should be done by way of extending tourist business and it has been suggested that we should promote different attractions.  I believe each area should devise its own winter attractions with a view to lengthening the season.  That is the real trouble.  It has resulted in our being unable to build up a sufficient number of competent catering workers for the industry.  Very often, particularly outside Dublin, a girl or young man who spends a season in one of these hotels, gets to know something of the business and then goes away at the end of the season to England, Scotland, Wales, America or Canada and we never see them again.  That seems to be one of our greatest difficulties. I sincerely hope that we shall get down to this problem of lengthening the season.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued by Deputy Dillon's remarks on fishing when he suggested that at the end of the fishermen's day we should lay on T.V. for them.  If I know fishermen&mdash;and I know quite a number who come here and who live here&mdash;what they like to frequent is a pub.  They do not want to watch <Col N="83" /> T. V.  &ldquo;The one that got away&rdquo; is a more interesting topic.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was also intrigued by the remarks made on coarse fishing. Great credit is due to Bord Fáilte for the way they have developed coarse fishing.  We may not be completely satisfied with what they have done but they have made wonderful progress.  It is amazing how these things come about.  About four years ago a group of Irish waiters and chefs went to England for an exhibition of Irish cooking and Irish coffee.  They won praise from the newspapers and they interested the then Minister for Lands&mdash;the present Minister for Transport and Power, I think&mdash;and got a 20 minutes item on I.T.V.  I do not think we had to pay for it.  It was a simple effort, people just going out and demonstrating their ability and other people taking notice of it.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with what Deputy Dillon said in regard to canal fishing and the utilisation of canals.  It is a great pity that C.I.E. sold the canal boats which could have been fitted up into a type of luxury fishing boats for tourists of the type that come from England and France.  I agree with everything Deputy Dillon said about the car ferry service.  I understand the Minister is in difficulties and that he has done his best about this matter but, perhaps, if we cannot do anything about the sea, we might be able to do something by subsidising our air ferry service.  I do not know what progress has been made in that regard or if there is any comprehensive plan in existence about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also pay attention to the lack of a large concert or conference hall, particularly in Dublin.  We have lost many a large conference because of our inability to house people in conference.  We have been ashamed to see in other cases the breaking up of these bodies after we have put them into our biggest house and to see them going, half to one big hotel and half <Col N="84" /> to another on the night of a celebration when the conference ends.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that exhibitions and festivals are drawing-cards and we should, no doubt, encourage everybody to put on exhibitions and festivals so as to lengthen the season, but in some cases we have spent money year after year on festivals that do not bring visitors here.  Would the Minister explore the possibility of giving Bord Fáilte more power in this direction, power to put on their own attractions? I have in mind a <i>son et lumiere</i>.  It is done in most countries now.  We have a very powerful history, one that could be well depicted in the media of light and sound.  It is a costly item. Some interested people tried to do it here last year but the amount of money required was prohibitive, something like £30,000.  They could not get a grant from Bord Fáilte, only a promise of a gurantee against loss up to a certain extent.</P>
    <P>What is really lacking in the Board &mdash;I am not criticising them&mdash;is, I think, an ideas group to think out ways and means of attracting people to Ireland.  That is something we must provide because every nation is catching on to the importance of tourism. Even in Iron Curtain countries they pay real attention to bringing in tourists.  Some of us might never get out if we went there.  If we are to take tourism seriously we must take catering workers seriously.  The catering worker is the only worker in this country with the exception of those in the County Borough of Dublin who has not got a set of conditions laid down by the State in relation to his or her hours of working.  If that situation is allowed to continue much longer we shall lose the very good people it is so necessary to hold here.  Visitors to this country think Irish waiters and waitresses are grand people.  They think they will never get back here on holidays to witness the charm of the Irish waiter and waitress.  In other parts of the world, in France or America, the waiter or waitress is quite impersonal.  We should not make it too easy for people to run Irish waiters and waitresses out of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> Bord Fáilte should be given power to deal with restaurant and café owners who overcharge.  At the moment if a person is overcharged in a café or restaurant and if he writes to Bord Fáilte, Bord Fáilte will reply politely to the effect that they will do what they can.  They may write a sharp note to the restaurant or café owner but that is all they can do. They cannot take any action to ensure that the person who complains will get his money back or say that the restaurant of café owner will have his registration taken away, because the restaurant or café owner is not registered in the same sense as hoteliers.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued at the suggestions made in regard to looking after the guest houses.  Indeed, some of the guest houses need to be looked after. If some of them are allowed to continue they will ruin our industry.  I have in mind the fly-by-night guest house.  There are some guest houses on the quays in Dublin which offer rooms over restaurants and when the people go to them they find they are unfit to stay in.  They do not get their money back and they have no redress.  I notice also that this Estimate refers to Cork Airport.  I am somewhat disappointed there is no provision for improving the kitchen facilities at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on this Estimate.  We have already had a tremendous debate far beyond the ambit of the Estimate but I cannot deal with Dublin Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have mentioned it, anyway.  Taking everything into consideration, I think Bord Fáilté is doing a very good job.  We are too prone to criticise Bord Fáilte instead of criticising ourselves.  We should ask ourselves what contribution we are making individually and collectively towards building up the tourist industry.  I appreciated the Minister is only a short time looking after tourism.  It is a good thing to have a Minister directly responsible for the operation of tourism because it is recognised as being second in importance to agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the last speaker and Deputy Dillon, I wish to comment on this question of cross-Channel transport for cars.  I am in full agreement with both speakers that some effort should be made to have cars transported to this country at a reasonable rate.  I appreciate it is a big problem and it will probably take some time to meet it.  However, there is one point the Minister could look into in the meantime, that is, the question of self-drive cars.  I do not know if the Minister has had an opportunity of looking into the provincial and daily papers in Great Britain and, I understand, the United States, where we find self-drive cars advertised as being available to the tourists when they arrive in this country.  I do not intend to criticise firms of repute; there are firms of repute who are doing a wonderful job. I am referring to those men who are advertising at cut-throat prices.  I am speaking from experience.  I know Irish people residing in Britain who return here for Christmas, Easter and summer holidays.  They have procured self-drive cars as the result of advertisements in provincial papers in Britain, an accident occurs, and the first thing they find is that there is no insurance.  Therefore, if the car is damaged they lose their deposit, number one; very often there is no insurance for passengers in the car, the only insurance in some cases being for a maimed driver.  There is no mention of those facts in the advertisement in relation to the self-drive car and now the bureau has to come to the aid of people maimed in accidents by cars such as these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power should step in and compel all self-drive car companies to register with him, and a condition precedent to the registration should be that their cars are of a certain standard and carry a certain insurance cover.  Pending the righting of the wrongs pointed out by Deputy Mullen and Deputy Dillon in regard to the transport of cars, something could be done here. Self-drive is becoming very popular and rightly so.  It gives an opportunity to tourists to see the country, to go <Col N="87" /> into the byways, off the beaten track, and to use cars which are in common use in the country, not the large American limousines which are too big for our roads.  We could go a long distance if Bord Fáilte took over the advertising&mdash;at a fee, of course&mdash;of these self-drive cars, or if the companies concerned were compelled to register with them as a condition precedent to their going into the market.</P>
    <P>I would strongly recommend the Minister to look into the matter.  A section of the Road Traffic Act will be coming into force on the 1st of May in respect of insurance and it might be an opportunity for the Minister to co-ordinate, before the present tourist season opens, the activities of his Department with those of Local Government and Justice in ensuring that the cars coming on the road for self-drive would be cars of a reputable standard and with proper insurance.  We have gone a long way in the matter of reciprocal arrangement with other countries for exchange of driving licences. That has done a considerable amount of good and has eliminated a great deal of red tape.  We can go further.  I hope the Minister will look into this matter pending the settlement of some cheaper method of transporting cars by sea or air.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to decry the Tourist Board in any way.  In my first speech as a Minister of State at a tourist development dinner in Bundoran I suggested that the three tourist organisations of that day should marry and that there should be one organisation governing tourism in this State.  We did abolish one of the organisations in existence at the time, which left us with the Tourist Association and the Tourist Board.  Serious consideration should be given to a second marriage in so far as they are concerned.  It is quite possible that the Tourist Board could utilise the personnel of the Tourist Association, which is mostly a voluntary organisation, and form one body governing tourism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon had to be corrected by Deputy Mullen as to the duties of the Tourist Association.  There are <Col N="88" /> Deputies who cannot distinguish between the duties of the Tourist Board and the duties of the Tourist Association. If we cannot distinguish between them, how can the Irish public or the tourist be expected to distinguish between them?  The Minister should consider a marriage of these two organisations and having one organisation governing tourism.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I do not wish to criticise the Tourist Board for their activities.  I remember some nine years ago saying in this House that I would advise them to look East instead of West for their business and their trade.  At that time we appeared to be concentrating on America for the tourist industry.  I thought it was foolish and I said it in this House.  I repeated it on three different occasions during discussions on Estimates of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I repeat it now.  I do not think the American tourist is the advantage to this country that he is made out to be.  I see now where such tourists have been going to see Killarney by helicopter.  They have not time to wait overnight.  They want to have a look at it by helicopter, purchase a few, possibly valuable, souvenirs in the duty-free airport at Shannon, and leave.  We are not decrying them; I do not wish to decry them in any way but they are not the attractive tourist that we should try to get.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mullen is right, and I have said it many times, that our eye should be on the working-class and the middle-class of Great Britain and the Six Counties.  They are the potential money spinners and money spenders as tourists.  They have certain blood connections, and other connections, business connections, with us and we are quite close to them with the strip of Irish Sea in between.</P>
    <P>I remember advising the Tourist Board several times to open tourist centres in the various cities throughout Britain and suggesting that they should do what the various British seaside resorts are doing, that is, having Yorkshire Wakes and attracting tourists to certain centres for the period of the Yorkshire Wakes, the Lancashire Wakes and the Scotch <Col N="89" /> Fairs.  They should try to attract tourists to the north of the country from Scotland and Northern Britain and to the south of the country from southern and central England.  We should not be afraid to descend even to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach described as the &ldquo;despicable raffle&rdquo; in advertising our seaside resorts.  We should make prizes available in centres, if necessary, for the purpose of attracting people to seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>If we are to set the middle class and the workingman as our tourist target, there is not much use in concentrating on the super hotels that are going up throughout the country.  We have to concentrate on the smaller hotel and the guesthouse.  I shall not deal with the type of guesthouse in the City of Dublin to which Deputy Mullen referred.  I know that what Deputy Mullen says is correct but I cannot go into that.  I refer to the guesthouse and, if you wish, the boarding house and the smaller hotel in the smaller seaside resorts.</P>
    <P>Theoretically, Bord Fáilte are at liberty to make grants to guesthouses and smaller hotels to improve their amenities.  I wonder has any Deputy the experience of applying to Bord Fáilte for such a grant?  I have.  I applied to them on three different occasions for grants for small hotels to improve their amenities.  We provided architects' reports and all the information they sought but if we were to carry out the repairs they suggested it could be done in only one way, by pulling down the structure and starting all over again.  Instead of building a guesthouse or small country hotel we would have had another luxury or super hotel in an area which could not cater for the class for which such an hotel would be suitable.</P>
    <P>I know another case where a very good hotel in provincial Ireland, some three or four years ago, applied for a grant.  They were being put off by the usual red tape until eventually they became exasperated.  An official of the Board called and said, &ldquo;We know you have done everything but, unfortunately, all moneys voted to us for this year have been absorbed in the building of hotels in the south of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> He was referring to the luxury hotels in Clare and Limerick but particularly in Kerry.  The unfortunate applicant had to wait until the following financial year to procure what I would call a reasonable grant.</P>
    <P>There are places where luxury hotels may be necessary.  I have no objection to luxury hotels in the immediate vicinity of Shannon.  If Kerry is to become a playground for American millionaires, let us try to extract a few thousand dollars out of their pockets by building a few luxury hotels but do not let us do it at the expense of the middle-class and workingclass English tourist whom we are trying to attract. I would appeal to the Minister to ask Bord Fáilte to concentrate more on giving grants to smaller hotels and guesthouses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good; I accept the ruling of the Chair as far as that is concerned.  Deputy Mullen pointed out the difficulty of retaining staffs in tourist hotels throughout the entire year.  It is a very serious problem.  We have no alternative employment for them during the winter months, and until we can extend the tourist season, it is most difficult.  Hotels, with the assistance of the unions, train young men and make them ideal waiters; but the end of the season comes and these boys have to clear off to Britain or some other industrial centre to seek alternative employment.  The next season starts and we find the hotelier taking on boys by trial and error until he eventually finds a staff.</P>
      <P>A story is told about a hotel in a seaside resort at the beginning of the season.  It had just opened and a tourist called for afternoon coffee. The waiter asked him did he want black or white and he said he would have it half and half.  The waiter did not know whether he wanted half in the cup and half in the saucer or what exactly he meant.  I am telling the story to show that the hotelier at the beginning of the season has to take on these untrained boys and dismiss them if they are not successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should do something to try to retain the trained personnel throughout the year.  I know a hotelier in Achill&mdash;I am not here to advertise any particular hotel&mdash;who found the <Col N="93" /> same difficulty.  His solution was to build a cinema opposite the hotel and retain his staff as usherettes in the cinema during the winter months.  It was a display of initiative on his part, and he has been able to retain probably one of the finest staffs in the West.</P>
    <P>I have often thought that the Minister, by liaison with his colleague, the Minister for Defence, might have been able to do something in this matter.  Chefs are most difficult to procure.  It is a very highly skilled profession and one cannot expect a chef or a trainee chef to remain out of employment for six or eight months of the year.  If catering schools were established for boy apprentices in the Army, where during their basic training they could be leased out as trainees to the hotels during the summer, we might solve this difficulty.  These boys, on discharge from the Army, would be eligible to join a catering union and become permanently occupied in the catering business.  It is something the Minister might look into as a method of solving this problem.</P>
    <P>Having got our tourist to the seaside resort and having provided him with a comfortable hotel, and, possibly, good food, we have to go a little further.  We have to cater for his entertainment and wants, particularly during inclement weather.  We have also to give him the facilities to keep in contact with the business he has left behind.  One of the essentials in a seaside resort is a public telephone.</P>

    <P>With regard to fishing, I come from a tourist county in which about 70 per cent. of our brown trout and sea trout fishing and about 30 per cent. of our salmon fishing is free &mdash; there is no charge.  We have some very good salmon rivers privately owned.  The worst landlord we have is the Minister's <Col N="95" /> colleague, the Minister for Agriculture. He owns one of the best rivers in Donegal, the Owenea in Glenties. He took it over from the previous owners.  It is now State property. Some few years ago, when Deputy Dillon was Minister for Agriculture, he displayed initiative by letting the river to the local angling association for a sum of £400.</P>

The wild duck, the widgeon, the teal, the mallard, the grey goose, and other varieties of wild goose, fly in here. They may drop on the lakes or moors of Scotland on their way.  It has never been suggested that they bring in fowl pest.  If it is suggested that we should import a few grouse from Yorkshire or the Highlands, the Government hold up their hands in holy horror and talk about the infestation of fowl with disease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree. It might require legislation and it might not.  We had these amenities in the past as a result of the Nelson eye. It might still be possible for the Minister to ensure that the Nelson eye would be used, or rather not used. While Dublin certainly may be looked upon by the foreigners as a tourist centre, it is not really a tourist centre. I think far too much money is being spent on attracting people to the city of Dublin.  We decry the centralisation of industry and what we wish to see is the decentralisation by Bord Fáilte of the considerable amount of money which they spend on advertising the city of Dublin.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest attractions here is our Horse Show in August.  Bord Fáilte have spent a considerable sum of money advertising the Horse Show. I have gone through the figures since the War and I find that they have not attracted one extra visitor to the Horse Show.  The attendance is static. One year it may be up by a thousand for the average during the week and another year it may be down, but it is mainly static.  Bord Fáilte have not succeeded in attracting additional tourists to the city.  One of the reasons is that there is no accommodation for them during Horse show week.  I should like to see Bord Fáilte spend more time and money and do more advertising to attract tourists to the various tourist resorts, and I do not mean seaside resorts.  We have other valuable tourist resorts in addition to seaside resorts and I should like to see Bord Fáilte pay more attention to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the papers and in magazines of these farms to which the Minister objected to my referring, where the spawn of rainbow trout is procured. We have on Arranmore Island off the coast of Donegal the only lake in Europe in which rainbow trout thrive without being restocked.

      <P>I am referring to sporting fish.  Here we have one of the finest tourist attractions in the country. The only lake in Europe in which rainbow trout have propagated themselves over the past 50 years without being restocked. Not a solitary line is given to them in the literature of the Tourist Board.  There is far too much centralisation by the Board in its advertising and far too much money is being spent building these luxury hotels.  I know I am prohibited from discussing roads. What tourist wants to go through this country on an autobahn?  He wants to get off the main roads and to discover the little known beaches and the little byways.  What effort are we making to attract him?  Again, were I permitted to discuss it, I would discuss the cutting of hedges which would help the tourist to see the countryside but the rules of the House do not permit me to mention these matters and it is a pity, because they are tourist attractions.  As I said before, this entire country is a tourist resort at certain times of the year.  Let me conclude by asking the Tourist Board to go eastwards, to look eastwards and to pay less attention to the west.  By that, I mean the other side of the Atlantic.</P>

      <P>If we are to develop the tourist industry, we must, first of all, have a Minister who is prepared <Col N="101" /> to take his courage in his hands.  As far as I am concerned, and the people in the area for which I speak, we see no reason why we should have duplication. We have the I.T.A. and we have Bord Fáilte two overlapping bodies, one depending for its existence on State funds and the other depending for its existence on contributions from the local authorities.  I see no reason why those two bodies should not be united in a common effort, and not have them at sixes and sevens as they are at present, both going in different directions while allegedly aiming at the same target.  If we want to attract the tourist, we must give him, not the Atlantic ocean coming in and going out every day or the Irish sea on the eastern coast.  We must make things attractive; we must give an inducement. Here let me congratulate the Hospitals Trust, together with the Racing Board, for sponsoring the greatest attraction in racing that Europe has seen.  It will be held next June at the Curragh.  To that event will come tourists from all over the world.  They will fly into Shannon and Dublin and spend their time and their money in this country.  For that, the Hospitals Trust and the Racing Board only are to be congratulated. We did not find the Irish Tourist Association or Bord Fáilte making any effort to sponsor such events.</P>
      <P>I want to speak for the area from which I come.  We are not a coastal county but we certainly have something to give.  We have more to give in our area than any seaside resort in Ireland. We give something when nobody else has it to give.  We can start off midway in September and, through October, November and right up to April, give the attractions to the tourist from England or America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some eleven years ago, by pure accident, I was responsible for bringing a party of American tourists to hunt in County Limerick.  It started with four.  They come and the numbers are increasing every year for the hunting season around Limerick.  Bord Fáilte seem to forget that while hunting is more or less prohibitive in America it is thrown open for a sum of £2 or £3 a day in County Limerick.  For that amount of money, <Col N="102" /> a person is supplied with fine open country, guaranteed hunting and a first-class course.</P>
    <P>Let me now move on to fishing. For some unknown reason, away back in 1927 or 1928 some brave got the idea of handing over the fishery rights of the Shannon to the E.S.B. The E.S.B. were founded to generate current&mdash;certainly not to control fishing. Since they have taken it over, they have ruined the fishing on the River Shannon.</P>

      <P>Prior to the erection of the weir across the Shannon at Limerick, there was a free flow of fish up the Shannon through Athlone and further up through the northern counties as well as up the tributaries.  Since the erection of the weir at Limerick, something has happened which has not happened in respect of any weir erected in Europe.  No fish pass is provided in the weir at Limerick.  Therefore, <Col N="103" /> from Limerick northwards, including the tributaries of the Shannon, fishing is controlled.  It is controlled by whatever small percentage of fish the E.S.B. wish to allow to pass through the weir.  That has killed the interest in that amenity of tourists and fishermen from Limerick up the whole stretch of the Shannon and its tributaries. I ask the Minister now at this late stage to intervene and to allow the fish to come through the Shannon, as happens in every other country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that, in order to attract tourists to come to fish, this step should be taken. You can fish in Ireland for little or nothing compared with other countries. Consider the fishing in England. Hundreds and hundreds of people sit along a canal bank, shoulder to shoulder, with a bit of rod and line. They remain there the day long.  That is fishing as far as the Englishman is concerned.  It is not the energetic fishing we are accustomed to here and about which those in England know nothing at all.  Bord Fáilte have fallen down on their job by not bringing that point home to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From fishing, I shall now move on to shooting.  From 1st October, you have one section of shooting and from 1st November, the other.  Most of County Limerick is open shooting. There has been no word, no organising, no publicity about that fact in England. Shooting is absolutely prohibitive in England except for the privileged classes.  It is thrown open to all and sundry in County Limerick.  I appeal to the Minister to spend more time, <Col N="104" /> energy and imagination on the advertising of these amenities throughout England.</P>
    <P>I have passed through the majority of cities in England.  What do you see about Ireland when you look along the platform?  Very little.  Go into the clubs at night.  Do you see anything about the facilities in Ireland? Do you see anything there about the cheap hunting, fishing and shooting in Ireland?  There is not a word about it.  You will get a bit of an office stuck in a side street where you will be given bits of paper and pamphlets which will convey nothing. We have not got down to the root of the tourist industry.  I should like to see teams of efficient men touring England and lecturing on the amenities we have to offer at such fair prices.</P>
    <P>Now I come to hotels.  I see no need for all this massive building for millionaires.  Any American tourist who comes to this country will make sure he gets value for his money.  Too much play has been made about American millionaires and I, like many Deputies who have spoken on this Supplementary Estimate, would much prefer any day to see tourists from England, Scotland and Wales coming here.  They are the people who will spend money and if we want to encourage them to continue their visits, we must provide for them something exclusively Irish &mdash;something in our character, something individualistic, something they have not got at home.  Of course I may not speak of the licensing laws here, but I would appeal to the Minister to spend more money in the cities and towns of Britain in a campaign to bring home to those people the facilities we have here and the low cost of these facilities by comparison with what they have to pay for similar facilities in their own countries.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again the necessity to send teams of experts over there to publicise our amenities.  Then we can say with hope that the tourist industry will pay off.  It is no use anticipating a rich harvest from this industry if we leave it to individual effort as we do in the case of the West of Ireland in the matter of deep sea fishing.  The people of Westport and Dingle are making <Col N="105" /> great individual efforts with practically no help, except what they can get by pulling and dragging small contributions from Bord Fáilte.  These are the things that attract people from outside; these are the things we need if we are to improve our tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his speech, Deputy Mullen touched on the major points I intended to refer to. Accordingly, I should just like to make one or two points in support of his general statement.  First of all, I would congratulate Deputy Mullen's and other organisations on the fine improvement brought about in the catering industry in Dublin.  That has been reflected in improved standards generally in hotels in the city.  On the other hand, I must make a strong protest against the prices charged in some cafés and hotels.  Some of the proprietors of these establishments have come from the East and seem to have a cynical disregard for the capacity of customers to pay some of the prices they ask for very moderate meals.</P>
      <P>Incidentally, while foreigners are mainly to blame for that position, some of our own people are at fault, too.  I have had occasion, as most members of the House have had, to go to the R.D.S. for the Spring Show and the Horse Show and I have found that the prices charged there are appallingly high.  I do not know whether Bord Fáilte have received complaints but I know people who have complained about the high charges while these events are being held.</P>
      <P>Another point I should like to draw to the Minister's attention is the question of the grants given by Bord Fáilte towards hotel development.  I referred to this last week during the debate on the Vote on Account, my complaint being that there is a tendency on the part of proprietors of hotels, who have been facilitated by substantial Bord Fáilte development grants, to put such hotels on the market at very enhanced prices.  I do not know whether it is within the Minister's capacity to control that sort of speculation but I do say it is something which is not desirable from the point of view of the tourist industry or the good of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> I would appeal to Bord Fáilte to be more magnanimous, more generous, in relation to appeals made by local authorities for the development of amenities in their respective areas.  I have in mind the disappointing experience of Dublin Corporation some years ago when they submitted suggestions for the development of Bull Island.  They were turned down on the ground that the Island was mainly a resort for Dublin citizens.  Nobody familiar with north-east Dublin could doubt that tourists coming to the city make use of hotels and other amenities in the area.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the position in regard to Bull Island.  The Corporation are engaged in development work opening access to it but they could not hope to embark on large scale development work without outside assistance.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Bord Fáilte on the magnificient work they are doing for tourism.  I do not share the view of Deputy P. O'Donnell that they are advertising Dublin exclusively. I have access to a large number of newspapers and journals, mainly cross-Channel papers and I frequently see attractive advertisements publicising Ireland&mdash;not a Twenty-Six County Ireland but an Ireland of thirty-two counties&mdash;and I know from contacts and from conversations with friends that officials have gone around and have displayed films showing the facilities and amenities we have to offer tourists.  I think the board are doing a good job in helping to develop our tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been an interesting debate and it has been on so lavish a scale that it may be unnecessary for me to say quite as much on the main estimate as I shall have to say tonight.  It will give me more opportunity to speak on other aspects of my departmental work on the occasion of the main Estimate as almost the entire ground of the tourist field has been covered in this debate, even though this is only a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the whole, the feelings of the House have been friendly towards <Col N="107" /> Bord Fáilte and there has been a considerable amount of praise for their efforts to stimulate tourism.  The directors and staff will be glad to read the debate because of the generous support given to their organisation. The only bitter note struck in the debate was that struck by Deputy O'Donnell who deliberately tried to convey the impression to the Irish people that Bord Fáilte would have nothing to do with anything but luxury hotels and that no money was spent outside Dublin.  He made other charges which he himself knows were quite without foundation and which were, indeed, in direct contradistinction to speeches made by his colleagues on the Fine Gael benches.</P>
    <P>I want to come now to the suggestions made, and the criticisms offered, all of which will be considered by the Department and by Bord Fáilte and to give as full an account as I can of the progress of Bord Fáilte.  Deputy Corish asked how the figures for expenditure for tourists were arrived at. That does not come within the ambit of my Department but, it is very important for Bord Fáilte to have a correct method of assessment.  Perhaps I could refer Deputies to an abstract relating to the number and expenditure of visitors to Ireland, and Irish visitors abroad, which is a reprint from the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Abstract</i> of December, 1959.  They will find there a very detailed description of the method by which the figures for tourist revenue are compiled.</P>
    <P>They are compiled largely on the basis of information given by the transport companies and a sample passenger card inquiry undertaken at eight day intervals in respect of persons entering and leaving the State.</P>
    <P>The information gathered by these means is used in conjunction with the total passenger movement and in that way they estimate the expenditure in this country.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office has a very fine reputation, both in this country and abroad, and in their view, the final estimates of expenditure may be taken as reasonably firm. I do not think I need say anything <Col N="108" /> more about the estimation of the value of the tourist industry except to ask Deputies who are interested in the fairly complex procedure by which that is assessed to read the reprint from the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> in which they will find the full analysis of the methods used.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies questioned the extent to which Bord Fáilte succeed in bringing people who are not of Irish origin into this country.  On the basis of the analysis given by the Central Statistics Office in 1960, the total income attributable to tourism was £42.4 million.  This was 17 per cent.  of our total external assets, indicating the great importance of the tourist industry.  Of that £42.4 million, £23 million was spent by tourists in the strictly narrow sense, excluding those who visited relatives here or came for business purposes.  The international definition of tourists includes those people coming to a country who are of the origin of that country.  The expenditure here has been broken down in order to illustrate how far we are attracting people with no connection with Ireland to come here.</P>
    <P>Again, using the term tourist in the narrowest possible sense, the tourists who came here in 1960 accounted for 697,000 of the 1,400,000 recorded visits.  I think we should be realistic about the part that Bord Fáilte should play in attracting our own kith and kin to this country.  While it is true to say that there is a tremendous inducement for people of our own kith and kin to come here for holidays as time passes, it would be very wrong to make the assumption that we should not encourage them to come back, pointing out to them the newer amenities and facilities and the pleasure they can have here.  As time passes and as the industry grows, that part of the work of Bord Fáilte will become more and more important.  It would be very wrong to assume that money spent in attracting our own kith and kin to return to this country would be ill spent.  That is certainly true of people of Irish origin living in the United States.  They have to cross the Atlantic at much greater expense.  We are, however, bringing new people to this <Col N="109" /> country in very large numbers, people who have not been here before.</P>
    <P>Deputies Esmonde and Corish raised the question of the amount spent by Bord Fáilte on publicity and Deputy Esmonde suggested that we should make clear to visitors the uncongested character of our roads and the pleasant conditions of living in this country.  In a recent year, out of £571,000 spent by Bord Fáilte, £290,000 was spent on publicity.  The main accent in regard to tourist propaganda may be described in these words &ldquo;Take it easy in Ireland&rdquo;. That is the general propaganda line in Bord Fáilte and the uncongested roads are particularly stressed in all the publicity.  They also point out the hospitality people receive here, the matchless scenery, and there is a great deal of publicity given to the sporting opportunities, to hunting, shooting, fishing and the special festivals that take place here.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Esmonde for carrying a trunk full of propaganda to spread about the places he visits when in Europe.  An example has been set by him which might well be followed by others who travel outside the country.  In regard to the character of the publicity, apart from handouts, leaflets and pamphlets, Bord Fáilte maintains offices in London, Manchester, Glasgow, New York, Montreal and Paris and conducts a continuous and extensive campaign, including the distribution of leaflets, trade advertising, television and the distribution of coloured films.  They also have a number of officers travelling through Britain and other countries visiting travel agents and arranging film shows and exhibitions and providing lectures to staffs of factories and offices and other groups with particular interests.</P>
    <P>A very important part of their work is to sponsor visits by overseas journalists and travel agents.  One of the most important functions of Bord Fáilte is to bring travel agents to this country so that they will see what they have to sell, and particularly in so far as they can, to bring to Ireland not only the heads of travel agencies but as many of the counter-clerks as they <Col N="110" /> can, so that they will have an idea of what they are selling to the people.  In many cases, they have never visited Ireland and know only what they read in the leaflets.  That is part of a planned campaign which, as manager of a tourist agency for four years in Paris many years ago, I can say is, on the whole, run well by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>To give some examples of the magnitude of the publicity of Bord Fáilte, I understand they distributed literature last year at the rate of 4,000,000 separate individual items. It was quite a long time before we could really convince the people of this country that it was worth spending large sums of money on the tourist industry.  It is interesting to note that the French Commissariat for Tourism spend annually more money on posters alone than the entire annual expenditure of Bord Fáilte, which indicates the very modest allocation we have for tourism and in connection with this Vote.</P>
    <P>In reply to a great number of Deputies, Bord Fáilte are concentrating their publicity, rightly, on Great Britain because there the major market lies.  The publicity reaches people of every income grade.  The publicity of Bord Fáilte reaches the working-men's clubs, the angling clubs, and the workers' travel associations, and everything possible is done to stimulate travel by people of all income groups in Great Britain.  More money is now being spent in the United States and a very small amount of money in Europe, but it is perfectly right that a great portion of the allocation on publicity should be spent in the neighbouring island.  I can assure Deputies that is not lost sight of by Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of publicity for special types of tourism is undertaken in Europe, particularly in connection with shooting and fishing.  The number of angling visitors from France and the number of Frenchmen who come here to shoot snipe has grown remarkably in the past three or four years.  A number of Deputies spoke of the importance of developing angling tourism and, as I was previously Minister in charge of fisheries and in charge of helping to <Col N="111" /> develop inland fishing for the purpose of encouraging tourists as well as our own people to fish, I have, naturally, taken a very great interest in the work of Bord Fáilte who co-operate very closely with the Inland Fisheries Trust in this very important activity.</P>
    <P>I do not think anyone can say there has been any neglect of the development of angling tourism. Expenditure in the recent five year fishing plan has totalled £250,000 and in that period the income from visiting anglers was approximately £3½ million and is now over £1 million per annum.  I should say that coarse fishing has taken a very important part in that development.  In 1958, it is reckoned that 4,700 people came here for coarse fishing.  That number had risen to 12,500 in 1959, and to 16,850 in 1960.  Deputy Dillon spoke of angling in my constituency.  I managed to get the figures, for 1960, for Monaghan.  There were some 1,400 tourist anglers in 1960 as compared with 300 some four years previously, showing a great development.</P>
    <P>Deputies have suggested that Bord Fáilte do not promote tourism among the artisan and middle-income class. In fact, Bord Fáilte organisers go around the workingmen's angling clubs, railway angling clubs, and angling clubs related to particular towns. They have shown films in those clubs and they make sure that the members of the clubs know to what travel agency they should go.  Considerable business has been arranged with a big organisation called the Workmen's Travel Association.  The coarse fish angling campaign has brought many Englishmen of the craftsmen class to this country.  As a result of coming here with their families, they will advertise not only the angling facilities of Ireland but the whole country as well, and we can expect more traffic of this type in future years.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that a number of coarse fishermen have switched over to game fishing for part of their holiday.  They had no idea of how cheap it could be.  I believe it is equally true that game fishermen <Col N="112" /> have been seen surreptitiously fishing for coarse fish, ashamedly to begin with, and openly afterwards.  It is equally true to say that a number of fishermen who came here have tried sea angling for the first time in their lives.  They came to fish for game fish or pike or bream.  The general impact of tourist angling is extending enormously through the experience of people who came here.</P>
    <P>If Deputies could see the full list of moderate-priced coach tours from Great Britain to here, they would realise that an appeal is being made to the middle and moderate income groups in Great Britain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister anything to say about the canals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not yet reached the question of the canal.  A very large number of tours from all parts of England by motor coach are arranged at prices of about £3 to £4 10s. per day, all inclusive, which as Deputies will realise, will appeal to people of moderate incomes.  Those coach tours are constantly being extended.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the success of bringing anglers here depends on the development associations consisting of most devoted people who work for no reward to themselves.  They arrange bookings in their towns and help to list accommodation.  They arrange for catering courses for people who are not accustomed to taking care of tourists and they also collaborate with Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust.  They have their own publicity in Great Britain in the angling newspapers, and in many cases, they send delegations to Great Britain, and in some cases, they maintain a particular connection with a town in Britain and in that way they have helped to increase our tourist angling business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular features of fishing that can be found in each area are, first of all, included in the main Bord Fáilte Angling Guide and, secondly, in local brochures for which Bord Fáilte give some assistance in the preparation.  Wherever fishing is available in canals, I know from my own experience in the past, although I <Col N="113" /> have not got the information here tonight, that the local development association includes canal angling amenities in their brochure and, through the films shown by Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust in Great Britain, Deputy Dillon can be certain that angling clubs in Great Britain know that in certain areas there is very fine fishing in the canals.</P>
    <P>An effort is also being made to stock the canals with tench which are particularly suitable for canal waters. I think Deputies also know that a very large stretch of canal will be permanently maintained as far as we know in the foreseeable future, regardless of any action taken in respect of canals by C.I.E.</P>
    <P>The development of game is, in part, the responsibility of the Minister for Lands and partly my responsibility to the extent that Bord Fáilte carries out publicity advertising game amenities. It has given some substantial help to the newly-established game councils on the assumption that, as the years go by, we shall gradually be able to develop a national game policy.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is also equally in touch with hunt organisations in the United States and gives information to travel agencies, especially in the U.S., in order to encourage people to come here and hunt.  I mentioned that because Deputy Donegan stressed the importance of hunting as a winter attraction. Bord Fáilte includes hunting and other sport in their general publicity and at the same time maintains touch with hunt organisations wherever possible so as to encourage people to hunt here. I do not hunt, but I think Deputies will realise there are some difficulties.  Many people abroad are not accustomed to our style of hunting and sometimes require a certain amount of experience before they become fully competent to hunt in our manner.  That has been proved true by some of the very short week-end hunting tours that have been arranged and have not been successful because some experience is required before people from abroad become accustomed to our way of hunting.</P>
    <P>I come to the question of hotel grants.  Deputy Cosgrave suggested that hoteliers were sometimes deterred <Col N="114" /> from improving premises through fear of incurring substantially increased valuation.  I understand that premises that have been improved or extended are subject to increased valuation but qualify for two-thirds remission of rates on any increase for a period of from two to seven years.  Taxation depreciation allowance includes an initial depreciation of 20 per cent. so that hoteliers can be encouraged to improve premises and promoters can be encouraged to build new hotels.  The rating and tax allowances together offer them a reasonable chance of developing and extending hotels without too much difficulty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said that the scheme of funding loans for hotels is preferable to the direct cash grant scheme as a means of encouraging hotel development.  He also suggested that the interest-free period on loans should be extended from 5 to 16 years. I am not quite clear on what he meant by the &ldquo;funding&rdquo; of loans.  The State does not advance moneys for hotel development works but the Minister can give guarantees in respect of loans raised by hoteliers in approved cases. The loans are lent in the normal way by lending institutions, usually the banks.  In view of the Minister's guarantee, the interest rate of such loans is generally a little bit below the normal lending rate.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte also gives grants which make guaranteed loans interest-free for five years and Bord Fáilte also makes grants which meet the greater part of the interest rate on loans secured otherwise than under the Ministerial guarantee, so that an hotel manager may borrow money himself without a Ministerial guarantee and get the interest paid on it for a number of years by Bord Fáilte.  He can also get the interest paid for five years on money borrowed on State guarantee.</P>
    <P>There are also grants for reconstruction of bedrooms and other hotel amenities.  I think those grants are generous and that it would be unreasonable to suggest that the interest-free period of the loan should be extended from 5 to 16 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about assistance for holiday camps.  They qualify for <Col N="115" /> the same treatment as hotels as regards grant and loan facilities and tax concessions. Butlin's holiday camp have received substantial grant assistance from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Assistance for private unregistered accommodation is suggested by some Deputies but I think Bord Fáilte were right in confining financial assistance to registered premises where there is a certain minimum standard.  The guaranteed loans and interest grant schemes are available to all registered premises, including guest houses.  A number of complaints have been made by Deputies to the effect that Bord Fáilte stress too much the incentives they offer to luxury hotels.  First, the hotels classified as &ldquo;A&rdquo; by Bord Fáilte as distinct from &ldquo;A plus&rdquo; or &ldquo;A-star&rdquo; are not, in the international sense, luxury hotels.  They are regarded as top-grade but not luxury hotels.  The luxury hotel is confined to those specified as &ldquo;A plus&rdquo; of which there are not many in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to hear the proportions of accommodation of the various classes in the country.  Out of a total of 18,700 registered hotel bedrooms fewer than 5,500 are in the &ldquo;A plus&rdquo; or &ldquo;A&rdquo; class.  By 1963, it is expected that we shall have 20,000 registered bedrooms of which &ldquo;A plus&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo; grades will account for about 6,400 rooms.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that Bord Fáilte are unwilling to assist in small extensions and improvement works and that this operates against the small hotelier or guest-house keeper. Deputy Dillon stressed the importance of assisting the small hotel keeper and guest-house keeper and at the same time suggested they should not be encouraged to go too far at once.  I think the minima for the various schemes are fairly reasonable.  The expenditure on improvement in accommodation required by Bord Fáilte for an hotel of any class or for registered guest house is as follows: bedroom grants should be for at least five bedrooms.  If it is an improvement grant, the works should be to the value of at least £2,000.  If a guaranteed loan is required it should <Col N="116" /> be for at least £500 and if interest grants are applied for, it should be in respect of loans of at least £500. The assistance offered is reasonable on the whole and it certainly is not discouraging to the small hotelier or to the registered guest-house keeper.</P>
    <P>The question was raised about advertising the simpler classes of accommodation even beyond those that are registered.  There is a complete and separate list of the unregistered lodging-house accommodation in all the areas where angling tourism is a feature and there are supplementary accommodation lists that have been published by Bord Fáilte and widely disseminated in the right kind of circles for Achill, Galway, Salthill, Kilkee, Lahinch, Ballybunion, Dingle, Killarney, West Cork, Arklow, Greystones, Skerries, Bundoran, Buncrana, Moville, and Tramore.  Lists for other places are in the course of preparation. That is in addition to the lists published particularly for the coarse angling and sea fishing districts.  They cover accommodation for 10,000 people.  No fewer than 947 private houses are listed and 132 houses are available for letting.  100,000 free copies are distributed and they include places where accommodation can be secured for as little as 12/6 for bed and breakfast and even in those cases there is a 50 per cent.  reduction for children.</P>
    <P>In order further to illustrate the extent to which Bord Fáilte is encouraging the improvement of B, C and guesthouse accommodation, I think the House should hear the figures.  The total grants or loans covering the improvement or construction of hotels has been £3,350,000 and of that sum £1,250,000 has been for accommodation other than A plus or A grade hotels.  The bedroom grants given so far total £527,000 of which £310,000 is for hotel accommodation of B class or lower.  That indicates that although there is a good deal in the newspapers about the great luxury hotels going up, all the time good work is being done by Board Fáilte to assist hotels of lower grade.  On such occasions as I have had the opportunity of speaking about the tourist industry, I <Col N="117" /> have made it clear that we need far more B and C guesthouse accommodation. There are whole stretches of magnificent coast where there is practically no accommodation. Deputies from Kerry will know there are very few guesthouses or hotels in places I know well, for example the great and wonderful beach stretching along the southern shore of the Dingle peninsula around Annascaul and that area.  There are many places of the same kind where accommodation in relation to the amenities is almost totally lacking.  I hope now that the tourist industry is showing continued signs of growth, there will be more applications for grants or loans for the simpler type of accommodation.  I have also told the Directors of the new C.I.E. hotel subsidiary that, in my view, they should now examine the whole question of how far they can provide B class accommodation in the areas where it is lacking and where they believe there is a tourist potential.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leneghan made some strange references to what he alleged to be the futility of the Bord Fáilte operations in Achill.  In Achill Bord Fáilte has been operating with particular success and the increase in the number of visitors last year as a result of the application of the June holiday plan to Achill has been very noticeable indeed.</P>
    <P>Having pointed out that Bord Fáilte are not only issuing supplementary accommodation lists but encouraging improvement and construction of hotels for people of the middle and lower income groups, I should say it is essential that our hotel standards should improve and that, whatever Bord Fáilte do, a minimum standard should be insisted upon in regard to what can be included in any classification by them in regard to comfort, food and hygiene.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of Deputies referred to different areas in which they are interested, and expressed the hope that Bord Fáilte would advertise their particular tourist area.  The answer to that is that if Deputies will look at the local publicity privately promoted, the Irish Tourist Association publicity and the many leaflets provided by Bord Fáilte, they will see that practically every tourist area is well covered and <Col N="118" /> in the case of Bord Fáilte in the general sense.  But there is a tremendous need for far more regional publicity organised by private interests.  Here again, may I repeat what has been stated by my predecessor and, I think, at the time of the Coalition Government, by every Minister in charge of tourism, that regional committees, associations and local hotels spend less money on developing tourism in their areas in proportion to the money spent by Bord Fáilte than any other country in Europe.  That perhaps could be understood in the earlier period of our tourist development, but the lack of regional publicity on a very big scale is becoming more and more noticeable.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to expect Bord Fáilte to go into every avenue, into every area.  It is for the local people to create their own image of what they have to offer to the people who come from abroad.  It is done all over Europe.  You can go into the smallest villages in Britain where I am perfectly certain the people as a whole have no more general income than people here and you will find that those villages form their associations: you will find leaflets abounding.  In hotels in other countries you will find a whole system of regional publicity worked out.  We have not yet even attempted to adopt the principle of the chain hotel system in which the collaboration between hotels throughout Europe makes possible the dissemination of tourist literature not only by individual hotels but by chains of hotels of the same class either around the whole country or in a particular area.  I should like to take the opportunity of congratulating the Chamber of Commerce in Galway for appointing a promotion officer for tourism in the area.  I hope that example will be followed elsewhere. Bord Fáilte are paying for part of the salary of this promotion officer.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies spoke of the necessity for providing amenities of various kinds, particularly in inland areas which will be of value to the tourist trade.  I should remind the House that the new local improvement grants are available to recognised associations from the Minister for Local Government and they apply to improvements <Col N="119" /> of the kind that would be of great value in the tourist industry, particularly in inland areas and in the areas where many people go to fish.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the effect of the present licensing laws on tourist resorts.  That does not come under this Estimate.  All I can say is that Bord Fáilte have made their point of view known to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the great potential of sea angling.  Bord Fáilte have been making a tremendous effort to develop sea angling.  There is still difficulty in obtaining a sufficient number of boats of the right kind and exactly at the moment when anglers want them.  There is also, unfortunately, a dearth of accommodation in some of the most magnificent areas for sea angling.  For example&mdash;I was reading one of the latest reports the other day&mdash;apparently, there is magnificent surf angling all around the west coast of Clare, underneath the burren limestone escarpments and there is surf angling in many other areas, but insufficient accommodation.  Bord Fáilte are naturally concentrating their interest on areas where accommodation and boats are available and the number of foreigners coming here and the number of our own people who come to take part in sea angling competitions is constantly increasing.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies, I think, to the growth in the number who come to play golf here.  Aer Lingus have arranged package tours for American golfers and I believe that in turn has begun to attract people to this country because of the very fine golf courses we have here and golf courses which are still relatively unencumbered compared with those in many parts of Great Britain and the United States.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave asked some questions about the comparative sea fares and rail fares on the Dublin-Cork route.  The only air fare that was changed was the return air excursion fare, which was increased from four guineas to five guineas.  I felt that as the flights from Dublin to Cork and <i>vice versa</i> were, in the main, positioning flights and had to be undertaken <Col N="120" /> anyway, to have cut-throat competition start between C.I.E. and the air service was anomalous in those circumstances. In reply to Deputy Cosgrave, I did definitely intervene in regard to the matter and on that ground.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully spoke about the necessity for encouraging interest in Irish games of every kind.  Bord Fáilte have published a calendar of events covering sports of every description and all the main events taking place in the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>Deputy Dolan spoke of the necessity for encouraging Irish entertainment in hotels.  I have spoken about that on a great many occasions. Speaking at chambers of commerce on occasions related to the development of tourism, I have constantly asked hotels to arrange for Irish singing and dancing.  I am glad to see that the practice is extending.  Equally, I hope that when they are doing it, the standard will be reasonably good.  There is no good in having people who are unable to sing well.  We have a great many pleasant singers in this country. The practice should extend because thousands of tourists come here and never hear any good Irish singing at all the whole time they are here.  There is no reason why we should not offer it to them because I know from people who have heard the Gael Linn cabaret that they are delighted and amazed by the variety of Irish songs.  In every way, we should develop that feature of our tourist activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon raised the question of the staff in a particular Irish Tourist Association office and other Deputies raised the question of whether we should not have another general amalgamation of the national tourist <Col N="121" /> organisation.  The answer to that is that there must be one association which reflects the interest taken by local authorities in tourism.  The Tourist Association is financed largely by local authorities and, in order to encourage local interest in tourism, to encourage regional publicity and to encourage representatives of local authorities in the belief that it pays to raise financial aid from the rates.  It is terribly important that the Tourist Association idea should be kept, at least, that there should be some organisation operating, spending the money of the ratepayers, aided by money granted by Bord Fáilte.  To have it wholly paid and wholly organised from the centre by Bord Fáilte would be inadvisable under present circumstances. I admit that all these kinds of things are arguable and I would ask Deputy Dillon if he could let me have privately particulars about the place where the official was not up to scratch and I will ask the Irish Tourist Association to investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>I have not had any complaints of poor service being given by those who work for the Irish Tourist Association. I have been in with some of them myself and have found them very pleasant, able to give a lot of information, and, when I asked as a matter of interest for very obscure information, I was told very politely that it simply was not within the ambit of their activities.  They said so politely, did not try to make a game of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMullen" hpid="Mr. Mullen Mr. Mullen">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>They do get grants from other organisations.  A number of questions were raised in regard to the provision of transport for cars. We increased the total space available for cars by 50 per cent. last year, and in one year, but I agree with Deputy Dillon that we still have a long way <Col N="122" /> to go to improve the conditions of travel.  We do hope for a proper car ferry service.  I am unable to say whether that will materialise in the near future or not but at least the proportion of space has gone up and it was very fully utilised, so that we are making some advance in that direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is that in Calais, Dover, for example, there are special embarking areas whereas in our case, in the congestion of Liverpool, for example, so far as I know, there is no possibility of making special spaces available or to create a special arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>And then, of course, the numbers of people crossing over at any one time between the English and French coasts are enormous.  But, as I have said, we hope all that will improve with time and every mortal effort possible is being made to persuade the various shipping companies and the railway company to improve the position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mullen made a number of interesting suggestions, with most of which I agree.  In connection with what he said in regard to, for example, providing in technical schools technical courses that aid the tourist industry, that is already being done and I hope it will be extended.  It would take me too long at this stage to comment on everything the Deputy had to say, except to say that I found his comment on the difference between French cooking and Irish cooking interesting because I agree that people should not attempt French <i>cuisine</i> unless they can really do it properly.  On the other hand, I think he was going too far when he said that French cooking was merely a camouflage of cooking when the materials are not good.</P>

      <P>Deputy P. O'Donnell referred to the self-drive car business and suggested there were some crooks engaged in the business.  I intend to ask Bord Fáilte what the present position is, how many complaints they have had and whether or not we should consider the registration of the self-drive car hire people.  The best firms belong to an association where there are certain standards, including standards in respect of insurance.  I know the association do their best to maintain high standards in this industry as a whole.  I think the suggestions made by Deputy O'Donnell should be taken up by Bord Fáilte and I will ask them to investigate it.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell also suggested we should make social contacts with particular English towns.  I think I have already indicated in connection with coarse angling that a number of development associations have formed friendly relations with angling associations in particular towns and concentrated upon them.  The Deputy suggested that the famous rainbow trout in a lake in Donegal was not anywhere mentioned in Bord Fáilte publicity.  I think that the <i>Angling Guide</i> is almost certain to include the full particulars of the famous rainbow trout, but I may be wrong.  However, I should like Deputy O'Donnell to make quite sure before he makes that criticism.  I read the <i>Angling Guide</i> in considerable detail myself and found that it did mention all the special features in regard to fishing, and I can hardly believe it omitted the lake where, as Deputy O'Donnell says, rainbow trout live without the need for restocking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Timmons asked a question about what happens when an hotel, <Col N="124" /> built with the aid of Bord Fáilte grants, is sold at a much higher price, at a speculative profit.  My information is that, in connection with the grants and assistance offered by Bord Fáilte, the hotel undertakes to maintain itself on the register for a minimum period.  I presume that in the case of anybody who purchased the hotel that obligation would continue. Of course, there is no way in which Bord Fáilte could prevent the sale of an hotel in the ordinary way, but they do try to ensure that the building itself will be maintained as a registered hotel for a minimum period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmons also suggested that Bord Fáilte might take part in the financial arrangements for the access to an island near Dublin.  Bord Fáilte have already made arrangements for the major resort development of the country.  They have cast their net fairly wide.  They have provided or offered assistance in a number of areas scattered all round the country.  I think they tend to concentrate on areas away from Dublin as being of major importance from the tourist point of view.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about measures to lengthen the tourist season. A great deal is being done in regard to that already through encouraging angling, shooting, hunting, and so forth.  Also the June Holiday Plan appears to be succeeding very well.  We shall have to consider, however, the very important matter of how far holidays can be staggered here in order that the tourist accommodation for Irish people and for visitors here can be increased over the whole period from April to October.  That is a matter which is engaging my attention, particularly at the moment.  There are many difficulties in connection with it. People are extremely conservative in their attitude towards holiday periods, but seeing the progress we have made in so many other aspects of tourism I can hardly believe we will not get co-operation from everyone concerned to extend as far as possible the holiday period, in particular co-operation from employer and trade union organisation. If we can do that we shall release a great deal of accommodation at the <Col N="125" /> critical periods, all of which will result in a total increase of tourist income from abroad.</P>

The whole of that question is under consideration at present. What the outcome will be, it is impossible for me to say now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with practically every point made by Deputies.  Again, I thank Deputies for their constructive criticism.  Anything I have not spoken of in my reply will be examined in the Department so that we can make quite sure that all the advice offered by Deputies will be studied to see whether or not we can do anything to forward the tourist industry.  I should like again to appeal to Deputies finally to encourage local initiative, which has already been so successful in the fishing areas, and to encourage more regional publicity in every area.  Whatever Bord Fáilte is <Col N="126" /> able to provide in the way of monetary assistance, in turn derived from a Vote of the House, it will never be sufficient unless there is more regional effort made in every part of the country.</P>

      <P>As I see it, the procedure will be that applicant will make his applicaation and, having been succesful, there will have to be an interval, during which he may, in consultation with his solicitor and counsel, prepare his defence.  As the section stands, he will then have to come before the same judge.  In Dublin, there might be difficulty in arranging that and it could lead to a carving up of the list.  The procedure the courts would tend to adopt, if allowed to do so under the Act, would be to arrange special days for the hearing of legal aid applications, and then list the cases in the normal way.  That is done commonly in Dublin in relation to types of cases that come up fairly regularly.  Special days are set aside for certain applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, it is, I think, highly desirable that the application for legal aid should be kept separate as far as possible from the actual trial.  That, I suggest, can be achieved by my amendment, which will tend to separate the application for legal aid from the trial.  The two are in character completely separate, one being an administrative <Col N="128" /> act and the other a judicial proceeding.  The objection may be made that the amendment is somewhat wide and could have the effect that an application for legal aid could be made in Cork in respect of a case to be heard in Donegal.  If the Minister considers that is a valid objection, I suggest he has an easy way out of the difficulty and, if he accepts the principle, I shall be quite satisfied.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley had similar amendments on an earlier section.  I thought the amendment might have been directed to the drafting of the Bill, but I now see the force of the argument the Deputy has advanced.  At first sight, I would certainly be prepared to recommend to the Minister that he should give it very careful consideration.  As far as the courts in Dublin are concerned, the situation may arise quite frequently in which a number of different judges or justices, as the case may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section refers to the appeal certificate, but I am relating my remarks to the earlier amendment which was, in fact, not moved but which the Minister indicated he would consider.  There was mention of the matter then in an offhand way from a drafting point of view.  There is force in the argument put forward by Deputy Colley, particularly with regard to the district court in Dublin.  There you have a number of district justices attached to the Dublin Metropolitan District.  The same argument would apply to some extent to the Dublin circuit court where you have a number of different judges attached to the circuit court for the county and city of Dublin.  It might very well be more convenient if the Minister were to leave the door open so that an application for a free legal aid certificate, either in the first instance or on appeal, could be made to a judge or justice, as the case may be, of the particular court.  From the Bill, as drafted, it does appear that a person seeking a free legal aid certificate will be compelled to go before the particular <Col N="129" /> judge or justice before whom he was tried.</P>
      <P>I confess I did not appreciate the force of Deputy Colley's amendment until I heard him speak to it tonight. For that reason, I have not reasoned it out fully for myself, but, on the face of it, it does appear to me that on occasion, at any rate, there may be very valid reasons why it should be open to a person seeking a free legal aid certificate to go before a judge or a justice other than the judge or justice before whom he is to be tried.  I urge the Minister to give very careful consideration to the point of view put forward by Deputy Colley.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are, I think, talking rather loosely here as between Sections 3 and 4.  No matter to which section we relate this amendment, it is applicable, I think, only to the judge of the court before whom the person is to be tried.  It refers to a person returned for trial and is, therefore, exclusively related to the circuit or central criminal court.  In the case of the circuit court, of course, I think it could only have relevance in the case of Dublin because it is only in Dublin that we have two circuit court judges. Apart from that narrow application of Deputy Colley's proposal, I think it is undesirable in principle.  Certainly, I do not mind having another look at it and giving it some further consideration, but it seems to me fairly obvious that the right person to decide on whether or not a legal aid certificate should be given is the judge who will be trying the case.  Do not forget that under Section 3, and right through the Bill in the various sections, we place an onus on the judge, in deciding whether or not to grant the certificate, to have regard to all the circumstances of the case.</P>

      <P>If any.  But surely it would be nonsensical to suggest that one judge, as Deputy Colley seems to indicate would be desirable, should have the duty of deciding the legal aid certificate issue and have to go into all the circumstances and then another <Col N="130" /> judge would actually try the case.  We have some knowledge of how this system operates in the North of Ireland and there it is exclusively the trial judge who decides whether or not the certificate be granted and the system operates very well there.  I think that is the right way to do it. It seems to me to be the only way to do it, but I do not mind having another look at it and seeing whether or not we could assist the mechanical administration of the scheme by enabling other judges in certain circumstances to grant legal aid certificates, even though they were not trying the case.  Frankly, I cannot see that any advantage would be gained from that.  It is far more desirable that the trial judge, taking all the circumstances of the case into account, should decide whether or not to grant the certificate.</P>

      <P>If I might be permitted to explain, the reason I was not here to move the amendment on Section 3 was that I was attending a meeting of one of the Committees of this House.  Since the Minister referred to Section 3, might I point out that the reason there is no amendment down relating to the district court is that it seems to me that as the Bill is drafted, the Minister has accepted the principle involved here in the case of the district justice because Section 3 (b) states that where a certificate, etc., is:</P>

      <P>I just want to say that I do not accept the principle that it is desirable to separate the granting of the legal aid certificate from the conduct of the trial.  Deputy Colley has not advanced any argument in favour of that and I do not think there is any argument in favour of it.  We cannot be wasting the time of the judges and have one judge, who is not trying the case, going into all the circumstances in order to decide whether a legal aid certificate should be granted, and then have a completely different judge deciding the case.  That would lead to an administrative muddle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put this point of view before the Minister.  There are circumstances in which it would be desirable, certainly from the point of view of the applicant, and if we regard it from the point of view of the applicant within the spirit of the Bill, we are talking about a case where it is regarded as being essential in the interests of justice, that a free legal aid certificate should be given.  It seems to me that you may have cases&mdash; I am not trying to go in by a back door and have a discussion on Section 3&mdash;<Col N="132" /> where it does become necessary for the judge to have regard to the particular defence which has been made.</P>
      <P>It may be that one judge will make up his mind that having regard to a particular type of defence which has been put up, there is no merit in that and that he will not give a free legal aid certificate.  Another judge may take a different view and feel it is only in an omnibus sense that he is required to have regard to the defence which is disclosed and that the major consideration in his mind is to be (a) the means of the applicant and (b) the seriousness of the charge which is being tried, and that, basing his decision on those grounds, irrespective of the nature of the defence, a free legal aid certificate should be given.  It is quite conceivable that two different judges will have different approaches to those questions and there would be some merit anyhow, if it is not made a general rule.  I appreciate the Minister's point of view with regard to taking up the time of the court but it seems to me that there may be occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>This amendment is put down to meet a point by Deputy O'Higgins.  Indeed, he has put down a similar amendment, amendment No. 18.  The purpose of my amendment and of Deputy O'Higgins's amendment is to ensure that the application for legal aid in the Appeal Court may be made by the applicant's legal representative.  It was always our intention that the application need not be made by the accused himself but by his legal representative on his behalf.  The reference in the section as it stands is &ldquo;(b) in person to that court.&rdquo;  In case that might lead to any misapprehension, my amendment proposes to alter that to read &ldquo;( ) to the court itself,&rdquo;.  I think that will make it clear that the application need not be made in person but can be made by the legal representative of the accused on his behalf.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has brought in this amendment to meet the point raised by me in connection with this matter on the Second Reading.  I do not want to be churlish about it but I am not entirely sure the Minister has met the point.  Section 4 (3), if we incorporate into it the Minister's amendment, then reads</P>
      <P>Where a person is, on being convicted of an offence, refused a legal aid (appeal) certificate, he may apply</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is, the person who has been convicted&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>for the certificate to the court to which an appeal from the conviction lies either&mdash;</P>
      <P>by letter addressed to the registrar of that court setting out the facts of the case and the grounds of the application,</P>
      <P>&mdash;there again, it is the person who is convicted who may apply by letter addressed to the registrar&mdash;or, coming to (b) and reading into it the Minister's amendment,</P>
      <P>to the court itself.</P>

      <Col N="135" /> It is certainly open to the construction that the Minister's amendment is not making any difference and that it still must be an application by the person himself.  We have not come to it yet but the next amendment, amendment No. 18, in my name, is put down to try to meet the same point.</P>
    <P>With all due diffidence and modesty, I suggest that if the Minister accepts my amendment, rather than his own, the position becomes crystal clear. My amendment seeks to add a subparagraph saying that the application may be made by the solicitor or counsel for the applicant.  Then you would have the position that it could be made by a letter addressed to the registrar or by the applicant himself in court or by the applicant's solicitor or counsel.  Then there would not be any room whatever for doubt.  It could be met in any of these three ways.  It may well be that the Minister's advice is correct that his amendment meets the point.  I think it is open to doubt. I should be glad if the Minister would look at it again.</P>

I am assured that this achieves what we want to achieve and, at the same time, preserves the consistent phraseology throughout.  I think Deputy O'Higgins is overlooking the point that a solicitor in court may represent anybody or that anything an individual is permitted to do in court can be done for him by a solicitor.  That is the normal practice and procedure of the courts.  By removing the words &ldquo;(b) in person to that court&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;( ) to the court itself,&rdquo; I think we are achieving exactly what we want to achieve.</P>

      <P>As often as not, the phrase used is &ldquo;a person may cause application to be made&rdquo;.  If the Minister looks up, for example, the Circuit Court rules in relation to Malicious Injury applications he will see that is the type of phrase used. The notice of application, for example, <Col N="137" /> must be signed by the applicant or by his solicitor.  The applicant must cause notice to be given to the local authority, the Gardaí, and so on.  The expression used is that the applicant causes it to be done.  That leaves it open to being done on his behalf by his representative.  However, if the Minister feels there is any real difficulty there&mdash;and I do not agree with him that there is&mdash;I think it can be removed equally simply by inserting a short sentence into this Bill to say it does not prejudice any earlier Act.</P>
      <P>Certainly if the Minister accepts my suggestion, he is making the position crystal clear.  It seems to me that, while he is aiming at doing the right thing he still leaves it open to doubt. I do not think it can be said too often in this House that what we do here is open to construction and interpretation by the courts which must have regard to what is written into the Act, not to anything the Minister or anyone else may say in explanation of the measure as it passes through the House.  The courts may not have any regard to any remarks the Minister may make or any explanations issued by means of a White Paper.</P>

      <P>I have, in fact, made my point of view clear with regard to amendment No. 18.  I do not know quite what the position is but having accepted the Minister's amendment No. 17, there is not much point in amendment No. 18 going into the Bill even if the Minister accepted <Col N="138" /> it.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down two amendments, one to Section 3 and the other to Section 4.  I can understand the Minister's reluctance to accept my amendment to Section 3 because of the large number of cases it might involve.  I asked him the number of convictions in certain years and the reply was that in 1960-61 the number was 99,508.  I take it there were as many more cases before the courts where there were no convictions and I can well see the Minister would not be anxious to involve the House in providing free legal aid for over 200,000 cases.</P>
      <P>However, in Section 4 I cannot see why the Minister cannot accept my amendment which affects only persons who have been convicted and who might require legal aid on appeal. It is a very serious matter to be convicted of an offence. In Section 3 my amendment referred to any person appearing in court which might include people involved only trivially.  In Section 4, however, I am dealing with people who have been convicted.  It is then that the thing becomes a serious matter and I am asking that the question of the seriousness of the offences should not be left in the hands of judges or justices&mdash;that they should not be given the power of deciding whether or not free legal aid should be granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="140" /> I am putting it to the Minister that any conviction is a very serious matter, that it is not a question for interpretation by the Bench.  A person convicted is a criminal and has a stigma for all time.  He is likely to lose, among other things, his employment and reputation.  What I am asking in this section is that he is afforded the means, if he applies, of getting legal aid and that it should not rest with the judge or justice to decide whether the matter is serious or not.</P>
    <P>In the cases where a number of people are charged together, there is great danger that incrimination might result for one of the group who might be innocent.  One of these persons might be convicted in the first instance when he had not recourse to legal aid.  He may have been at a disadvantage in that respect and legal aid on appeal might result in his being declared innocent.  Take the case of a number of children.  They see a purse on the strand and one of them pinches it.  They are all charged but surely only one of them is guilty? They are tried together and, without solicitor or counsel to cross examine, all they can do is stand there with their mouths open.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that whatever excuse the Minister might have for not providing free legal aid in respect of a person being accused in the first instance, once that person is convicted it becomes a serious matter and he should have the right of free legal aid on appeal.  Imagine a person not having legal aid in the first instance and being convicted and then appealing and not having free legal aid on the appeal.  The conviction is bound to be affirmed.</P>
    <P>In 1960/61 the number of convictions in the Circuit Court was only 143 and the number of convictions in the Central Criminal Court was only 19. People who are convicted in those courts are convicted of more serious offences than in the district court.  The evidence shows that a large number of persons are convicted in the first instance and the sentence is reaffirmed on appeal and in neither case have they legal aid.  There is bound to be a miscarriage of justice.  I am no <Col N="141" /> expert but I am interested in legal matters and I have read a lot of books on briefs to counsel and on Marshall Hall and all that kind of thing and it is laid down in these books that a great proportion of the cases that go to court can be either won or lost.</P>
    <P>There are some cases that are certain to fail and there are some that must be won largely depending on the ability of the solicitor and counsel in those cases. If you accept that there are cases that can be won or lost, then it is sticking out a mile that if a person has no legal aid he is going to lose his case.  In all cases of appeal a person should be given legal aid where he has not had it in the first instance.  I am satisfied that there are many cases of miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>I will prove my point.  I was summoned for having a radio without a licence.  I had no licence but, nevertheless, I had a little savvy which the other people in the court did not have. They were all fined 10s. or £1 but I was not fined because I could defend myself.  I asked the prosecution witness did he see the aerial.  He had to answer that he had not because he had never gone out into the yard to see it. I also asked did he make sure that what he thought was a radio was not an empty cabinet and he had to say that he did not.  I asked him did he see any mechanism connected to the wooden box and he said he did not and the justice said the case was out. All the other people were fined 10s. or £1 and I was as guilty as they were but I was not fined.</P>
    <P>I am quoting that to prove my point that legal aid is essential.  If I had not been able to speak for myself I would have been convicted.  I am putting it to the Minister that if he cannot give free legal aid in the first instance he must at least give it in cases of appeal.  It would be a grave miscarriage of justice to have people convicted and these convictions upheld on appeal if they have not got legal assistance.  The average person is overawed by the court and is at the mercy of the State Solicitor or the Garda both of whom know the ropes very well.  I will again ask the Minister to give free aid in the case of appeal.</P>

      <P>There is one matter worrying me about this section and it is linked up with Section 2. Subsection (b) of Section 2 says that legal aid may be granted if it appears necessary to the district court by reason of the gravity of the charge. The expression&mdash;&ldquo;gravity of the charge&rdquo;&mdash;is what worries me and that applies also to the appeal.</P>

      <P>I know we have but it also applies under Section 4.  I would rather see the Minister confine the cases in which free legal aid may be granted to cases where there is a fixed penalty or a possible fixed penalty.  I know that district justices take different views of the gravity of the offence.  I know one district justice who, in a case of drunk and disorderly, will impose a fine of £2 but, immediately the prosecution witness says &ldquo;he used a particular offensive word,&rdquo; it is two months hard labour right off the reel.  I am speaking from experience.  Who is to decide the gravity of the offence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>You generally appeal against the sentence admitting the facts.  Everybody knows it is a matter of going before the circuit court, pleading guilty, admitting the facts and stating the circumstances.  The circuit judge immediately reverses the penalty and imposes a fine of £1, £2 or £3.  It depends entirely on the outlook of the justice as to what is the gravity of the offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that when the last Intoxicating Liquor Act became law, justices were clamping on fines of £25 right off the reel.  They have dwindled away to £3 now and we are back to the old system.  Two or three convictions under that Act could be very serious for an individual.  I think we should not leave it to their discretion even on appeal.  We should have something more concrete than the decision of a justice as to the gravity of an offence.  I know certain <Col N="143" /> parts of the country where an offence under the Road Transport Act can be very serious.  Take County Sligo where Deputy Gilbride comes from.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. P. O'Donnell Mr. P. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Road Transport Act, even a first offence related to carriage of goods for reward automatically carries a fine of £25. The case may be in the balance but one justice may decide to convict, and the fine is £25.  We now know what happens under the Road Traffic Act. Far be it from me to criticise our juries, but I said in this House that once we made death resulting from an accident so serious an offence that it had to go before a judge and jury, we would get very few convictions.  To my own knowledge, there have been at least six such trials, and I was personally involved in one, but there was not a solitary conviction.  Not only is the charge of causing death to the unfortunate person who has been killed left to the jury, but it is also left to the jury to decide whether the defendant or the accused was driving in a dangerous manner.  Juries, afraid of the consequences when death may have been caused purely accidentally, will not convict a defendant even of careless driving.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is a step in the right direction, but we should not start off on the wrong foot.  I do not think we should leave it to justices to decide what offence is sufficiently serious for legal aid to be granted. Justices differ.</P>

      <P>Usually, if they do, they do it out of malice, but a drunken man is liable to use language which he would not normally use and you will find justices who will impose a jail sentence for what I really can describe as an offence arising out of intoxication, and with no malice aforethought.  It would be very wrong indeed to classify that as a grievous offence.  There may be so many such cases that the Bill will not be the success we would all like it to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know certain districts where appeals are granted very often indeed.  We might defeat the purposes of the Bill and I would prefer to see legal aid granted where the penalty for a grievous offence was a serious one.  A charge which appeared to be a grievous one might fizzle out under the Probation Act when the defence was unravelled.  For legal aid purposes, if there were a minimum penalty of £40, or if the conviction carried a jail sentence, we would be doing much more for the unfortunate defendant than we are doing at present.</P>
      <P>I have had considerable experience of free legal aid across the water and at the moment we are not going anywhere near it.  I do not suggest to the Minister that we could afford to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have free legal aid, in civil actions and in criminal actions.  It is not a trial judge&mdash;this has probably been argued or pointed out here earlier&mdash;who decides whether the defendant is entitled to free legal aid or otherwise.  A committee of the Law <Col N="145" /> Society first inquire into the means of the defendant or the plaintiff, as the case may be.  They inquire <i>prima facie</i> into his right of action before they decide, but here we are throwing onto the trial judge a sort of pre-trial judicial function to decide whether there is sufficient evidence, and whether the charge is serious enough, without hearing the defence or, as Deputy McGilligan points out, the defendant having disclosed his evidence at a certain stage.</P>
    <P>What worries me about Section 4 is that you cannot construe it without first having construed Section 2, which sets out that the gravity of the offence is left to the district justice to decide <i>inter alia</i>, and whether you are entitled to legal aid to appeal from his own decision.  Again, to look at it from a different angle, an offence may appear to be serious but when the defence is unravelled the district justice may apply a nominal penalty, but that nominal penalty on a particular defendant may carry as great a stigma as a conviction and jail sentence for habitual drunkenness may carry for another person.  It depends on the outlook of the defendant.</P>
    <P>For example, a gentleman who is a very careful driver would not like to have recorded against him a conviction for dangerous driving, irrespective of whether it carried a penalty of 1/- or a jail sentence.  That might be very serious to him, whereas to an old lag 14 days' hard labour means nothing.  It means going back to renew old acquaintances&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 4, as amended, there are two matters to which I want to refer.  The first is the use of the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo;.  I put down an amendment to this section but it was ruled out of order.  That amendment provided for the use of the word &ldquo;advisable&rdquo;.  I am not terribly <Col N="146" /> enamoured of the word &ldquo;advisable&rdquo; but I have the gravest misgivings about the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; in this context. The section provides that legal aid will be granted only if it is considered by the court to be &ldquo;essential&rdquo; in the interests of justice.  I suggest that word will have to be interpreted by the court and that, on strict and perhaps correct, interpretation, it would mean that you could never really decide that legal aid was essential to a case until the case was finished. You could only guess beforehand and it is obvious that the interpretation of the word will vary from one judge or justice to another.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it seems to me that if we try to cover cases where it is essential in the interests of justice that legal aid be given, then we are trying to cover cases in which we are saying: in the past, there has been a miscarriage of justice in each of these cases because in the interests of justice, it was essential to have free legal aid but there was no free legal aid.  It seems to me that to interpret the matter that way, as you must on the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo;, you may upset the whole basis of the Bill.  You may end up by having, on the one hand, judges or justices interpreting it so strongly that no one coming before them will get any free legal aid and on the other hand, because of the impossibility of interpreting this word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; accurately, you may have judges or justices more or less glossing over the word and treating it as something that gives them considerable latitude.</P>
      <P>To me, it seems it would be much better if the Minister could substitute another word for &ldquo;essential&rdquo; that would convey the idea of advisable, although it may be that the word &ldquo;advisable&rdquo; is not the best one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which I shall refer is in connection with subsection 3 (a) where the procedure is laid down that application for free legal aid may be made by letter addressed to the registrar of the court.  I do not know what the Minister can do about this in the regulations but I am anxious that he should see as far as possible that this does not degenerate into a question of letters to the registrar being dealt <Col N="147" /> with by the registrar and rubber-stamped by the judge or justice.  So far as the Minister can do anything about that, I urge him to see that does not happen.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of procedure on which I am not very clear.  Where a person applies by a letter to the registrar, say, in the case of the Court of Criminal Appeal, where you have three judges, what is to happen in considering this?  Are the judges to sit together to consider the application through the registrar or, are they to sit in public or in private?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would refrain from -contradicting me and let us concentrate on the matter, we might make a little more progress. If a judge decides it is essential in the interests of justice that free legal aid should be given, surely that can only mean that the judge will consider the matter and say: &ldquo;Unless this man is given free legal aid, he must be convicted.&rdquo;  Surely that is the only possible interpretation: the man is already convicted unless he gets free legal aid?  That is a ludicrous situation to envisage in a Bill such as this. <Col N="148" /> We have already said that a man is convicted if he does not get legal aid but I do not believe that is what we mean or what is intended.  What we should be trying to do is to ensure, so far as possible, that wherever the judge feels there is reasonable doubt as to whether an acquittal will result, unless there is free legal aid, he must then give a certificate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LionelBooth" hpid="Mr. Booth Mr. Booth">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Booth</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are putting the trial judge in the position of prejudging the whole issue.  What we should really be trying to do is to enable him to say: on &ldquo;<i>prima facie</i> perusal of the case as it appears before me, it seems to be advisable, by reason of the complexity or seriousness of the offence, that this man should have free legal aid.&rdquo;  But to say it is &ldquo;essential&rdquo; would, I think, put the judge in the position as outlined by Deputy Colley where a very strict legalistic approach would almost certainly lead to the refusal of a certificate, while a more humane approach would force the judge to interpret &ldquo;essential&rdquo; as advisable.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to consider the matter between now and the Report Stage because there is a very fine issue of principle here.  I do not want this business to get so much out of control financially that it would collapse.  I do not really believe it will lead to a great increase, if in fact there is any increase, in costs, but it will give a greater uniformity in the decisions which will be given.</P>

      <P>I do not want to delay on this but I should like to join with Deputies Colley and Booth on this point and ask the Minister to consider it further.  It seems to me that if the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; is used we are putting the judge or justice in the position in which he must say: &ldquo;Justice will not be done unless free legal aid is granted&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Sherwin made some comments on this section with which I should like to deal. First, I should like to point out to him the large number of cases that are dealt with in the district courts and he agrees with me, I think, that we could not possibly contemplate giving free legal aid in all these cases because Deputy Sherwin must realise that if we were prepared to give free legal aid in every case where there was an appeal, then every case would be appealed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>You must take that chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a decision I am not prepared to take at this stage.  It is as important to retain limiting words such as: &ldquo;by reason of the serious nature of the offence...&rdquo; in appeal cases as in the original trial. Even the case Deputy Sherwin quoted, that of five parties being involved in one theft, could be regarded as coming within the ambit of the section. The justice in this case could regard that as being of a serious nature or take the view that there were exceptional circumstances.  Even in that case it is quite feasible the district justice would allow free legal aid on appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to point out to Deputy O'Donnell and others that in this Bill we are at least giving free legal aid on appeal from summary courts which is <Col N="150" /> not the case at all in the North of Ireland; indeed it was not the case in Britain for a very long time.  When the scheme was introduced in Britain, legal aid was not given on appeal, nor is it given in Northern Ireland as the scheme operates there now.  Therefore, we are at least going that stage ahead.  Until we see how the scheme works, it is essential to keep these limiting factors in respect of the appeal&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly essential; it may be advisable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential from the point of view of the public finances. If we keep on discussing this &ldquo;essential&rdquo; and &ldquo;advisable&rdquo;<i>ad nauseam</i>, then free legal aid for everybody will be delayed to a very considerable extent.  Deputy Colley wants some word which means &ldquo;advisable&rdquo; but is not &ldquo;advisable&rdquo;.  I have already indicated that the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; here is inserted deliberately and that, in my opinion, it is necessary at this stage.  I agree that it would be a far finer thing if we could give free legal aid in every case or in every case where it was not essential but merely advisable, but I have already said that the resources at our disposal for social schemes of this nature are limited.  We think the right thing to do at this stage is to give free legal aid only in cases where it is essential.  Later on, if we find our experience of the scheme indicates it is possible to do so, we can consider being a little more generous or extending the scheme.</P>
      <P>It is no good attacking me here on this point.  As Deputy O'Donnell has said, this is a step forward.  There was nothing there before and just because it is not everything that everybody wants, it is unreasonable for Deputies to launch this attack on the scheme.  I have been absolutely open and frank with the House.  I have told Deputies several times already that this is a limited scheme and I have explained the reasons why it is limited.  Surely Deputies can accept that and let us go on from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Booth and Deputy Colley seemed to be worried about the fact that different interpretations would be placed on the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo;.  That <Col N="151" /> may be, but surely if that is a defect, that defect applies to every Act of Parliament we bring in here.  Every Act of Parliament is liable to be judicially interpreted and if we were to regard that as a defect, we would not pass any Acts of Parliament at all.  It seems to me that &ldquo;essential&rdquo; has at least this advantage: it is clear-cut; it means one thing and nothing else, whereas &ldquo;advisable&rdquo; is subject to a whole range of interpretations and would certainly be capable of meaning different things to different people.</P>
    <P>However, I am not worried if district justices or circuit court judges, for that matter, interpret this thing differently. One district justice may be more liberal than another.  That is inevitable in any scheme of this sort, but, in answer to Deputy O'Donnell, the right people to interpret this are the judges. Most Deputies would agree with me that flexibility is desirable.  It has been said here several times in this debate that what is a serious charge for one man may be a comparatively light charge to another.  It would take a very peculiar set of circumstances for a charge to be a serious one for habitual criminals, whereas to be charged with a comparatively minor offence would be a very serious matter for a person who was never in trouble before.  It is essential that we leave the matter to the good sense of the justices and judges and I feel confident that they will see what we are trying to do in this scheme and interpret it intelligently.  If we cannot count on that, then we can throw our hats at the whole judicial process.</P>
    <P>As regards the question raised by Deputy Colley whether the Court of Criminal Appeal will be three or will sit in camera or otherwise, I can only say it is not for me to settle the procedure of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I am quite certain they will settle their own practice and procedure in their own way and it is not at all necessary for the Bill or for me to indicate in what way they should conduct their courts.  With regard to the question of the letter addressed to the registrar, I can only ask: to whom else should it be addressed?  Is he not <Col N="152" /> the appropriate officer of the court to receive all these communications?  I could not possibly undertake to supervise the working of the courts to the extent of seeing to it that the registrar passes on all correspondence in the proper way to the judge or justice.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Sherwin&mdash;I know he has a very honest approach to this Bill&mdash;may I say we are doing the best we can at this stage?  We visualise that this scheme will work for a certain period and at the end of the period, we shall review it.  We shall see what it is costing and whether the money devoted to it could possibly be more appropriately diverted to other purposes or whether more money could be diverted to this scheme.  Let Deputies not forget that any money voted from the Exchequer to this piece of social reform has alternative uses.  It could possibly be given to increase old age pensions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy <Col N="153" /> Ryan gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 83 on the Order Paper of 1st March on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As you are aware, this matter refers to the action of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which will result in a certain amount of what I believe is unnecessary, undesirable and stupid interference with the existing reception from UTV and BBC in the Dublin area and westward and south of Dublin.  It is my contention that either serious mistakes or deliberate policy is the only explanation for the proposed interference with the reception of both UTV and BBC programmes now available for owners of TV sets in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in a subsequent statement which he made public, was rather scathing about the quality of the reception available from UTV and BBC.  Admittedly, it is not as good as we can now fortunately get from Telefís Éireann but it is good enough for the people, is acceptable, and what they want.  I do not believe the Department should allow anything or deliberately cause anything to interfere with the reception already available and which was satisfactory enough to encourage over 100,000 people to invest their hard-earned savings in sets over the past four or five years.</P>
      <P>That the Department are quite capable of making mistakes is clearly shown by the fact that they chose Channel A for the Gort station, although the Department had already signed away the use of Channel A under international agreement.  The excuse now being offered that they are changing from Channel A to Channel B in order to reduce interference with the BBC is merely camouflage, and the Minister knows that well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is sincere&mdash;and I believe him to be a sincere individual, whatever about the Government's intentions or declarations&mdash;he can prevent the degree of interference which he says is inevitable.  I am advised that technically there is no reason whatever why the allocation which I will read in a few moments could not <Col N="154" /> be made and which would result in little or no interference with the reception now available on UTV and BBC channels.  The result would be that a large number of people could continue to enjoy the reception which has been available to them for several years from these two quarters.</P>
    <P>If the Minister refuses to adopt the solution which I understand has been put to his Department and to him and which I am now deliberately putting on the records of this House, he personally will be to blame and his Party and Government can accept all the responsibility they deserve for denying to Telefís Éireann the goodwill they have every right to expect because the blame for all this will fall back on Telefís Éireann whereas, in fact, it lies entirely upon the Minister because he is the person who allocates the channels.</P>
    <P>The solution which could now be implemented is to swop the channels allocated to Dublin and Sligo with each other and to swop the channels which it is proposed to allocate to Mount Leinster and Cork with each other.  If that were done it would remove several of the excuses the Minister gave in his public statement.  The result of all that would be as follows: Dublin or Kippure would be on Channel 11 for the 405 line and Channel 1 for the 625 line which at the moment it is proposed to give to Sligo, and Sligo would be on Channel 7 for the 405 line and Channel H for the 625 line.</P>
    <P>I am advised that the number of people who might be at any loss by that being done would be about 1,000 out of over 100,000 people who have sets, and even those people could have their sets adapted from Channel 7 to Channel 11 for about £3 a set.  It seems to me the height of folly not to do this now before more people invest money in sets that carry Channel 7 only or before our manufacturers manufacture sets that carry Channel 7 only.  Galway would remain unchanged, that is to say, if the Minister has Channel B for Galway; but Kilkenny, instead of Cork, would have Channel D and Cork would have <Col N="155" /> Channel F instead of its being given to Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>All this is technically possible and now is the time to do it before further public or private money is wasted and which will certainly result in interference with the reception now available.</P>
    <P>The Minister advanced as an excuse for not transferring the Cork Channel 6 or Channel D to Kilkenny that it would be too near Channel 7 or Channel H in Dublin and that therefore there would be a certain amount of interference for people in the southern midlands but, under the solution I have offered the Minister, if Channel 9 F were moved to Cork and 6 D to Mount Leinster there would be a difference of five channels between Mount Leinster and Dublin; there would be a difference of three channels between Belfast and Mount Leinster and Channel 9 would be further away from Belfast than ever before, meaning that there would be practically no interference whatsoever with UTV in Dublin and, as UTV cannot reach the southern area at present it would not affect people in the Cork area, and they would not lose anything at all.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Channel 11 transmitter, which is to go into Sligo, is now in the country&mdash;I may be wrong &mdash;but certainly it is not yet erected and it would be perfectly possible to erect this transmitter on Kippure without interference with the service but, certainly, even if there were to be a short interval in transmission from Telefís Éireann it would be better to do that now than to deny to the people who have enjoyed a choice of two programmes for several years past&mdash;three programmes since 1st January&mdash;what they invested their hard-earned money to get.</P>
    <P>I have no personal axe to grind in this matter.  I do not watch television. I watch the Government and that is a full-time job.  It leaves me little time for the relaxation which many people enjoy and to which they are entitled. What I am particularly concerned about is the tens of thousands of people in Dublin and north of Dublin and across the midlands over to the north <Col N="156" /> west who have invested large sums of money in television sets over the last four or five years.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister admitted that the interference would become greater as one moved west and south of the City of Dublin.  I have the privilege of representing the people of Dublin South-West constituency and they are in the main hard working people and most of them acquired their sets on the hire purchase system. They have expended anything from £80 to £100 over the last few years or are committed to pay that amount over the next few years.  These people at present enjoy a choice of three television programmes.  It is no reflection on Telefís Éireann to say that they might want to look at some of the programmes to which they have become attuned over the last few years.  One can quote the words, as the Minister did, of the head of Telefís Éireann, Mr. Eamonn Andrews, that &ldquo;the worst thing that could happen to Irish Television is to have no opposition anywhere.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that the matter was not a serious one because reception of these stations was available only in the north and east.  That may be so, geographically speaking, but numerically speaking, there is a far greater density of population and a much greater concentration of television sets in the north and east because it covers all Dublin city and county which has&mdash;it is unfortunate, but it has&mdash;about one-third of the population of the State.  Then, if you move north, you have Dundalk, Drogheda, Counties Monaghan, Sligo, Donegal and the Midlands.  I have not had an opportunity of adding up the number of sets in that area but that is where the main concentration is by reason of the fact that the people have enjoyed a choice of two programmes over the past four or five years and a third programme since the beginning of this year.  These are the people who will be the main sufferers. If there is a reasonable alternative available, which could be implemented now at less cost and with the least inconvenience, then now is the time to do it.</P>
    <P>Telefís Éireann would never have <Col N="157" /> been possible, were it not for the fact that these people, who are now to be deprived of a choice of three programmes, had invested their money in television sets.  I do not know what the total cost of the investment is but it runs into millions of pounds.  If these people had not got sets on 1st January, the Minister had no hope of collecting £4 television licences from about 100,000 owners of sets in the State and Telefís Éireann would never have come about.  It seems to be extremely shabby practice to say to these people that the investment they made is now to be destroyed and they are to be deprived of something they had every right to expect.</P>
    <P>I wonder what kind of outcry there might be if Radio Éireann were to broadcast with such a strong transmission that all foreign stations were cut out?  The row that would develop would be even louder than any transmission they could send out, and rightly so.  To propose the alternative I am proposing is not a question of being anti-national&mdash;far from it.  It is a question of allowing the people here a choice of programme.  It is because I have every confidence in the excellence of Telefís Éireann&mdash; because it certainly has improved and it has given a service of which we can be proud, considering the limited time in which it has been in operation and the limited amount of finance available to it&mdash;that I think the Minister is doing a grave disservice to suggest by implication that it cannot suffer interference from outside.</P>
    <P>It has caused a certain amount of talk that when it was decided to reduce interference, it was the B.B.C., which is a subsidiary of the British Department of Posts and Telegraphs, which was kindly considered and not U.T.V.  It may well be that Telefís Éireann want to monopolise the advertising in television in this country.  If that be so, it would be better that they should say it, and steps could be taken by the Minister for Finance or somebody else to encourage people to advertise only on Telefís Éireann and exclude them from advertising on foreign stations.  But to deny people <Col N="158" /> reasonably good programmes in that service because of anxiety to monopolise the fees for television advertising seems to me to be extremely unfair and most undesirable.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement is a vexatious one.  It suggests he is not bound to protect the rights of people to a choice of three programmes because there is no international obligation on him to do so.  I never suggested, nor do I think anybody suggested, there is. What we are saying is that there is a moral obligation on him to protect the investment of those who have already invested money.  I am prepared to concede I used a word which might not be technically accurate when raising a supplementary on 1st March.  I referred to twenty different frequencies. The Minister has pointed out that this is not quite right.  I do not think his phrase that he entirely repudiates my statement is entirely fair.  In return for the concession I am making, I would ask the Minister to concede that an error by omission was made in page three of his statement in which he uses the sentence &ldquo;We were assigned sufficient frequencies at the Stockholm Conference in Bands 1 and 3 to provide two separate services, one on 405 lines and the other on 625 lines, a system which uses a band width of eight megacycles.&rdquo;  That would suggest to anybody who did not know otherwise that both 405 and 625 used eight megacycles.  My information is that 405 uses only five megacycles. The statement ought to have made that clearer.  I could entirely repudiate what the Minister says, but I think it would be better, when discussing technical things not to be so emphatic in one's statements.</P>
    <P>The Minister refused, in reply to Deputy Sweetman and again in his statement, to go into the technical reasons for the assignment to particular stations of the frequencies allotted to us.  If the Minister has any technical reasons he should state them. There are people in the trade, people who are expert technically, who have different views on this matter from those of the Minister and his Department. If the Minister has good and <Col N="159" /> valid reasons for not adopting their suggestions, he should give them in the fullest detail.  It might not mean a great deal to me or to the Minister personally but it certainly would to the people technically competent.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to reconsider the whole matter and at this stage to do the right thing by the people who now have a choice of three programmes.  To say that he will not give the people a choice of three programmes because it might interfere with a minority is to say that justice will not be done to 200 people because one person might not have as good a service as that on the home television.  I do not believe the Minister is technically correct in what he says in that regard.  If the allocations I suggest are adopted, there will be no particular difficulty.  On that account I would ask the Minister sincerely to reconsider his steps at this stage, to change the channels and to give to hundreds of thousands of television owners here what they are entitled to: a choice of three programmes. If he does that, he will be doing credit to Telefís Éireann and to himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>That obligation is to our own viewers, to give them satisfactory reception of the home programmes. Our second obligation is to ensure that Telefís Éireann transmissions do not cause any interference within the service areas of transmitters of other administrations.  In fully ten minutes of the twenty minutes Deputy Ryan has spoken here, he gave me more technical advice in relation to the disposition of Telefís Éireann stations than I could possibly get from the highly qualified people at my disposal and at the disposal of Radio Éireann. The Stockholm Conference lasted a month.  It was attended by the engineers of all the European administrations and they spent a whole month discussing this matter before agreement <Col N="160" /> was reached on the allocation of frequency to the countries represented at that Conference.</P>
      <P>Now, we are as much concerned in relation to reception by members of the public who own television sets as Deputy Ryan is.  Before the Stockholm Conference, we were not in a position to decide on any line standard for our service other than 405.  As a result of the good work done at that Conference by the representatives of this country, our Government found themselves in the position of deciding for either 625 or 405.  Notwithstanding the fact that the adoption of 625 transmission as the standard line here will cost a good deal more than if we had remained on the 405 line standard, we are also providing for 405 line transmission from Dublin and Sligo because there are people in possession of 405 line receivers and we want to make it possible for them to get our 405 line as well as other 405 line receptions from outside stations. There is no such thing as interference-free reception and the reason for the Stockholm Conference was to reduce to the minimum any interference that might be caused as between one station and another.</P>
      <P>In relation to the statement made by Deputy Ryan that there are people who have views on this matter other than the views expresed and the decisions taken by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I want now to tell Deputy Ryan and the House that a deputation from the Wireless Dealers' Association discussed this whole matter with representatives of my Department and Radio Éireann on 9th March last.  There was a long and frank discussion lasting for an hour and a half, at the end of which the Association indicated that they were fully satisfied that the arrangements we were making were the best that could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the discussion with the Wireless Dealers' Association they accepted that there was really no alternative to the choice of Channel F for Mount Leinster, but they questioned whether a station was necessary there at all, whether its power could be reduced, particularly towards the north, and whether one or two small <Col N="161" /> satellite stations would not suffice.  The Post Office and Radio Éireann technical experts were able to convince them that a station of 50 kilowatt power was needed to cover the parts of Wicklow which are in shadow from Kippure, as well as Counties Wexford and Waterford. They also convinced them that the offset arrangements proposed for Mount Leinster would be far more beneficial from the point of view of protecting the U.T.V. transmissions, than a very substantial reduction in power.  The offset arrangements proposed would have the same effect as reducing the power of Mount Leinster from 50 kilowatts to 1/5th of a kilowatt and leaving it exactly on the same frequency.</P>
    <P>Any change in the characteristics of the Mount Leinster station would involve consulting a number of other administrations.  That same argument applies with equal force to a number of other suggestions made by Deputy Ryan tonight in relation to the switching of these lines and frequencies.  We would have to go to all these other administrations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and get their consent before we could break the agreement reached and adopt Deputy Ryan's suggestions.  Any change would have to be in accordance with the procedure laid down at Stockholm.  We would have no case for looking for a change in the frequency for Mount Leinster because all we can claim is that we should have assignments which will give us a domestic service of good quality and the assignments we have received are in accordance with the planning principles adopted by the Stockholm Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who do not realise that interference cuts both ways and that it would be silly to try deliberately to blot out another station because this would automatically reduce the service area of one's own transmitter.  There is just no question of anyone trying to blot out reception from either the Six Counties or the B.B.C.  We must all bear in mind not alone the stations which are already in <Col N="162" /> operation but also stations not yet existing for which assignments are held by other administrations.  In the United Kingdom roughly half of the nine Band III channels are not in use at present as they are reserved for a possible third 405 line service.  The United Kingdom holds frequency assignments, however, for stations in all 14 of the 405 line Channels in Bands I and III.  That country was assigned frequencies for 146 stations at Stockholm&mdash;an average of ten for each Channel &mdash; and the permitted power of the stations varies from 1 kilowatt to 500 kilowatts.  Among the assignments are ones for the following new stations in Northern Ireland: Channel 5, Enniskillen; Channel 6, Black Mountain; Channel 8, Koram Hill; and Channel 12, Koram Hill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan may not have had that information at his disposal when he decided to raise this matter here tonight and to make suggestions for switching frequencies.</P>

      <P>According as additional stations are opened in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, to cover areas of poor reception, the range of existing stations will become less and less because of mutual interference between stations.  This is something over which we can exercise no control and it is bound to have an adverse effect on reception of B.B.C. and U.T.V. programmes in this country.  In this connexion the proposed change from Channel A to Channel B for the Gort station may not prove to be of much advantage to Irish viewers who have been in the habit of viewing the Six Counties B.B.C. transmissions on Channel I as a new station will be opened on the same Channel within the next few months at Llandona in North Wales and is quite likely to interfere with the reception along the east coast from the Belfast station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We were awaiting confirmation in relation to the change from Channel A to Channel B from one country and I am glad to say that that confirmation arrived today.  I do not think there is <Col N="163" /> anything further I need say.  We have the best possible advice we can get. From the outset we made it our business to ensure that we would have the best possible technical advice when we set out to establish a T.V. service as a public corporation.  There is no reason why I should doubt the advice I got in relation to this matter.  The allocations are the best possible that could be got in the circumstances.  So far as the future is concerned, large numbers of people who are now getting fringe <Col N="164" /> reception from outside stations will continue to get that fringe reception. The picture may not be as clear as the picture from Telefís Éireann, but it is only since Telefís Éireann started that people here have found themselves in a position to judge for themselves the quality of the picture from Telefís Éireann as compared with the quality of the picture they were getting by fringe reception from outside stations.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 21st March, 1962.</P>
