    <Title>European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Bill, 1979: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry) Ray MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> The main purpose of the Bill is to provide the necessary legislative authority for the appropriate payments to Irish representatives elected to the European Assembly.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that Irish representatives will receive, in respect of their duties in the Assembly, the equivalent of the allowance payable from time to time to a Dáil Deputy.  This is in accordance with the decision of the European Council that Assembly representatives should be paid the same remuneration as the Members of the Parliament of the country they represent.  The Council left it up to each member state to decide, in relation to Members holding a dual mandate in the National Parliament and the Assembly, whether they should retain both salaries.  It has been decided that Irish representatives in the Assembly who are also members of the Oireachtas, will receive their appropriate Oireachtas allowance in addition to their Assembly allowance.  It is not, however, necessary to provide specifically for this in the legislation.  It is not the intention that should an office holder such as a Minister of State become an Assembly representative that he or she would continue to hold office.  The question of payment of salary as an office holder in addition to allowances as Member of the Assembly and the Oireachtas will not therefore arise.  Payment of the Assembly allowance will commence from the beginning of the term of office, that is, in the case of an elected representative, from the date on which the Assembly first meets after the election.</P>
    <P>Members of the European Parliament have in the past received allowances in respect of travel, subsistence and secretarial expenses and it is understood that these payments will continue to be determined by the Assembly and met from the Assembly budget.  It is not envisaged, accordingly, that any expenses would fall to be met from voted moneys. It is considered however to have a provision in the legislation enabling payment of expenses to be made from voted moneys if the necessity should arise in the future, for example, if these expenses should cease to be borne on Assembly funds.  Section 3 enables this to be done by way of order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> Section 4 of the Bill provides for the making of a contributory scheme for the grant of pensions to, or in respect of, the Irish representatives in the Assembly. The provisions will be set out in the scheme itself which will be generally on the lines of that already applicable to Members of the Oireachtas.  Such a scheme will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides, at section 5, for the avoidance of conflict of interest arising through representatives of the European Assembly having direct involvement in the affairs of State-sponsored bodies.  Already, the individual Acts governing most of these bodies contain provisions designed to ensure that a person shall not at the same time be a Member of the Oireachtas and a member of the board or staff of a State-sponsored body.  The application of similar limitations to representatives in the European Assembly is appropriate and the present Bill affords a suitable opportunity to do so on a general basis. The Schedule to section 5 lists the bodies to which the limitations will apply and further bodies may be added as and when appropriate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing at all to do with us and it should not be any concern of the Irish taxpayer.  It should not be part of their duty to pay Members of another Parliament, which is what the Government are asking us to do as a result of a foolish decision taken by the Heads of State at one of the Council meetings at the end of last year, forced on them for political reasons by the Head of one Government who has since left office.  That is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are here today asked to debate what is called the European Assembly (Irish Representatives) Bill, 1979.  In every one of the other eight countries of the Community they are doing exactly the same thing, wasting the time of <Col N="776" /> Parliament and their taxpayers' money. The history of this is that the then British Foreign Secretary, in an excess of virtue, about two years ago said that he would not agree that Members of the European Parliament be paid any more than the Members of the House of Commons.  As sometimes happens, this became part of the policy of the Labour Government then in office in England with the result that a meeting of the Heads of State at Bremen, the British Prime Minister of the day, Mr. Callaghan, said he would not agree to any proposal under which the Members of the European Parliament would be paid more, or that the Members from England would be paid more than were MPs in the House of Commons.  What was agreed at that meeting&mdash;I suppose, in an effort to keep Prime Minister Callaghan quiet, to help him get over what they saw at the time as electoral problems in the club atmosphere that operates at all of these meetings in which they like to continue dealing with the devil they know, and of course in the United Kingdom of six months ago they were dealing with the devil they knew and feared the &ldquo;deviless&rdquo;, if there is such a word, they did not know.  It was agreed at that meeting that each parliament, or each government, would pay its own Members and the European Parliament would decide at what rate they would be paid.</P>
    <P>Now we are confronted with a situation in which there are 410 Members of the European Parliament being paid at nine different rates, all doing the same job.  Surely this is the height of ridiculousness?  As we frequently pay lip service to this matter, make many speeches about it, with pages and pages of newspaper absorbed by our lofty thoughts on the ideal of a united Europe, the movement towards the unity of the peoples of Europe, we now propose to have an Assembly of over 400 people in which there are nine different rates of pay for Members all doing the same job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a trade union's delight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  Even on this island three of the Members will be paid <Col N="777" /> at one rate and 15 at another.  In fact that is not even true because, when examined, it is worse than that.  For example Mr. Maher and Mr. Flanagan both will have only their European salaries, whereas Members of this House, and there is one Senator&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator McCartin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take the rates at the bottom of the scale: the lowest paid Members of the European Parliament for Ireland will be Mr. Maher and Mr. Flanagan, neither of whom is a Member of either House of the Oireachtas. Therefore, they will be paid the basic allowance set out in this Bill, which is, I think, £6,200.  Senator McCartin will be paid another rate.  The other 12 Members, being Members of the Dáil, will be paid a third rate.  None of these will be the same as the rate paid to the three Members from the North of Ireland, one of whom is an MP in the House of Commons and presumably will be paid this allowance in addition to his MP's salary.  The other two are not MPs and will receive only the European rate, which will be different from that paid to Members from the South of Ireland, all of which will be different from the rate paid to any one of the Members coming from each individual country to the European Parliament next month.  The great possibility is that the whole thing is illegal and if challenged in the European Court, under the Treaty of Rome, must be thrown out as a bit of nonsense.</P>
      <P>It is a waste of our time discussing it. It was a waste of time of the Heads of State putting this forward.  I presume it came off the top of somebody's head after a very good dinner late one evening, as a way of putting the problem to one side so that they would not have to come to a decision about it.  That is the only way in which I can think such a ridiculous suggestion could have been put forward and expect to be treated seriously by the nine Parliaments in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that he send a cable or telex now&mdash;if still operative&mdash;to the Taoiseach in <Col N="778" /> Strasbourg at the present Council Meeting in order that he be able to inform his fellow Heads of State this evening: &ldquo;Yes, legislation was introduced in the Irish Parliament this morning; we are going ahead with that proposition,&rdquo; and then forget the whole thing.  It is obvious to me that by the end of this year the European Parliament will have made their own decision about how their Members should be paid and will tell the Council of Ministers and Heads of State that they have no function at all in the matter and no right to interfere in the level of pay being given to European parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>While on that subject I would say to the European parliamentarians&mdash;and this is only fair&mdash;they should not pay themselves.  I believe that within 12 months they will be paying themselves and that this Bill will be seen for what it is, a bit of worthless window-dressing. The European parliamentarians should not create further jealousies amongst, not merely themselves but the ordinary people of Europe by paying themselves excessive salaries.  But I think they should be paid more than we are paid in this House.  It is only fair to say that the strain involved, the very unsocial type of job it will be, the long time that will have to be spent away from home, the difficulties of keeping a second home going in some of the most expensive places in Europe along with maintaining one's home base, means that these people should be adequately compensated.  In that way I feel they should be paid more than we are paid here.  I would hesitate to put a figure on it but I would think something in the region of £15,000 a year would be a more suitable salary. There is no denying the strain involved, the potential damage to family life, the very unsocial hours that must be worked and spent travelling in being a Member of the European Parliament, meeting in three different locations, and its Members need to be adequately compensated. Indeed they could never be adequately compensated in monetary terms but some effort must be made to assist Members to bring their families out to Europe with them, thereby, in some way, keeping the strands of family life together.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> During the last six months I think a lot of people thought that to be elected to the European Parliament, to be a Member representing Ireland there, would mean the beginning of a glamorous life style.  I am afraid that the reality may prove to be different.  It will involve hard work and a lot of travel in the height of the winter, many times in the early hours of the morning.  There is no doubt that the European Parliament will put huge strains on the social and family lives as well as the health of the Deputies involved.  I would advise Deputy O'Connell, who has just come in, to refuse to have any part in getting this legislation through the House.  When the European parliamentarians come to settle their salaries they should be on the generous side having regard to all the factors.  This European Parliament was elected and will do more serious work than the two Parliaments which preceded it, which was comprised of Members who were nominated but not elected.  The new Members can speak with greater confidence and take a more positive view of the affairs of Europe. When deciding on their salaries I hope they will behave in a responsible fashion, recognising that at least one Member of the Dáil at home will not criticise them if they are paid more than we are getting.</P>
    <P>If the Government were serious about this Bill the proper thing to do would have been to include provisions in relation to the level of expenses.  I noticed from the Minister's speech that the Government are carefully sidestepping this.  The general public's view of the politician will not be enhanced by a Bill which brings about situations in which the only way possible for a European Deputy to maintain his two houses and maintain his family in a style they are accustomed to is to claim expenses at an exaggerated level from the European Parliament.  If the Government wish to dictate the salary level, they should also dictate the expenses level.</P>
    <P>They should do the correct thing and keep out of it altogether and accept this for what it was&mdash;a bit of window dressing for the sake of a British electorate, proposed by a British Prime Minister who is now out of office.  It should be <Col N="780" /> forgotten.  In Britain the Bill was merely circulated and in Italy, the Netherlands and Luxembourg no legislation has been introduced.  At this stage, I feel we will hear no more about it from these countries.  They paid their lip service to the Council of the Heads of States at Bremen by agreeing at that stage, and nothing has been done about it since.  In France the Bill was adopted by the Assembly and is going to the Senate.  Denmark and Germany are the only two countries who have completed the legislative proposals.  I recommend that the House allow the Second Stage to go through and then forget the whole thing, because it is a silly worthless bit of interfering in a matter that is not our business.  It is ridiculous that the taxpayer should have to pay the salaries of 15 men whose salaries should be paid by a Parliament to which they were elected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to give out to a Minister of State who is trying to do his job well.  However, as Deputy Barry said, this is a bit of nonsense.  The Government had the opportunity to define within the context of this Bill the role of a Member of the European Parliament in relation to these two Houses.  The first anomaly arises in the first page of the Minister's speech where no mention is made of the fact that two Members were elected to the Parliament who are not Members of this House.  No provision was made in this legislation to give them rights of access to this House or, more importantly, to give them rights of access to the Joint Committee on EC Legislation.  In the next four or five years we will be in a situation where a person who headed the poll in the largest constituency does not have rights of access to the Joint-Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. If the Government and the Department of the Public Service were doing their job these aspects of the role of European parliamentarians would have been recognised before they rushed in to discuss the rates of pay.  The Government are determining the rates of pay without attempting to look at what the job specification means in practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are engaged here in a bit of political window dressing which is a <Col N="781" /> sequel to the charade that was played out in the Bremen Summit, when the British Prime Minister along with others was faced with the embarrassing prospect that the people might not come out and vote in the percentage numbers hoped for because of the stories about the salaries.  We must get quite clear this business about salaries and resources to do a job.  There is no way that Deputy MacSharry would sit in this House and take a salary tied to the standard of income in Sligo town, which would be lower than the standard of income in Dublin South-East.  No Deputy would accept that criteria and that is what we are proposing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A political deal worked out at a Summit between nine Heads of State because they could not come up with a political formula that would work on some basis of equity is essentially their problem.  We in this House should not formally give consent to the principle of different rates of pay for the same job.  Will 100 years in the Labour movement and of the Labour struggle be turned upside down by this nonsense?  The Government were represented last Friday evening in O'Connell Street by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Labour at the unveiling of a monument by the President to James Larkin, the great Labour leader.  What would be his comment on a different rate of pay for dockers in Dublin, Sligo, Bremen and so on?  This is nonsense from the Government and I am sad for the Minister of State that he must sit here and listen to justified criticism.</P>
    <P>The reality is that if we pass this legislation we will be creating a precedent for the Department of the Public Service and for future Ministers for Finance in the matter of differential rates of pay for the same job.  That is unacceptable, and we are asking the Minister to let this legislation wither away until it can be dealt with properly by people who are competent to do so.</P>
    <P>The nonsense did not start or stop at Bremen.  It extends into the Department of the Public Service.  Section 4 deals with a pension scheme, and so casual has been the drafting that an Irish MEP, to benefit from a pension scheme paid <Col N="782" /> for by the people of Ireland, would have to serve 20 years before being entitled to a 50 per cent pension.  He would have to serve eight years before qualifying for a minimum pension.  An Irish MEP will not be given an opportunity to buy some years of service.  In other words, if an Irish MEP wanted to serve only five years but was anxious to provide for some kind of pension, he is not being given an opportunity in the Bill to buy the extra three years to give him some kind of pension.  Why were these things not looked at more carefully?  If we have a Committee Stage these points will have to be looked at more carefully then.</P>
    <P>Totally absent from the Bill and scandalously absent from the Minister's statement is any concept of the role of an MEP in relation to his Irish constituency. We are talking about the House voting taxpayers' money to MEP's so that they can become effective Members.  They are being equated with Deputies and Senators, but there is not a Deputy who has a constituency the size of Munster or Connacht/Ulster.  The kind of allowance being provided for here will not in any way pay our MEP's for the sheer physical job of looking after such constituencies.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill for additional resources for MEP's with which to service their Irish constituencies. If the Government are serious about European legislation and about enabling 15 Members for the Twenty-six Counties to do their job in Europe, why has not this legislation incorporated some framework whereby Irish MEP's would have some scheme of resources to enable them effectively to represent their huge Irish constituencies?</P>
    <P>I do not know why we are discussing this legislation.  We are doing so in a vacuum.  If we pass this Bill before the European Parliament has decided on the levels of remuneration, expenses and so on, we will run the risk of creating a gap between the kind of resources&mdash;I stress &ldquo;resources&rdquo; rather than salary and I will elaborate what I mean by it&mdash;available to Irish MEPs in relation to the difficulty of doing the work.  Subsequently we will have to come back to waste valuable parliamentary  <Col N="783" /> time to amend this legislation when the picture has clarified itself.</P>
    <P>It would have helped us if the Minister had given some explanation as to why he wants this legislation so soon, why he wants it passed before 17 July.  I suspect he had hoped to get the Committee Stage today&mdash;the brevity of his introductory statement would give that impression. He has not told us why he wants the legislation before the levels of salaries and expenses have been established by the European Parliament. Of course it is only a physical expression of the fear by the Heads of State of the nine EEC countries that a level of salary and expenses on the scale of those on the Continent would create a scandal in Britain and Ireland because Dáil salaries and allowances are so low relative to the other member states, possibly with the exception of Luxembourg, which is in another category.  The motivation behind the Bremen compromise was to ensure a good turn-out of electors on 7 June.  By general consensus among politicians, we have had that turn-out and we should now look afresh at the whole business.</P>
    <P>MEPs will be doing the same job in Europe whether they come from Donegal, the south of France or northern Denmark.  If the principle of differential pay for Deputies coming from Donegal, Kerry or Dublin is unacceptable to the House, then surely the same principle should apply in regard to MEPs.  If it does not, if the Government persist in this kind of nonsense, we can only assume that all the high-flying talk of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the European idea is not being lived up to.</P>
    <P>The question of resources for Members of Parliament, whether in this House or in Europe, is a major one.  All too frequently we confuse the minds of the public on this matter.  Effectively there is an absence of resources to do our job.  The public want a political service from politicians of all political persuasions and in the view of many members of my party, the greatest impediment to us in providing such a service is not the level of our remuneration but the absence of adequate resources to do the job, the lack of permanent offices <Col N="784" /> in our constituencies, of assistants to take messages and to do some work in the constituencies, of persons to advice us in relation to legislation&mdash;general resources in personnel and facilities.</P>
    <P>The submission made by the Select Committee on the Devlin Report points out how inadequate these resources are. Why, then, should the Government now be incorporating the same low level of resources for our MEPs?  There is not a mention in the Bill of resources, other than salaries.  Again it brings us to the situation where we are caught in a vacuum.  We are discussing one part of a person's remuneration without knowing what the other part is going to be.  We are trying to decide in advance on decisions which will be taken by the European Parliament as to what part of moneys should be made available to a European Member.  In advance of that decision we could be 100 per cent right or 100 per cent wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not realise why the Minister feels that he has to bring in the legislation. When the order for Second Stage of this legislation was first moved about three weeks ago Deputy Barry at that time sought clarification as to why it was introduced. Since that is on the record of the House I would expect that the Minister, his officials or somebody over there would have noted that question and would at least have seen fit to write in a paragraph stating why this legislation should be taken now.  There is no justification for taking it at this time.  If we take it we are going to run the risk of incorporating in law a precedent which I oppose, that is a differential rate for the same job.  If you were to say to anybody employed in this House&mdash;for example, the ushers, the reporters or the journalists up in the benches&mdash;that they would get a different rate for the same job, can you imagine the reaction that you would get?  Yet the Minister is asking us to accept it.  We are told in a euphemistic phrase that the allowances for the European Parliament will somehow balance the scales and it will be all right on the day.  That is not acceptable, and it confirms people's attitudes to politicians, that we do not have a capacity to be open, honest and direct in these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="785" /> I will quote Mr. &ldquo;Tip&rdquo; O'Neill, Speaker of the House of Representatives in the US Congress, who spoke at a recent discussion with congressmen who were debating their level of pay and increase in remuneration.  For the record, on a recent visit to the US I took the opportunity to visit a congressman's office. The constituency of a congressman is similar in size to that of a Member of the European Parliament now.  Their roles are different but their level of representation is the same.  The resources that the congressman has, as distinct from salary, amount to a maximum staff of 18 people and a maximum amount of money of $.25 million to enable that person to act as a public representative on behalf of the people who have elected him.  He has a suite of offices in one of the buildings adjoining the Congress and he has resources in his own constituency to enable a permanent representation.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with the level of the responsibility of a Member like Mr. T.J. Maher, who is the best example to take because he is exclusively a Member of the European Parliament and nothing else, and consider the massive mandate that he received from the electorate and the critical importance of the agricultural sector to the province of Munster.  What kind of resources are we giving to him and what kind of resources do the Government propose to give? Again, there is no reference to any of those matters in the Minister's speech or in the legislation other than the factual mechanical moving of the legislation in order to give effect to a political compromise worked out somewhere in the small hours in Bremen to accommodate a political sector point that has now passed.</P>
    <P>I was about to quote Speaker O'Neill in relation to congressmen's pay.  They are in receipt of an increase on the resources they already have which I have described.  He was quoted as saying that if congressmen did not have the guts to pay them the rate for the job they should not be in Congress in the first place.  It is time for people in this House and in the other House to say openly and honestly to the public that unless we get adequate resources&mdash;by that I mean sufficient staff, facilities and <Col N="786" /> premises&mdash;to do the kind of job that is demanded of us, unless we get a reasonable rate for the job also, we are not going to be able to make democracy work.  We spend vast sums each year on the Army and on the Garda who are, above everything else, protectors and guardians of the democratic system which we operate, yet we invest virtually nothing in that democratic system itself. That is the kind of nonsense we have inherited from the Westminster Parliament where the House of Commons was a plaything for wealthy gentlemen who had private resources and who could indulge their pursuit of power with their private means.  That is not the case in this republican assembly, and it is to the shame of successive Governments that over many years we have been hidebound by that aristocratic model of a parliament instead of being inspired by what would have properly been a republican assembly which would enable any person who obtained a mandate to do the job that he or she is properly elected to do.</P>
    <P>I will finish by saying that I am sorry to have to be so harsh in this matter and by asking the Minister of State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the attitude of Deputy Barry and Deputy Quinn.  We have no alternative but to accept the position as we find it.  After the Brussels Summit meeting when this matter was referred to and agreed to by the Heads of State, the Taoiseach spoke in this House on 7 December and I quote from <Col N="787" /> the Official Report, column 978, Volume 310:</P>
      <P>We also considered the remuneration of Members of the directly elected European Parliament and concluded that Members elected next June should be paid the same salaries as those of members of the Parliament of the country they represent; that their salaries should be subject to national taxation in their own country; and that they should receive satisfactory allowances for such expenses as travelling, subsistence and support staff.  It will be for each member state, in relation to members holding the dual mandate, to decide whether they may retain both salaries.</P>
      <P>In his reply to the Taoiseach the Leader of the Opposition and of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy FitzGerald said, as reported at column 987 of the same volume:</P>
      <P>I have always thought that there would be disadvantages if the salaries paid in Ireland were to be at the level necessary to attract a German member of Parliament to join the European Parliament.  Such salaries which would have been of the order of £25,000 per year would have been so disproportionate to salaries here in the public sector, and indeed even in most parts of the private sector, that they might have given a wrong impression and might have had an adverse effect on the degree of participation in the elections and in the confidence of people in the value and the seriousness of the elections.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>I would have hoped&mdash;and this had been suggested in the papers&mdash;that an intermediate figure of a kind more appropriate to this country would have emerged,</P>
      <P>These are the words of Deputy Barry's leader&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>a figure which would have been close to if not at the level of the salary of a Minister here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking the situation as presented in this <Col N="788" /> legislation with the dual mandate and dual salary allowed, a Member of the European Parliament who is a Member of this House or even of the Seanad has as much as if not more than I have as Minister of State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy FitzGerald on the occasion referred to by the Minister of State and it is quite clear that what he meant was that the salaries paid by the European Parliament would be equal to a salary paid to a Minister here even outside the Dáil allowance. How does Mr. T. J. Maher stand?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be more relevant to discuss the concern of Deputies for their own facilities rather than their concern for the elected Members of the European Parliament.  It is ridiculous to adopt this attitude, bearing in mind what has already been said about the salaries and allowances of Members of the European Parliament from other countries and the ways in which the Governments of those countries will decide whether or not there will be a double salary.  We have only one job to do because of our participation in Europe.  We find it necessary to introduce this legislation because otherwise no allowance whatsoever will be paid to Members of the European Parliament.  If the legislation is not passed before the summer recess the Members will be without remuneration until October or November.  I had hoped that Deputies would be more considerate and would agree to taking all Stages today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various points made were tied up in the argument about people from different countries doing the same work and receiving different salaries.  The argument is justified and I will not attempt to put forward a counter argument. A decision has been made by the <Col N="789" /> European Heads of State and they are putting forward legislation in their own countries of the type now before this House allowing payments to be made to Members of the European Parliament.  I have been criticised for making such a short speech on Second Stage and not going into detail on the role of the Members of the European Parliament. That is not our business.  The purpose of this legislation is to make provision for payment of an allowance to Members of the European Parliament.  I explained that in detail during my speech.  It is not the duty of this House in any way to outline what the role of Members might be.  Neither is it our business to become involved in the provision of resources or facilities or secretarial allowances for Members of the European Parliament; it is a matter for the European Assembly. The ten people who were Members of the Parliament during the past six years did not receive a salary but the allowances from the European Assembly were quite generous and I am sure that they will not only be maintained but drastically improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised the matter of pension schemes.  The legislation enables us to set up a pension scheme and the points made will obviously be taken into account.  It will be broadly on the same lines as the Oireachtas pension scheme.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is not passed before the Dáil rises next week for the summer recess the elected Members of the European Parliament will have no allowance whatsoever.</P>

    <Title>Restrictive Practices (Confirmation of Order) Bill, 1979: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Col N="791" />
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of this Bill is to confirm the Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Order, 1979, which I made on 12 June under the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972.  This order extends for another year a statutory ban on the operation of new company-owned motor spirit stations by oil companies.  The order was due to expire shortly.</P>
      <P>I have extended the order because the Restrictive Practices Commission have indicated that they will not be in a position to report to me for some time yet on the public inquiry which they held recently into the supply and distribution of motor spirit.  This inquiry, which I requested, was concerned with the operation of the current Restrictive Practices (Motor Spirit) Orders, with any matter germane to the operation of the orders, and also with conditions which obtain in regard to agreements under which petrol stations which are company owned but not company run are operated.</P>
      <P>The first inquiry into the trade was under the fair trading legislation and took place in 1960.  It was principally concerned with examining the merits of the &ldquo;solus&rdquo; system, the system under which a retailer undertakes to handle one brand of motor spirit exclusively.  It found that the system had certain merits but needed to be regulated because of its tendency to encourage an excessive number of petrol retail outlets.  An order to regulate the system was made by the Minister in 1961 and shortly afterwards the Fair Trade Commission and the pertrol companies reached agreement on certain guiding principles designed to limit the increase in outlets.</P>
      <P>There was concern throughout the sixties that the guiding principles were not having their intended effect of limiting the number of outlets and that the regulation of the solus system was leading companies to increase the number of directly operated outlets.  At the Minister's request, the Commission held an inquiry into this growth in outlets in 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> In their report, the Restrictive Practices Commission argued that the extension of control by the oil companies over the retail market by means of company-operated stations needed to be curbed in the public interest as they felt that this development would lead to dominance by the oil companies over the retail trade and increase the risk of such restrictive practices as price fixing and market sharing.  An order to halt this development for a three-year trial period was made in 1972.  It was reviewed in 1975 by the commission and on their recommendation extended for another three years until the summer of 1978 when the prohibition was extended for a further year.</P>
    <P>Following their 1975 review the commission had suggested that when they next review the ban they should also review the orders as a whole.  During that review they also received representations on matters relevant to the orders which their terms of reference did not allow them to consider.  I decided, therefore, when requesting the recent inquiry that they should be free to consider other matters germane to the orders.  I also decided that they should look into a matter which has been the source of grievance to some people in the trade for a number of years&mdash;the conditions under which persons who are not the companies employees operate their stations under licence.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Act, 1972, provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  The Bill now before the House is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the order.  The order, however, may not be amended but must be accepted or rejected as it stands.</P>
    <P>This is an uncontroversial measure and I have no hesitation in recommending it to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main objects of the Bill are to increase the authorised share capital of Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. from £6 million to £25 million, and to raise the ceiling of borrowings which may be guaranteed by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance from £3 million to £60 million.</P>
      <P>The Dáil is aware that Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. is a wholly State-owned company with share capital of £6 million held by the Minister for Finance.  The amount of borrowings covered by ministerial guarantee at present is £765,800.  The principal activity of the company is the manufacture of steel from ferrous scrap.  Its principal products are reinforcing bars and sections in a limited range of sizes mainly for the construction industry.</P>
      <P>Following advice from external consultants who made a thorough study of the company's operations and potential, the company has embarked on a major development and restructuring of the industry which it is anticipated will give more efficient and more flexible production. A new 90 tonne electric arc furnace will be installed to replace the existing 30 tonne electric arc furnace and a continuous casting facility and a new universal bar and section rolling mill will replace part of older outdated plant.  The programme envisages the commissioning of the new plant by mid-1980 and the expansion of crude steel output and finished product output over the succeeding five-year period to the projected annual output level of 282,000 tonnes of saleable products.  This will be more than double present output.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this restructuring of the steel mill will give greatly increased production capacity the workforce will not be increased.  The position is, however, that the company's operations are no longer viable and without this modernisation programme the industry would have to shut down with the loss of the jobs of over 700 workers.  The industry will now be given up-to-date means of steel <Col N="794" /> production which will put the company's unit costs of production on a competitive level in the European Community.</P>
    <P>The cost of the programme will be in the region of £45 million, including £10 million working capital and pre-production expenses.  Of this £10.5 million will be provided by the Exchequer as share capital, £4 million by an IDA grant, £17.5 million by a loan from the funds of the European Coal and Steel Community, £8 million by the leasing of equipment through United Kingdom banks and the balance from other commercial sources.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the steel industry which has been with us since 1974 together with the outdated methods in use have created difficulties for the company and consequently it has had to borrow heavily to keep in business.  The company's projections, however, show that even allowing for the servicing of these loans there will be profits in the third and subsequent years of operation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, the European Commission did not immediately approve the Irish Steel Holdings proposals.  This was because of its requirement that investment proposals should not be in conflict with the restructuring requirements of the Community steel industry made necessary by the world steel crisis.  The Commission initiated discussions between the company and a French steel company&mdash;Societé Metallurgique et Navale Dunkerque, Normandie (SMNDN)&mdash; which led to the conclusion in December last or reciprocal marketing arrangements. The two companies have agreed to market a proportion of each other's production in their respective areas of market influence&mdash;up to 30,000 tonnes per annum in each case when the Irish Steel Holdings plant becomes operational.  During the period prior to the commissioning of the new plant Irish Steel Holdings and SMNDN will maintain contacts with a view to fostering relationships not only between the two companies but also with their respective customers.</P>
    <P>I might at this stage advert to the fact that the company's policy will, of course, be in the first place to satisfy the home market demand, the balance of <Col N="795" /> production being for export.  The agreement with SMNDN will give the Irish company a foothold in the wider Community market as well as providing economies in production costs. However, apart from the anticipated benefits from the agreement, the company is building up its own sales management team to deal with the increase in products for export expected to come on stream late in 1980.  The consultants who examined the projects are satisfied that the export targets can be met.</P>
    <P>The European Commission are satisfied that together with the modernisation of the Irish Steel Holdings plant the agreement with the French company is in accordance with the general objectives for the Community steel industry. Irish Steel Holdings thus qualifies for a loan at a favourable rate from the funds of the European Coal and Steel Community.</P>
    <P>There are also minor amendments to the Principal Act proposed in the Bill:</P>
    <P>&mdash;section 2 provides for the change of name asked for by the company from Irish Steel Holdings Ltd. to Irish Steel Ltd.</P>
    <P>&mdash;section 5, besides providing for the raising of the ceiling for Ministerial guarantee of loans includes some changes in the relevant section of the Principal Act so that the guarantee may cover payment in respect of contracts entered into for leasing of plant and equipment as well as commissions and incidental expenses arising in connection with a loan or leasing contract.</P>
    <P>&mdash;section 6 provides for the approval of the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service to the remuneration of the chief officer of the company, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;section 7 provides for similar approval of any alteration or arrangement in the superannuation of the staff of the company.</P>
    <P>The two last amendments are being included in the legislation for all State-owned companies as the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not opposed to the measure this Bill contains and we will support the Minister's action.  At the same time there are a few items to which attention needs to be drawn.  One is the apparent disappearance of all limits from the amount of money which the State is willing to put into the project purely for the purpose of preserving a relatively small amount of employment. I realise that the Minister's party, and my own party, are subject to pressures in this regard and that makes it unthinkable that there would be anything but a bipartisan or tripartisan approach to this in this House.  Even if we were not subject to political pressures nobody wants an industry to disappear.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, here is an industry which is embarking on an expansion programme that will not be reflected in any extra jobs and may end up supporting fewer jobs than are now there. That is a programme for survival because, unless it embarks on such a programme, it will go to the wall and these jobs will be gone.  We are going to spend £45 million on an industry, which admittedly is unique of its kind in this country and to that extent has some claim on our sentiment, in rescuing employment which is threatened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I contrast that with the ineffective measures which the State has taken in other respects where employment has fallen from the country like snow off a ditch because of failure to guard adequately against competition from outside, against low cost imports, against the British temporary employment subsidy and so on.  The Confederation of Irish Industry estimate that many thousands of jobs have been lost not because we have failed to spend enormous amounts of money&mdash;I admit that to have matched the British temporary employment subsidy earlier would have cost money&mdash;but because of an insufficiently aggressive stance on behalf of the Government in combating measures of this kind which were taken abroad and had a disastrous effect on vulnerable sectors of Irish industry.  It is due partly <Col N="797" /> also to the Government taking an inadequately aggressive approach towards controlling dumped imports from other countries which had, and are still having, the effect of closing down traditional Irish industries and ones which derive their raw material from natural resources.  Perhaps they are not very glamorous natural resources, timber, leather and so on, but they are natural resources and they will be there when the world has tired of other ones or the resources of others are exhausted.</P>
    <P>We have failed to protect employment in the dull, boring old sectors such as textiles, clothing, footwear, leather production and the timber industry when it could have been done without any excessive investment of money.  We are pouring £45 million into keeping a project going, the continuing existence of which, apart from a sentimental attachment, is hard to justify.  The difficulty in justifying it was reflected in the long delay after which the European Commission finally expressed itself as happy with this redevelopment project.</P>
    <P>The steel industry has been and is having, a very difficult time in the European Economic Community generally, largely because of cheap imports from countries which are only now getting into the steel business and are able to do it for half nothing.  In this favoured north-western corner of Europe, there is heavy unemployment in the steel industry even in countries which have a long steel tradition and do not have problems of supply such as Irish Steel Holdings and Haulbowline might have and which have a long tradition of expertise in this matter.  There are parts of Germany, in the Saar, in the Ruhr and other regions, where unemployment is twice the national average because of slackness in the steel industry.  There are parts of France, which are not a stone's throw from the Societé Metallurgique et Navale Dunkerque.  It must be aware that on its own doorstep there is widespread unemployment which has led to serious political disorders, to riots in the street and to the employment of the mobile guards or whatever the French call their riot squads.  This has <Col N="798" /> been purely as a consequence of the distress caused by uncompetitiveness of European steel.  This is the very sector in which we propose, purely for the sake of maintaining a number of jobs, which is tiny towards what we have thrown away in neglect in the last few years, to spend a lot of money.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's Bill because there was unanimity in the party that we should support it and be behind the maintenance of this employment.  I have misgivings as to whether nationally, or in the long term, locally, it is a sensible way of proceeding.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a breakdown of the £45 million pounds which shows that £10½ million pounds will be provided by the Exchequer as share capital, £4 million by an IDA grant, £17.5 million by way of a loan from the funds of the European Coal and Steel Community, £8 million by the leasing of equipment through United Kingdom banks and the balance from other commercial sources.  That does not conceal the fact that every penny of the £45 million will be provided from the resources of the national Exchequer in the short or long term, unless I have misunderstood the Minister's explanations.  I hope that the long-term outlook for steel production in the EEC will improve.  If it does not, I can see either this or some other Minister back here in a few years with some kind of a tale and another application to bale something out, which perhaps it is unduly sentimental of us to be doing now.</P>
    <P>I am very much out of my depth in anything technical but I see that the agreement between Irish Steel and the company in Normandy envisage a reciprocal marketing arrangement whereby each would co-operate in shifting 30,000 tonnes of the other's product a year.  On the figures which the Minister has given that is a very small proportion of the production which he envisages for the Haulbowline plant.  It is not much more than 10 per cent of it. While naturally a reciprocal marketing arrangement must be beneficial&mdash;it is the kind of thing the Common Market exists to promote&mdash;unless there is something behind the figures which I <Col N="799" /> have misunderstood, that arrangement does not seem to me to guarantee anything very much for this company in the long term.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I have been somewhat on the pessimistic side but this party are unanimous in their anxiety to support this company and to have employment there protected.  However, in the long term we may be talking in terms of several hundred millions of pounds more in this respect and asking ourselves whether it has been sensible at a time like this to keep our industrial lines so over-extended having failed so lamentably to protect other industrial outputs in the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>I am speaking for this party in the absence of Deputy Barry Desmond who, unfortunately, is unable to be present this morning.  We welcome this legislation in so far as it strengthens basically a critical part of our economy and in a way that enables the Irish people, through their Government, to retain control of the production and manufacture of steel which predominantly is for the construction industry.  If Deputy Kelly wishes to look to that industry in terms of a source of employment he will realise that it is perhaps the largest single employer of labour apart from agriculture proper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the construction industry.  The Government were right to press ahead with this measure.  I am aware of the kind of difficulties  <Col N="800" /> they had in convincing the European Communities of the absolute necessity to develop Irish Steel and to persuade them that it is necessary to modernise in order to remain static, not to talk about developing.  We in the Labour Party had the same difficulties politically in the European Parliament when members of the Socialist group, particularly the Luxembourg members, one of whom had worked as a union official for the steel industry in Luxembourg prior to his election to the parliament, raised the question of how the spending of EEC money on a small steel plant in Cork where there is no steel tradition could be justified when many people are unemployed and when there are mills in a situation of under-capacity to an extent that has not been experienced for many years.  The argument we made within the context of the Socialist group, an argument that was made forcibly by Deputy Kavanagh, was that each country required a basic steel industry for the purpose of providing essential supplies in this conown local economy and that in this context Irish Steel, which is a State company, should be protected and extended. By protection we meant it had to be modernised so as to produce steel at an efficient level relative to the ever-improving technology of steel production.</P>
      <P>The reason for the crisis in the steel industry is that the labour cost of this activity in places like Spain and south-east Asia are much lower than is the case in the EEC and also that some of the older steel companies, particularly the French ones, have become, under private enterprise, very inefficient, under-invested and under-capitalised. The sense of what Deputy Kelly was suggesting was that those parts of the Community that have a tradition in certain areas of production such as steel should be encouraged to produce for all of us and that in return other parts of the Community that have traditions in certain areas of production, such as food, should reciprocate so that there might be a balance relative to the national capacity and resources of the various regions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="801" /> But in the absence of a common industrial policy&mdash;and this is presupposed by Deputy Kelly in his remarks&mdash;we could not but press for the consolidation, modernisation and development of Irish Steel.  If the French and the Germans who hold the whiphand in so many aspects in the EEC are concerned in real terms about the plight of the steel industry and about the plight generally of old traditional industrial sectors from which they have wined and dined for many years, it is with them that responsibility lies primarily in promoting and developing a common industrial policy into which would fit neatly the kind of logical argument that Deputy Kelly was making. Then we could relate the role of that policy in relation to Irish Steel. However, we do not have that kind of policy and I think that the Minister as well as Deputies on both sides will agree that we are a long way from it.</P>
    <P>What are we to do in the interim?  The consolidation of a State holding company which is producing raw material that is critical and essential in terms of the construction industry and the retaining of control of that company by the State is the right approach and the Minister had no choice but to adopt this approach irrespective of whatever local pressures may have been brought to bear.  I am sure that if this plant had been located in any other part of the country there would still have been local pressures.</P>
    <P>The House should be clear, having heard Deputy Kelly's remarks, that all we are being asked to do in this instance is to agree to an increase of £10.5 million in share capital for this company. The IDA, through their budget on which we shall be voting separately, are making available £4 million of that amount and the rest is being made up by way of loan from British and European banks. One must presume that since this action is being taken the operation will be on a commercial basis and that the return on the capital borrowed will be serviced by way of increased sales and, consequently, increased profits.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position in his reply but I am presuming that all we are <Col N="802" /> being asked to do is directly to agree to the making available of £10.5 million by way of extra share capital.  The essence of this legislation is that the Minister is seeking our approval to raise our capital investment in this company so that it may be modernised in the way that is necessary and in accordance with the approval of the European Steel and Coal Communities.</P>
    <P>There is no need to continue at length on this subject.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned this move to consolidate the steel industry is essential in terms of the public control of the primary material involved especially in the context of its importance to the construction industry.  I am glad that the Government are taking this action having regard to the importance of a nationalised steel industry in terms of our economic and industrial development and having regard to possible future problems in relation to steel on the world market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Bill is being accepted fairly readily, though we have had two diametrically opposed sets of reasons for, in one case, not opposing the Bill and in the other case for supporting it.  It is interesting to note the fundamental cleavages in approach. Without offending anybody, I might say that Deputy Quinn's grasp of what is at stake is the more clear grasp of the situation. This is not simply a rescue operation for the purpose of preserving the 700 jobs which are there.  If that was all it was I would not promote this Bill in the House, because at a total cost of £45 million it would be ludicrous.  One could create ten times more jobs than that for the same amount of money.  We are endeavouring to maintain and strengthen the only steel mill we have, and the only steel mill we are likely to have.  The reason it is important that we have a steel mill is that, if some serious situation were to arise in Europe or in the world whereby it became difficult or impossible for us to import certain vital commodities, the absence of heavy steel would affect our economy most, particularly for the construction industry, as Deputy Quinn said.</P>

      <P>There would be a most disproportionate jolt to the economy if we ran out of construction steel.  We will have enough under this proposal for all our reasonable needs.  We will, in fact, have an excess and we will have to export that excess, which will be fairly considerable. The only definite contract we have at the moment is an arrangement with a Normandy firm that they will sell 30,000 tonnes of the Irish Steel production in return for Irish Steel marketing 30,000 tonnes of a different type of steel manufactured by the French and not manufactured here.  Nonetheless, Irish Steel are already in negotiation with a number of other steel undertakings and steel users in Europe on the question of increasing their exports.  The company have expressed confidence that they will be able to negotiate suitable contracts in this respect.  They have already, at my suggestion and the chairman's suggestion, taken steps to strengthen their sales and marketing organisation to enable those exports to be achieved.  Deputy Kelly is quite wrong when he says that the Exchequer will have to find the whole £45 million a year.  Most of the money is borrowed on a commercial basis and on the projections will be repaid to those from whom it is borrowed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, some of the borrowings, but it is perfectly normal practice that the State should guarantee borrowings for companies like this.  The company envisage under the plans for this project that they can be profitable in the third year from the time that this new project comes on stream.  I sincerely hope they are right.  While I share many of Deputy Quinn's views on this project, I must confess that I also share some of Deputy Kelly's scepticism.  I have had a <Col N="804" /> sickener in respect of a very large project, a larger one than this, a short distance from the location of this one over the last two years.  I am extremely anxious, on behalf of the Irish taxpayer, that Irish Steel at Haulbowline will not end up as NET at Marino Point have ended up.  I will do all in my power to ensure that I will not be back in a year or two with another Irish Steel Holdings Bill in the same way as I had to come back with new NET Bills to cope with the situation that arose there.</P>
      <P>There is now in charge of this company a man of very considerable ability who has proved himself in this country in recent years in the building of a major new plant for a private firm, from which he recently retired as full-time chief executive.  I am very happy to acknowledge here that Mr. Kevin McCourt very generously accepted my invitation that he become an executive chairman of this company rather than the part-time chairman he was and that he will do it for the two years that will be necessary to see this project through to fruition.  He has already, at Midleton, County Cork, seen successfully into operation the building of a major distillery, the only major distillery that has been built in this country for very many years.</P>

      <P>I do not believe they over-ran it to any great significance.  I have seen a couple of over-runs in that general area lately.  I would much prefer to have been involved in Irish Distillers than I would in some other areas.  Mr. McCourt has very generously agreed to this.  He is not devoting 100 per cent of his time to this job but he is certainly devoting a very high proportion of it.  I have every confidence in his ability to ensure that this project comes on stream on time and within budget or as near to being within a budget as one can reasonably be in a project of this kind in these inflationary days.  I would like to acknowledge his public spiritedness and his generosity in taking on this virtually <Col N="805" /> full-time job.  His willingness to do this, at my request, in the public interest is something which stands out like a beacon today when greed and selfishness are so predominantly a feature of so much we see in the country at the moment.  I believe I have dealt with most of the points which have been raised.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Protection of Young Persons (Employment) (Section 4) Order, 1979,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 7 June 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving this motion on behalf of the Minister for Labour who is attending a conference in Geneva.  The motion now introduced, seeks the approval of Dáil <Col N="810" /> Éireann for a draft Order to continue in force for a further period of 12 months from 5 July 1979 subsection (3) of section 4 of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.  In accordance with the Act, this subsection will expire on 5 July 1979 unless the draft order is made with the approval of both Houses.  A similar motion was approved by the Seanad on 13 June.  The power to make the order is conferred on the Minister for Labour by subsection (5) of section 4.</P>
    <P>The employment of children under school leaving age, which is at present 15 years, is generally restricted under section 4.  Sections (2), (3) and (4) of section 4 permit children between 14 and 15 years of age to be employed in light nonindustrial work for limited hours provided that the work is not harmful to their health or normal development or their capacity to benefit from schooling. The employment of children during school years is dealt with in subsection (3) and during school holidays in subsection (4).  Subsection (3) which is, by far, the more restrictive allows a maximum of two hours work on a week day, four hours on Saturdays and Sundays and 14 hours a week.  We all have an obligation to ensure that young people are given every opportunity to grow and develop and to benefit fully from their schooling. It is the Minister's belief that the limited access to employment allowed to young people under 15 years of age by subsection (3) of section 4 of this Act should not hinder their development.</P>
    <P>The Act imposes extensive duties on employers in regard to the employment of young people, including those between 14 and 15 years of age.  Before employing the young person, an employer should require the production of his birth certificate or other satisfactory evidence of age.  The written permission of parents or guardian should also be obtained.  An employer should maintain a register or other satisfactory record showing in regard to young persons the name, date of birth, times of starting and finishing work each day, the rate of wages paid and the total amount of wages paid.  The employer is also required to display an approved abstract <Col N="811" /> of the Act at the principal entrances to the place of employment.  I should also mention that a parent or guardian of a child who aids or abets an employer who contravenes section 4 of the Act is guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Inspections under the Act are carried out by the inspectors of my Department and the Minister is satisfied that in general the enforcement of the Act is proceeding satisfactorily.  In the initial stage of the operation of the Act the approach has been one of advice, publicity and exhortation to employers to secure compliance with the Act, but more recently a number of prosecutions have been undertaken.  I should mention that most employers co-operate with the officials of my Department and there is no evidence of any widespread exploitation of young people in regard to section 4 or any other provisions of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I understand, nevertheless, the viewpoint of those who maintain that there should be a total ban on the employment of children under 15 years of age during school term and accept that their concern is for the health, education and moral welfare of such young people.  However, the withdrawal of the right to engage in limited employment during school-term laid down in the Act would be contrary to the wishes of many parents who consider that a limited period of work outside school hours can be useful experience for young people in the process of adapting to employment and on deciding on careers. The Minister's view, and that view is supported by experience of administering the Act to date, is that the balance of the argument is in favour of continuing a provision for strictly limited work during school term by 14- to 15-year-olds.  It is the Minister's intention during the coming year to review this legislation and he will at that stage consult with all the interests involved.</P>
    <P>His attention has also been drawn to a possible drafting defect in section 4.  He has been advised that the lapse of subsection 4 (3) would not, in fact, result in the prohibition of employment of children under 15, during school term, as was apparently originally intended, but would allow such employment in <Col N="812" /> work which fulfils the conditions set out in subsection (2) but without any definite restrictions as to hours.  This makes it all the more necessary to ensure that subsection 4 (3) remains in force.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil, therefore on behalf of the Minister for Labour to approve the making of an order to continue in force for a further 12 months from 5 July 1979, subsection 4 (3) of the Protection of Young Persons (Employment), Act, 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  Indeed I welcome anything for the protection of young people and the avoidance of their exploitation.  But having said that, we should be presented with something more positive than a Minister coming into the House seeking the extension of the provisions of an Act.</P>
      <P>The whole question of young people should be examined and some sort of overall charter drawn up.  Because there are so many areas now in which young people can and are being exploited it is not sufficient for a Minister to come into this House from time to time seeking a further 12 months extension of the provisions of an Act.  That is not what is needed in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While supporting the extension of the provisions of the 1977 Act one thing that strikes me about this is that the whole area of education must enter into the picture as well.  When I said a positive charter should be drawn up I was bearing in mind that we had extended the school-leaving age to 15 and we have extended the age at which people can engage in gainful employment. But I feel aggrieved that we have not geared our educational structure to deal with this very important point.  For example, let us consider the centre city areas I represent where there are a lot of schools, national schools particularly, where children finish their education possibly at 13 or 14 and are then literally hanging around for a year.  One may say that there are vocational schools, this, that and the other, but that is not sufficient, particularly in inner city areas where there is the capacity within our schools to provide such children with <Col N="813" /> further education, giving them something to work toward and to spark off their intellect.  What happens?  These children go into school and spend their time watching the clock until they are 15 years of age, when they can start to work.  I was a member of a school attendance committee which found that such children were caught regularly at work at the age of 14, when they were told: &ldquo;You must go back to school.&rdquo;  One knew in one's heart of hearts that sending them back to school would cause problems.  I know I may be extending the scope of this discussion somewhat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am prepared to allow the Deputy so long as he adheres closely to the subject matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that we investigate the root of the problem. When these children are forced back to school they cause problems in the classroom because generally they are bored; perhaps they have been in that class two years already and are utterly bored.  Of course the teachers' hands are tied.  The Department have laid down the curriculum to which the schools must adhere and, if they do not, they will be in trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Raising the school-leaving age is merely paying lip service to the problem. Mind you, we are all fairly good at paying lip service to these types of problems. But this is a problem that could be tackled quite easily and not to any great cost.  In the more affluent areas of the city, generally speaking parents have plotted what their children will do, where they will go, into what stream they will go, whether it be vocational education or whatever.  But the areas about which I am concerned and those generally we are endeavouring to protect are where the people are exploited, paid low wages. Perhaps because of their social background they can be easily exploited. We have a pressing duty to examine their problem and deal with it.  It is as simple as re-structuring the primary/ secondary educational system up to <Col N="814" /> inter-certificate or group certificate level; making it a new level, so that when children reach the age of 14 or 15 there is some sort of maintenance grant provided enabling them to remain at school.  Very often they must go to work to support the family.  Certainly in a number of schools in my area the unemployment rate among the parents of pupils is in excess of 56 per cent. Therefore, one can well understand the pressures on such parents to take their children out of school and put them in employment, even at the age of 13 or 14. That is why I am in favour of the extension of these provisions, but I am not in favour of the Minister coming along next year seeking a further extension because that would merely constitute living with the same situation none of us wants.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to refer this to the Department of Education&mdash;and I think this would be a matter for them&mdash; for consideration.  Even if it takes a number of years to carry out the re-structuring I have suggested, at least let there be a positive commitment to the training of young people, training them in areas of this city where they are in need of special incentives.</P>
    <P>We should consider having some type of allowance for children to encourage them to stay at school.  We should pay a supplementary welfare benefit to parents for children to encourage them to keep their children at school.  Because of their backgrounds the minds of many of these children are not opened early, but when they reach the age of 15 or 16, if they are still at school, a new vista of education opens up to them and they grow hungry for education and they wish to get it to get on in life.  We should consider this aspect very carefully.  In Dublin today large numbers of deprived young people are turning to vandalism, not through their own fault but because of their circumstances and the environment in which they are living.  Money spent on education is never wasted and if we have to, we should divert money from other areas into education.  The money spent over the years on education in deprived areas as compared with the money spent in other areas is very small and that shows that we have our <Col N="815" /> priorities wrong.  The rich and articulate have the money and the political muscle and are prepared to use it in order to be educated.</P>
    <P>I hope that in future we will not have to make these <i>ad hoc</i> 12-month orders to protect people who allow themselves to be exploited because they have not been educated and because of the environment in which they are living.  I hope they will be educated to see the prospects before them and to grasp them so that they will not need protection.  I agree that this type of thing should be relaxed during the summer holidays so that young people can earn pocket money or money to buy school books and dress themselves.  This would help them to adopt an independent approach at an early stage, but this should only happen in the summer.</P>
    <P>It is important to get to the source of the problem, the reasons why this type of legislation must be introduced.  Many young people want to get out of school and that is a sad reflection on the type of education we offer.  If education is imparted properly young people will respond, because in general they hunger and thirst for knowledge.  However it is sad to see this desire for knowledge stifled because the curriculum of the Department of Education is not flexible enough.  People in deprived areas need a different type of education.  We must consider the type of training and education they will need to fit them for life.  It is not desirable for young people to constantly see unemployment in the home and not experience the disciplines of a working life where older members of the family are regularly going to and from work.  Being out of touch with this type of discipline has a disastrous effect on the lives of young people.</P>
    <P>Many people have improved their living standards but the people we are trying to protect, the 14- and 15-year-old students, have not got an improvement. They are still the victims of society in a lot of ways.  Primary education was first given in order to teach people the three Rs, but now that is not enough.  We must tackle this problem intelligently and quickly by diverting money from other areas if necessary into deprived areas <Col N="816" /> because in the other areas parents are capable of paying for education.  If we do that the young people we are trying to protect here will not need to be protected because they will be equipped to deal with life and to protect themselves.</P>
    <P>A lot more could be said about exploitation. It is important that in this type of legislation we put forward positive proposals to end discrimination and exploitation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all undoubtedly in favour of extending this order.  There is no question of this order not being approved by the House.  However, we have an opportunity here, as did Deputy O'Brien, to raise the question of the relationship of education in certain parts of the country to the problems related to young people leaving school and trying to get jobs before the legal age.  What the Minister for Labour and the officials from the Department of Labour could usefully do before the end of the International Year of the Child is to take the essence of the contributions of the Fine Gael Deputies away and then come back and talk to us in real terms about a legislative programme that would take account of all categories in dealing with the last two to three years of primary education in certain areas of the community whether it is an urban area or an isolated rural district where there are similar problems of poverty and isolation.</P>
      <P>In a community such as Deputy Fergus O'Brien represents in Dublin so vigorously, for historical reasons there are in-built and hardening structural problems of unemployment which have produced a profile of 56 per cent unemployed. This will have a disastrous effect on young people striving to grow up in that area, and an even more drastic effect on young people trying to get out of it.  In many respects it is a more effective prison system than anything the Department of Justice could devise, because a young person trying to escape from that kind of an environment finds it even more difficult than someone trying to get out of Portlaoise or Mountjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree to the Minister's request to <Col N="817" /> extend this order for another 12 months, but in so doing we ask him please to recognise that the law as it stands and the relationship of the protection of young people with employment and the possibility for exploitation that exists cannot be looked at in isolation from the primary school curriculum as it operates in certain parts of the community, whether it be in a city or in rural Ireland. In order to give effect to this legislation the objectives, which most Members of this House would share, of integration of work experience, of being educated to work and of actually working as a young person for the limited hours we are talking about, must be tackled seriously by the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like to see children who work part-time in, say, Deputy O'Brien's constituency, being able to come into the schools the following week to discuss their experiences and subsequently to learn something from discussions with the teachers through a properly designed curriculum&mdash;such matters as the role of trade unions, the way PAYE operates, why the social welfare system is structured the way it is and the whole question of relationships within industry. Deputy Andrews, in opposition, had the social welfare brief for a time and he is aware of the problems.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate but I emphasise that in granting our approval to this extension we are serving formal notice on the Government to move positively to close the gaps that now exist between the law as it stands, the intentions of the House and the reality on the ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We all know the phrase &ldquo;The devil finds work for idle hands to do&rdquo;.  This motion will at least help young people to find something constructive to do during school holidays.  I know many parents who are pleased if their young children have some constructive work to do during the summer, and I am glad the order is here to allow this to continue. Young people must have an identity, a feeling that they are capable of doing something for themselves, that they are capable of earning even small wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> When children come to 14 or 15 years of age it is a great encouragement to them to be able to earn some pocket money.  I am happy to say that there are very few employers who exploit young people of that age, though there may be some.  Many employers go out of their way during the summer to make employment for young people, even if only for a couple of hours per week.  It develops a sense of responsibility in young people to realise that they can put their time to good use and return home tired in the evening instead of hanging around the house all day watching television. Of course I would confine this to holiday time because, particularly at examination periods, young people undergo severe physical and emotional stresses during school terms.  Therefore it would be bad for them if they were pushed out to work by parents after school.  The law that ensures this will not happen is very important.</P>
    <P>I suggest that communities would set up bureaux in their respective areas to try to find work for young people who could go to such centres and say the type of work they would like to do, centres which would have lists of people interested in employing young people during the summer.  There are people who devote their time to developing projects during the summer to keep young people busy and happy.  Apart from being essential, these projects are becoming more and more popular in local communities. Young people are organised in groups and brought on walks in parks and woodlands where they learn all about the trees and the flowers.  The important thing is that children will be occupied during leisure time.  They are the most vulnerable part of our society and it is up to us to ensure they are given the care and protection they need, particularly in this year of the child.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Lemass, I am pleased that the Minister is extending this legislation for another year. Employment for young people has always been a great problem, particularly in recent years, and we must appreciate the efforts that have been made to tackle it.  Any reader of Charles Dickens knows how young people suffered <Col N="819" /> in the past.  Although this legislation is not perfect, it provides a safeguard for young people.  It provides a method whereby their education, apart from formal education, can be advanced. It is important that we take steps to see that young people will not be exploited, that we encourage employment for young people which will give them an opportunity of continuing and expanding their education.  In developed countries like ours we have these safeguards but in this International Year of the Child our thoughts must go out to the millions of children in the Third World who have no such safeguards, or even sufficient food.  I mention that to show that we must take a definite course when dealing with legislation like this.</P>
      <P>In this city the corporation have many fine places where societies, clubs and organisations can help to provide employment for young people.  In AnCO young trainee apprentices are being employed on useful works.  In one instance a parochial housing society have been given a house to be turned into flats.  AnCO are arranging for the decoration and so forth that has to be done in this regard and the people employed on that are mainly young people.</P>
      <P>Sometimes in public houses I see young people employed to take drink from the bar to the tables.  I do not visit these places frequently, but I consider that we should examine this very carefully. Is that suitable employment for young people?  Many of them have to take up such jobs because of the economic circumstances of their families, but that is not the right criterion for judging the suitability of employment. Some years ago I spoke on this matter in this House and both the Minister of the day and our spokesman were perturbed about it.  We must be very strict in our application of this legislation and we must be very vigilant to ensure that young people are old enough to be employed and that the conditions and the work are suitable to them.  I suggest that bringing drinks around in public houses is not suitable employment for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> In rural areas, especially at harvest time, there is great scope for activity for young people in such occupations as picking strawberries, potatoes or other fruits and vegetables in the open air. That is good for their health and also they are remunerated.  However, I would like to see more organised labour for young people.  Teachers have enough to do nowadays without becoming involved altogether in extra-mural activities, but I appeal to parochial societies to help the teachers.  They might well be able to organise young people in work on social matters within the parish.  I do not suggest that we should infringe on the labour market in any way but certain things could be done in, say, a parish which would make the whole area so much better to live in.  There is State money for such projects and the local authorities would donate money also for this type of activity.</P>
    <P>I suggest that as much publicity as possible be given to the statement made by the Minister in introducing the motion. People are not always aware of what they are entitled to or what is available for them.  Uppermost in our minds must be the protection of young people but we must protect them by educating them so that they will become good citizens and build up their characters.  Also we must encourage employment for young people during the holidays rather than in the school period.  We send them to school so that they will be educated and therefore we must ensure that education comes first. Education can be very broad.  There is formal education at the school desks and there can be education outside that also through the provisions I have mentioned. In this legislation we have an instrument which can be of enormous benefit to young people.  The legislation imposes extensive duties on employers in regard to young people, and this is as it should be.  We must make sure that young people will not be exploited by unscrupulous employers.  Human nature being what it is, we will always have a small number of unscrupulous employers, therefore the whole weight of the State's legislative powers and powers of control must be exercised here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> At present especially, youth are being exploited by all kinds of commercial interests, not necessarily in employment. Teenagers have become the greatest spenders in our society.  Very often they are given a false set of values and being led to believe that life will be easy and that it is not necessary to work for it.  We should stress to young people that the work ethic is really worth while.  Young people are generous and they respond satisfactorily to leadership.  When we enact legislation for the protection of youth we can, without becoming complacent say that we have an instrument here to fashion a good social work ethic. The State, through parents and guardians, can fashion something really worth while for the youth of this nation. We can educate our young people, we can protect them from exploitation. Employers should be encouraged to provide employment suitable for young people.  Employers, generally speaking, are good citizens and they back this legislation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to publicise the contents of this order.  Because we allow the employment of young people in certain spheres we may become complacent and after a while this legislation may be honoured more in the breach than in the observance, and then youth will be exploited.  If we bring home to parents, guardians, teachers and employers that this is what the State means by protecting young people, we will have a better society.  In many undemocratic countries youth is being exploited by the state while in democratic countries youth is exploited to some extent by unscrupulous employers.  This State has done its best to give protection against exploitation and this measure should be publicised as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputies who contributed to the debate on this important motion which I moved on behalf of the Minister for Labour.  In his extremely worthy contribution Deputy O'Brien suggested that we should adapt our educational system to the sociological needs of particular communities and I will bring this point to the attention of the Minister.  It is a matter that should be examined by those charged with the operation of the educational system, under the guidance of the Government.  The Deputy represents parts of the inner city and would have first-hand knowledge of the problems of his area.  It is clear that there are very serious problems in the city centre area.  I am a Dubliner and proud of the fact and, being in a position of trust there are times when I feel that I let down the inner jewel of the city.  I know the area very well and have had family associations with parts of it over the years.  I will bring Deputy O'Brien's observations to the attention of the Ministers for Labour and Education.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the order is to protect young children against possible exploitation. Deputy Moore and others said that in the main employers take a very fair view of the employment of young people, but there are others who adopt a very unjust attitude and exploit young people to their own commercial benefit. Their only concern is profit.  Such people are the exception, but these things happen. It is well to put these people on notice that they will quickly find themselves before the courts if they continue to practise that form of exploitation. The order will be implemented in a thorough fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien also mentioned a children's charter and this is another idea which could be examined.  This suggestion is not original and has been made at various times in the past.  The reduction in the school-leaving age has not in all cases achieved the desired <Col N="823" /> result.  Deputy O'Brien suggests that we are paying lip service to the problems of young people who find themselves bored not only by the curriculum they must pursue but also by the environment in which they live.  Consequently the raising of the school leaving age is of no advantage to them.  The educational system should be adapted to meet the problems in particular areas, whether in the centre of cities or in rural districts.  It could be a very costly operation but human beings should make money work for them rather than let money dominate them</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the primary and group certificates was also suggested by Deputy O'Brien, together with the introduction of a new level.  I do not wish to appear critical of educators.  Many thousands of young people in primary schools are being educated by people who are second to none, and I say that from first-hand experience.  Let us not be critical of educators but rather take a constructive look at the system.  Deputy Quinn supported Deputy O'Brien in his general view of the draft order and did not see any reason why it should not be supported.  The Deputy suggested something about serving notice on the Government, but I did not quite follow what it was.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass made a positive contribution and, as a mother, she supported the idea of employment for young people which gives them a small amount of pocket money.  Some young people do not see it as pocket money.  They see it as an addition to the household budget. While I think it is important for young people to work during the school holidays, I am not very keen on the idea of young people working during school term.  Having regard to the problems faced by some families, the reality is that young people from 13 and 14 years of age have to do their bit to put bread on the table.  There is no gainsaying that.</P>
    <P>In the draft order the age at which young people can work during the school holidays is between 14 and 15 years of age.  The amounts of money they can earn are not so small any more. A young man or a young woman working in a supermarket gets quite a lot of money into his or her pocket.  Their <Col N="824" /> parents have an obligation to teach them the value of money.  Putting a lot of money suddenly into the hands of young people can be quite dangerous.  Parents have an obligation to explain the value of money to their children and in certain circumstances to encourage them to save.  That is an important part of a young person's development.  Young people should not be discouraged from working.  Work experience is part of their development.  It should not be overdone and young people should not be overworked.  That is what this draft order seeks to achieve.  They should be properly paid and the conditions in which they work should be properly monitored.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the suggestion made by Deputy Moore about safeguarding young people against exploitation. He does not agree that young people should be employed in public houses.  I agree with Deputy Moore's general premise.  Having regard to our history in relation to drink, young people should not be exposed to drink at an early age.  As the law stands, only people over 18 years can go into pubs and order drinks as I understand it.  I am subject to correction on that.</P>
    <P>The licensed vintners have been very careful about the point raised by Deputy Moore.  They do not employ young people who are under age.  The licensed vintners' organisation is an extremely responsible organisation and they would not allow any member to employ an unreasonably young person.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised the question of publicising the contents of the order.  I introduced it this morning on behalf of the Minister for Labour.  I am sure the media will take note of it and publicise it. People can read it in their newspapers and take note of what was said by Deputies.  It is as well to restate the fact that there is a legal obligation on employers to publish in their factories the contents of the order.  From the information I have received this morning I know that, under the Principal Act, the inspectors will ensure that aspect of the matter is strictly enforced.  Those are two areas of practical publicity.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the views expressed <Col N="825" /> by the House.  I assure Deputy O'Brien that his views will be brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the total capital cost of all community schools constructed to date; the date of construction of the earliest such school; the number of religious orders involved in the management of such schools; the percentage of the capital expenditure involved, envisaged in the draft deed of trust, as the responsibility of the religious orders concerned; the total financial contribution outstanding from the religious orders concerned on the basis of the percentage figure contained in the draft deed of trust; and if so, when the request for such payments has been made.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>As I have told the House on a number of occasions recently the negotiations regarding the deed of trust for community schools are still in progress.  I would not, accordingly, consider it appropriate at this stage to enter into detail in relation to specific provisions of the proposed deed, including the financial provisions.  I shall be making a full statement in this matter in due course.</P>
      <P>The total capital cost of community schools constructed to date amounts to £17.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first school building was completed in 1974.  The particulars of the religious orders involved in the management of individual schools are set out in a tabular statement, which with the permission <Col N="835" /> of the Ceann Comhairle will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of public accountability would the Minister agree that it is extraordinary that there should be incurred expenditure of some £17,500,000 without any indication to the House at this stage as to the relevant proportions to be paid by contributors and that negotiations should still be in train concerning the proportional contributions, bearing in mind that we are talking about a figure of the order of £20 million by the end of this year while this House is unaware so far of the termination of any of the negotiations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that the negotiations have been in progress for a long time, but as I have stated in my reply I hope to bring them to a conclusion in the very near future.  The other two sources of revenue that have been mentioned from the beginning are the religious orders and the vocational education committees.  We hope to be in a position to finalise the deed of trust in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the various vocational education committees have not been under any illusion as to the amounts they will be required to pay and that in regard to the other arrangements made there seems to be a great deal of unawareness, to say the least, that the Dáil Committee on Public Accounts may have very considerable views to express in relation to what can be described only as the extraordinary negotiations on the part of the Department with the interests concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that the interests concerned include the Department, the vocational education committees and individual religious orders.  I do not think there is any illusion about the amounts of money involved either from the point of view of the vocational education committees or of the religious orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the clear arrangements that were entered into by the parties concerned is there any possibility of getting the money <Col N="837" /> from them in consideration of the finality of the deed of trust?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to get the money from the interests concerned.  Some of the schools are functioning and I am sure the Deputy will agree when I say that the venture is well worth while.  I am convinced that a suitable arrangement both in terms of finance and of the other provisions concerned in relation to the deed of trust will be reached in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Has any proportion of the capital expenditure to be met by the religious orders been published by or on behalf of the Department or is the information being kept strictly secret between all the parties concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to be discourteous to the Deputy or to the House I repeat that I would not consider it appropriate at this final stage in the negotiations to mention either financial or other provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of the Minister not being able to give this information to the House would he agree that it should not be communicated to anyone else before it is possible to give it to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There might be a problem in that regard in that the House might be in recess when the announcement can be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that possibility, but my point is that the information should not be given to anybody else before it is given to the House, assuming the House is in session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if a report on the urban archaeology study on areas of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Wexford: (a) has <Col N="838" /> been furnished to the relevant local authorities for use in respect of planning applications, (b) is available to any persons wishing to develop property in the areas in question in a manner which might be damaging to the archaeological sites there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney) Jim Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Tunney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The joint study on urban archaeology has not been completed and a report has not yet been furnished.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the relevant local authorities have sufficient information to enable them to prevent any developments which could be potentially damaging to archaeological remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that on a previous occasion he stated that a survey had been completed in so far as parts of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Wexford are concerned, and in those circumstances would he not consider it useful to communicate the results of that survey to the local authorities in the areas in question so as to ensure that they have as much information as possible to enable them to avoid any development which is inimical to the interest of archaeology?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that in respect of the information that is available, much of it would not be available were it not for the co-operation and the interest of the local authorities and other agencies in the areas concerned.  I am satisfied that there will not be any damage in the areas to which the Deputy refers of a kind that he and I am sure everybody else wish to have avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is presumably not prepared to authorise publication of an interim report by this study group, would he indicate when he expects the report of the body in question to be completed?  Has he reconsidered the position and can he now say if it will be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret having to do this but I would remind the Deputy of the terms of reference he prepared for this <Col N="839" /> study group and say how important it is that it was not indicated to them that reports should be prepared with any expedition whatever.  Notwithstanding that, I appreciate that the concern of the Deputy, my concern, and the concern of the House is that no damage is done. That is my primary concern.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that in respect of the preparation of reports it requires the availability of personnel, who unfortunately are limited in availability and who unfortunately are occupied on excavation at the moment which is also considered very important.  In respect of the question which the Deputy has about Wood Quay I would consider the advisability of seeking an interim report there as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister has, by his implied criticism of me, indicated that he believes there should be expedition in the completion of this report, now that he has been in office for the last two years will he consider altering the terms of reference to improve them in the way that he considers they are lacking in their original drafting?  If so, when will he do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that from the Deputy.  I want to assure him that I have already expressed regret that more work has not been done on this.  I am sure the Deputy also appreciates that it is not work that can be carried out by people who are not qualified to do it.  The availability of such qualified people is, regrettably, rather limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <P>A report on the archaeological excavation carried out at the High Street site in Dublin by the National Museum has not been published.  Finds of archaeological objects have been reported in accordance with the terms of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 and 1954.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it satisfactory that an excavation has been carried out with public funds by a public body, the National Museum, at considerable expense and that a report of that excavation has not been published in view of the fact that a large part of the value of an archaeological excavation is derived from the publication of the results?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is very mindful of the fact that the officer who carried out that report is also a key officer in the excavations which are taking place at the moment and, regrettably, he has not been free to make the report.  On the other hand, one can take some consolation from the fact that the finds are there and that the information is there from which the report can be prepared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that in this area there is the concern <Col N="843" /> that most academics have in respect of what they do themselves. Apart from that, ideally I believe the person who carried out the excavation should be the person who prepares the report.  I hope the officer in question will be freed from other duties so that the report, which the Deputy wishes that we have and which I wish to have, will be made available.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that practically all of the areas the Minister has mentioned are areas in which actual archaeological excavation is taking place anyway and that to carry out a survey in such an area is not doing anything extra?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Last evening the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy put out a statement which is only the latest chapter in an obscure little story which began as far as the public are concerned on 17 April last when <i>The Irish Times</i> under the following heading &ldquo;Fish for Oil Deal by Lenihan with Norway&rdquo; reported that the Government were offering Norway fishing facilities in exchange for a stake for Ireland's Aran oil company in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.  They said that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy Lenihan, was understood to have suggested in an exchange of letters with his Norwegian counterpart&mdash;note the circumstantiality of that&mdash;that Ireland was prepared to allow Norwegian fishing vessels to register under the Irish flag as part of such a deal.</P>
      <P>On 23 April <i>The Irish Times</i> printed in a very different context part of a four-day marathon interview which their Olivia O'Leary conducted, apparently running between cumann meetings, the Dáil, his office and half way across the country and back, with the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  She mentioned that a row had brewed up about this story and quotes the Minister as reacting as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Ryan had the information for a week,&rdquo; said Lenihan referring to Liam Ryan of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, who broke the story.  &ldquo;He tried to get at me but Dunlop fought him off over in the GIS and Neeson fought him off upstairs here.  But it is just as well that it got out in the end&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The day I saw the first report I put down a question to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy.  It was reached on 2 May about ten days after the Olivia O'Leary interview.  In the course of the answer to the main question the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contacts which have taken place with Norwegian authorities concerning an application by an Irish company for an interest in a petroleum exploration licence offshore Norway have indicated that there appears to <Col N="852" /> be scope for co-operation which could be of interest to Norway and, from the point of view of access to oil supplies, to Ireland.  These contacts can best be described as being of a preliminary nature.</P>
    <P>He was pressed in regard to whether fish figured in these discussions and he said:</P>
    <P>I am not aware that one of my colleagues made that reference but in the course of our discussions with the Norwegian authorities the question of fish was discussed.</P>
    <P>I asked:</P>
    <P>Has the question of fishing boats been discussed in this setting as well?</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Malley: Yes.</P>
    <P>On 31 May I was in this House when the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry was answering questions from my colleague, Deputy Deasy.  In connection with fish stocks in the North Sea, I asked if there was any truth in the reports which attributed some part to himself in the negotiations and approaches between our Government and Norwegians in regard to the possible exchange of an admission to our fishing waters in return for a stake in the Norwegian oil fields.  I asked if the Minister had had no hand, act or part in those negotiations.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>I engaged in no negotiations in Oslo or Dublin or anywhere else, in regard to the matter mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Knowing the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry as most Members do, I repeated myself to get a simpler and straighter answer.  I asked him again about the exchange of access to fishing waters for oil and he said:</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no question of that.  I cannot be more emphatic than that.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that at all events he would be totally opposed to any such thing if it were ever suggested but it never had been.</P>
    <P>On 12 June I asked what was the present status of the negotiations with Norwegian interests.  The Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy referred  <Col N="853" /> me to the reply he had given on 2 May and indicated that contacts of a preliminary nature had taken place with Norwegian authorities and said:</P>
    <P>There have been no developments in the matter since then.</P>
    <P>I ask the house to judge how candid a reply that was when one week later it emerges, not spontaneously but because some journalist was intelligent enough to look closely at the accounts of a private company, that he had agreed with that company to take up, if he opted to do so, 51 per cent of a private enterprise in the event that the Norwegian Government give that private enterprise access to the Norwegian oil field.  That was the first time that was mentioned.  It was not spontaneously offered by the Minister any more than from first to last he made a spontaneous statement about this matter. All the information, and it is meagre enough, was extracted from him by dint of questioning.  The first information was extracted only through a leak and even that they tried to sit on as the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in an unguarded, but very characteristic, moment disclosed to Miss O'Leary.</P>
    <P>A week later the Minister said in this House that there had not been any development since 2 May but we find they agreed to take up a 51 per cent interest in that private enterprise.  Not only have they agreed to do so, but evidently that agreement was at all times there because the Minister said in his statement last night that the Government agreed to lend their support in connection with this application, the 51 per cent deal obviously being part of this, and following the agreement official representations were made to the appropriate authorities.  We are only now hearing about this.  What is the reason for this obsessive secrecy?</P>
    <P>The sequence of events appears to have been as follows.  First, an agreement between the Minister and Aran Energy Limited and, second, a joint approach to the Norwegians in which fish and fishing boats unquestionably were part of the deal.  A fortnight after the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry had denied that he had any hand, act or part <Col N="854" /> in the negotiations, on June 12, I asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in which Department these contacts originated.  He said:</P>
    <P>In my Department and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>If fish was not part of the deal why would the Department of Fisheries and Forestry be involved?  Why would anybody gratuitously bring the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry into any deal in which his presence was not officially a necessity?  I do not know why the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry should be so shy about disclosing that he and his Department unquestionably played a part in these negotiations.  I cannot guess the reason for that diffidence and lack of frankness.</P>
    <P>It is disingenuous and less than frank of the Minister to have answered a question as recently as Tuesday of last week and not to have disclosed that this arrangement with the Aran company has been made.  Any agreement which we can get with the Norwegians or anybody else which will guarantee a stable oil supply for this country is something that will have the unqualified support of this party and the same, I am sure, can be said about the Labour Party, but it is a pity that our first real chance of an independent oil supply should be characterised by this lack of frankness, candour and downright evasiveness.  I cannot see why there was this diffidence and why two members of the Government should be in conflict about the part played by one of them in this chapter.</P>
    <P>If that were all that were to it there would be no special need to say more except that it was a mysterious piece of obscurity. But there are two other factors I have to mention to the House.  One of them bears on the national oil corporation which is a venture which the Minister has floated more than once.  He has mentioned, both in the House and outside it at favourable conjunctures for himself, that he hoped to see a national oil corporation established.  On the last occasion when he mentioned it he even went so far as to say that he expected to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> private company and give it a statutory basis later in the year.</P>
    <P>Again, if there is a real role for an <Col N="855" /> Irish national oil corporation and if it is not going to become simply another featherbed and another means of employing people behind desks and not, in the end, getting any expertise in the oil business which is what we are lamentably short of and if it will have access to real advice&mdash;and I mean instructed expert advice and not the sort of advice which the Minister has been getting for the last few months from people who are extremely competent in their own field but are simply out of their depth in the oil world&mdash;then by all means let us have a national oil company.  But if we are going to have a nationalised state body bearing a title like that I would like to be told&mdash;and it is not the first time I have asked this question&mdash;why can this oil corporation not have a role to play in this Norwegian possibility?</P>
    <P>I agree that corporations are as varied as people; we can have a corporation which has hardware and which carries on exploration and exploitation itself; we can have a distributing corporation; we can have a corporation which is merely a holding a company and so on.  The Minister has been vague about what he has in mind in regard to a role for this corporation.  Among other things I am inclined to suspect that the name itself is just a pretty toy which will provide an easy headline on a slack day, merely a toy like the Industrial Development Consortium which does not have an address or a telephone number, let alone a staff or a budget, or like the Employment Action Team which has been disbanded. It would not surprise me if the national oil corporation goes the same way because I am not yet convinced that there is a role for it.  But if there is a role for it I want to know why the first serious enterprise of an independent kind which has ever been available to this State in the energy or oil fields should be evidently denied to this national oil corporation. Why is it that if we are going to have a national oil corporation the one thing it is not going to be allowed put its nose into is this Norwegian possibility? Surely this is, above all, the kind of thing it should get into and surely it should have a role there which need not be complicated by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> The Minister knows that I am not a doctrinaire socialist and that no one else in this party is either.  I am all for giving private enterprise its head where it will work.  I am not in favour of subsidising private enterprise at the expense of the national asset.  That is the reason why, when this oil story first broke, my first query was: what do the Government think they are about in handing out a national asset in the shape of access to fishing waters and fishing stocks in return for a benefit of which the prime recipient, the prime beneficiary is going to be Aran Energy and the gentlemen with money and expectations in that company?  That was the prime question I was interested in to which I have not yet received an answer.  It is curious that when we have, for the first time, a smell of a chance to have an oil supply of our own it is not the national oil corporation&mdash;which has been floated for an easy headline&mdash;which is envisaged as being the company to exploit it but a private company in which the State is taking a share for the purpose at least of this particular operation.</P>
    <P>What kind of a private company is it? This is the note I want to end on and I am sure the Minister will be clicking his tongue at me for being so unworthy as to say things like this.  This is not just any old company at all.  Aran Energy&mdash;and there is no use in trying to blot it out&mdash;has got very substantial associations with the Fianna Fáil Party.  I am not trying to allege that it is not possible to be as honest as the day is long and still be a member of or a supporter of or a contributor to or a hatchet man for the Fianna Fáil Party.  It is possible. Those two things do not by any means exclude one another.  I am making no allegations or insinuations of any kind and I do not want the Minister to suppose that I am.  But when we find the State acquiring 51 per cent of the shares of this enterprise&mdash;and all they have got so far is an option to acquire and we are not told what the agreed price will be or what the terms are on which the acquisition is going to take place, and even if the Minister gives us some information now I am not going to regard it as satisfactory because I cannot reply after he sits down&mdash;and agreeing and binding <Col N="857" /> themselves in certain events where the Norwegians, I suppose, will give a licence, to take up 51 per cent of this enterprise at an undisclosed price and on otherwise undisclosed conditions one has to look a bit more closely at the people who are involved.  The people involved in Aran Energy are not all of the Fianna Fáil colour and the Minister can save himself the time of trotting out the names of people who are of my political colour because I know there are a couple of them in it, too.</P>

They are Senators Eoin Ryan, Desmond Hanafin and Richard Conroy. These three gentlemen are beneficially interested in this company.  Moreover, Senator Hanafin is the head of the Fianna Fáil fund-raising operation and he presides, as far as I know, during working hours in the Burlington Hotel and takes in&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My reference to these gentlemen and their company is not intended  <Col N="858" /> as an insinuation and in case that might be taken as damning them as being an insufficient qualification, I want to say positively that I have not one shred of evidence to support an insinuation or allegation of any kind at all in regard to any of them or in regard to their enterprise.  What I do say is that by itself alone the mere fact that these gentlemen, in particular Senator Hanafin, are associated with this company requires from the Government in this whole matter a quite special degree of frankness and a quite special degree of candour and what has been forthcoming from the Government from first to last in this affair, which began two months ago, is the opposite of frankness and the opposite of candour.  So, all I have to say is that though everybody connected with this deal may be as honest as the day is long and there may be nobody connected with it, whether in the company or in the Government or anywhere else, whose primary interest is not the welfare of the people and the delivery of a stable oil company it is a pity, and it is a sign of the kind of mí-ádh that is on this country, that when we get the smell of an independent stable oil supply we are not allowed to exploit it without finding ourselves up to our knees in Fianna Fáil hatchet men.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer first of all to the points that I wanted to make and then I will come back to that last scurrilous attack that has been made in typical fashion by Deputy Kelly saying that he is not making accusations or charges but at the same time nailing them on to the record of this House to be taken by the Press Gallery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Response to the difficulties in the energy sector which are now at worldwide proportions must embrace different time scales and the arrangements which were concluded with Aran Energy are primarily of potential long term significance.  The arrangements agreed with the company were set out in a simple exchange of letters.  The essential features of the arrangement are <Col N="859" /> described in the official announcement issued yesterday.  If a licence were granted by the Norwegian authorities, the Irish State would be entitled to hold up to 51 per cent of the shares of the company holding the licence and would be entitled to exercise all voting and other rights appropriate to such a level of shareholding.  The ownership of hydrocarbons accruing to each party from any discovery in the licensed area would be in proportion to that party's percentage interest in the licensee company. The Minister would have the right to require that all the available crude should be refined and marketed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It was clearly understood by the parties that the arrangements were in the form of an entitlement or option and that a review by the Government would be necessary if a further decision arose. There was, therefore, no firm commitment to proceed with the venture but, of course, if prospective territory were allocated under satisfactory terms then it would, in the Minister's opinion, be in the interests of the Government to conclude a formal agreement and to proceed with the venture.</P>
    <P>The Norwegian Continental Shelf area has proved to be a very prolific producer of oil and the blocks on offer in the fourth round of licensing were particularly attractive.  The intense interest of oil companies, in many cases strongly supported by their Governments, in securing access to these blocks, was evidence of the belief that the acreage is highly prospective.  In the circumstances, it was understandable that the applicant company should look to the Government for support, and it was equally understandable that the Government should be interested in the prospect that a successful outcome to the application could give us access to production of oil at competitive prices from an area which is very stable in both political and economic terms.  If a commercial find were made in acreage licensed to the company, development of the deposit would undoubtedly take a number of years, but even a modest share of the total production from such a find would be of enormous value to this country. <Col N="860" /> The agreement reached with the company, in return for such support as the Government were in a position to afford, was an attractive one in that it did not involve any immediate commitment of public funds but, nevertheless, would enable the Government, if they decided that the option to participate should be exercised, to reserve all the available oil for the Irish market.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister has expressed the view that the current energy situation imposes upon us an obligation to break out of the mould which at present exists for almost all our oil supplies.  It is no longer acceptable anywhere&mdash;and we should not continue to accept the position&mdash;that control over almost the totality of such an important commodity should rest with commercial interests over which we have little control.  It is, therefore, important that the Government should explore every possibility of achieving greater freedom of action in the matter of security of our future oil supplies.  This thinking lies behind the decision to set up a limited company to examine what can be done to improve our position in the shorter-term and it was this thinking which underlay the arrangement concluded with Aran Energy Ltd.  Unless we are prepared to take initiatives of a kind which would not in the past have been contemplated, our ability to cope with the deepening energy crisis over the next few years will be inhibited to an extent which the Government are not prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question as to why it was not undertaken by the national oil corporation I should like to state that at the time of the original application to the Norwegians we did not have a State entity which could have applied for a licence or which could have satisfied the Norwegian authority that they were competent to hold a licence.  The only application from an Irish interest was that submitted by Aran Energy.  The State oil company are primarily intended to deal with supply problems.  If the Government should decide to seek exploration rights abroad in their own right then it seems unlikely that this would be feasible until a statutory corporation <Col N="861" /> was set up and fully operational. However, if the Government were to decide to exercise the option with Aran it would be the Minister's intention that the national oil corporation would look after the State's interests.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly made some scurrilous remarks about the various directors of the company.  I do not have any knowledge of the directors or shareholders of the company.  I do not know whether some of the people he mentioned are directors or not but I take his point.  Thankfully, we live in a democracy and surely membership of any political party by any man or woman should not be an inhibiting factor with regard to the carrying on of legitimate business.  Surely, we should be encouraging our people to become involved in political parties.  The Deputy, not so graciously, admitted that some of the directors of this organisation are members of his party.  However, the scurrilous way he threw in the suggestion that there was some form of underhand deals and said at the same time that he was not making such a suggestion was an appalling performance.</P>
    <P>There was a question about the fishing situation.  The Norwegians are aware of the value of their off-shore <Col N="862" /> blocks being licensed under the fourth round.  One of the blocks was referred to as &ldquo;gold block&rdquo;.  From recent press reports the early drilling results from that block would seem to verify the accuracy of that label.  Understandably, the Norwegian Government are not prepared to allocate these blocks without assessing in detail the strengths and weaknesses of each applicant and the benefits such an applicant will bring to the Norwegian economy.  In particular, the authorities were interested in discussing possible development projects with various applicants.  In our representations to the Norwegians we discussed possible projects in the fishery area where the Norwegians have a proven technological excellence.  Those discussions did not involve examination in any depth of any specific project.  We have an awareness by the Government that there are energy problems facing us if we are to meet our social and economic goals in future years.  The Government are conscious of this and are fighting to see that our energy needs will be met in a proper manner.</P>
