      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Bill deals in a comprehensive way with certain areas of housing policy.  I propose to give Deputies a broad outline only of its provisions and intentions without dwelling in too much detail on what are essentially drafting technicalities.  Detailed information about the Bill is set out in the explanatory memorandum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the Bill is largely a validating measure relating to changes made since 1972 in the schemes of financial assistance in the form of housing <Col N="1105" /> grants, subsidies and loans under the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970.  Particulars of these changes and of the retrospective dates involved are set out in the explanatory memorandum.  An important point is that I have availed of this opportunity to include provisions in the Bill which will facilitate the making of such changes in the future as may be considered appropriate in these schemes of financial assistance without the need for special legislation to validate every change.  The Bill also contains provisions to strengthen the present statutory basis for the control of the prices of certain new private houses and flats.  It will provide for a new optional arrangement for pre-sale structural works to local authority houses and will enable certain land now vested in the Minister for Health to be transferred, principally for housing purposes.  The Bill will give more flexibility to housing authorities in allocating their houses and empower the Minister for the Environment to direct a housing authority to sell, or not to sell, houses of a specified class.  It will also provide for changes of a technical nature required in existing housing and building legislation.</P>
    <P>I propose, for the convenience of Deputies, to deal briefly with the Bill, section by section, where possible.  Section 1 is the interpretation section.  Sections 2 to 7 relate to capital grants.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 2, Deputies are aware that a pilot exercise in the devolution of the administration of the new house grant scheme to housing authorities was initiated in County Meath on 14 May 1973.  In Counties Longford and Westmeath, similar exercises were undertaken in respect of the schemes of grants for reconstruction work and the installation of private water and sewerage facilities in individual houses, with effect from 1 August 1973.  These arrangements were terminated on the introduction of the new State grants schemes in respect of new houses and house improvements with effect from 6 July 1977, and 1 November 1977, respectively, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of administration. Section 2 of the Bill <Col N="1106" /> provides for validation of these devolved arrangements and generally provides also a statutory basis for the possible future devolution by the Minister of the administration of housing grant schemes if the circumstances so warrant.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will authorise the Minister to make a grant towards the administration and general expenses of an approved body which represents, or promotes the formation of, co-operative housing groups or voluntary associations. This is a form of activity which I would wish to see developing.  My Department's role is, however, of necessity, primarily a co-ordinating one and the success of non-profit housing depends largely on the dedication and initiative of the groups or associations involved. One body which has been to the forefront in fostering the concept of co-operation in the provision of housing, with consequent savings in construction and other costs and, indeed, which has been mainly responsible for the supervision and expansion of co-operative housing activity in recent years is the National Association of Building Co-operatives which was established in 1970.  The Government are anxious that NABCo be given every encouragement and have accordingly approved a grant towards their administrative and general expenses in 1979.  Incidentally, section 7 refers to grants payable to individual voluntary housing associations and I will touch on this aspect later.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 6 replace sections 15, 16, 18 and 21 to 32 of the Housing Act, 1966&mdash;as amended by sections 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11 and 14 of the Housing Act, 1970&mdash;and sections 2 and 3 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962.  In other words, three sections of the Bill will replace 25 sections in existing legislation.  The grant provisions of the Housing Acts, 1966 to 1970, are inflexible in that the amounts of grants payable, floor area limits and other detailed qualifying conditions are specified by the Acts so that changes which were found to be desirable from time to time in grant schemes required amending legislation.  This situation has proved to be unduly rigid in the light of the frequency of these changes.  To meet <Col N="1107" /> this situation, sections 4 to 6 of the Bill have been drafted on the basis that a broad general power is conferred on the Minister or a housing authority to pay a grant for specified purposes, subject to such regulations as may be made by the Minister for the purposes of the section concerned.  It is intended to make regulations governing the principal features of the grants.  The proposed regulatory powers will be broadly in line with similar provisions in the 1962, 1966 and 1970 Acts, but modified to take account of changes made administratively since 1972 in anticipation of amending legislation. It is envisaged that future changes in grant schemes will be made by regulations under these sections.  In accordance with section 5 of the 1966 Act, every regulation made under the Bill will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and it may be annulled by resolution of either House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides a statutory basis for new house grants payable by the Minister.  Subsection (2) outlines the aspects of a grant scheme which may be incorporated in regulations and varied subsequently.  Subsection (3) enables the Minister to lay down technical standards. Subsection (4) provides for certain cases of hardship.  Between July 1977, when I introduced the £1,000 new house grant scheme for first-time owners-occupiers, and the end of May 1979, 17,389 grants were approved and 9,874 grants paid&mdash;4,674 grants were approved under the old scheme during the year ended 30 June 1977.</P>
    <P>Section 5, which deals with house improvement grants payable by the Minister, broadly follows the same approach as section 4.  With hindsight, it is somewhat tortuous to spell out in legislation separate detailed provisions relating to ordinary reconstruction grants, further grants, essential repair grants, improvement grants payable to housing authorities, water and sewerage grants, and so on.  In the Bill, I have described a wide range of grants as house improvement grants and my aim is to simplify still further this grant scheme in the future.  Section 1 contains a definition of &ldquo;improvement works&rdquo;, which is based <Col N="1108" /> on the definition of &ldquo;reconstruction&rdquo; in section 21 of the 1966 Act.  Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the explanatory memorandum set out details of the grant changes made since 1972.  Incidentally, section 5 (1) will enable the Minister to pay a grant to a housing authority for improvement works to their rented houses; this replaces section 24 of the 1966 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill will enable a housing authority to pay a grant to a person providing a new house and to pay a grant or make other assistance to a person carrying out improvement works to a house, subject to such regulations as may be made.  The Minister may also contribute to the expenses incurred by a housing authority in this regard. Section 6 validates the payment of grants by the authorities and the making of contributions by the Minister since 1 February 1972 in respect of improvement works to a house for the accommodation of physically disabled persons. This worthwhile scheme was extended to include severely mentally handicapped persons from 1 July 1975 and I increased the amounts of financial assistance substantially from 1 November 1977.  Deputies are, of course, aware that, with the exception of the special scheme to which I have just referred and certain transitional cases, grants or supplementary housing grants are not generally payable by housing authorities since 1977.  Section 6 is, therefore, mainly an enabling provision to cater for any schemes which might be considered appropriate in the future.</P>
    <P>Another important scheme provided for in the Bill is the making of grants to approved bodies providing housing and caretaker accommodation for elderly persons.  Deputies will recall that, in April 1978 I announced details of a package of financial assistance in this type of case, comprising grants, loans and annual subsidies.  An improved package of assistance was announced on 1 February 1979.  Section 7 of the Bill will empower the Minister to pay grants to bodies approved under the scheme, subject to such regulations as may be made.  This section replaces section 19 of the 1966 Act.  Loans and subsidies under the package are payable under section 12 of the 1966 Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1109" /> Section 8 deals with house improvement loans.  It replaces section 40 of the 1966 Act and section 4 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962.  Generally, section 8 will enable a housing authority to make a secured or an unsecured loan to a person carrying out improvement works to a house, subject to such regulations as may be made. In this way, the maximum unsecured loan, which is being increased from £200 to £600, may be varied with less administrative difficulty in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will enable the Minister to pay a subsidy to housing authorities towards the annual loan charges incurred by them in providing sites for private housing, subject to such regulations as may be made.  One section largely replaces a corresponding provision in section 44 of the 1966 Act, but the new section is less restrictive as regards the amount of the subsidy.  I have taken steps to increase the supply of serviced land by increasing substantially the allocation for sanitary services this year and I asked local authorities last August to consider the development of part of their land reserves with a view to making sites available for private housing, particularly as an incentive to tenants or prospective tenants of their houses to secure their own accommodation.  To stimulate this activity, I increased the site subsidy available.  This scheme is an important element in the attempts being made to curb increases in house prices.</P>
    <P>Subsections (1) and (7) of section 10 validate the subsidy system which applied in the period from 1 April 1973 to 31 December 1976, under which most of the loss on local authority housing provided for letting was transferred on a phased basis to the Exchequer.  Up to 31 March 1973 the payment of housing subsidy to local authorities was governed by section 44 of the 1966 Act, which is being repealed.  Since 1 January 1977 the loan charges incurred by housing authorities on the provision of houses for letting are generally met in full by the Exchequer.  Section 10 (2) provides for the payment of subsidy in accordance with the arrangements in operation since then, subject to such <Col N="1110" /> regulations as may be made.  Under section 10 (5), subsidy payments can be made either to the housing authority or directly to the agency from which the loans were obtained.  Subsection (6) contains a provision whereby, in the case of moneys borrowed from the Commissioners of Public Works, subsidy can also be effected by writing off moneys owed to the Commissioners by housing authorities.  This would give rise to some savings in administrative costs, but unfortunately, it is not feasible to introduce this change just yet.  If the change is made in a few years' time, it is intended that the amount written off should be clearly identifiable in the Estimates and in the Appropriation Accounts for my Department and that the Minister should be answerable in the Dáil for the sum involved in the normal way.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill will provide a statutory basis for what is known as the low-rise mortgage scheme, which was introduced on 22 November 1976. Recently, I modified the scheme so as to enable certain two-person families, comprising one parent and one child, to qualify.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides statutory authority for the payment by the Minister of an interest subsidy from 1 June 1977 on certain house purchase loans made by a building society and guaranteed by a housing authority under section 42 of the 1966 Act.  The loans were made during the period 1969 to 1972 to householders, mainly in the Donaghmede, Finglas, Kilbarrack, Kimmage and Tallaght areas of Dublin who qualified for the normal local authority house purchase loan at a fixed interest rate of 9 per cent from Dublin Corporation and from Dublin County Council. The societies charged the normal variable mortgage rates, and the effect of section 12 is to enable the Minister to subsidise the mortgage interest rates, thereby confining the interest rate charged to a flat 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the carrying out of pre-sale works to local authority rented houses prior to their sale to tenants. Section 106 of the 1966 Act requires a housing authority to put a house into good structural condition before the house is sold to the tenant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> I have been concerned that delays in having such pre-sale works completed were holding up the completion of the purchase by tenants.  Accordingly, in order to expedite the completion of the arrangements for the purchase of local authority houses, a new optional procedure is being introduced under section 13 whereby the authority and the tenant may agree on the nature, extent and cost of the works necessary to put the house into good structural condition; and the tenant may, within a specified period, carry out the works directly or arrange to have them carried out.  The authority would pay the tenant the agreed cost of the works on their satisfactory completion.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is an optional procedure.  In the absence of an agreement, the original arrangement whereby the works are carried out by the housing authority will apply.  The section also provides for statutory rights of appeal to the Minister under both the optional arrangements and the present arrangement.</P>
    <P>Section 14 extends the general power in section 5 of the 1966 Act to make regulations by enabling them to be applied either generally or to specified classes of areas, houses, loans, persons, works or other matters.  The section also largely replaces section 14 of the 1966 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 15 validates rates relief given before 1 January 1978, arising from the introduction of improvement grants in respect of houses occupied by physically disabled and severely mentally handicapped persons in 1972 and 1975, respectively, and provides for rates relief consequent on the restriction of new house grants between January 1976 and 6 July 1977.</P>
    <P>Section 60 (8) of the 1966 Act requires a housing authority, in determining the order of priority to be followed in letting local authority houses in accordance with their approved scheme of letting priorities to obtain and have regard to a report from their chief medical officer. The Health Act, 1970, transferred to health boards functions under the Health Acts previously exercised by local authorities.  Since then, there has <Col N="1112" /> been a difference of opinion as to whether the existing provisions under the 1966 Act are still satisfactory.  Delays have arisen in certain areas due to increases in the work loads of health boards.</P>
    <P>Some housing authorities, however, consider that it is still desirable to have the advice of a medical officer of health of a health board for the purpose of letting houses and that, in that event, the authority should be required to have regard to the advice.  Deputies will, no doubt, agree that in many cases, the staff of housing authorities could perform these duties.  I am anxious, therefore, to provide a proper statutory basis for flexibility in the arrangements for the letting of local authority houses where this is found to be desirable.  Accordingly, section 16 of the Bill provides that a housing authority may exercise a discretion as to whether they should obtain a report from a medical officer of health of the health board.  Where, however, such a report is obtained, the authority must have regard to it.</P>
    <P>At present, a housing authority have discretion under section 90 of the 1966 Act as to the sale of any of their houses. I want to ensure, however, that special, purpose-built houses which would normally be unsuitable for family use&mdash;one example would be elderly person's houses&mdash;are not lost from the rented local authority housing stock.  On the other hand, I should like to make sure that most local authority tenants will be afforded an opportunity of purchasing their houses.  Towards this end, section 17 of the Bill enables the Minister to direct an authority to offer for sale, or not to sell, as the case may be, houses of specified classes.</P>
    <P>Section 18 deals with new house prices.  The provisions are complex and their implications could be far-reaching.  I should like, therefore, to speak about this section in some detail.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is a need for a satisfactory framework for the operation of controls on the prices of new houses.  I think this view is shared by the main political parties, on the basis of debates on this general issue in both Houses of the Oireachtas during the past <Col N="1113" /> few years.  I understand that many builders also accept in principle the need for some form of house price control.</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I do not envisage that the form of house price control which is implemented following the enactment of the Bill will remain unaltered indefinitely.  A flexible approach must be adopted and controls adjusted, in consultation with interested bodies, to take account of changing circumstances. Indeed, it is conceivable that the controls could be dismantled from time to time.</P>
    <P>Section 18 replaces section 35 (2) of the 1966 Act, under which the system of certifying reasonable value in respect of the prices of new houses and flats has operated up to now.  I think, however, it is generally agreed that it no longer provides an adequate statutory framework for the operation of this form of control on house prices.  Initially, the Minister simply refused a grant for a house where the consideration being charged exceeded the amount appearing to him to represent reasonable value.</P>
    <P>Though this may have been a compelling reason for house builders to obtain and adhere to the terms of certificates of reasonable value (or CRVs, as they are commonly referred to) at the time of their introduction in 1973, when practically all grants for speculatively-built houses were paid to the builders, it is certainly not the case since January 1976, when grants have been payable only to occupants of the houses concerned, not to the builders.  At present a builder, having obtained a CRV and committed a purchaser on the strength of it, has no further direct financial incentive to ensure that the terms of the CRV are adhered to and, should any unauthorised departures come to light, it is the purchaser who may suffer to the extent of losing the £1,000 grant, stamp duty exemption and, possibly, since August last, a house-purchase loan.</P>
    <P>It is evident to me that the volume of abuses and circumvention of the CRV system has grown since 1976 and it is incumbent on me to bring before the House proposals to counteract these tendencies.  These abuses have been highlighted by Deputies on a number of <Col N="1114" /> occasions in the House, in the media and in the numerous complaints made to my Department by aggrieved house purchasers.  I should like to give some examples of the type of abuse which the new provisions are designed to combat.</P>
    <P>Builders have been known to charge prices far in excess of the CRV price while at the same time telling purchasers that they had a CRV and that there would be no problem about the grant or the stamp duty exemption.  Cases have come to light of extra money being charged &ldquo;under the counter&rdquo;, of circumvention by means of departures from price variation clauses and of charging extra for items already included in the approved CRV price.  It has also been alleged that contracts are being drawn up under which the sale terms purport to comply with the terms of CRVs when in reality they do not. Another unpalatable aspect of the present situation is that builders who are prepared to abide by the spirit and letter of the system can be put at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> less scrupulous competitors.</P>
    <P>Broadly, section 18 has two main purposes: first, to empower the Minister to require that certain loans by lending agencies for the purchase of new houses cannot be made unless a CRV is obtained; and second, to impose clear obligations on builders in relation to the construction and sale of houses for which they have obtained a CRV and to enable the Minister to take effective action against those who fail to fulfil these obligations.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) gives effect to the first purpose.  I should emphasise that this subsection is an enabling provision which will apply to such categories of loans and for such periods as the Minister may by regulations provide, having regard principally to trends in house prices, costs and earnings, the availability of mortgage finance and the national housing programme.  It is not intended that this requirement should apply to short-term borrowing, such as bridging finance; hence, the definition of &ldquo;loan&rdquo; in subsection (14).</P>
    <P>The remainder of the section deals with the second purpose I have just mentioned <Col N="1115" /> as well as making general provisions relating to the issue of CRVs.  The broad concept of reasonable value as enshrined in the 1966 Act is not being changed in any material way nor does the new measure imply any fundamental innovation in the approach to the determination of what constitutes reasonable value.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) imposes an obligation on a builder to ensure that a house is contructed in accordance with his application for a CRV and that the price charged is in accordance with the terms of the CRV.  It also obliges the purchaser to see that where a CRV exists, and he enjoys the attendant benefits, the price paid accords with the CRV.  This should thus deter any possible collusion between builder and purchaser in order to circumvent the CRV requirements.</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) comprises an important provision which will enable the Minister at his discretion to refuse, for a period not exceeding five years, to consider any further application for a CRV from any person who has previously obtained a CRV and has either supplied false or misleading information or failed to fulfil requirements under section 18.  Before exercising this power the Minister will be required to notify the person concerned of his intention to do so, giving his reasons, and give him an opportunity of making representations in the matter.  Furthermore, any person so affected has a right of appeal to the High Court against the Minister's decision.  I consider that this power will constitute an effective deterrent against abuses of the type to which I referred earlier.  I envisage that the power will be invoked in exceptional circumstances only.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for offences under subsections (2), (5), (6), (9), (10) and (11).  Subsection (12) provides a defence relating to proceedings for an offence. Provision is being made also for an appeal to the High Court against the Minister's opinion under subsection (14).</P>
    <P>To sum up, I think that section 18 will provide a comprehensive statutory framework for the operation of a form of control on the prices of new houses and flats which benefit from State funds or <Col N="1116" /> which are financed by mortgages available from limited resources.</P>
    <P>The section attempts to strike a fair balance between the interest of the public authorities, the householder, the builder and lending agencies.</P>
    <P>Section 19 will extend the categories of persons specified in section 1 of the Statutory Declarations Act, 1938, who may take and receive a statutory declaration for the purposes of an application for a grant, loan or subsidy under the Bill.  This measure should facilitate individual householders.</P>
    <P>Section 20 contains an amendment of section 30 (2) of the Building Societies Act, 1976, which relates to the powers of the Registrar of Building Societies to investigate the affairs of a society.  The section will remove any doubt as to the constitutionality of the existing provisions. The point at issue is similar to that for which provision was made in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979.  The section will also extend the Minister's power to make regulations under section 77 of the 1976 Act in relation to the amounts and purposes of building society loans.  This latter amendment has been found to be necessary in the light of experience since the coming into operation of the 1976 Act.  For example, it is necessary from time to time to take steps to reconcile the anticipated level of mortgage lending for new houses with the financial needs of the national housing programme.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 21 is to enable the Minister for Health to transfer, mainly for housing purposes, about 54 acres of land at Navan Road, Dublin, to Dublin Corporation and the Commissioners of Public Works.  That Minister presently holds the land in trust under section 21 (3) of the Saint Laurence's Hospital Act, 1943, and amending legislation is necessary to ensure satisfactory title on transfer of the lands.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill and the Schedule repeal those sections of the Housing Act, 1966, and of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962, which are superseded by various provisions of the Bill.  In all, 30 sections are being repealed wholly or in part and ten sections of the Housing Act, 1977, will be spent when <Col N="1117" /> the Bill becomes law.  Section 22 includes transitional provisions, where appropriate. It also repeals sections 93 (6) (a) and 98 (5) of the 1966 Act, which enables a housing authority to require payment, generally referred to as a &ldquo;clawback&rdquo; payment, to them of part of the profit made on resale by a tenant purchaser of certain houses.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 23 of the Bill relates to Title, collective citation and construction. The Bill contains retrospective provisions in sections 2 to 7 and 10 to 12.  It is proposed that the remaining sections will come into operation when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should say that I very much regret the fact that the Construction Industry Federation launched into print recently about section 18 of the Bill without due concern for the facts of the matter.  Their press notice of 1 June contained several inaccurate and misleading statements.  It is scarcely necessary for me to repeat at this stage all the points which I made in a press rejoinder which I issued on that date.  I would simply reiterate the fact that, since this Government resumed office, there have been numerous meetings between the CIF, the Minister, the Minister of State and senior officers of the Department at which various aspects of the CRV system were discussed.  I considered, nevertheless, that it would have been entirely inappropriate to have the provisions of section 18 discussed with the CIF in advance of the Bill being circulated to elected representatives in this House.  I informed the federation, however, as recently as 23 April last, that as soon as the Bill was published any observations made in the matter by elected representatives, by the federation and by other interested bodies would be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>I received a request from the federation to meet them and hear their views on the Bill.  In reply I stated that I was prepared to meet a deputation, as requested, and that firm arrangements for the meeting would be made as soon as the federation let me have details of the matters they intended to raise.  On 25 June I was informed that the federation <Col N="1118" /> did not wish to add to their views as set out in their press notice of 1 June.</P>
    <P>In similar circumstances the Irish Building Societies Association, which is particularly concerned about aspects of section 20 of the Bill, also asked me recently to meet a deputation to present their views and submitted in advance a memorandum setting out in considerable detail points which they want to press and the reasons why they feel that the section as drafted should be changed.</P>
    <P>I regret that, due mainly to pressure of other commitments, I was unable to meet representatives of the Construction Industry Federation and of the Irish Building Societies Association.  I should like, however, to take this opportunity to say that, having considered the representations already made, I shall move a number of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  In particular, I intend to provide that, where the Minister refuses to grant a certificate of reasonable value pursuant to subsection (3) (a) of section 18, the applicant will have a right of appeal to a court.  I intend to provide expressly that the question of the interest rate applicable to building society loans shall not come within the scope of regulations made under section 77 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, as amended by section 20 of the Bill.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> At the outset I should like to say it is a great pity that a Bill of this sort is brought before the House in the dying days of this session of Parliament. We received a list of Bills which the Government required to be enacted this week.  There were about 20 Bills concerned, one of which was the Bill before us now.  The Government expected that all these Bills would be processed through this House yesterday and today, but this is a reckless way of dealing with parliamentary business.  I want to put that on record.  We are trying to process this Bill as best we can in the ordinary way and have Committee Stage next week.  If this is the way that the Government are arranging their business generally at Cabinet level and elsewhere the present chaos and unrest is not to be wondered at.  Having said that, I feel this <Col N="1119" /> Bill is being introduced at an opportune time.  Certainly, there never was a more appropriate time for a housing debate. There is a housing crisis of terrifying dimensions looming.  The purchase of a house has gone out of the reach of all but the wealthy and the Government, as a matter of policy, are cutting back on local authority building.  The consequences are not very difficult to forecast. We shall have a young and very angry house-seeking population with all the consequences that that will have.</P>
      <P>At the moment a person of wealth can move from a good house into a better one and pay no rates.  However, a person living on the type of salary or income which the Government are telling him he should be glad to have cannot afford a house and the Government will not provide one for him.</P>
      <P>Lest it be said that I am exaggerating or indulging in extravagant language, I would like to put a few facts on the record of this House concerning house prices and housing finance.  The price of an average house, financed by building societies, has increased from £12,113 in 1976 to £21,774 in the first quarter of this year, and the price of houses financed by other agencies&mdash;such as banks and insurance companies&mdash;has increased even more.  This is not an increase that has been going on from 1976 and has stopped.  The average price of the building society house for the first quarter of 1978 was £17,139 and, as I have said, the average price for the same house for the first quarter of this year is £21,774&mdash;an increase of £4,635 between March 1978 and March 1979. These are not my figures; these are figures taken from the quarterly bulletins of housing statistics completed and issued by the Minister's own Department. They must be regarded as accurate and as representing the present price of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to housing finance, a young married house purchaser, if he is lucky enough to be able to secure a loan, has today to pay interest at the record figure of 14.15 per cent.  It never reached that figure during the height of the depression in 1974 to 1976 when, as we know, there <Col N="1120" /> was a very serious world recession and depression.  The Government of the day subsidised building societies during that time, to keep down their rate of interest and to cushion the house builders and house purchasers against the recession. At the present rate of interest the cost of financing a £16,000 loan&mdash;and this seems to be regarded by the Minister and his Department as a type of loan very much in demand and worthy of the protection of his Department&mdash;from a building society for 20 years is £203.20 per month, just under £50 a week.  I would regard a payment of £50 a week in respect of a house purchase loan as being beyond, and very far beyond, the capacity of the average person who is expected by the Minister to house himself, yet the Minister expects that person with an income of approximately £75 per week to house himself and that category is being, indeed not too gently, pushed off the housing list.  A payment of £50 a week is not alone beyond the capacity of a person with that income but is far beyond one with a far higher income.</P>
    <P>We all know that the mortgage interest rate is on the way up.  There was an article in one of the papers yesterday giving a figure of a decided increase of 2.7 per cent.  I know that that has been contradicted by the building societies&mdash;well, not actually contradicted, but the building societies say that they have not yet held their meeting. Figures such as those given in yesterday evening's newspaper are not taken out of the sky; they are not the imagination of somebody who has not done any research in the matter and the figures for the new interest rates that are being spoken about at the moment are 16.85 per cent, 17.85 per cent and 18.35 per cent.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> That is the figure that was given in the <i>Evening Herald</i>; the Minister is right.  Of course, if the Minister comes to the rescue of the building societies and subsidies them, these figures will not materialise.  I did <Col N="1121" /> not hear the response from the building societies on the media, but I understand that it was not a point blank denial.  It was a denial that these figures had been decided upon at a formal meeting.  We know that a formal meeting was not held.</P>
      <P>I propose, for the purpose of this debate, to take the lowest of those increases, 16.85 per cent and see how it will affect a loan of £16,000 for 20 years.  I have told the House that at the moment that loan is costing about £50 a week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This debate would be meaningless if I cannot discuss the cost of houses, the capacity of people to build houses for themselves, the failure of the Government to build local government houses and then to examine the Bill in the light of that and see what the Government propose to do.  At the present rate of interest the cost of a £16,000 loan for 20 years is about £50 a week. Under the lowest figure mentioned, in relation to an increase of £16.85, that loan will go up to £60, or add another £10 a week to what people are already paying.  That is making it impossible for people, unless they are wealthy, to purchase houses of their own.  The people who are expected to pay £50 a week at the moment, which possibly will be <Col N="1122" /> £60 a week in a month's time, will have to find a deposit of between £2,000 to £7,000.</P>
      <P>We have to look at the position I have outlined in regard to the cost of housing finance in relation to the increase in the cost of living.  I will not go into this in detail.  I will only refer to the cost of electricity, motoring, rail fares and a host of other increases which will be announced as soon as the House goes into recess.  We have to look at the housing market and housing finance in relation to those increases.  As things stand, young people who have just got married or are thinking of getting married cannot afford to buy houses or to build them. The Minister cannot contradict that.  The approach of the Government towards building local authority houses and the policy and history of the Government in relation to that matter going back to 1969, and all the White Papers and Green Papers they have introduced since they have come into power, are of building less local authority houses and forcing people to build their own houses.</P>
      <P>We have had a discussion in the House about the number of new house starts over the years.  I put down a question to the Minister for the Environment at the end of May asking him to tell me the number of house starts over a period from 1970 to date.  He could not give me the information then and he seemed to be a bit annoyed that I had asked him the question.  He told me his Department would give me the information and he hoped that when I got it that the work which would have to be put into it would be justified.  I thank the Minister's Department for giving me that information which I got yesterday and for the amount of work they put into it.  The work was well worth while for I believe it will shame the Government into revising their policy about local authority housing in the light of house prices and the cost of house financing as I have indicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find that 1978 was the worst year for new house starts since 1971.  There was a dramatic cutback in new houses in 1978.  In 1978, 5,805 new houses were commenced by county councils and county boroughs.  In 1977 there were <Col N="1123" /> 7,045 new house starts, almost 2,000 more.  In 1976 there were 7,046 houses, in 1975, the year of the recession, there were 6,393, in 1974, 8,215, in 1973, 7,195, in 1972, 6,825, in 1971, 5,494 and in 1970, 4,178.  This is a clear indication that when Fianna Fáil are in power the lower income group are neglected as far as housing is concerned. That is much more serious when the cutback in local authority houses by the Government is not only confined to the county councils.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that that would be more appropriate on the Estimate.  I am still waiting for the Deputy to come to the Bill.  We are discussing a Housing Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monghan):</i> I agree, but the Minister has produced a Housing Bill in which he proposes to almost everything the Bill will do by regulation.  I want to make the case for the people who require houses and I want to ask the Minister what he proposes to put into the regulations.  I have given the situation as far as the county councils are concerned.  It does not stop there.  There is a miserable performance as far as the urban councils are concerned.  We find that the year 1970 was the worst year of all the years for which I sought information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1970 there were 954 house starts by urban county councils.  In 1971 there were 1,375, 1972, 1,361, 1973, 1,113, 1974, 1,921, 1975, 948, 1976, 1,419, 1977, 1,032, 1978, 876.  Is the Minister ashamed of himself?  Are the Government ashamed of themselves?  I am not indulging in extravagant language when I say that a housing crisis of terrifying proportions is looming.  The Government are directly responsible for it.  I have been waiting some time for this Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979.  I though there would be some good news in it and some solution to the problem that is rapidly developing.  I see no solution unless the Minister gives an undertaking that in the regulations which he seeks power to make under the <Col N="1124" /> Bill, he proposes to solve the problem. There is no hope in the Bill or in the Minister's speech for the people requiring houses.</P>
    <P>In view of the cost of houses and the cost of finance I suggest to the Minister that he should build more local authority houses and that in these regulations he should revise at once the policy enunciated in the White Paper by his colleagues, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and the Minister for Finance, which means there will be a cutback in local authority housing.  On several occasions in recent months the Minister has denied strongly that there was any cutback in local authority housing but facts speak for themselves.  The figures I have given and which I obtained in reply to a parliamentary question prove beyond doubt that there is a drastic cutback in local authority housing. We have not yet got the figures for 1979.</P>
    <P>I could also give the House information regarding new house starts for 1979 but I will content myself by saying that there was a drastic cutback in the allocation for new house starts in 1979 as against the number requested.  There is no doubt that when information on new house starts for 1979 is given to this House it will show a further drastic cutback in the 1978 figures which are shameful.  This is happening at a time when we have a very large percentage of our population in the younger age group, when people are marrying at a younger age and when people expect better housing because they see the wealthy section enjoying the benefit of very good houses. The Minister must build more local authority houses and must revise the policy of cutting back on local authority houses.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister must increase the SDA loan.  I know he has increased the amount but the cost of houses has increased dramatically.  In 1977 when the Government introduced a scheme for the £1,000 grant it was regarded as a considerable sum of money but it has been gobbled up several times over by the increases in the cost of housing between 1977 and 1979. I have given the figures.  Houses have increased <Col N="1125" /> in price from £11,076 to £21,000 or £22,000 in 1979.  What use is the £1,000 grant in a situation like that? The Minister must have regard to prevailing conditions.  He must increase the SDA loan far in excess of £9,000. The Minister may tell me that this loan is being availed of but it is being availed of by what I call special category builders. These are people who have farms, who can provide their own site and who can do a considerable amount of work on building the house.  They are the only kind of people whom this loan can help.</P>
    <P>The Minister must increase considerably the income qualification for the SDA loan.  I know he has increased it but it is far from adequate.  In addition, he must subsidise interest because interest is getting out of hand.  He must do something to control effectively house and land prices.  The certificate of reasonable value has been in operation for some time and it is obvious that it has not worked.  Instead of reducing house prices they have increased drastically.  The only thing it has done is to drive a certain category of builder out of building the kind of house that is required and into building more palatial and expensive houses.</P>
    <P>The Chair asked me to speak on the Bill.  With the greatest of respect, I think that all I have said had to be said and perhaps a lot more could be said.  There is nothing in the Bill that will give solace or comfort to the person seeking a house.  There are a few matters in the Bill with which I would like to deal.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the devolution of administration of housing grants, a scheme that was introduced by Deputy Tully as Minister for Local Government. It was introduced as a pilot scheme in Meath and to some extent in Longford and in Westmeath.  The scheme worked well.  It facilitated the inspection of houses and it meant that an inspector from the local authority would not inspect the house for one purpose while an inspector from the Department inspected it for another purpose.  That kind of duplication only leads to expense and delay.  It is a pity the Minister has seen <Col N="1126" /> fit to depart from this devolution of housing functions to local authorities instead of extending it.  The real answer to it is that once the Minister got his hands on the local authorities' purse strings he had to get tighter control of everything. Instead of devolving functions to the local authorities we are gradually taking control from them and giving power back to the Custom House.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with expenses to housing co-operatives.  That is a worthy provision.  I should like the Minister to tell us more about housing co-operatives, how many there are and how they work.  The Minister has told us that sections 4, 5, and 6 replace about 25 other sections in the 1966 Act and in other housing Acts.  The answer to that is that all the sections in the other legislation will be replaced by regulations, regulations we do not know about and about which we will not be told until they are presented to us.  There is no provision in this Bill for laying these regulations before the House but on looking at the 1966 Act with which this measure is to be read I find that section 5 of that Act provides for the laying of regulations before the House.  I presume that section will govern any regulations made under this Bill but I should like the Minister to confirm that.</P>
    <P>I am assuming that is so, that these regulations will have to be laid before the House and that they can be annulled within 21 sitting days of being laid on the table of the House.  There is a defect in that because although the House can annul these regulations, there is a doubt as to whether it can amend them.  I think it has been held that the House must either annul them or confirm them but it cannot amend them.  That is a serious defect and I intend to put down an amendment on it on Committee Stage because we are giving the Minister the widest powers in regard to housing he ever had or asked for, to control loans, subsidies and so on.  Therefore, it is only reasonable that the House should have an opportunity of considering those regulations and amending them if it thinks fit.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had any immediate good news about increasing grants, <Col N="1127" /> small dwelling loans or the qualifying income for those loans, I am sure he would have told us about it.  When concluding, I hope he will have something to say about these matters that will make them more bearable for house builders.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 4 seems to be a departure from present Government policy on housing grants.  When they introduced their famous manifesto of 1977, they said there would be a £1,000 grant for everybody who wanted to build a house provided&mdash;and this was not spelled out&mdash;he or she had not previously bought or built a house.  There was no tag in regard to a means test or anything like that.  We know that when the £1,000 grant was introduced many other grants were abolished, for example, the farmers grant which was as high as £900.  The fact that there was no means test was good electioneering.  It was much easier to say that everyone building a house, who did not already have one, would get a grant of £1,000, than to say that anyone with an income up to £x would qualify for the grant of £1,000.  That would not be nearly so attractive.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> They could use it to buy a few stools.  Section 4 (2) (f) states that the Minister may make regulations regarding:</P>
      <P>requirements in relation to the financial and family circumstances of the person to whom the grant is paid, and</P>
      <P>What has the Minister in mind there? Will he or his Minister of State tell us if that is a proposal to impose a means test?  Is that going back on the election manifesto of 1977?  Is it an indication that the Minister is taking power at least to impose a means test?  In his reply will the Minister tell us exactly what that means?  Section 4 says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and subject to such regulations as may be made by the Minister for the purposes of this section, pay, out of <Col N="1128" /> moneys provided by the Oireachtas, a grant to a person providing a new house where&mdash;....</P>
    <P>(2)  Regulations under this section may, in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, make provision in relation to all or any one or more of the following:...</P>
    <P>(f) requirements in relation to the financial and family circumstances of the person to whom the grant is paid, and</P>
    <P>That sounds very like the introduction of a means test.  That section continues:</P>
    <P>(3)  A grant shall not be paid under this section unless the house the subject of the grant complies with such conditions, if any, as may be determined by the Minister from time to time for the purposes of this section in relation to standards of construction of houses and the provision of water, sewerage and other services therein.</P>
    <P>Does that include electricity?  There should be more co-operation between the ESB and house builders to provide electricity at much more reasonable charges than are being charged at present.</P>
    <P>When dealing with grants for the improvement of houses we have the same requirement regarding the financial and family circumstances of the person to whom the grant is to be paid which is spelled out in section 5 (2) (e).  Under section 8 (7) improvement grants will not be made unless there is a leasehold interest covering the duration of the repayment of the loan and 15 years. That is unreasonable because if the loan is for 25 years, the person would not get the loan unless he had a lease for 40 years.  If a person has a lease covering the period of the loan, which would be 20 or 25 years, that should be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Under section 9 the Minister may subsidise local authorities to enable them to provide and make available sites for private houses.  The idea behind this is sound.  This is in operation at the moment but is not being pursued energetically enough.  I also think that when sites are being sold by local <Col N="1129" /> authorities they are charging too much for them.  They are having regard to the increase in the value of land from the date they bought the land to the date of the selling of the sites.  The policy should be to make these sites available at cost. The local authority should not get into the land market or the site market and expect profit.  They should make the sites available at cost plus, of course, the cost of development.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk from time to time about low rise mortgage interest schemes.  My own opinion is that that scheme is practically valueless and that it is not availed of to any extent certainly in rural Ireland.  The category of people who would qualify for it is so limited that it does not serve any useful purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to deal with section 11 which deals with subsidies by the Minister and the housing authorities for the purchase and construction of houses.  One of its subsections provides for the payment of a clawback which was a very ugly word some time ago.  I would like the Minister to deal with that in his reply.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is one of the sections that the Minister spelled out very clearly. That is the section which deals with putting into structurally sound condition houses which local authorities are selling. The Bill proposes to change the old system under which the local authority had to put the house into a reasonable state of repair from a structural point of view before they could transfer it or vest it.  The Minister is now changing that.  He is providing that the tenant/purchaser and the local authority may enter into an agreement under which the tenant will carry out the work.  The Minister gave as his reason the delays which took place in having this work carried out, which delays, he says, held up the vesting on the sale of a house.  That is so but it is a shocking indictment of the way the business of the public is carried out by departments and local authorities.  It is a shocking admission for a Minister to come into this House and say that he has to change the law because of the delays that took place in repairing these houses.  I am not a bit surprised that he should say that because I know how <Col N="1130" /> long it takes to get an isolated local authority house built for people who badly need it.  It takes years; five years is nothing from the time one starts making representations to the time the house is built.</P>
    <P>Something should be done to speed up this sort of thing.  I am not sure that it is a good idea to relieve local authorities of the obligation to put a house in structurally sound condition before handing it over to the tenant/purchaser.  Local authorities should not be allowed to hand over a house to the tenant/ purchaser on the condition that he will carry out the repairs.  Will the repairs be carried out in all cases or will the house be allowed to deteriorate further?  It would be much better if the Minister and the local authority were to set about speeding up the repair of these houses rather than washing their hands of it because that is what this section is doing; it is getting rid of an obligation to put these houses into a structurally sound condition.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I know it is optional but it is an option that may be availed of and it would be better to continue to make it a condition for the local authority to put the houses into good condition.  I would even go a little further and say that the definition of structural improvements should be extended.  The effect of that would be to prolong the life of these houses and, in the long run, to save the State, the taxpayers and what is left of the rate payers the cost involved if houses are allowed to deteriorate.  At present the term &ldquo;structural condition&rdquo; is interpreted in a very narrow way. Walls, doors and the roof qualify and that is all.  It would be a better policy to give a wider interpretation to structural repair and to leave the obligation on the local authorities to make a reasonably good job of these before they hand over the property.</P>
      <P>I was rather amused to see that the Minister has availed of this Bill to extend the category of people who may administer statutory declarations.  Section 19 provides that:</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Are we talking about declarations or just the question of witnessing a document?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I would like to go back to section 17 (2) which provides:</P>
      <P>Section 90 of the Principal Act shall apply, and be deemed always to have applied, to a building consisting of a house and a shop, together with any outoffice, yard, garden or other and appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith.</P>
      <P>There is no explanation given of this in the explanatory memorandum and I would like the Minister to tell us what is behind that section.  It is obviously put in to validate some transgressions that there are doubts about and I would like the Minister to spell out exactly what is involved here.</P>
      <P>That brings me to section 18 which deals with certificates of reasonable value.  Everybody in this House believes that there should be control over the price of houses just as there is control over the price of commodities people buy in shops every day of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the system of CRVs is <Col N="1132" /> not working.  It worked to deprive people of grants and cause delays in getting grants and having deeds stamped and it also worked to drive a lot of building structures out of the grant category.  The Minister is now extending this in an undefined manner to cover such categories of houses as he may later decide, such categories of houses which are financed by loans, the amount of such loans to be defined.  Something should be done about the cost of land for building houses.  The cost of sites has rocketed in recent years.  I am aware that in Cavan town sites cost on average £6,000.  Admittedly, there are unusual circumstances there in that there is a limited amount of land available for building but I understand that £4,000 is the average cost of a site throughout the country. The Minister will have to grasp this nettle soon because as long as the cost of sites continues to rocket it will be impossible to control the price of houses.  It is not possible to make omelettes without cracking eggs and it is not possible to build houses without sites.</P>
    <P>I accept that this is a problem but the Minister should find a solution to it.  I was pleased to hear the Minister say that it was his intention to amend this section on Committee Stage.  He told us that one of the amendments he proposed to introduce was one which would give a person who has been refused a CRV the right to appeal to a court.  My immediate reaction to that amendment is that unless a special judge is assigned to this type of work intolerable delays will result.  By the time such a case is heard what would have been a reasonable value when the application was made will be completely out of date.  There are precedents for appointing judges as arbitrators to deal with such matters and I suggest that the Minister, when considering his amendment, should think in terms of appointing a Circuit Court judge as the arbitrator.  He should devise a simple procedure for disposing of these appeals or else the whole thing will be meaningless.</P>
    <P>There have been other complaints about the delays in the issuing of CRVs in that after a certificate is applied for <Col N="1133" /> and £X,000 is mentioned as the reasonable value the application may be refused without any reason being given for such a refusal.  The Minister should be obliged to give his reasons for such a refusal.  The Minister's decision to allow an applicant the right of appeal to a court against such a refusal will be meaningless unless the Minister gives his reasons for that refusal.</P>
    <P>The issuing of the certificates should be speeded up.  The Minister has told us that the average delay is about three weeks but my information is that there are longer delays in some important cases.  If the Minister intends operating this system he should ensure that his Department have the machinery to operate it expeditiously, even if that means taking on more expert staff to deal with the matter.  The housing situation warrants a speeding up of this process.  A person should be entitled to a decision on his application within a specified period, similar to a provision which exists under the Act which deals with planning applications.  I do not think that the Department should get around the specified time by asking a further question at the end of that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have meaningful discussions with representatives of the building construction industry and any organisation which represents house purchasers in relation to these certificates. If the Minister imposes an unworkable and unacceptable system instead of solving our problems he will be creating more.  I do not wish to be misunderstood in relation to this and I am anxious to make it clear that I am in favour of controlling the price of building land because I do not believe that the cost of houses can be brought down to a reasonable figure unless the cost of land is effectively controlled.  It will not be possible to solve any problem by the Minister getting the building construction industry by the throat and insisting on that industry adhering to certain regulations.  Meaningful discussions should take place with a view to preparing an acceptable and effective system of price control.  The Minister is charged with the responsibility of working out the <Col N="1134" /> details of such a system and he has the staff at his disposal to do that.</P>
    <P>We shall have more to say about this Bill on Committee Stage.  There seems to be some sort of mini-war brewing between the Minister and the building construction industry.  That would be a pity and in the long run will not serve the people who want to buy a house.  I urge a coming together.  I am not here to defend the building industry; indeed I should not have thought they would need any defence against the Minister because not so long ago I thought he and they were very pally&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the points that have to be made can more appropriately be dealt with on the Committee Stage of this long Bill when we can clarify the Government's intention in regard to the proposed regulations it might envisage under the enabling sections of this Bill. But it is right on the Second Stage to look at the sort of housing strategy the Government are now trying to pursue and for which they have seen fit to introduce this legislation to enable them to pursue that strategy.  Since the beginning of this Dáil we have had a number of housing debates in addition to the Estimates.  We had a debate last November and in May of this year and we have had a series of exchanges at Question Time in regard to the performance of the Government on housing generally and specifically on their performance on local authority housing within the context of their overall housing policy.  It is quite clear&mdash;I can give chapter and verse if these are sought but I do not wish to delay the House&mdash;that the effect of the Government's policy, applying to Fianna Fáil exactly the same criteria that would apply to the Labour Party and Fine Gael when they were in office, is that it is now more difficult to get a local authority house than it was two, three or four years ago.  The queues are growing and local authorities find it more difficult to meet the demand out of capital funds irrespective of any percentage increase in those funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have in our society a section who, because of the economic system or in any economic system because of the level of their remuneration, of their skills or their disability of one kind or another, will never be able to house themselves. Under Fianna Fáil it has become more <Col N="1136" /> difficult for that section even to aspire to a house than it was under the last administration. That is a conscious political shift of public resources away from people in housing need to people who can afford to house themselves.</P>
    <P>In May the Minister of State accused me of lecturing the House on socialist theory and programmes.  Calling to the attention of the House the fact that national resources are being used in a particular way so that those most in need are getting least is not a theoretical lecture; it is pointing out a specific fact. The Government in their White Papers have repeatedly stressed their reliance on the private sector generally as the engine to fuel and drive our economy.  The Minister for the Environment and his Minister of State have re-inforced that view and have given effect to that overall Government strategy by boosting or attempting to boost the private sector in housing.  Now, two years into their term, the Government housing strategy as set out by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in the White Papers and Green Papers is basically in shreds. Local authority housing is down on what it was in the last three to four years and it is continuing to drift downwards. The figures are there.  The private sector in which the Government purported to place most of its confidence is at war, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, with the Minister for the Environment.  That state of war, which one can only infer from what the Minister himself admitted in his speech, is highly unsatisfactory for the industry and all of those who work in it. Secondly, it is highly unsatisfactory and damaging for the people who depend on that industry to provide them with a home.  This is further aggravated by the fact that this Government have shifted emphasis away from local authority housing to the private sector.  They have done so in line with the view of the Taoiseach when he was Leader of the Opposition and stated on two separate occasions that the proportion of local authority houses being built by Deputy Tully when he was Minister for Local Government was too high and should be reduced.  That proportion has now been reduced to the kind of level the then <Col N="1137" /> Leader of the Opposition was talking about.</P>
    <P>Having taken that right wing ideological attitude&mdash;if we need ideological lectures now they are printed at Government expense in the White and Green Papers&mdash;the Minister for the Environment proposes to and proceeds to aggravate the private sector on which he proposes to place so much responsibility. That is basically incompetent and impossible to understand.  I can understand the right wing drift of Fianna Fáil as a logical and reasonable attitude to take.  It is one I disagree with, but I cannot understand that having taken that attitude they should then more or less spit in the face of the people they hope will build the houses their economic strategy requires.  I shall come to that in detail when we get to the question of the CRV but in terms of overall housing strategy it is a basic charge to the answering of which the Minister should devote some time.</P>
    <P>The relationship between the house building section of the building industry and any Government is absolutely critical.  Given the structure of our society I foresee a significant role for the private house building sector to play in our economy.  Because of social and demographic patterns of populations in rural and urban areas in the socialist economies of eastern Europe there is a considerable role for private bouse building.  We are talking about a very important industry; we are talking about the engine room for the provision of houses.  While there will be political differences between the three parties on the role of local and private housing, the importance of the house building industry to the economy and to the social development of our society should be clearly stated to the building industry, who labour under the misapprehension that they have only one political ally&mdash; Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that the Minister's and the Minister of State's handling of the relationship between the industry and the Government appears to have resulted in a serious deterioration in the confidence of that industry to meet the <Col N="1138" /> social housing targets set by the Government. I should be delighted if the Minister can refute that charge or allay my fears about it because the complexity of the industry creates sufficient problems for them without aggravation from our self-inflicted political incompetence.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister's speech one would think that there were only two opinions in terms of housing policy, either private or local authority, and that the co-operative option is little more than window dressing.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing the section which enables him to give grants to housing bodies other than local authorities.  It is a good proposal and I warmly welcome it.  Having introduced the proposal the Minister does not elaborate on the kind of effective role he envisages for that sector of the housing market, the number of houses he envisages the voluntary housing sector providing and the aid to be made available to that sector.  If my information is correct we are only talking in terms of £6,000 being given to NABCo this year.  That is a paltry sum in the context of the housing industry.  After many discussions and representations from the voluntary housing sector the provision of £6,000 as a grant-in-aid is an insignificant gesture.  The Minister seems to be conceding the principle of the role of the voluntary housing sector on the one hand and taking it away again by giving them no money.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to commend the enthusiasm and activity over many years of Bernard Thompson.  He pioneered the idea of voluntary housing and created NABCo.  I understand that he has been seconded to NABCo.</P>
    <P>We must seriously consider a substantially expanding role for the voluntary housing sector.  The Minister should have taken the opportunity on Second Stage to indicate the Government's housing strategy.  From reading the speech and the Bill, it seems that the nuts and bolts of the strategy will be in the regulations introduced under the Act.  I agree with the provisions whereby the Minister holds two ministerial orders. The Minister and the Department should <Col N="1139" /> have that flexibility and should not be tied down by specified amounts and specified areas.  Without getting an indication of the level of aid proposed under the different categories, it is difficult to assess the Government's housing strategy.  When we reach Committee Stage perhaps we can look at this aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lack of clarity in thinking to the role of local authorities. The idea of delegating to them the power of allocating grants is a positive one and seems to move in the direction of devolution of Government.  On the other hand, the Minister is retaining the right to direct housing authorities to sell or not to sell some parts of their housing stock as if housing authorities could not be trusted to keep within their ownership certain categories of houses for their own needs.  On the one hand, the Minister appears to trust local authorities to act as runners at local level to dispense grants and to use discretion in their allocation and on the other hand, he has taken powers to direct local authorities to sell or not to sell because, as he said, a local authority might sell houses that were specially built for the elderly and the handicapped.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister not trust the Fianna Fáil councillors?  Do the Government not trust the democratic judgement of the people who elected those counicllors? Do Fianna Fáil not believe in local democracy to the extent that they are prepared to allow a local authority, with the help and assistance of the officials in the local authority service, who are committed and conscientious, to judge whether a stock of housing in Cavan town should or should not be sold?  Why must they take this new, centralised power to themselves, to direct or not to direct a local authority to dispose of its housing stock?  I can see absolutely no good housing reason for it.  At all times I would argue that the local housing authority on the ground, if doing their job properly, made a better assessment of the housing need, with all due respect to the Minister of the day&mdash;and that would apply to any Minister, myself included, were I in that position&mdash;than a Minister based in Dublin.  I cannot see <Col N="1140" /> the housing benefit to the country of enabling a Minister to have this power.  I see a far more ominous reason.  I can foresee the power being given in this Bill dictated, not by the Minister for the Environment but by either the Minister for Economic Planning and Development or the Minister for Finance, when the direction would be to sell the housing stock rather than hold it in order to recoup some money.  I can see that provision being inserted as much at the behest of the Department of Finance as at that of the Minister for the Environment.  That is an area that must be clarified.  Either we trust local authorities, in principle, to make decisions about their areas&mdash;and so I think Deputy F. O'Brien would agree&mdash;housing is undoubtedly the top priority of most local authorities, of most local representatives, certainly in larger areas with a growing population. For example, the Housing Committee of Dublin Corporation, with their officials, are in a far better position to assess actual housing needs and priorities, and the strategies of their authority than, with all due respect to them, The people in the Custom House.  The assistance and advice of the Custom House people is needed but certainly the final decision should rest with the local authority.</P>
    <P>I regret the tendency to increased centralisation resulting in an over-bureaucratised and over-worked central government, which is what is being pursued in this Bill.  I fail to see an adequate housing reason.  I can see a financial reason dictated by the Department of Finance&mdash;that is another story&mdash;but I do not see any good housing reason for it, and the way in which it is moving is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>The voluntary housing sector did not receive sufficient mention in this Bill. Perhaps the Minister could outline the strategy and role he would envisage for that sector; what percentage of the total new housing output he would envisage being provided by the sector over a period of time once it gets off the ground.  The Minister might outline also what would be its specific financial relationship to local authorities on the question of obtaining building sites for housing from local authorities.  I know <Col N="1141" /> that any attempts at establishing housing co-operatives in the Greater Dublin region have been fraught with difficulty on the question of the price of housing sites obtained from local authorities. Unless the Minister is explicit about this, gives substantial financial assistance to NABCo and, in addition, clarifies Government thinking in relation to the disposal of sites by local authorities to housing co-operatives, the aspirations of the voluntary housing sector will remain just that and will not be converted into real terms.</P>
    <P>I would envisage the voluntary housing sector aiming at providing between 2,000 to 3,000 houses per annum within a five-year period of getting off the ground.  Ideally we should be looking at a middle turret of housing provision through the agencies of the voluntary housing sector working directly with the small house builders' association.  Part of the difficulty experienced by small house builders, was not in their construction of houses but in their marketing of houses, in trying to ride the valleys and troughs of a highly cyclical market, of being unable to plan their way out of perhaps the most chaotic and unplanned part of our economy, which is the building industry in general and, to a certain extent, the housing industry in particular.</P>
    <P>Many house builders who become housing contractors do so not because they are skilled in marketing or in sales but because they are skilled craftsmen of one kind or another, men who have been bricklayers, carpenters or whatever and who come together to start building houses.  Frequently the difficulties and problems that arise are a product of their relationship to the market by reason of their being salesmen of one kind or another rather than actual builders.  I could foresee a lot of small builders benefiting considerably through having a relationship with a housing association, one which would guarantee their markets, enable them to phase their payments and plan ahead, rather than putting a sign up on a site, waiting for prospective buyers at weekends and so on.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could outline <Col N="1142" /> Government thinking in relation to the role of the voluntary housing sector.  As far as we in the Labour Party are concerned it is an area that must be developed if we are to achieve our goal in the kind of housing provision needed as a result of the change in our population structure, one which will be highlighted dramatically when the recent census figures are published.  While on that topic perhaps the Minister would let us know the way in which grants will now be paid to housing co-operatives the way in which group grants will be paid, if there will be any additional grant other than that which obtained up to the last few years.  For example, is there any proposal for a differential in the £1,000 grant; will there be an incentive given to people to build in co-operatives, say some provision whereby, if there are ten people applying for grants, one application only will be necessary.  It was my experience that separate applications had to be made.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister envisage making available an extra £1,000, or a multiple of the number available, in order to end courage the idea of group building on a voluntary basis?  Apart from the £6,000 being given to NABCo and assistance that varies throughout the country, there is no positive incentive to people at present to get involved in co-operative housing. These are the people caught between trying to raise the deposit on a house in the private sector&mdash;who see the prices of houses soaring beyond their reach&mdash;and faced with joining the housing queue in a local authority area, finding that they are very far down the line.  Their main problem is that they cannot get into the housing sector to begin with.  They can live with the repayments, even the extraordinarily high interest rates&mdash;the can just about live with those&mdash;but the cannot make that initial jump to get into the housing market.</P>
    <P>I am endeavouring to be constructive on this Bill because the political and policy differences between the Government and the Labour Party are quite clear; we have had numerous housing debates in which that has been clearly established.  It would be useful on this Bill to endeavour to clarify Government thinking, if any, in these areas and in <Col N="1143" /> respect of which they propose to take enabling powers under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I presume we shall not have the Committee Stage until the autumn.  Does the Minister know if it is proposed to sit next week?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if necessary; it was mentioned by the Taoiseach yesterday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of voluntary housing I might mention a point that has arisen in my experience, applying not merely to that sector but to all the loans given by local authorities, that is, the question of legal aid.  People under the age of 21 cannot sign a mortgage with a local authority.  It is my intention to include an amendment that people aged 18 will be legally entitled to sign a loan with a local authority.  In Dublin many young couples of 18 and 19 who have saved a considerable amount of money simply cannot get a loan from a local authority to buy a house because they have not reached the minimum legal age.  They go into a flat and by the time they have reached the legal age they have a family and the money is gone.  The minimum legal age should be reduced for a variety of reasons but in the context of SDA and low rise mortgage loans there is no reason why an amending section should not be put into this legislation to enable young couples to sign a mortgage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In another section the Minister proposed to enable local authorities to spend money on improving their existing dwellings and I would like him to elaborate how this is to be interpreted. The Minister in his speech said that section 5 (1) would enable the Minister to pay a grant to a housing authority for improvement works to their rented houses and that this replaces section 24 of the 1966 Act.  Is it the Minister's intention to introduce some differential scheme of conservation grants having regard to the different age structure of local authority housing stock around the country?  Is it the Minister's intention to integrate such a system of conservation grants with a policy of gradual urban renewal in certain inner city areas?  This theme was the subject of a housing conference <Col N="1144" /> which the Department runs along with the Institute of Architects every second year.  At the recent housing conference, a number of case studies on the question of gradual renewal were presented.  The merits of the case for gradual renewal were accepted by all the participants and everybody conceded that what was needed was a comprehensive package of financial incentives by way of grants, tax relief and the relaxation of certain building regulations.  If the Minister is to enable himself to give these grants, perhaps he will clarify the Government's thinking on it.</P>
    <P>This Government are halfway through their term of office and irrespective of whether they are returned or not we are talking about a five-year period of government, and it is getting late in the day for the development of concrete proposals in these areas as distinct from aspirations and suggestions.  I urge the Minister to come forward as quickly as possible in relation to these areas.  A lot of work has been done not just in Britain, with which we have direct administrative comparability, but in other countries as well.  Given the energy crisis we now have the whole question of the loss of housing stock due to obsolescence. It is a question of major importance and it is not being properly dealt with by the Government.  We must give extra special attention to this, particularly in the context of inner city renewal of the kind the Minister for Economic Planning and Development talked about.  We will get no serious conservation programme off the ground unless the Minister takes the initiative and comes forward with a detailed package and sells it enthusiastically to the various local authorities.  Dublin Corporation established an inner city commission, but until such time as the Custom House gives the green light to a lot of proposals now being discussed, they will remain a committee of aspirations and nothing else.</P>
    <P>In relation to the housing numbers game concerning starts and completions of 25,000 houses a year, as far as we in the Labour Party are concerned, for statistical purposes we regard a rehabilitated house as a new completion to be included in the overall figure.  At <Col N="1145" /> the moment, the numbers game in relation to new housing starts predominates too much in our housing policy; we are concerned exclusively with new housing provision to the exclusion of total housing stock.  Even if we built 30 houses a year we would only be increasing the housing stock by less than 2 per cent. We must pay more attention to housing people in the existing housing stock.  A scheme of conservation grants which would be promoted and developed by the Government and which would have as part of it provision to count a rehabilitated house as part of new completions for that year, is a scheme to which we would give approval in principle. The arguments for conservation are very strong and I am glad that the Minister has made this provision.</P>
    <P>The grants the Minister is making available to local authorities should come out of the capital provision and money to be spent on the conservation of housing stock should come from the capital provision.  One of the great problems of local authorities at the moment is that repairs or modernisation of any type must come out of the maintenance grant and there are too many constraints on that grant.  It is not possible to effect the kind of repairs necessary, for example in many of the flats in Dublin which are now very substandard and badly in need of major repairs.  There is no financial provision or flexibility available to repair them at the moment.  As a consequence the people in those flats want to get out of them.  The area then begins to suffer a process of social decline with consequent negative effects right through the inner city area.  Deputy Fergus O'Brien is in a far better position than I to know what that can mean in real terms.</P>
    <P>Two points arise on the matter of making grants: a comprehensive conservation programme, which would come out of capital grant allocations to local authorities and which we, in turn, would recognise as part of the housing provision for the year.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is a major section which relates to CRVs.  Most of this legislation can be dealt with more properly on Committee Stage and therefore I will not <Col N="1146" /> go into the question of mortgage finance and all that.  I do not think that is germane to this legislation or to the general question of housing policy.  With a record level of interest rates at the moment, I hope the Minister will be able to persuade some of the more right-wing members of the Government to do something about interest subsidies building societies, and perhaps he would find out from the Minister for Finance how he can reconcile his bland assertions last Christmas that our entry the EMS would mean we would be no longer tied to the minimum lending rate of the Bank of England and that consequently the hike in interest rates here before Christmas would never happen again.  That is by way of an aside.</P>

      <P>I might have some credit from the bank in that respect.  Section will have to be looked at in great detail on Committee Stage.  It is disturbing because if you have a Government depend on the private sector enthusiastically that they make Margaret Thatcher appear as a mildly social democrat at times, if you have a Government who hope that the private sector will take us into Tír na nÓg, you then look at the way in which a Government Department relate to the largest single industry outside agriculture from the point of view of employment volume of capital employed, the construction industry.  The Minister of State last November, in his contribution to the debate on local authority housing, the construction industry had been in the gutter when Fianna Fáil returned to office and Fianna Fáil raised it from the gutter and gave it new confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship that now seem exist between the house building sector of the construction industry and the Government appears to be disastrous That is not to anybody's advantage least of all those hoping to be housed and those who work in the industry Perhaps the Minister for Labour has embarked on a new industrial relations policy for the entire Government to effect that they will not talk to anybody <Col N="1147" /> until a dispute happens.  I do not understand the Minister's statement today when he said:</P>
    <P>I should like to make it clear that I do not envisage that whatever form of house price control is implemented following the enactment of the Bill will remain unaltered indefinitely.  A flexible approach must be adopted and controls adjusted, in consultation with interested bodies, to take account of changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a perfectly reasonable sort of statement, but what has been happening?  The two major components of housing provision here are the CIF and the Building Societies Association. The Minister has referred to both in his speech and I should like to know what consultations have taken place between the Minister and the CIF since the Minister took office and before the drafting of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>More meetings have taken place between the CIF, my Department, the Minister of State and myself, in 18 months than for a number of years before that.  There has been a lot of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.  It seems to me extraordinary that if those meetings took place they have been unproductive in terms of getting the kind of joint approach that is required.  A statement was published by the CIF, and the fact that the Minister saw fit to reply to it directly in the House seems to indicate a considerable difference between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Their interpretation, contained in that statement, had many inaccuracies. I said that in my speech as a rejoinder to that statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us try to find out what has been agreed in relation to CRVs.  We all realise there must be some form of consumer protection in relation to standards and reasonable value.  That is not an issue even in the industry itself &mdash;what is at issue is the administration and the interpretation of it.  If a system like this is to work, particularly when one is talking about private interests, <Col N="1148" /> there must be the consent and the co-operation of the organisation that represents the private interests, irrespective of individual members of such an organisation. Undoubtedly there are cowboys in the building industry, there are house builders who use their positions to exploit vulnerable house purchasers.  We all know that, and we know there are people who have attempted directly to evade the application of the CRVs, who have got would-be house purchasers to sign letters informing contractors that they would not be getting CRVs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating has brought to the Minister's attention a major house construction company who operated that tactic.  We are aware of the abuses and we have been responsible in the way we have portrayed these abuses when speaking here, because of our concern.  I cannot understand why a draft of section 18, with its implications and its penalties, was not shown to the interested bodies before it was published. The Minister made the plea that it was in deference to the sensibilities of Members of the Oireachtas that he had refused to let people see a draft of the legislation before TDs and Senators.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he considered it would have been entirely inappropriate to have the provisions of section 18 discussed with the CIF in advance of the Bill being circulated to elected representatives in this House.  He went on to say that as soon as the Bill had been published any observations made on the Bill by elected representatives, the federation and other interested bodies, would be carefully considered. I cannot square that kind of approach with the application of CRVs and the Minister's statement on page 10 of his speech that a flexible approach must be adopted and controls adjusted in consultation with interested bodies to take account of changing circumstances. Indeed the proof of what I have been saying is contained in the last paragraph of the Minister's speech when he spoke about amendments he proposes to introduce on Committee Stage.  The <Col N="1149" /> Minister has claimed he met the CIF on numerous occasions, and I cannot dispute it, but he also said that in the last few weeks or months he has been unable to meet them.</P>
      <P>The Minister said also:</P>
      <P>I regret that, due mainly to pressure of other commitments, I was unable to meet representatives of the Construction Industry Federation and of the Irish Building Societies Association. I should like, however, to take this opportunity to say that, having considered the representations already made, I shall move a number of amendments to the Bill at the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>It is a tradition of this House that, basically, Opposition amendments are not accepted.  That is regrettable.  If we had a proper legislative system incorporating a proper committee structure, all the elected representatives could play a role in drafting legislation.  The Minister is aware that the role played by the Opposition on Committee Stage is simply to clarify what is intended.  It is very seldom, except in cases where there has been agreement, that Opposition amendments are accepted.  The result of this situation is that for the most part legislation goes through as initiated.  Yet the Minister is indicating already in this instance that the Bill is drafted inadequately in relation to the building societies and that, consequently, he will be introducing amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but in this instance we are talking about a contentious section, that is section 18.  We have talked on numerous occasions about this question of CRVs.  It is for the Minister and the representatives of the industry to clarify the situation.  All I can do is observe from this side of the House that irrespective of the meetings that have been held in the past, those meetings that were held specifically to <Col N="1150" /> deal with this matter of CRVs have not been productive.  According to the Minister he has not been able to find time to meet representatives of the CIF or of the building societies and neither has he been able to make his Minister of State available to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>To clarify the situation, I would point out that on more than one occasion the CIF were asked to make submissions but failed to do so. However, very recently, within a matter of some days past, we received a message from them saying that they had nothing further to add to what was contained in their newspaper item of 1 June. The reference to the pressure of time relates to the past few days.  Had they made their submissions before then and given me time to fix a date, I would have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the clarification but that is not the impression I got from the reference in the Minister's speech to his inability to meet these people.  I shall not dwell any further on this point because we can consider it in detail on Committee Stage, but I would make the point that this legislation is attempting to give power, by way of a series of enabling sections, to the Minister to push his housing policy.  That policy has been identified in the past as a policy relying on the private sector and on the house-building industry by way of a system of grants of one kind or another.  Consequently, the emphasis has been taken from local authority housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State has denied this and has attempted in the House to support that denial, but the figures indicate otherwise, as most local representatives and Fianna Fáil back benchers would agree.  I would argue that this shift has taken place as between local authority and private housing.  If it has taken place the private sector's relationship with the Minister is being aggravated.  The private sector have gone up market and are building the more expensive type houses. The result of this is that the people most in need of housing are not being accommodated. The number of starts in local authority housing has been reduced.  My <Col N="1151" /> assessment of the situation is that the Minister and the private building industry are engaged in a cold war but if I am wrong I should be glad to hear the Minister refute what I am saying.  There are two lessons to be learned from the situation.  First, the building industry should realise that Fianna Fáil in Opposition and Fianna Fáil in office are two separate things and that the perceived relationship which the building industry had traditionally with Fianna Fáil, a relationship that emerges from the Burlington Hotel and other places in terms of Fianna Fáil activities, should be seen now for what it is.</P>
    <P>The second point is that if the Government are to pursue a right-wing policy in relation to house building they should ensure first that the relationship with the industry is reasonably satisfactory. The Minister assures me that he has done everything possible to meet the industry but the fact remains that there is now a situation that can be described as a state of war between the Minister and the industry in relation to the application of CRVs.  I note that the Minister is shaking his head but I note also that in his speech he said in relation to the CIF that:</P>
    <P>Their press notice of 1 June contained several inaccurate and misleading statements.  It is scarcely necessary for me to repeat at this stage all the points which I made in a press rejoinder which I issued on that date.  I would simply reiterate the fact that, since this Government resumed office, there have been numerous meetings between the CIF, the Minister, the Minister of State and senior officers of the Department at which various aspects of the CRV system were discussed.</P>
    <P>That is the Minister's word as of today but the CIF are saying that they have nothing further to add to their statement. There is one big gap in relation to the application of a system that is being incorporated in section 18 of this Bill.  This means that every lending agency will have to obtain a CRV before a house is built and we know what happened in the past in relation to administration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much in favour of them but I am in favour also of local authority housing and of developing the voluntary housing sector.  If I were Minister these are the aspects of the industry that I should be concentrating on. This Government have seen fit to have regard almost exclusively to the private sector.  They are opting for the wrong road and, what is worse, they are making a bad job of it.  Essentially I am criticising the management of this Government in the area of housing. They are prepared to engage in this mismanagement in order to achieve their housing targets.  We are now to pass legislation to make CRVs obligatory for lending agencies as well as for house builders.  Given the nature of the housing market, this will distort the activities of the builders to such an extent that those most in need of housing are not likely to get it.  We do not know how this Bill is going to work and there will be all sorts of difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>If they start building they will flood the upper side of the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not get into housing figures and prices at the moment, but the Minister knows how flooded that particular area is.  My concern is that the people least able to house themselves&mdash;as distinct from the people who are not able to house themselves&mdash;who can afford to make some financial provision for themselves and normally depend on the private sector to provide low cost housing for them will suffer most.  It is my contention that the larger house building, construction companies, will move out of this area and into other areas of the building industry because of the present state of the house building industry and the demand for construction in other sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CIF themselves do not know the position because the market is so diverse and the variables so many that we do not know what the impact is likely to be. I can quite clearly say that unless you get the management of the CRV system right, to the extent that the people <Col N="1153" /> operating the system feel that it is right, it will not work.  Introducing heavier penalties, as provided for under section 18, will not help the situation at all.  The Minister's words are &ldquo;co-operation and consultation and a flexible approach&rdquo;.  If what the Minister has had for the last year or so with the CIF has been a flexible approach and that flexibility has resulted in a stalemate between one Government Department and the organisation of the other, is it any wonder that the postal strike lasted for 17 weeks and is it any wonder that we have all the other industrial difficulties?</P>

      <P>They are not, really.  The question on Second Stage&mdash;and I am quoting what the Minister introduced in debate&mdash;is the competence of the Minister to implement and pursue a policy that the Government have seen fit to identify as their right wing strategy. That, frankly, begs the question and I hope the Minister will reply.</P>
      <P>That is all I wish to say on Second Stage.  There are a number of other points which would more properly come up on Committee Stage and are questions that require clarification, rather than points of view.  Many of these provisions are enabling ones and it would depend on the actual regulations and their publication before we can see the strategy.  If the Minister has defined thinking in the area of the concrete role of the voluntary housing sector and on the question of conservation grants and grants for local authorities, he should indicate that as soon as possible so that the local authorities and local authority members such as Deputy O'Brien, can begin to anticipate the legislation and the regulations and move forward to identify activities in their own local authority areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to have on opportunity to speak on this Bill.  This Bill does not reveal any housing policy whatsoever.  It is purely to enable the Minister, in time, to do certain things if he wants to do them.  Given the serious nature of our housing problem I would <Col N="1154" /> prefer the Minister to have a defined policy.</P>
      <P>We have a large number of families reluctantly sharing with their in-laws. We have hundreds of families, particularly in Dublin, squatting in local authority housing.  We have very long waiting lists for housing and one would get the impression, from this Government's stance on housing, that these lists will get longer.  Many houses are falling into disrepair through lack of maintenance, due, among other reasons, to the fact that grants are totally inadequate. Housing stock in this town is in a major decline and the Government have no real policy for tackling this serious problem.  It could be tackled by way of tax relief incentives to people who invest money in their homes and in their property.  The grants for these people should be generous grants and these are not forthcoming.  There is, unfortunately, nothing to show this approach in the Bill.  When one considers the money that must be invested in new housing it is tragic to see this terrible decline in reasonably good housing stock.  Young families are unable to get private accommodation or, if they do, they are forced to pay more than one-third of their income for slum accommodation.  Have the Government any policy on this?  I do not thing they have.  It is sad to see these people being forced to pay terrible rents for accommodation which, literally, is not fit for animals.  Because of the housing shortage, this type of accommodation is being used and abused by the people who own it and the Government are standing back from the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are families who have to accept crushing debt burdens to get accommodation. Not alone are they going to building societies and local authorities but they are forced to get a second loan from banks or other financial institutions, in order to obtain a deposit for their houses.  This means putting themselves &ldquo;in hock&rdquo; away beyond their earning capacity and when one considers the very high interest rates being passed on to them, in many cases there is real poverty in this area, which appears to be totally disregarded.  People who have the courage to provide their own accommodation are, in my view, <Col N="1155" /> being severely penalised and not given any real help.  This legislation mentions grants and help and all sorts of accommodation for people; in fact, there is little by way of help for these people.</P>
    <P>When the trumpets and fanfares were sounding in mid-1977 regarding the £1,000 grant, one would have thought that this was a bonanza.  As Deputy Tully earlier said, it could be used by way of a deposit.  This £1,000 grant has lost any real meaning or value that it had because of escalating costs.  Also, as a grant it should be divided up, with £500 being paid at roofing stage and the balance on completion.  The trouble with this grant is that your house may be built and the builder may hand it over to you, but unless you are actually living in the house with furniture, curtains and all the paraphernalia one must have in a house you do not get this £1,000.  You might put a mattress on the floor and be sleeping on it but that will not be accepted as living in the house because there are no curtains on the windows.</P>
    <P>Surely a grant is to help people?  I suppose £1,000 is useful because it will help a man to pay off his debts.  Why should he be given £1,000 to pay off his debts when the grant could be given earlier when the man really needs it?  I have had several complaints about this from different people and I have got on to the Department about them but the grant was not given.  Those people could not move into their houses because they could not afford to buy furniture.</P>
    <P>A grant is given to help people.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said this appears to be enabling legislation for the Minister to put some sort of income limit on this grant.  When this £1,000 grant was being praised by the Government there was no impediment whatsoever.  As long as a person was buying a house for the first time he was entitled to the grant.  Under this new Bill the Minister is obviously having second thoughts.  This side of the House did not introduce this £1,000 grant so I am not saying whether I am for or against it.  If this Bill, on top of making the £1,000 grant available only to first owners, is making it restrictive on the basis of earnings I believe it will be useless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It was important to raise that matter.  We now have it on the record of the House that there will not be any income limit on this grant.  The Minister says that he is only validating actions taken by the previous Government. He has now said quite clearly that he does not intend to put any income limit on the £1,000 grant.  We could possibly <Col N="1157" /> call this Bill the Validation Bill rather than the Miscellaneous Provisions Bill.</P>
      <P>There is an income limit on loans granted for repairs.  People do repairs to keep their property in good order and there should not be an income limit on loans for repairs.  In fact, a tax incentive should be given to encourage people to keep their property in good order.  The loan granted is £2,500 but one cannot get much done for that amount of money.  It is important that we keep our existing housing stock in as good a condition as we can.  A very large amount of capital is required to build new houses. The land they have to be build on also costs a large sum of money.  I ask the Minister to look at the income limit on repairs.  The Minister is giving himself a lot of enabling powers in this Bill.  He should avail of those enabling powers in relation to the grant for repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many people who might like to buy houses and rent this accommodation to people.  Those people should be given grants to improve their property particularly if it can be proved that they will provide good accommodation for young families.  There are many young people looking for any type of accommodation. They are obliged to pay over one-third of their income for slum accommodation. If people are given grants at low interest rates to provide good accommodation at reasonable rents for those young people we should encourage this.  We do not seem to want to do this. When people are paying substantial rent for their accommodation they should be able to claim tax relief.  I know this is a matter for another Minister but I believe it is in the housing area.  If the Minister accepts that this type of accommodation should be available he should be prepared to approach the Minister for Finance and get him to agree to give some tax relief to the people who are in rented accommodation.  People who are buying homes of their own get tax relief on the interest they pay but the people who are paying very high rent are not getting any tax relief.  I believe that if those people were given some tax relief the Minister for Finance would be able to get at the tax dodgers at the other end of the scale.  This would not cost the Exchequer <Col N="1158" /> a great deal of money but it would help the person in rented accommodation to help meet the cost of his rent.</P>
    <P>The question of housing and house prices is important.  We are not facing up to the problem of escalating costs and the problems this will create.  Local authority housing is on the decline because of specific decisions taken by the Government.  That is their policy and they will have to stand by it.  As public representatives we have to meet our constituents and discuss their various problems.  The main problem is housing. I have found in the past year that people who hitherto would have provided their own houses are unable to do so because of the escalating cost of houses in the past few years and because no real effort has been made to come to grips with the financing of houses for them.  The SDA loan is £9,000 but the average house price is £20,000 and at the lower limit it is in the range of £15,000 to £16,000. We are talking about a man who must earn less than £80 per week in order to qualify for the SDA loan.  Before he can consider buying a house he must have £6,000 or £7,000 in his pocket.  It is obvious that it is a ludicrous situation.  We are saying we will provide the money but we do not have to lend it because people cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>Low rise mortgage has considerable merit.  The then Minister, Deputy Tully, introduced the scheme and it was worth while.  Possibly there were too many restrictions but at least it was a start to subsidise loans.  That start was never developed as it should have been to cater for people.  The scheme had considerable merit because it enabled people in the initial stage to have subsidised loans.</P>
    <P>The Government took a deliberate decision to cut back on local authority housing.  We have a responsibility to put alternatives to the Government.  The tragic result of the Government's decision is that people will be exploited and will be forced to live in accommodation that is unfit for animals.  If the Government had any sense they would ask what incentive could be given to young people who genuinely want to provide their own homes.  Surely the way to do it by way of the low rise mortgage scheme where <Col N="1159" /> deposits will be rather low and where we can lend reasonably high.  Because of the subsidised lending rate people will be able to avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It would alleviate many of our housing problems and would take many people from the housing lists if they could be helped to provide their own houses.  I can see in two years' time a doubling of the corporation housing list.  We have a young population and people are tending to marry at an early age.  If there is a doubling of the housing list we will have a real housing crisis.  However, the problem can be solved if we have the will and the social conscience.  The Government who are committed to the private sector will be helping that sector because they will be building to meet the needs of young people.  It behoves the Government to examine the whole area of financing for young people.  The Government have a choice whether we will have a housing crisis or not.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not give hope to people in need of housing.  Public representatives are well aware of the hardship, illhealth and the broken families caused by bad accommodation or no accommodation at all.  A loan of £9,000 sounds very nice but housing costs have risen dramatically.  This Government took office in the second quarter of 1977 and up to March of this year there has been an increase in housing costs of 49 per cent. That is staggering.  The cost of building materials accounts for 17 per cent of that.  Labour accounts for 65 per cent of house costs but I wonder if labour costs account for the very high increases in the past 21 months.  I do not think they do.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned CRVs, constraints, threats and so on, but in my view there is a certain amount of dishonesty here.  He is not serious about keeping house prices down.  He is merely paying political lip service.  He should examine this area again to see if the 49 per cent has been a real increase resulting from inflation and rising costs. I do not believe that argument would stand up under any circumstances because in that period the cost of materials rose by 17 per cent.  It is important to ask: where is the bulk of the <Col N="1160" /> increase going?  I do not know; I can only hazard a guess that it is going into the pockets of many builders.  Although labour costs have risen in my view they have not risen to the extent we are talking about here.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that 39 per cent of privately built houses were financed by agencies, other than those mentioned by him, who did not care if a CRV was issued?  How serious is he when he talks about CRVs?  The CIF were in touch with him about this but at the end they were blowing hot and cold because when they looked at the figures and saw that nearly 40 per cent of privately built houses were financed by private agencies this seemed a joke.  That is why I wonder if the Minister is seriously concerned that we are getting reasonable value for houses.  I do not think we are. In my opinion the Minister is not taking this seriously.  He is giving himself legislation, paying political lip service. The CIF do not put the boot in now, as was intended earlier.  The Minister would not show them this legislation because, he said, he wanted to pay us the courtesy of bringing it first before the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that but I find it very hard to do so especially when one reads statements made by different Ministers all over the country who do not care whether it would be better if those statements were first made in the House.  I resent it when the Minister uses this House to defend himself against the CIF because when it is to his advantage he or any other Ministers, will make statements of policy outside this House. I ask the Minister not to give us that kind of claptrap.  We are not fools.  It suited him to hide behind us on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn mentioned voluntary housing associations.  If we are serious about tackling housing problems we must look at every aspect of this subject and see where we get help to develop because housing is a basic need.  When Christ was born His parents could not find a roof for over their heads and He was born in a manager.</P>
    <P>I accept that housing costs are rising and that the financial constraints on the Government are rough and tough but <Col N="1161" /> the Minister's speech and the Bill do not give us any hope for the future.  This legislation enables the Minister to do this, that and the other.  Voluntary housing societies not alone must be encouraged but they must be developed. That would not be costly.  Housing aid societies should be in a position to buy old houses and refurbish them.  On the Continent they buy property and when the people die the society takes over the property.  This is a long-term situation; it does not solve any immediate problems. If we encourage such societies we will show that we are serious about developing and preserving housing stock.</P>
    <P>There are people who are prepared to give their time free to help do this but they do not have the capital.  The Government should develop the voluntary organisations.  If one goes through this city one will see a great deal of run-down property that could be purchased, developed and let to young families who are in dire need of housing, who are living with their in-laws, are suffering serious mental stress and many of whom are on valium and on numerous occasions have attempted to take their own lives.  I have no doubt that Deputy Moore has seen this in his own area&mdash;young women attempting to take their lives because of the pressures they were living under.</P>
    <P>This House and the Government have a very definite obligation to do something about this, to stand up and be counted.  We must admit that we have a problem.  We have constraints upon ourselves but we should be asking ourselves what we can do and where are there areas we can help without costing this State a vast fortune.  We have the voluntary housing agencies, the co-operatives. They are doing a job and the grants they get are miserable.  That highlights our total indifference to people who want to help themselves.  They should be given free sites and generous grants and the expertise should be made available to help these housing co-operatives. If that was done they would develop and mushroom.  We could also have housing aid societies which would buy old houses from people and when those people had died they would take <Col N="1162" /> over the houses and we would be creating a whole new housing stock.</P>
    <P>In other countries architects are involved in the provision of housing.  Of all the professional bodies architects have a very strong social conscience.  There is a fund of goodwill here that can be tapped. We could ask the architects' association to become involved in the setting up of a housing body to be financed by the Government; sites could be provided under the Derelict Sites Act.  Around Dublin there is an enormous number of derelict sites and a lot of land could be provided in that way.  I suggest that people of the calibre of architects would give generously of their time to put something into their own areas.  But nobody seems to have the will or the desire to do any of those things.  Nobody wants to take any new initiative to provide new areas of housing.  Local authorities are being run down and it behoves the people who are running them down to provide something in their place.  Otherwise we will have a problem of great magnitude in the very near future which is something none of us in this House would want to see.  If we go on as we are doing at the moment that is precisely what is going to happen.  I would ask this Government to use their initiative and develop housing for the people.</P>
    <P>Another area which is neglected is in relation to the local authorities.  They get a capital grant every year to do with it what they want to do and to build what they can with it.  We must take a serious look at the whole area of replacement. The capital grants should be used only for new developments.  Replacing and refurbishing run-down housing stock in local authority areas, particularly in Dublin, where a big clearance is being carried out, is going on using that money.  It is only when a councillor in a particular area decides to put down a motion in a local authority housing committee that action is reluctantly taken if the councillor can get sufficient support from his colleagues.  Action is only taken when the particular housing stock is a slum of the worst type.  That is what is happening at the moment.  There should be a planned programme over ten years as to what a local authority are going to <Col N="1163" /> do every year and the amount of money they are going to get to develop an area and they should knock down a building if it has to be knocked down or refurbish it if it can be refurbished.</P>
    <P>But if we decide that we should take some action in regard to certain property the people in it are being housed in new housing stock developed by the corporation out of their normal capital fund and there is absolutely no provision made whatsoever for special funding for this type of work.  This is why there is a reluctance on the part of many local authorities to go ahead and try to get areas closed because they know that if they do all those people will have to be housed in prime areas thus depriving many people who are already on the waiting list.  That is because there is no proper policy.</P>
    <P>It is important that we have a policy and the initiative must come from central Government.  They must look at it and realise that we have a major problem.  I know we have an inter-departmental committee on inner city development.  I hope&mdash;and I will be very much involved and interested&mdash;that something is going to happen in this line. Often if one wants to do nothing one sets up a committee and that looks after everything.  I do not think we need a committee to get things done in the city of Dublin.  What we need is a financial commitment.  The corporation are well aware of what is wanted.  Basically I am not against this committee and I will not knock it because hopefully it will do something useful.  It is the person who set up the committee that I want to knock because if he had gone to the local authority and told them that he was sincerely interested in the inner city and asked what was needed he would have been told that this inter-departmental committee was not needed because the very hard-working officials of Dublin Corporation and the equally hard-working councillors would have been in a position to tell him exactly what was required for this type of development.  Really it is a question of putting it on the long finger because if I ask a question in the House I will be told that the inter-departmental committee <Col N="1164" /> are looking into it and they will refer back to me in a few months time.</P>
    <P>This may be digressing from the Bill but again one does not often get an opportunity in this House to discuss this very serious problem.  People might say that this would be irrelevant to Estimates but Estimates come up and if we get an hour at them for everybody we are lucky; then they are postponed and then they die.  The day of the Estimate and the day of getting a bite at the cherry of the Estimate is gone and so when we do get an opportunity of discussing housing it is welcome.  Eighty per cent of the problems with constituents relate to housing and that is why I am glad I have the opportunity to talk on this very serious subject.  I do not think the Government are taking it seriously.  It is obvious that they do not have any policy and are leaving all this to the private developer.  They are not providing the facilities to encourage people to build their own houses and as a result we are faced with the huge problem of bad and inadequate housing.</P>
    <P>We should also try to find ways to encourage private developers to move into vacant sites in the inner city.  Such developers are in the building business for the purpose of making a profit, and I do not object to that, but if they do not see profit in the development of an inner city site they will not embark on any project there.  It is up to us to encourage them by way of tax incentives or otherwise to develop those sites.  During the last couple of years a lot of sites were left vacant because that was not the type of development to be engaged in. Such developers must be able to see a profit at the end of their work or otherwise they will not embark on such projects.  Had the proper incentives been available I have no doubt that many developers would have commenced a mixed type of development in the inner city area.  It is that type of development which is essential.  We do not want lopsided development but, unfortunately, there is not much interest in housing in the inner city along normal and balanced lines.  I raised this matter with the former Minister for Finance and also asked him <Col N="1165" /> to experiment in this direction by giving incentives to developers to erect houses in the inner city.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see some merit in the suggestions I have put forward.  I am not contending that my suggestions are revolutionary or new, but we must face the fact that we have a chronic housing shortage and a duty to provide homes for our people.  I have heard many people speaking about the great advantage it was to have our people getting married at an early age but we will have to provide housing for that young population.  If we do not do that we will effectively be forcing them to live in substandard accommodation, breeding grounds for vandalism and violence.  Then we will be failing miserably in our duty to our young people. We have a moral obligation to provide decent housing accommodation in a proper environment for our young people.</P>
    <P>I was happy to be associated with a Government&mdash;in particular the former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully&mdash;who tackled the housing problem in a serious manner.  They were not interested in the cost of such improvements; their only concern was the welfare of our people.  Over the years various inner city communities have been plugging away to get housing in their areas and we are all aware of the developments at the cattle mart, the Coombe, Clanbrassil Street, Smithfield and Ringsend, but it should be remembered that before we left office we had made a commitment to embark on those projects.  It appears that the Government have not made any further commitment to do similar work.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister in relation to the inner city development and the cost, I am sceptical about the outcome of the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on that area. It should be remembered that we are concerned about people, not bricks and mortar.  The only way to ensure that people will live in the inner city is to provide them with decent accommodation. If there is not a serious commitment on the part of the committee its establishment will amount to nothing less <Col N="1166" /> than an exercise in chicanery, which none of us wanted.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of voluntary help in regard to housing. In my constituency we are fortunate to have such a concerned group as the Iveagh Trust.  However, because of constraints they are now experiencing a serious financial situation.  Last year I was successful in my efforts to obtain a grant from Dublin Corporation to help that trust in its efforts but it is my view that we should have a more positive policy towards such organisations.  The Iveagh Trust is a non-profit making concern and they should not have to run around seeking help or wondering if they will have to cease operations because of lack of funds.  It is unfortunate that the Department are reluctant to underwrite such non-profit making concerns against losses.  The Department, if they adopted that suggestion, could appoint a representative on the board of that trust who would be in a position to scrutinise all the accounts.  The trust recently obtained an estimate of £38,000 for the repainting of their houses, an estimate which they had to reject because they did not have the money.  The result is that the housing stock of the trust is gradually deteriorating.  In housing terms such an amount of money is very small but it would help the trust to keep those houses in a proper state of repair.  Such laudable organisations should be encouraged to remain in being and keep up the standard of their houses.  We are all aware that where voluntary organisations are prepared to help the underprivileged they are whipped to death. That is an indictment of our thinking and social conscience and is alien to everything we should stand for.  The Minister should be more generous to such people because any grant given to them is a good investment.  He is giving substantial grants to repair homes, a sensible and practical approach which is long overdue, but he should also consider the voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be dominated by the Ministers for Finance and Economic Planning and Development and it is the latter Minister who appears to be calling all the shots.  It appears that the Minister for the Environment does <Col N="1167" /> not have any authority other than to put through certain legislation.  He does not appear to have any control over money. It is hard to understand why such important legislation as this was brought before the House in the last week of this session.  I cannot understand why we are being given the impression that if we do not pass it immediately the housing industry will collapse although the Bill seeks to regularise matters since 1970.  I do not believe there is any great urgency about this legislation and I trust that we will have ample opportunity to consider it in detail on Committee Stage.  This rushing by the Government epitomises their attitude to our serious social problem of housing, a problem which they are anxious to sweep under the carpet.</P>
    <P>They can have us back next week and the week after if they want that but I contend this legislation must be discussed and we must get the time to put down reasoned amendments which I hope the Minister will accept.  If he refers the Bill to a select committee I would be happy with that because we could discuss and amend it so as to get the type of legislation we all want.  Unless we get this type of co-operation from the Government I am not prepared to give the Minister the Bill quickly.  We are prepared to sit and go through it line by line to ensure we get what we and the people we represent want and expect to get.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the manner in which this Bill was brought before the House.  It epitomises the Government's attitude to housing policy.  They want to run down local authority housing and get us back to the slum conditions we thought we were getting away from.  If the Government have sense and can read the political messages that were conveyed in the past few weeks in this city, they should know the city is not too happy with them.  They may have got a mandate in 1977 but the past few weeks showed the people are not too pleased but if the Government want to pursue their merry way it is on their own heads. If they have any political &ldquo;cop&rdquo; they will sit up and take seriously the job with which they were charged&mdash;to develop <Col N="1168" /> and provide reasonable housing accommodation for the people.</P>
    <P>I shall participate in the Committee Stage but I assure the Minister that under no circumstances can he expect to get this Bill in a hurry.  I do not intend to give it because it is too serious a matter and given that serious nature the Minister should defer the Bill until the autumn.  If he does not want to do that, we are prepared to sit until it is properly debated and amended in a reasonable way.</P>

      <P>As regards Dublin and the inner city, this Government have done more and have recognised the problem more quickly than any other previous administration to the extent <Col N="1169" /> that economic planning has been given a special brief for it and voted funds for it. A recent report by the National Economic and Social Council has been produced on inner Dublin and for the first time in many years we are positively committed and the record is there now to prove that we intend to do something about it.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Brien when he says that the Bill is comprehensive and complex.  While there may be need for more discussion and possibly some minor amendments, the Opposition were given the opportunity to put forward their suggestions.  If the Bill is delayed the people it was designed to assist will suffer.  In his speech the Minister referred to the need of the less fortunate in our community.  The Minister has recognised the delays in housing the physically handicapped and he has assumed direct responsibility to ensure that action is taken in this area.  The Minister should be commended for ensuring that the less fortunate members of our community are catered for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government may have made progress in the laying of foundations but they did not commit themselves to the funding of serviced land.  The only way to control the price of houses is to have more serviced land than is needed.  The main requirement in the future is a commitment to fund serviced land.  There has been much talk about the downgrading of local authorities but the Bill recognises their importance.  In sections 8 and 9 the Minister has recognised the importance of the involvement of local authorities in the housing drive.  Section 8 of the Bill proposes an increase in home improvement grants from £200 to £600.  This is practical recognition of the need for change in this area.  The income limit for county council loans has been increased on two occasions.  When the Coalition were in power Fianna Fáil appealed to them to increase the income limit.  In my constituency the benefits of the increased income limit can be seen.  The number of loan applications confirms the success of the Government's housing policy.  There has been a great increase in the demand for the £1,000 grant.  The <Col N="1170" /> current number of applications is 9,874 as against 4,674.</P>
    <P>The Bill recognises the need for a national housing policy.  In my constituency two satellite towns are being developed and there has been a great increase in the number of local authority houses.  Deputy O'Brien should visit my constituency and see what is being done to provide local authority housing.  The overlapping of boundaries between local authorities leads to complications.  I would ask the Minister and the managers concerned to consider the matter in relation to housing in County Dublin.  Some of my constituents make payments to two local authorities&mdash;to the county council and the corporation. The different schemes and methods of payment cause confusion.  I know that the Minister has visited many areas and seen local authority and private developments. There is need for a closer working relationship between the corporation and the county council.</P>
    <P>The CRV scheme is desirable and should be supported because it assures house purchasers that they are getting value for money.  The guarantee scheme introduced by the Minister is a further assurance for first-time house purchasers.  This scheme has a number of legal stipulations built into it which ensure value for money.</P>

      <P>I do not know how much information the Deputy has on the matter already, but he can take it there will be three stages.  One of these is the establishment of a holding centre where refugees would be accommodated for a few months, and that would be established by the Red Cross.  Certain formalities would be undertaken while they were there, such as health checks and documentation.  Intermediate accommodation would be the next stage.  It is expected that they would be accommodated in the intermediate accommodation for perhaps one-and-a-half to two years.  After that the long-term integration settlement would take place. The reception of these refugees and their settlement in this country are being planned very carefully so as to cause the minimum upset to the people themselves when they come.  We will try to have as many of the necessary arrangements made to make it easier for them to settle here.</P>

It <Col N="1173" /> is now clear from what the Minister says that at least some of the delay&mdash;which I submit is inordinate&mdash;is related to the understandable difficulty of finding premises and accomodation in this country and the availability of the Government to be able to handle that in as expeditious a way as both sides of the House might like.</P>

As the person appointed by the Government to coordinate these activities, I am anxious to ensure that the best possible arrangements are made for the refugees so that we will not rush them in here and then find that they are going to suffer all sorts of problems.  We are all concerned to deal with the matter in as humane and efficient a way as possible.</P>

It is a difficult problem which must be handled properly and it will be so handled as far as the group dealing with it are concerned.  I would like the assurance of all sides of the House that they will support the best possible arrangements being made.  One Deputy has suggested that they should not be accommodated in camps.  Another Deputy made a suggestion that they be <Col N="1175" /> brought in immediately.  Talking about finding them jobs before the individuals have even been identified to us is a bit premature.  In regard to the question posed by Deputy Enright, it is expected that the 100 who will come here will consist of family groups, but the individuals have not yet been selected by the United Nations High Commissioner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Mountjoy Prison has a total serving staff of 303 and there are about 450 prisoners in the prison.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the demands being made on the other establishments manned by the prison service I am satisfied that Mountjoy has received its fair share of available staff resources.  I might point out that the number of prison staff in Mountjoy Prison and elsewhere has been increased substantially in recent years and the position is still under review.  Thus on 1 July 1977 the number of serving staff in Mountjoy was 239 and the number of prisoners 378.</P>
      <P>This is not to say I agree that the prisoner to prison officer ratio is necessarily the criterion or that I am satisfied that present staffing in the prison generally is sufficient.  However, prison staff has increased by some 40 per cent in the past two years from approximately 800 on 1 April 1977 to over 1,100 on 1 April 1979.  There is a limit to how quickly it is possible to find suitable additional staff and to recruit and train them and I believe that the rate of intake has been as high as is feasible in the period in question.  In very recent months the postal strike has caused special difficulties.</P>

      <P>It has not been possible to serve jury summonses since the commencement of the postal dispute with the result that juries have not been available for High Court actions in Dublin since 9 March 1979.  No civil jury trials have been held in Dublin since then.</P>
      <P>There were 1,748 jury actions awaiting hearing in the High Court on 31 May last, the end of the Easter law term, as compared with a total of 1,411 at the end of the 1978 Easter law term.</P>
      <P>The right to trial by jury of a High Court action is provided by law and in the absence of jurors the courses open to litigants are to opt for trial without jury or to have their cases adjourned.  The Trinity law term commenced on 13 June and the President of the High Court has directed that outstanding jury actions are to be listed for trial as from 26 June with an indication that they would be tried without a jury unless a party asked to have a case adjourned to next term. So far applications for adjournment have been made in about 70 per cent of the cases listed.</P>
      <P>Criminal trials in the District, Circuit and Central Criminal Courts have not been affected by the postal dispute and, while there has been a falling off in the amount of civil business coming into court offices, the business that is being received is being attended to.</P>

      <P>The Courts Bill was introduced in the Dáil last week and I will be dealing with it in the Seanad this afternoon.  It is hoped to appoint three new judges under that Bill.  This will help to alleviate the very serious backlog.  The <Col N="1182" /> problem is the non-servicing of summonses to prospective jurors.  Consequently there has been a delay from the setting down to the date of the hearing. The time lag has increased from nine months to 16 months.  This is quite a serious matter.</P>

Taking all that into account I would say some time in the near future. There is a certain urgency about it.  I am not privy to the creation of judges, as the Deputy will appreciate.  I do not want to mislead him or the House in relation to when those judges will be appointed.</P>

      <P>The Minister said last week that by next October the backlog will have reached the order of 16 months.  Does he consider that, in some circumstances, it is possible to argue that a decision relating to a particular award after that length of time might be so out of date in relation to the alleged crime involved that it could do less than total justice?  Is there any way in which consideration can be given to the intervening period in the actual decision?</P>

The award will be made on the day and that will take account of the time lag.  From the experience of some practitioners the longer the time of the hearing from the date of an accident the more lucrative the award can be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on 9 November last in a written reply to a similar question, recommendations made by visting committees receive careful consideration and frequently it is possible to adopt them.  As far as St. Patrick's Institution is concerned, many of the proposals made over the years by the visting committee to that institution have been implemented.  Again, however, I must emphasise, as I did in my earlier reply, that it is not possible for me, as it was not possible for my predecessors, to accept some of those recommendations.</P>

      <P>The educational aspects of the report were implemented to some degree.  Other aspects were considered. Unfortunately they were not found to be acceptable.  There was one grotesque suggestion in one of the reports&mdash;that is a personal opinion. There was a recommendation which would give the visiting committees appellate jurisdiction over the Governor and put members of the staff including the Governor in the position of having to appear before the committee and defend themselves against accusations by a prisoner in the presence of the prisoner who, according to the recommendation, would be entitled to the assistance of a member of the committee as an advocate.

On the question of operating the school during the summer months, there is no doubt that is a desirable objective.  It is hoped to achieve it this summer.  Every effort is being made to ensure that the problem will be resolved this summer.  The interim arrangements made for 1978 did not work out.

I would ask the people to take this opportunity of showing concern for other people's problems, those of the 26,000 adopted children and the adoptive parents.  Here is an opportunity for the nation to come together, get off our collective social consciences and go out and do something on behalf of other people.

      <P>The Prison Officers' Association, like any other staff association, frequently puts forward claims of greater or lesser dimensions on behalf of some or all of its members.  The submission and negotiation of claims is a continuous process and it is never possible to say that an association is fully satisfied with the position at any particular time.  On the contrary it appears to be reasonable to assume that a staff association will always have some claim or request on hands.  I believe that offers recently made on my behalf in response to a number of requests by the Prison Officers' Association have been reasonable and that they have been welcomed by the association.

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice the reason the two fingerprint experts involved in the British ambassador murder case, were guilty of not maintaining the rigid standards in cases of fingerprint identification, if, as documentation appears to show, the identification was inconclusive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The only documentation to which the Question could relate is certain Departmental documentation which I mentioned in previous replies and I did not suggest, as the question seems to imply, that that documentation &ldquo;appears to show&rdquo; that the identification made in relation to the murder of the British Ambassador was inconclusive.  In fact, as may be seen from my reply of 23 May 1978, I explicitly drew attention to the fact that the documentation related to a particular time and that there was conflicting evidence as to what happened later.  In other words, the documentation was identified as being evidence, important evidence in my view, but not proof either actual or apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This of course does not alter the fact that the assessment made by the Garda authorities, taking account of all the evidence, was that those members who alleged that the identification had at some stage been held out as being conclusive had not substantiated their allegation.  I assume, therefore, that the Deputy would wish the question to be interpreted as asking why, despite such an assessment, I said in my reply of 23 May 1978 that the rigid standards that ought <Col N="1192" /> to have been maintained were not maintained. There is no contradiction involved. Independent expert advice indicates that, on the material before them, the two members concerned were not justified in drawing even the qualified conclusion which they themselves admit that they drew and reported to their authorities.</P>
    <P>I regret that in giving this reply I have had to repeat this critical reference to two identifiable members of the force who have had to go through a period of considerable strain because extremely serious allegations against them of criminal misconduct had to be investigated, an investigation which ended with a decision by the DPP that the institution of criminal proceedings was not warranted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that he now considers the identification to have been conclusive, or is he saying it was inconclusive?</P>

      <P>Strictly speaking, a veto has never been used.  That is to say, there has been no occasion when a question <Col N="1196" /> was put to the vote in the council and action was blocked because a member state imposed a veto.  Since 1965 the Luxembourg &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Compromise&rdquo; has been observed according to which council decisions are taken unanimously where very important interests of one or more member states are involved.</P>
      <P>What happens in practice is that when it is clear that a member state is not willing to agree to a proposal which it sees as being contrary to its very important national interests, the proposal is not pursued for the time being or is withdrawn.  Though this is not a veto in the formal sense it has, of course, an equivalent effect.</P>
      <P>On a limited number of occasions since 1965, a very important national interest has been formally declared by a member state and for that reason no vote has been taken since unanimity would not be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>More frequently, however, it has become clear in discussion at working group or council level that one or more member states would withhold agreement to a proposal, which has, therefore, not been proceeded with, although the member state in question has not in fact declared that a very important national interest was involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Foreign Ministers of the Nine EEC member states, including Ireland, meeting in Paris on 18 June, issued a statement on the refugee problem in South-East Asia, in the course of which they stated that they had decided to approach the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees with a view to the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations to study practical measures to resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>Naturally, the situation to which the Deputy refers, that is the danger to the lives of refugees from Vietnam now seeking to land in countries in the area, would be among the matters to be treated by a conference.  We, together with our partners in the Nine, are anxious that no person should be forced out of his/her own country.  Equally, however, we consider that they should be free to leave, if they should wish to do so.  We are concerned that this tragic problem should be approached by all countries in a genuine humanitarian spirit.</P>
      <P>With regard to the timing of the conference, it is not possible at this juncture to say how soon it might take place although we would wish it to be in the near future.</P>
      <P>The members of the EEC, including Ireland, are alredy contributing to the relief of the problem, both by admitting refugees and by contributing financially to UNHCR.  In addition, the EEC Commission recently contributed an extra 5 million units of account to help the refugees.  The Deputy will be aware that the discussions in Paris to which I have referred took place subsequent to the reported statements by the Vice-Premier of Malaysia about the further admission of refugees to that country&mdash;some of which I understand he now alleges to have been wrongly reported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have decided to admit 100 Indo-Chinese refugees into Ireland, and have contributed financially to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for their relief programmes in the region.  We will be keeping under close review how best we can continue to aid the refugees, whether <Col N="1198" /> by direct contributions to the UNHCR or, in the light of our experience in settling the first group of refugees, whether it would be possible for us to admit and integrate further numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Vice-Premier stated that the refugees, on landing, would be shot but that he later climbed down because of public opinion?  Does the Minister agree that it was only because of public opinion, and because that country did not want to have bodies littered all over the place in front of television crews, that instead of shooting those people, they will send them out to sea where they will drown and there will not be any evidence of their drowning?</P>

The main responsibility for the problem&mdash;I express this in a personal manner&mdash;lies with the former masters of the unfortunate Far Eastern countries, particularly Vietnam&mdash;I refer specifically to France and America.  These were the former colonial masters of these two countries and they bear a large burden of the responsibility for what is happening.</P>

Does the Minister agree that in the future, when this matter is being written about, the horrible loss of life which is occurring will bear a minor but a similar resemblance to the famine in Ireland and what the Nazis did to the Jews?  Are we going to urge the United Nations to have this convention held? Are we pressing the United States, France and Britain to ensure they do something more than they are doing because at the moment they are only doing the bare minimum.</P>

      <P>The Passport Office and the staff there have come in for a lot of criticism over the years.  I would like, in defence of the Passport Office and the staff there, to pay a special tribute to them.  They work extremely hard.  It is only fair to place on the record that the <Col N="1201" /> Passport Office issue a passport on the same day to people who have to make long trips and who are otherwise unable to have their passports collected in time for their journeys.  In other words, people can have their passports issued on the same day.  A system of on-the-spot renewal of five year passports introduced late in 1978 also means that people who call to the Passport Office can have their passports renewed while they wait.  People receiving passports on the day they apply for them together with people seeking renewal usually number about 350 people per day.  In addition, each day between 600 and 650 new passports are collected by callers at the public office.  It can be seen that this staff, who have been subject to criticism in recent years, are an extremely hard-working and efficient staff.  I have taken the opportunity, having special responsibility for this area, of making arrangements for the Office of Public Works to have a post box installed to make it easier for people to deposit their passports in the Passport Office when they arrive in town after hours.  The public office is open from 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. and it does not close for lunch time. They are very hard-working and dedicated civil servants.</P>

The Minister referred in his reply to over 600 callers a day.  How many staff are there to cope with that number?  I presume that the postal applications will be dealt with when the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs finally gets the post going.</P>

Despite these difficulties, the elections were conducted with a high degree of efficiency and I would like to take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the performance of the returning officers concerned.</P>
      <P>Because of the absence of polling cards some electors experienced certain difficulty in ascertaining where they should vote but these were isolated instances and in the vast majority of cases no such difficulty arose.</P>
      <P>As at previous elections, there were reports of errors in the register of electors and, where details were given, the reports are being investigated.  At this stage I have no evidence to suggest that the register in any area was seriously defective.  I should add that in the conduct of elections returning officers are independent authorities answerable only to the courts.</P>

      <P>Leaving aside the ritual tributes&mdash;we seem to be up to our knees in them today&mdash;despite the Minister's answer does he agree that there was unprecedented confusion in the recent local government and European election? Many complaints were given to candidates of all parties on election day and since then and there was massive public dissatisfaction with many facets of the <Col N="1204" /> organisation of that campaign.  Will the Minister accept that as a statement of fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to polling cards, we went to much expense to advertise because of the postal strike.  I admit there were difficulties but from my knowledge of the situation they were exaggerated grossly.  There was one instance which I heard quoted publicly of a whole housing estate in Baldoyle being left off the register.  The fact is the people were not housed in that estate when the electoral list was being compiled and therefore they could not have been on the electoral list for that area.  There were these kinds of complaints; I am only giving that one instance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the conduct of the election, that is the business of the returning officer.  A voting scheme is set up by a local authority but the physical location of the polling station is the business of the returning officer.  Admittedly there were complaints and people were entitled to complain.  The movement of population in Dublin from one area to another area is quite common and it is bound to mean that people will not be too familiar with where they can vote.  In many instances the parties were able to sort out the complaints to some extent by helping voters to find their polling stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The electoral list is revised every year. People are paid to do this.  There is adequate advertising done to make people aware that they should ensure they are on the voters' list.  The relevant date is 15 September.  A draft register comes out in late November.  People can still check at the local post office or Garda station whether they are on the draft register. The final exercise in compiling the voters' list is the revision courts which take place in February.  Here the final decisions are made only where there are objections and occasionally people have to be added to the list.  I would recommend <Col N="1205" /> to all political parties that they take an interest through their organisations in the compiling of the register, particularly when the draft register comes out.  This would eliminate many of the complaints that people are not on the register.  Many people do not bother to fill up the necessary form that is sent to their home each year.  There are always complaints about the register. There could be a printer's error but that is very rare.  The political parties have a definite role to play where the people who are paid to compile the register fall down on the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has raised many issues in his reply.  I should like three specific answers.  Will he tell the House how much money the Government spent on the advertising campaign?

Will the Minister look into the efficiency of the revision courts that are set for a particular time and place but do not take place?  Further will he look into the question of whether there is collusion between some of the <Col N="1206" /> political parties and some of the revision court people?

With regard to extending the time of the revision court, it may be worth having look at that matter&mdash;and I will have look at it&mdash;in order to give a greater <Col N="1207" /> span in between.  With regard to some points made by Deputy Blaney, the usual people employed and paid to compile the electoral list were the rate collectors. That has always been the case.  If they are not doing it efficiently there is a cure for that.  The Garda Síochána have a function with regard to checking it and the people themselves have the function of filling in the necessary forms that come to each elector every year.  If they do not they should, because the local council are obliged to ensure that all electors get the necessary envelopes. This is a function of the council.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, which has been put before the House in the last days of this session, is very important.  I agree with my colleagues who said there is no way in which a Bill of this kind should be rushed through this House for the purpose of conveniencing any of us who would like to go on our holidays.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains many new sections and changes in administrative practices. One section deals with a question I have always felt very strongly about: the idea that certain things should be dealt with by ministerial order in future and that the particular sections of an Act passed in 1966 should be changed.  First, ministerial orders must be placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and there is chance of debating them within 21 days.  Very often this is a most unsatisfactory way of dealing with matters of this kind.  Second, the Minister feels it would be better if the Minister in charge at any particular time had the right to deal with, for instance, the size of grants and so on, without having to come before the House.  In this case if specific reference had been made in the Bill they could have been dealt with because most of us agree that that is a good idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many points in the Bill that have to be teased out during the Committee Stage.  This is very much a Committee Stage Bill, despite the fact that we <Col N="1229" /> have had long speeches here, and mine will not be too short either.</P>
    <P>This Bill attempts to copperfasten Government policy on housing.  While I will not blame the Minister, the Government must take the full responsibility for what they are doing.  The Minister comes into the House as their representative.  I would hate to think that he firmly believes the line being taken by the Government in regard to housing is correct. I listened to the people who spoke today, particularly Deputy Lawlor.  It was obvious, as he pointed out, that he was not here when the previous legislation was passed and that he was not here when the previous legislation was passed and that he did not know as much about housing as other Deputies.  To me he appeared to know very little about housing. There is no point in talking about the fact that Dublin city and county lines run together and that there is difficulty in allocating houses, deciding on requirements or looking for sites.  I appointed a housing co-ordinator with the approval of my Government who agreed that this was necessary.  He did an excellent job and prevented all this messing around which was occuring previously and is occurring again.  What has happened since the change of Government?  We do not hear very much about the housing co-ordinator.</P>
    <P>I agree also with Deputy F. O'Brien who talked about inner city development. The Minister is talking about the way in which housing, particularly local authority housing, is being dealt with.  As far as Dublin city is concerned the only housing schemes under way were approved during the time of the National Coalition Government when I was Minister for Local Government.  This development was possible in some cases because I sanctioned CPOs which my predecessor and his predecessor in the Fianna Fáil party as Ministers had refused to sanction.  What is going to happen now to the inner city?  The Minister and other speakers from those benches have said that sites are too dear. Is that story to be used as an excuse to prevent any further development in the centre of Dublin?  I am not a Dublin man, but I believe it would be a shame if the action taken by Dublin Corporation <Col N="1230" /> with the active encouragement of the National Coalition Government to try to rebuild Dublin city centre is to be stymied now because somebody says that it is costing too much to buy the sites.</P>
    <P>Two angles of that have to be examined. One is the fact that building on the edge of the city will eventually cost a lot more than building in the city centre. We will have the cluttered streets and the lack of schools and all the facilities which were necessary and which were provided in the inner city, if people are moved out from there.  Apart from that, people are entitled to live where they have always lived, if at all possible.</P>
    <P>The second angle is the question of the cost of those sites.  When I was Minister I said that something should be done about this.  Possibly it would have been, because I felt very strongly on this question of the cost of sites.  People bought old coal-yards, tumbledown houses and so on for a few shillings 30 or 40 years ago and now are looking for £1 million for those sites which they got for almost nothing.  The Kenny report, which was presented to me after I had taken office, dealt only with the perimeter of the cities and towns and did not deal with the main points which were the city and town centres.  In Dublin, Cork, Galway and all towns and villages throughout the country there are thousands of sites which could and should be used.  The reason that they have not been used is that the Department of the Environment have not taken the initiative. I bear my share of blame for it, but Fianna Fáil, who were in office for a long time before I was and have been in office again for two years now, must take the major share of the blame for not doing something about this.  Why should derelict sites in this city be left as an eyesore with tumbledown houses near the city centre?  Surely the very least that could be done would be to impose some type of taxation on those derelict sites. That might force the owners either to build on them or sell them to the corporation who should build on them. When we were in office we made provision to do this but it was not proceeded with.  Perhaps we had not the time.  In <Col N="1231" /> future the people of Dublin should be housed in these places and not out on the perimeter of the city.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lawlor has said that the whole thing is a question of money.  I know how much it costs to build local authority or any other type of houses.  A tremendous amount of money is required, but to get that money first of all it is necessary to be prepared to consider housing a priority.  I suggest that the present Government do not consider the housing of ordinary people as a priority in their programme.  It is a question of whether the money to be provided is going to be provided in the proper place. I make no apology for allocating the lion's share of the money given to local authorities in my time to Dublin city and, to a lesser degree, to Cork city. That was where the big problem was. Despite that, all local authorities throughout the country found that they were gradually getting rid of their waiting list.  According to statistics issued by the present Government after they had taken office, 78 per cent of the people looking for local authority houses a little over 12 months ago consisted of two in family.  This the Government used as an argument to suit themselves. Indeed, it is a great tribute to their predecessors although I am sure it is not intended in that way.  If they had continued on that basis we would have reached the stage where&mdash;although we would not do away with the housing list if we were going to have a living city because there would always be people coming along who would qualify for houses&mdash;at least we would have cut down the list to the minimum.  Instead of that the list is growing again.  The amount of money given to local authorities last year and particularly this year for building houses in relation to the present cost of houses means that the number of people rehoused will be less and less as the years go by.  As long as Fianna Fáil are there&mdash;which will not be very long but they will be there for two and a half years anyway&mdash;they will continue to reduce the number of houses being built by local authorities.</P>
    <P>In November 1978 I introduced the <Col N="1232" /> low rise mortgage scheme.  That scheme properly administered is the only bright light I see.  It is the only hope being offered by the present Government because they have continued it for the people who are unable to get local authority houses and who are being encouraged to build their own.  When the scheme was introduced as an experiment my intention was that it should apply to a married couple who had been 12 months on the housing list of the local authority and provided that they had one child at the time they applied.  Possibly I was at some fault.  I am not prepared to say that the officials, who are excellent people, put something into the scheme which I did not intend, but the result was that a lot of people who were married and who were in a position at that time to consider building houses were ruled out.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the present Minister altered the conditions slightly but it is difficult to understand his thinking on it. In his alteration of the scheme he said that it should apply to people where there were two in family, parent and child.  This was intended to deal with the one-parent family but it would have been far better if he had said simply that it applies where two people are concerned. People who are married, whether they have a family or not, are entitled to housing and if they are unable to provide it directly out of their own pocket, then money should be provided for them by somebody.  The local authority can do it with the aid of the low rise mortgage.  I suggest that this alteration in the scheme be made.  This will relieve to some extent the claims of a number of people who at present see no hope of ever being rehoused.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly talks about the co-operatives who are building houses and one in particular operates mainly in his own county doing an excellent job. Father Bohan's group have been working very hard.  Legislation should be devised, not to give them £6,000 for the purpose of helping them along, but to give co-operatives like them a substantial amount of money which will ensure that they will at least be able to continue building the houses.  The biggest trouble with those schemes is that their cash <Col N="1233" /> flow is always too tight.  If they had a certain amount of money on which they could operate they would always have a flow which would keep them going, but when they build a scheme they have to wait until the scheme is almost completed before they have enough money to do anything with it.  It would be an excellent idea if something could be done to ensure that these people are helped. During my period in office legislation did not enable me to give them the money I thought they needed.  I mentioned Father Bohan's group because they are doing a very good job and there are many others who deserve to be helped.</P>
    <P>The amount of money being made available to local authorities for housing is so small when compared with building costs that it is ridiculous to suggest that the Government have any interest in keeping up local authority housing schemes.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said this morning that a definite effort is being made to reduce them considerably and this is also my opinion.  The number of local authority houses built in 1976 was 7,263; in 1977 it was 6,333 and in 1978 it was 6,073.  Where do we go from that? Figures go down on a sliding scale. There is no point in saying to people who apply for a local authority house that they are being put on a list or that they will get an SDA loan.  The amount of money available last year and this year for SDA loans is so small that it is of no use to the large number of people looking for houses.  I have figures of the number of people who availed of loans and the figures given by the Minister for last year as compared with previous years.  He gives the impression that he is comparing like with like but this is not the case.  There was a means test applying the loans to people with a reasonable income as against something which was promised to everybody, no matter what the income.  It is not right that this should be done.</P>
    <P>If someone comes to me as a public representative and tells me that he badly needs rehousing I must advise him to go to the local authority and apply for an SDA loan.  The Minister has recently made a regulation confining these loans <Col N="1234" /> to people with an income in the region of £80 per week.  The amount of the loan is £9,000 and the repayments amount to about £22 per week.  Then these people must look for a suitable site.  Even if the site is provided by the local authority it can cost from £1,200 to £2,500.  Prices on the open market start at £2,000 and end up anywhere, depending on the number of sites available in the area.  The loan of £9,000 is not given until the house is completed.  They must find a builder who will construct the house on the site.  They will have the £9,000, less the cost of the site, plus whatever money they have saved.  Young people cannot save much money at present.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing nowadays as a house costing £10,000 or £12,000.  One would be lucky to find a house under £16,000 and the cost of an ordinary three-bedroomed house is between £15,000 and £20,000.  Of what use is a loan of £9,000 to someone who is earning only slightly more than £80 per week?  Such a person may qualify for a low-rise mortgage but if this is not the case he cannot get the money to build a house.  I am sure the Minister has had the experience of going around the country and seeing the type of houses being built.  There is a rather strange phenomenon at present.  Ordinary houses are no longer being built but there are many luxury houses under construction in the £40,000-£100,000 bracket.  Ten years ago a luxury house might have cost £20,000 but such houses are now being sold at these exorbitant prices.  The two-house family is now nearly as common as the two-car family.  People with money are buying property but the small man cannot get the accommodation to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>In bringing in this legislation the Minister had a golden opportunity to deal with problems of this kind.  He should have taken firm steps to deal with the question of site value and the exorbitant demands being made by people in cities and towns for sites which they acquired for very little.  He should have ensured that local authorities were allowed, as previously, to build houses for those who need them.</P>
    <P>There is reference in the Bill to an inspection <Col N="1235" /> by a medical officer of the accommodation of people who require housing.  It is suggested that it would shorten proceedings if that procedure were done away with and left to the discretion of the local authorities.  I do not know if the Minister has examined this point.  I do not want to see a situation arising again where county councillors will be giving out houses.  I believe that the officials, on expert advice, are the people to allocate houses.  That has been the system.  I do not believe that someone who is not a medical officer should be entitled to carry out this function. Council officials are the same as the rest of us and have their own definite political views.  The onus should not be put on them but should be allowed to rest on the medical officer who gives professional advice.  The fact that medical officers may have been switched to the health boards should not prevent them from giving advice.  The Minister should examine this point.  I do not want to see again the racket which existed many years ago where someone who wanted a house got it because he lobbied councillors.  That was before my time as a member of a county council, but it was done.  The situation has now changed drastically and I would hate to see the re-creation of the old system.</P>
    <P>Veiled references have been made to the standard of local authority houses. In my time in this House I have become used to people flying a kite to see what the reaction will be.  Fianna Fáil have always been very good at kite flying.  A few little kites have been appearing about the standard of houses&mdash;that they are costing too much because the standard is too high.  When I took over I found the standard was too low.  It was an abominable standard, the worst possible standard, not only for local authority houses but for the cheaper private houses as they were then.  The general standard had dropped considerably.</P>
    <P>When the local authorities started to build decent houses people were ashamed to build poor type houses beside them, and the standard went up generally.  I should not like to see us going back, in the interests of the economy, <Col N="1236" /> to the type of houses built by my predecessor.  I handed over a good standard to the Minister.  He has maintained it up to now, and I hope he will continue to maintain it.  Apart from anything else, the cost of repairing substandard houses is so high that I am sure the people in the Department of the Environment have headaches from trying to keep them in a habitable conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Environment is in the House.  I should like to remind him of statements he made when he was on this side of the House.  It was usual for him to say county councils were not getting enough money.  He had a favourite one about Kerry County Council and the small number of houses being built in Kerry, about 300, or something like that.  The next time he goes into the Department he should look at how many houses were built in Kerry last year and how many will be built this year.  When he is in Opposition again he may be a little more careful about making those charges.</P>
    <P>He is not the only one.  People from Dublin suggested all they had to do was to get into office and millions of pounds would be made available for housing. The effort we made was a good one and it should be kept up, but it looks as if it will not be kept up.  The Taoiseach said in December 1976 that we were building too many local authority houses in relation to the number of houses being built. He has lived up to this word.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of sections in the Bill deal with things done from 1970 on, and legislation had to be introduced eventually to legalise them.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lalor, asked why we did not do this when we were in office.  That sounds a little hollow having regard to the practice which has built up over the years.  At a certain stage the officials say: &ldquo;It is time this was regularised.  A Bill should be introduced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am interested in section 2 dealing with devolution of the administration of house grant schemes.  I devolved it to the local authority in County Meath because it was the one I knew best and to Longford, Westmeath and Donegal for water and sewerage schemes to have them administered at local level.  I felt <Col N="1237" /> this would lead to an administrative saving. I also felt it would speed up the inspection of the work, because the engineer who is going along the road every day is most likely to know whether the housing scheme or the water and sewerage scheme is being done properly and this saves bringing somebody down from Dublin to inspect it.  The Minister would be well advised to consider devolving the administration of these schemes again.  I did it on a pilot scheme and I would advise the Minister to do it on a general scale.  I know there are difficulties. I know certain officials would feel they would be put out of a job. Knowing how understaffed the Department are, I am sure there would be no difficulty whatever in finding adequate employment for them.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with co-operative housing.  I would be prepared to give the Minister any help I possible could in assisting these bodies because I believe they are doing a great job.  They are pioneers.  I am very proud that the first co-operative scheme was carried out in the village in which I live, Laytown.  It was an excellent effort.  The co-operation of the local authority and the officials of the Department was forthcoming.  A site was got from the local authority at a reasonable cost.  The houses are there and will be there long after all of us have passed on.  A number of other schemes have been carried out in the area since. All over the country we have these co-operative schemes.</P>
    <P>Sections 4, 5 and 6 replace sections 15, 16, 18 and 21 to 32 of the Housing Act, 1966, as amended by the Housing Act of 1970, and sections 2 and 3 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1952.  That may be all right, but I am always very doubtful about giving any Minister the right to do things by order which previously were done under legislation passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  While in this case some of the things referred to are necessary, I do not believe this is a good thing generally and I would be a little careful about supporting it.  The question of the provision of the grants and so on could be dealt with specifically rather than including them in a blanket section as has been done in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> Section 4 provides a statutory basis for the new house grants payable by the Minister.  As I pointed out, the Minister has drawn the long bow, because he stated that between July 1977, when he introduced the £1,000 new house grant scheme for first-time owner occupiers and the end of May 1979, 17,389 grants were approved and 9,874 were paid, and 4,674 grants were approved under the old scheme during the year ended 30 June 1977.  There was a means test then. It appears from my reading of the Bill that it is again proposed to introduce a means test.  If not, perhaps the Minister will say so.  According to the wording it appears some type of means will be introduced.</P>
    <P>The regulations which govern the payment of the £1,000 grant have been tightened up considerably.  Many people complain to me that they have been ruled out for one reason or another. Before the £1,000 grant scheme was introduced those engaged in agriculture, under a certain valuation, farm workers and people in substandard houses could get a grant of £900.  So, for those people who need a grant, all that is involved is an extra £100.  This makes the £1,000 which dazzled so many eyes before the 1977 General Election look very small. When we compare the £1,000 grant with the cost of a new house, it is a very small State contribution and offers little encouragement. At the time when it was £325 and there was supplementary grants from local authorities up to £700, one could build a house for £3,000 which at present would cost about £15,000.  If one relates those two, one can see how much use the £1,000 grant is even if somebody qualified for it.</P>
    <P>House improvement grants could have been increased.  I was speaking to a widow a few days ago.  She wanted a very simple thing done.  She lives in a three-bedroomed council cottage and wanted to build a small bedroom, kitchen, put a septic tank in&mdash;she already has water&mdash;and build a small porch in the front because she lives close to the sea.  The air is strong particularly in spring.  The quotation for the job was £9,000.  To say to her she would get £600 of a grant is not a lot of encouragement to get her to improve her housing <Col N="1239" /> conditions.  That is what we should relate the grants to and not to the fact that they were £300 or £400 before and are now £600.  The question is, what incentive is it?  With the cost of building materials at present it is very small.  Having improvement works instead of reconstruction is like changing the name of the Department of Local Government to the Department of the Environment: it does the same thing.  It does not matter whether it is improvement works or reconstruction, it will not put another shilling into anybody's pocket.  When it is called something in 1960 it should be called the same thing in 1979.</P>
    <P>Section 5(1) will enable the Minister to pay a grant to a housing authority for improvement works carried out to their rented houses.  That is an excellent idea. I would like to see it in operation and know what the grant will be paid for. Will any improvement be made in it? Will this apply to houses where no fireplaces are provided?  I introduced a grant which helped&mdash;between the local authority and the Department it reached £400 on a £600 job or two-thirds&mdash;to provide a fireplace in a number of these houses.  Is it now proposed to update that?  Will something be done to increase the amount of money available and allow the local authority to put fireplaces in their own houses?  At present they do not do so.</P>
    <P>I remember the taunts from this side of the House about how backward we were on 16 May 1974 when I made an order regulating that every new house would have to have a fireplace.  I was told about the wealth of oil in the country and in the world and that it was stupid to put a fireplace in a house.  It would contaminate the atmosphere and who would want a fireplace instead of central heating?  Now who wants central heating instead of a fireplace?  I should like to know whether the Minister intends to include this in the grant which he is prepared to pay for improvement work.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to a rented scheme owned by Guinness Trust.  If they are taken over by the local authority can any provision be made?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> Will the Minister consider that and ensure that this Bill will be wide enough to cover that?  Old houses which have not received a lot of attention from landlords for many years may require a lot of repairs.  I would be glad if the local authority would take them over and ensure the necessary repairs are carried out.</P>
    <P>As far as consolidating the existing stock of houses is concerned, no Government have ever done enough about that.  There are a lot of houses that could be made habitable if the necessary effort was made.  It would eventually save the State a lot of money.  Enough thought has not been given to that.  I do not mean that another committee should be set up to look into it.  Committees are there when nobody wants to take any action.  They are a grand way of giving an impression that something is being done.  We must take the bull by the horns and do the job.  We started it in the inner city and I ask the Minister to continue it.  There are houses which need to be repaired or they will fall down.  If the people who own them are unable to repair them, the onus is on the local authority and, through the local authority, on the State, to have the repairs carried out.</P>
    <P>The Bill can affect rented accommodation in a big way.  A lot of accommodation is wasted.  People who own houses are sometimes living themselves in appalling conditions because their houses are let at a low rent to someone who could afford to pay much more. One the other hand, there is the rack-rent landlord who is charging more than he should for poor accommodation.  I am disappointed that some effort has not been made to grasp this nettle.  Now is the time to do it.  If we put it on the long finger it means that in a few years somebody else will bring a new Bill before the House and someone else will be making the same suggestion.</P>
    <P>There was a sensible suggestion made a few years ago that young people and families living in Ballymun should be rehoused and places like Ballymun Towers should be used to house young people coming from the country and living and working in the city who would be prepared to pay a reasonable rent for <Col N="1241" /> decent accommodation.  That is a pipe dream now and we will not get very far with it.  The loan of £200 which can be increased to £600 is a help but it is only a small one.  Some local authorities have been giving loans which allow people to repair old houses.  However, not enough local authorities are prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>On the question of subsidies to local authorities towards the annual loan charges incurred by them for sites for private houses, it is wrong for local authorities, when they get such loan charges, to charge those who are building houses on those sites.  They should charge them a reasonable amount compared with sites outside.  If the people had a few pounds a week less and, instead of having £81, had £79, the local authority would be responsible for rehousing them.  It is a bit much when the local authority, after pointing that out to the applicant, charge £1,500 or £2,000 for a serviced site.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about having made arrangements to increase the supply of serviced land by increasing substantially the allocation for sanitary services this year.  He said that local authorities had been asked last August to consider possible land reserves with a view to making serviced sites available for private housing.  If the Minister would like me to go through it, I have got the answer to a question I asked last week.  It directly contradicts his statement about giving more money for sanitary services.  The amount of money given for sanitary services this year is very much lower than in previous years. I will take my own constituency, Meath. In 1976 the figure was £585,000; in 1975 it was £468,000; in 1978 it was £446,000; and in 1979 it was £475,000. Talk about inflation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only one local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give the whole lot.  I will take Clare.  In 1974 the figure was £160,000; in 1975 it was £358,000; in 1976 it was £422,000; in 1977 it was £631,000; in 1978 it was £426,000; and in 1979 it was £218,000. If we go right through the whole lot we will see that the direct opposite has been <Col N="1242" /> happening.  Serviced sites will not be provided in that way.  Despite all the noise that was made when the Government were on this side of the House about the lack of serviced land, we finished up with much more land available for houses than had been there in 1973.  I am all in favour of making serviced sites available.</P>
      <P>On section 11, the Minister said the Bill would provide a statutory basis for low-rise mortgages and he said he had modified the scheme so as to enable certain two-person families to qualify, families comprising one parent and one child.  I suggest that the Minister should alter that so as to facilitate married couples without children.  I introduced that scheme in 1976.  I do not agree that a married couple without a family should not be entitled to a house.</P>
      <P>There is the question of the provision of money for private housing.  I believe the amount available for SDA loans is far too small and that the amount of money which can be borrowed is too far below the cost of building a house because of the tremendous change in the last two years.  Recently we have been hearing about the latest hike in interest rates which were already too high.  Some years ago we passed legislation which updated building society law which had been covered by legislation 103 years old.  We know what the members of the present Government said about that Bill when it going through.  Luckily I got it enacted nearly three years ago and I suggest that the regulations provided for in that Bill should be adhered to strictly. No matter what happens we should try to ensure that building societies will not be permitted to increase their rates unduly.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong if we allowed building societies to increase their rates to such an extent that people who borrowed from them years ago would be paying three times the interest rate.  It is bad enough at present.  I cannot understand why some countries can have very low interest rates when we allow ours to hit the ceiling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is being made here for people living in Donaghmede, Tallaght and elsewhere in Dublin who qualify for normal local authority house purchase <Col N="1243" /> loans at a fixed rate of interest of 9 per cent.  Dublin Corporation, then under a Fianna Fáil Minister, had not got the money but said to would-be purchasers that it was all right to get the money from building societies.  Then they forced them to pay the building society rates which were much higher than the people had expected.  One of the last things I did before leaving office was to arrange that these people would have the rate pushed back to 9 per cent.  I am glad the Minister has seen the validity of that. The local authority should always be given the necessary money to give loans to people looking for them who are entitled to them, and guarantees to building societies should be made good.</P>
    <P>The question of carrying out work on pre-sale local authority houses was mentioned. The procedure whereby tenants would do the work themselves had been in operation for many years and it was worked out pretty well.  Tenants are often able to do a much better job than contractors, whose main interest would be to get paid for the work.  The 1966 Act refers to structural repairs and if local authorities stuck strictly to structural repairs very little would be done. One could say that round towers are structurally sound, but would anybody be able to live in them?  There are local authorities who do not stick strictly to the letter of the law in this respect.  There should be a general directive that as many repairs would be done as are reasonably necessary and not just structural repairs.  Deputy Blaney was Minister at that time and I am surprised he allowed that Bill to be enacted.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to section 16 in regard to improvement grants for houses for the mentally and physically handicapped. The general impression was given that nothing had been done for such people until the present Government took office.  I am proud that the officials who were working under me in the Department agreed that a percentage of all local authority houses&mdash;it became 10 per cent ultimately&mdash;should be provided for old folk.  In many cases they were people who would never have got houses though they were living in appalling conditions. <Col N="1244" /> I provided such things as sliding doors, ramps for wheelchairs, a system which allowed physically handicapped to get in and out of baths&mdash;in other words, an enlightened approach.  I should be glad if the Minister would ensure this would be continued.  I have already dealt with the question of reports by medical officers.  This also should be continued.</P>
    <P>I am a bit doubtful about the provision in regard to sales.  At the moment housing authorities have discretion under section 90 of the 1966 Act in regard to the sale of any of their houses.  I go all the way with the Minister that old folks' houses should not pass out of the hands of local authorities.  I would not agree that a house of this kind should be passed on to a person who would almost certainly sell it.</P>
    <P>I found things happening in Dublin in regard to houses which were being used by the corporation as rent offices.  In such cases I found the greatest reluctance on the part of the corporation to allow such houses to be sold to the tenants&mdash;the corporation made every effort possible to ensure they would not be sold.  I suggest that tenants who have obliged the corporation by allowing them to use their houses as rent offices should be treated in the same way as other tenants willing to purchase.</P>
    <P>I am aware local authorities have the right to refuse to allow tenants to sell cottages.  I am doubtful whether this is a good idea in many cases.  There are many people in the country who might be leaving the area to live with friends and they might have only a few years redemption of their houses, yet they are not allowed to sell them.  That is wrong. Tenants should be facilitated to sell to people in the area who would be entitled to rehousing.</P>
    <P>I come now to a section about which I feel strongly, section 18.  New house prices have gone through the roof.  Prices being charged for any kind of house are ridiculous.  The CRVs were being operated in my time and I was surprised to hear the Minister say last night on the Adjournment that he had made a better job of applying this system than I did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1245" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not.  The trouble about the CRV system is that at the best of times it worked well, but did not work at all in many instances.  The Minister would be deluding himself if he got the impression that because he is administering it he can wave a wand to operate the CRV system well in every case.  It is not operating well and it will not operate well.  I was rather annoyed at the Minister to have made such a remark.  It is unlike the Minister to take such a pretty line.  I was surprised to hear that he and the CIF do not appear to be hitting it off.  The CIF are not pin-ups of mine.  I had good and bad relations with them, but as a trade union official of some experience I have always found that rows can be settled around the table.  The local postal dispute was one such row.  There should not be any of this playing hard to get.  Of course it would be wrong to suggest that the CIF should be allowed to dictate to the Minister on legislation, but they are a very important section of the business community whose views must be heard. I found some of the members very reasonable but on occassions I disagreed with their views.</P>
      <P>The CRV system operates well when we have people who are prepared to accept a price for a job, but if we have contractors who, having got a CRV, try to persuade the buyer that they should put in some kind of stoves or some special kind of fitting for which they will charge extra, the system will not work properly. We have heard of people getting CRV's for a number of houses and not completing many of them and lumping them with a second lot within the CRV scheme.  The scheme will not work if that continues.  There are no better officials than those in this Department and if they cannot make it work something will have to be done about it.</P>
      <P>There has been references to guarantees for house builders.  Again it appears that somebody is trying to give the impression that such guarantees were worked out by the present Minister. They were worked out by the officials when I was in charge with Mr. Greene of the CIF.  It had been ready for completion when I left office.  I hope that scheme will work well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I wish the Minister well in his efforts to get house prices down but I suggest the Minister's efforts now will not succeed in that.  The CRV scheme on its own, even with the best will in the world, will not prevent people from trying to drive a coach and four through the legislation.  Therefore, something has to be done to try to tighten it up.  Houses are bad enough, but I believe flats are far worse.  It is something the Minister will have to get working on.  I do not know whether the Minister can empower lending agencies to give loans on CRV houses and I should like to see this spelled out.</P>
    <P>One of the complaints of the builders in my time&mdash;I have always claimed it was not correct&mdash;was that there was too much delay between the application for a CRV and granting it, particularly where an appeal was involved.  If this is done in respect of every house how can the Minister ensure that the scheme is properly serviced?  Is it not true that many of the bigger houses will be sold at a double price no matter what is done?  I suggest the Minister may be compounding the whole business by widening the group of houses covered.  I should like to be sure that the officials will have sufficient help to ensure that they can do the job.  If not, life will be made very unpleasant for them by the people concerned, and that would be wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement said that this is not intended where short-term borrowing such as bridging finance and so on is referred to and a loan is defined in such a way that it will not apply.  One of the shocking things about house financing is that even though a person has succeeded in getting a loan or a promise of a loan he will not get that until the house is completed.  The man pays 17 per cent or 18 per cent to the bank and between one thing and another he can finish up paying back the loan and paying off what he got from a building society or some other agency.  House financing is in a mess and a definite effort will have to be made to straighten it out.  It will not be done by introducing a Bill like this. All of these matters should have been dealt with in a Bill and I realise that would take a lot of time.  However, that <Col N="1247" /> would be preferable to putting through a measure here in a few hours and then discovering that it makes little difference in the long run.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statements says:</P>
    <P>Subsection (8) comprises an important provision which will enable the Minister at his discretion to refuse for a period not exceeding five years to consider any further application for a CRV from any person who has previously obtained a CRV and has either supplied false or misleading information or failed to fulfil requirements under section 18.</P>
    <P>To whom is the Minister referring?  Is he talking about a builder or an individual? Does it mean that if a builder employing 30 or 40 men makes a false statement, deliberately or otherwise, he can be disqualified for five years?  If so, it means he is out of business, not just suspended. Does it mean that if he cannot get a CRV he cannot build houses?  Is that the thinking behind the subsection?  If so, it should be spelled out fully.  It is like the legislation introduced into this House years ago where if a person knocked down somebody on a road, even accidentally, and killed him he could be charged with manslaughter but when it came before a jury they would not convict the person of manslaughter because the punishment could be too serious. Something like that could happen in this case and the cure could be worse than the disease.  I accept that a person can appeal to the High Court but that costs a lot of money and it takes a long time for a case to get to court.  Someone told me recently it takes about two years.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Section 20 contains an amendment of section 30 (2) of the Building Societies Act, 1978, which relates to the powers of the registrar of building societies to investigate the affairs of a society.  The section will remove any doubts as to the constitutionality of the existing provisions.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to elaborate on that.  The legislation referred to was passed only three years ago.  What is being done here is altering something that is in <Col N="1248" /> a different kind of Act.  When many of us first came into the House we tried to relate one piece of legislation to another and we found a whole list of Acts that would be affected.  One would need a library to find out how certain kinds of legislation relate to each other.  I ask the Minister to give more information on this point.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The section will also extend the Minister's power to make regulations under section 77 of the 1976 Act in relation to the amount and purposes of building society loans.  This latter amendment has been found to be necessary in the light of experience since the coming into operation of the 1976 Act.  For example, it is necessary from time to time to take steps to reconcile the anticipated level of mortgage lending for new houses with the financial needs of the national housing programme.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying he wants to have the authority to insist that building socieities will only lend not more than X amount of money or lend money for houses valued at certain amounts at certain periods?  He should say so.  We have already done that.  I have done it, the Minister has done it and it has been done by our predecessors.  It is an excellent idea, but whether we were doing it legally is a matter I should like to have clarified.</P>
    <P>It is accepted that at present a vast amount of money is being made available from building societies for house-building.  I know that some societies want people to lodge £2,000 for a period of not less than six months, that others want £1,000 lodged for 12 months and so on; but having regard to the amount of money presently available it does not appear to be a reasonable approach. It has been stated in the papers that the EMS was responsible for bringing a lot of money into this country, particularly from Britain, which was invested in the building societies.  I am not prepared to accept that because people with large amounts of money in Britain did not bring it to this country to invest in building societies.  I think the reason the building societies have so much money is because it is now possible to invest <Col N="1249" /> pension funds and so on because it is a guaranteed fund.  This is possible as a result of the 1976 Act.  The present Minister for Finance made the necessary order but the preliminary work was done.  It was an excellent idea and I backed it fully when the legislation was going through.  I think that is where the big money is coming from.  The building societies supply most of the money available for house-building and the Minister's comment about how much money he was making available rings a little hollow.  The Minister in his statement said:</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 21 is to enable the Minister for Health to transfer, mainly for housing purposes, about 54 acres of land at Navan Road, Dublin, to Dublin Corporation and the Commissioners of Public Works.  That Minister presently holds the lands in trust under section 21 (3) of the Saint Laurence's Hospital Act, 1943,...</P>
    <P>I agree that legislation was necessary to have that done, and it was an excellent idea to do it, but I should like to know where the Office of Public Works come in.  I think it should go to the corporation for housing.  There are too many people who would like to have a finger in the pie.  Dublin Corporation could use any serviced land they can get like that.</P>
    <P>Sections 90 (6) (a) and 98 (5) of the 1966 Act, which enable the housing authorities to require payment, generally referred to as a clawback payment, from part of the profit made on resale by a tenant purchaser of certain houses are repealed by this legislation.  I included in the sale regulations, particularly in Dublin, that a person would have to retain a house for five years after purchasing it from the corporation or else pay some of the profit made on it. Many people tried to give the impression that that was the first time that was introduced. If my memory serves me correctly, this applies also to ordinary county council cottages throughout the country, but the whole price was taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>This Bill had to be introduced.  I am sorry more alterations were not included. <Col N="1250" /> Corporations, county councils and all local authorities are entitled to get enough money to build houses for those who need them.  We did it in 1973, during the greatest recession Europe has ever known, in 1974, 1975 and 1976. Now Fianna Fáil are cutting back.  I am not a prophet of doom, but I predict there will be a substantial drop in the number of local authority and private houses built in 1979.  I would hate to see this happening but I know Fianna Fáil's record and they built during the recession. the houses we built during the recession.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has agreed to discuss various items with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations. That is a good idea.  I found them reasonable people and suggest they should be treated as such.  When I left office I said I felt the system of purchasing local authority houses which I had arranged could not continue because it was bringing the price too high.  If I had remained in office I would have taken the necessary steps to try to have this revised.  I suggest the Minister discuss this with his officials, who I found excellent because their advice will be sound. The should try to find a better system.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants this Bill passed before we adjourn, I am afraid it will be a long hot summer.  I do not see how we could allow this Bill to go through within a matter of hours, as has been suggested. I want to go on holiday as much as anybody but this is the wrong time to introduce this legislation and I suggest that the Autumn would be the proper time to discuss these matters, most of which have been lying around from nine to two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and, I am afraid, pedestrian.  I am surprised more Members have not contributed to this debate as more than 100 of them serve on local authorities.  In recent weeks many of us spent long hours going from door to door canvassing for votes.  I am sure we all have a vivid insight into housing problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Deputies spoke at length on some of the major issues&mdash;limits for loans, lack of capital allocations and so on&mdash;in other words, the shortage of houses which affects, and will continue <Col N="1251" /> to affect so many people.  There is no easy solution.  The Minister cannot wave a magic wand.  This problem is always with us and he has my sympathy because he will continue to be accused&mdash;and abused&mdash;of not doing his job.  When I visit housing estates the most pathetic sight is to see a large family with no bathroom facilities or flush toilets.  For many years it has been my view that when Ministers make capital allocations for housing to local authorities they should divide that allocation into various sections.  A major portion should go to the building of bathrooms in every local authority house which does not have that basic facility.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would bring that point to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>These people might have five, six, seven or eight children and they have no chance of getting a house in a new estate where all these modern facilities are available because under existing law they are considered to be adequately housed.  I would like to see a change of attitude in the Department and perhaps the Minister could see that these wrongs are balanced.  It is very difficult to explain to one of these tenants who is house proud and is ambitious for her children that she cannot get out of that house because she is deemed by the local authority to be adequately housed.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the low rise mortgage scheme.  Credit for that scheme must go to the previous Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully. That was a wonderful innovation which helped numerous people to build their own houses.  As has been emphasised in this debate, there should be an expansion of the scheme to enable a married couple to avail of the loan without the stipulation that they should have at least one child.</P>
    <P>I agree that they should be on the housing list for a year.  There must be certain constraints, but it is unfortunate that a married couple can be on a housing list for five, six, ten or 12 years without a snowball's chance in hell of being rehoused by the local authority because, as is always the case especially <Col N="1252" /> on the points system, a family with children will get priority.  You can never make up the deficit of not having children unless there is an avalanche of houses, which is a remote possibility. There should be consideration for people with no children who have been on that housing list for a considerable length of time.  Some of these people will tell you that they are living with in-laws and they cannot have children because they would have to leave that house.  That is pathetic.  It is hard for a local representative to explain that they cannot get a house, that there is no chance of it.  The pain, anguish and disappointment in their faces is too much to bear.  It is a pathetic situation which should be rectified. There is no doubt that it would cost the State an appreciable amount of money but it would be a mercy to allow them qualify under this scheme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see, regarding the stipulation whereby an applicant for rehousing had to have his or her housing conditions examined by a health inspector, that there is provision in the Bill whereby the local authority can send along their own housing officer to do the inspection. Also there is provision for a health inspector to call if there are extenuating circumstances.  I agree with that because the present system has not worked.  I have seen injustices brought about by the fact that the health inspector may not be doing his job properly, and there can be a delay sometimes of at least a year between the time of the applicant applying to be included on the list and the time it takes the inspector to get around to carry out that inspection.  The lack of harmony and co-operation between the health inspectors and the people controlling the health boards and the housing authorities is frightening.  It is bureaucracy at its worst, and the sooner that situation is eliminated the better.  I am surprised that the CEOs of so many health boards throughout the country have allowed that position to obtain.  The local authority on which I serve is Dungarvan Urban Council and we have not yet made out the 1979 housing list, although applications for that list closed before Christmas 1978. The fault lies entirely with the officials of the South-Eastern Health Board, and I <Col N="1253" /> am told that that is not an unique position in the country.  Some ministerial action must be taken where there is pure neglect or a high degree of inefficiency such as that.  Some people who are in need of housing are being discriminated against because houses which become vacant at present are being left off the 1978 list while very urgent cases could have cropped up in the interim.  I cannot see how any CEO of a health board or any county manager could tolerate a position such as that.  There will have to be a shake-up.</P>
    <P>Luckily, in recent years it has become a feature of housing schemes in towns, and villages for that matter, that provision is made for old people's homes. Previously these old people had to go on the housing list and compete with families, and just like the married couples with no children, their chances were remote if not completely hopeless. Nowadays, since the advent of housing schemes for old people their chances have improved considerably and some very worthwhile rehousing has been carried out in this sector.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me on one point.  There was a provision, and I do not know if it still exists, that the council did not get the full housing subsidy unless the people rehoused were over 60 years of age.  If that provision still exists it should be changed.  In Dungarvan some eight years ago we were told that we would not get that financial aid unless each of the people going into the houses was over 60 years of age.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. Another sector who have been discriminated against in regard to housing are unmarried mothers.  In the permissive society that we have nowadays unmarried mothers are becoming more and more plentiful.  That is one of the social <Col N="1254" /> misfortunes of our day and all the pious talk in the world is not going to change that situation.  I hope that those small houses which are becoming a feature of towns and cities would also be available for re-housing unmarried mothers who seem to be outcasts of society at present and who in most local authorities are not wanted.  Their applications are just shelved and not considered.  I have known some county managers and senior housing officials to show great compassion, but there is a bias in too many minds in this country still and that bias can seep into the highest places, even into the county managerial system, the town clerk system and the housing section.  I hope that all such small houses are not confined to any specific sector of the public but that they will cover everybody, in particular the most unfortunate. I list the unmarried mothers in that category.</P>
      <P>About a year ago I put down a question to the Minister here about something which has always puzzled me.  I have continually asked the officials in my own country council and my urban council in Waterford about the income limit requirement before a person qualifies to be included in the housing list.  In reply to the Dáil question the Minister stated that there is no definite income limit, whereas the housing section of Waterford County Council, who I hope will read this report, continually clamp an income limit on applicants. That income limit coincides with the income limit for eligibility for a new house loan, which was £3,500 and which is now £4,000.  If a working-class man with a family happens to earn more than £4,000 at present his chances in Waterford are that he will be struck off the list. The Minister of State has nodded, indicating that there is no such upper limit. I would appreciate if he would convey that directive to the county manager in Waterford.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is really getting away from the Bill now.  Certainly the Bill is wide enough for anything on housing.  We are getting on to what should be really business matters about the filling of vacant <Col N="1255" /> houses and so on.  It hardly arises on this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, I am being extremely relevant because we are talking about housing and I am referring merely to the eligibility of some according to the Minister and their non-eligibility according to the housing officials in certain housing authorities. There seems to be a conflict of opinion in this case and I would like the Minister of State to have the matter ironed out. As we all know, £4,000 is not a mighty income nowadays.  Very few people in that category could even think of building their own houses.  The site would cost at least £4,000, the equivalent of their annual income.  People would probably need an income in the region of £7,000 or £8,000 to consider building a house of their own without the aid of the low rise mortgage scheme.  If people who would ordinarily qualify for that subsidised loan have an income in excess of £4,000 they are prevented from getting it.</P>
      <P>I am not blaming the present Minister for the level of the limit.  During our period in office it was pegged at £2,350, which was a ridiculous figure.  It was boosted to £3,500 and now stands at £4,000 which, taking inflation into account, would approximate to the old level of £2,350.  The amount was never sufficient.  I am aware that the Minister has not a bottomless well of finance available.  He says that there is no upper limitation for people on local authority housing lists and this should apply throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that people <Col N="1256" /> earning £20,000 a year cannot be rehoused.  I have been told by officials in the country that they received a directive from Dublin, but the Minister is quite definite that this is not the case.</P>
      <P>There is a sad lack of direction among officials when it comes to building local authority houses.  They tend to build where they can easily acquire land.  In some backward areas the demand for land is not great, particularly for housing purposes.  The council rush in and build perhaps 20 houses, even though there may be only seven or eight approved applicants in the area.  Money should be diverted only to areas where there is a housing need.  In County Waterford they had to import housing applicants from 30 or 40 miles away.  That practice is to be condemned and the Department should ensure that applicants are rehoused in their own areas.</P>
      <P>We have a small-minded outlook when it comes to the provision of open space.  We build outwards from the centre of towns into the countryside, allowing little or no green space.  The law obliging councils to provide a certain percentage of land for open space seems to be flouted by including back gardens and private tennis courts or playing fields.  Sufficient open space is not available to the public and this applies throughout the whole country.  Local authorities are the worst offenders and I would ask the Minister to see that the law is not flouted in this respect.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested to me that housing sites would be much more readily available if there were an effective law to get rid of derelict sites.  There is a law at present which is supposed to penalise people but I am told the Act is so full of loopholes that it is absolutely ineffective. Thousands of valuable sites could be provided if existing eyesores were removed and the sites made available for urban renewal.  Does the Minister intend to amend existing legislation to deal with this matter?  Derelict sites are a blot on our landscape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 30 of the Housing Act, 1966, provides for the repair or reconstruction of a private dwelling in a county council area, but I do not know if similar reconstruction can be carried out on a private dwelling in an urban area. <Col N="1257" /> Perhaps the Minister could enlighten me. The section deals with a house in great disrepair whose owner is in very poor circumstances and is consequently unable to carry out repairs.  The Council, with the sanction of the Department of the Environment, are entitled to spend public money on making the house habitable for the lifetime of the people who occupy it.  I have yet to be allowed to implement this section in an urban area.</P>
    <P>During the past year or two I have come across some frightening red tape and the fact that the Minister cannot make an order to overcome it is incomprehensible. A new reconstruction grant scheme was introduced on 1 November 1977.  This was to be lauded because it increased the grant from £400 to £600.  If someone had started work on a house before that date and had not applied for the grant by the following 1 January, two months later, he or she would be precluded from getting a reconstruction grant of any kind.  That seems to me to be the utmost in red tape and bureaucracy.  Surely the Minister has a discretion to see that people are not cut out completely from getting any form of grant merely because they did not submit a form before such and such a date.  One of the two people I have in mind is an old age pensioner who spent his life savings on reconstructing his house.  He assumed he would be entitled to some grant, be it under the old scheme or under the new scheme.  Due to this regulation he does not get one shilling. I would ask the Minister to extend that date so that people such as he can qualify.</P>
    <P>I have also come across a couple of cases where people cannot qualify on technical grounds for the £1,000 new house grant.  It is the duty of public officials to make it easy for people to get these grants and not to put obstacles in their way.  I am sure the Minister has every sympathy with that point of view. I tabled four Dáil questions today covering the cases I am referring to, two dealing with reconstruction grants and two with new house grants.  I would ask the Minister to use his good offices to see that these people get the grants to which they are entitled.  If filling up a form a <Col N="1258" /> few days late can cut poor people off from qualifying, something is seriously wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister was absent when I was making my original point.  I know I am not supposed to repeat myself but I will. As I said I will be very brief, and I will finish on this note.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that in my recent electioneering for the urban and county councils elections I must have visited about 4,000 houses.  A high proportion of them were local authority houses and a great proportion of those houses had no bathroom facilities or flush toilets.  In future, a certain proportion of the capital allocation to the various local authorities should be designated for one purpose only, that is, to bring those houses up to the required standard.  People living in those houses are not considered eligible for rehousing by the local authority because their existing accommodation is deemed to be adequate.  Nowadays such housing conditions cannot be deemed to be adequate.  In future allocations the Minister should consider giving a block grant to provide everybody living in local authority housing with the basic facility of a bathroom and flush toilet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Any opportunity to discuss housing is welcome because it is one of the major social challenges facing us.  I read the Minister's Bill very carefully. I welcome elements of it.  The Bill could have been more comprehensive.  I hope this does not sound unfair, but it is very little and very late in some cases. There are elements in it which show the Minister is responsive to public feeling and to suggestions from this side of the House.  It is a little heartening to know that the time we spend here is not quite as wasted as some of us sometimes think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as presented will not make a great deal of difference to the essential housing problems which face us.  The Bill <Col N="1259" /> is largely a validating measure relating to changes made since 1972 in the schemes of financial assistance in the form of housing grants, subsidies and loans.  The real changes needed in the area of housing grants, subsidies and loans are that there should be more of all of them.  There is clear statistical and social evidence that we are well on the way to a housing crisis.  This housing crisis is not as acute in some rural areas as it is in some urban areas.  The Bill could have made some reference to regional disparities, not merely in the allocation of resources but in the overburdening of some local authorities who have many more applicants than there are likely to be dwellings for them, while other local authorities are relatively free of such depressing statistics.</P>
    <P>The facts are that in a number of urban areas&mdash;Dublin being the eminent example&mdash;there is not the slightest likelihood of the numbers of people who are now on the housing lists being housed in the foreseeable future unless there is a basic, fundamental and radical overhaul of the way we have approached housing.  It has always been my belief that the reason we have been so halfhearted about radical housing programmes is that for faint-hearted politicians they represent a psychological and a resource commitment today to ends which may not be visible for a period of time long after the next election or the next two elections.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to pretend that Ministers for Local Government are totally villainous in the way they approach housing statistics, but there is a natural psychological pressure on them to deliver the goods within the five year cycle. Therefore, down the years housing has been to some extent the Cinderella area of the social services.  This is particularly tragic when most of the social ills which beset us today, and to which on some occasions we are very quick to provide a very superficial response, can be traced in whole or in part to a bad housing environment. Dáil Éireann still stands within two miles of housing conditions which can only be considered as Dickensian and antediluvian.  People are cluttered <Col N="1260" /> together, in some cases with six or seven in the one room.</P>
    <P>In relation to schemes of financial assistance in the form of housing grants, subsidies and loans, I should like to have seen in the Bill not just the validating of regulations which have been in existence for some years, or the topping up of other regulations, or tentative and in some cases quite cosmetic manoeuvring on some schemes such as the CRVs, but a very radical revision, in the literal sense of the word, of how we have been tackling housing.  The social, economic, cultural and other by-products of bad housing are so overwhelmingly obvious that I do not understand why a Minister and a Government cannot take upon themselves the exciting and challenging job of making radical and major improvements in that area.  That revision, that basic rethinking on the way we have been doing things, finds no response in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the Minister's remarks he made reference to certificates of reasonable value and he purported to introduce certain changes in the schemes.  I am pleased that in the tenor of his remarks, echoed lavishly enough this evening by the media, the Minister indicates that he is concerned about CRVs and that there is reason for concern.  In his speech he said:</P>
    <P>I think, however, it is generally agreed that it no longer provides an adequate statutory framework for the operation of this form of control on house prices.</P>
    <P>He goes on to outline not only his own reservations but also the degree to which a minority of builders have been &ldquo;known to charge prices far in excess of the CRV price&rdquo; clearly indicating that the need is well-established for a major dramatic innovation in this area.  The innovation which should follow such a statement is one that has been requested from this side of the House and the practices which the Minister has referred to were almost verbatim those outlined in questions by Deputy Fitzpatrick, spokesman for the Environment for Fine Gael, for a considerable time.</P>
    <P>What do we get as a response to the Minister's decision that the situation is <Col N="1261" /> not satisfactory?  We get a very cosmetic, weak gesture which will not go anywhere near dealing with the real problem.  I contend that the Minister is weak in a number of respects with regard to CRVs.  We asked questions on 15 May about CRVs.  The Minister, on that occasion, was not just apparently unable to grasp the essential facts of what we were trying to get across, but was either deliberately or otherwise evasive in his replies.  With the permission of the Chair I raised this matter on the adjournment last night and have since had an opportunity of surveying the Minister's limited response to my queries on that occasion.  As the Minister comprehensively refers to &ldquo;evasion&rdquo; by builders of the intent, purpose, spirit and letter of the CRVs, the evasion of the Minister in this area on that date is relevant to what we are talking about.</P>
    <P>There is now overwhelming evidence to indicate that the Minister persists in neglecting to correct the omissions which he made on that date.  On that date I asked the Minister if he was aware that certain builders were evading their responsibility by asking would-be purchasers to sign to the effect that the CRV was not going to be paid and that they therefore acknowledged they would lose and forego the £1,000 grant.  There is nothing, as the Minister rightly points out, illegal about that.  Whether or not it is desirable, sharp practice, Government policy or more or less acceptable to either side of the House is not the issue. The issue I wish to make&mdash;and I intend to repeat it on every occasion until I get a reply from the Minister&mdash;is that, despite details being supplied by me on that occasion, the Minister consistently, persistently, arrogantly, and totally determinedly said he knew nothing about what I was saying.  I have looked at the replies to many of the questions which the Minister for the Environment handles.  I have a great deal of admiration for the Minister's manner and challenge. He does himself and the House a disservice by covering up in the way he does for people who should be brought to heel by him.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he did not know what we were talking about.  It transpired subsequently that not merely had <Col N="1262" /> I brought this matter to the Minister's attention but that the Taoiseach had done so by a letter dated prior to that occasion. When we are talking, in the context of the Bill, about CRVs it is hypocritical, if not worse, for the Minister to try to adopt a lofty attitude of admonishing all and sundry about the right way to behave when he is guilty of mischievous and misleading replies in the House.  On 6 March the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of evasion on the CRVs was a central point in the Minister's address this morning and was interpreted widely as being so.  I abhor double standards.  That is part of my function in this House and I will continue to assert that as long as I remain here.  Nobody wishes to replay last night's exchange.  I want to ask the Minister if, in relation to the evasion he refers to in his speech, he is aware that on 15 March the Taoiseach replied to a client of mine saying he had drawn certain matters to his attention.  I would like an answer to that question.  If that is the case how is it possible for the Minister to say to the House on 15 May, and to repeat last night, that he knows nothing about it?  I do not understand that.  The Minister has not answered that question and he should not be allowed to avoid his responsibilities in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A glimmer of the reason why that evasion is going on may be ascertained from the background of what we are talking about.  The truth is that there are a small number of builders, some of them substantial, who have, for one reason or another, been allowed to ride roughshod over a lot of legislation on the statute books.  I have been given an independent report this evening about electrical faults in housing estates, about which we have been on to the Minister in this House and in correspondence, which standards have led unfortunately to the deaths of a number of people either directly or indirectly.  That is my <Col N="1263" /> contention.  The builders involved in the latter case are well known to the Minister.  Their name is no secret. Nobody wishes to pillory people who are not here themselves but there is one member of the Fianna Fáil Party who could have an opportunity to defend himself if he wished to appear.  In relation to the CRV case I mentioned earlier, where it was apparently the intention of a building firm, Abbey Homesteads Limited, not to apply for CRVs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I regret I cannot erase it now.  A building firm which has very close connections with a member of the Fianna Fáil Party was the subject of a cover up by the Minister for the Environment which he consistently insisted on carrying forward even to last night.  It ill-becomes the Minister to lecture decent members of the building profession about their moral responsibilities in relation to CRVs when we see such a lack of genuineness and integrity in the manner in which he handled replies to this question. I want the Minister to come clean on this.  I am aware there can be no excuse for the manner in which the Minister has consistently denied knowledge of the circumstances in this case.

      <P>On the basis of performance so far, the credibility of the Bill and the integrity of the Minister's stance is called into question if we cannot accept the word of a man in this House whose job is to legislate in this area.  If this was in another House the Minister <Col N="1264" /> would be called upon to resign unless a very full explanation was forthcoming. None has been forthcoming.  If we can do nothing else in this House let us, for God's sake, tell the truth.</P>

      <P>The CRV regulations that the Minister refers to as being the panacea for all ills are weak-kneed and cosmetic and will only further the damage presently being done.  The whole point and purpose of the CRV is to give people an indication of value for money. That it is not mandatory is perhaps regrettable and maybe that should be considered, but at least the force of every possible measure which the Government can introduce should be brought to bear on builders so that the massive and growing evasion which now exists can be curbed.  The Minister at least recognises in his statement that that is necessary.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately the measures he takes are too limited.  He says that section 18 has two main purposes.  The first is to empower the Minister to require that certain loans by lending agencies for the purchase of new houses cannot be made unless a CRV is obtained.</P>
      <P>The second is to impose clear obligations on builders in relation to the construction of houses for which they have obtained a CRV and of course to enable the Minister to take effective action and so on.  What is the effective action?  As far as I can see effective action allows for the possibility that a Minister might at his discretion refuse for a period not exceeding five years to consider any further application for a CRV from any person who has previously obtained a CRV and who has either supplied false or misleading information or failed to fulfil requirements under section 18. That is subsection (8) and it is an important provision which will enable the Minister to debar someone for five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1265" /> The Minister is a lot longer at this game than I am but I know that that is a joke, because this town and the Companies Registration Office are cluttered with £100 limited companies who are here today and gone tomorrow, fly-by-nights. How is the Minister going to pin the offenders?  How is he going to put the finger on a builder who abuses the regulations in this regard, who acts in defiance of the spirit of what the Minister and everybody else on this side of the House wants to achieve.  Who exactly is the Minister going to debar for a period of five years?  Will he debar a builder or a building company?  May be there are answers to these questions and I look forward to hearing them when the Minister comes in to conclude.</P>
    <P>All I can say is that one does not have to be a legal expert to recognise that a coach and four can be driven through that provision.  It is being done at the moment to evade responsibilities. Limited companies are being set up for the purpose of building housing estates and are being liquidated almost immediately. Of course, relations or friends or some named individual on behalf of the builder sets up again the following day with a different name and there is apparently nothing anybody can do about it unless the will is there to have a look at company law, which is not under discussion at present.  I see no reason why this proposal should be the slightest bit different.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is a bit of a gimmick unless it is backed up.  Not alone that, but all the usual caveats are entered that before exercising this power the Minister will be required to notify the person concerned of his intention to do so.  Of course there is the usual interminable right of appeal which could go on and on.  Meanwhile the residents of a particular house will no doubt be pestering their public representatives with letters and questions will be raised here and in the end nothing will be done.  In the end the CRV will be seen for what it apparently is in the eyes of the Minister: a pretty good stick to raise now and again at after-luncheon meetings when the Government want to appear to be on the side of the angels for a period.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious he will surely <Col N="1266" /> retract or at least reconsider his statement that section 18 will provide a comprehensive statutory framework for the operation of a form of control in the prices of new houses and flats which benefit from State funds or which are financed by mortgages available from limited resources.  Does anybody seriously believe that?  The Minister, in all of his quite lengthy statement, never referred once to the price of serviced land which is a most germane and fundamental element in the whole question of the price of houses.  There is no question there of the Minister doing anything unpleasant like, for example, controlling the price of houses or controlling the price of land or having a look at the Kenny Report and implementing a few of the proposals in it.  That is not suggested because that is too near the bone and might mean hurting too many people to whom I honestly believe the Minister and the Government are in hock.</P>
    <P>I have come to the firm belief that the clear moral imperative which a Government should have in this fundamental crucial area of housing has been sold down the river and that this Government are not therefore in a position to be able to legislate with the integrity necessary in the area of housing.  That is what saddens me, not for myself because I am one of the fortunate ones, but for the 8,000 families presently on the corporation housing list and the unfortunate couples trying to raise money in the face of daily escalating mortgage prices and for the people all around this country who have been told that they will be given adequate housing, that they will be given £1,000 grants and that they will be cherished equally.  The £1,000 grant is of course increasingly seen for what it is.  It just escalated house prices by £1,000 in three months and I am sure in due course it will be readily forgotten even by people on the far side of the House.</P>
    <P>The CRV, which is not the most fundamental element in the whole question of house finance, is certainly a useful lever which the Minister has if he chooses to exercise his options in the area.  But I can see the row back beginning already.  Indeed, the Minister's final comments this morning subsequent to <Col N="1267" /> representations from a number of associations indicated that he proposed amendments&mdash;and the Bill is not even off the ground&mdash;in relation to his refusal in certain cases to grant a CRV pursuant to subsection 3 (a) of section 18 that there would be the right of appeal to a court.</P>
    <P>Let me say clearly that this party would never condone a situation where people did not have that right to appeal. But I honestly believe that the initial proposal of the Minister is too limited altogether if he considers that the CRV in that circumstances will be in any way effective as a statutory element in house price control.  The CRV will simply continue to be, as it has always been, evaded and avoided.  Indeed, even the Minister's reference to making certain loans conditional on the CRV is weak.  Is the Minister willing to support a situation where local authorities and building societies and everybody else will give loans where there is not a CRV?  Does the Minister turn his face against that categorically and unequivocally?  Does he say, for example, that he will not subsidies building societies who will give loans where there is no CRV?  What steps will he take to put meat and to put muscle on the sentiments which he expressed in the soft parts, the nebulous parts of the proposals here?  We share his concern and indeed, though we are too modest to say so, we might claim that we had some small part in initiating the particular expression of his concern.</P>
    <P>I recognise the difficulties the Minister has in this area.  I recognise that it is very difficult in the face of the power of big business to introduce regulations but I firmly believe that the vast majority of building companies and building firms are of the most decent stock.  Their practices and their standards are the highest. They deserve to be treated with respect and therefore it saddens me when the minority of unscrupulous builders can get away with blue murder.  It puts the decent people at a disadvantage, as the Minister observed once again this morning. Therefore it is imperative, primarily for the sake of the people who need houses and even in the interests of good commerce, that the Minister should introduce <Col N="1268" /> measures that would be seen to be practicable and which would be effective.</P>
    <P>I know that on a number of occasions Opposition parties are accused of being destructive and negative and always opposing for the sake of opposition.  I do not intend to do that, but I must say that there are a number of omissions from the Bill.  There are a number of measures which we would like to see in the Bill and which are indeed party policy and which, as far as I am concerned, could very well now be the beneficiary of some consideration from the Minister and his Department.  If we are going to succeed in this whole housing area the basic tinkering which occurs in some of the areas here, the cosmetics which occur in more areas, the CRV type of approach, the softly, softly approach of hoping that everything will be all right on the day or that if it is not all right the Minister will be so far out of Government that he will not have to worry about it anyway, that will have to stop.</P>
    <P>That sort of attitude is very negligent of the duty of a Government.  We would like to see introduced, for example, a loan scheme for people which would give them more than the present levels of finance because unfortunately they are subject to review every now and again and are therefore subject to anomalies all the time.  If one applies for a loan in the local authority sector immediately after the limit has been increased one is, relatively speaking, advantaged compared with people who will apply two or three years later.  There should be annual index-linked revision of local authority loan limits if we are, in common justice, to ensure that one couple does not have a relative advantage from public funds over another couple and if we want in justice to reflect the soaring price of housing.</P>
    <P>In the last 18 months we have seen unprecedented house price increases. The result has been not just the massive spec-profits for certain operators but, more tragically, the fact that a greater number of people have had to fall back on the local authority housing lists because they cannot afford to provide a house for themselves.  If the Minister denies <Col N="1269" /> that, he is calling black white.  The usual procedure is for pressure to be applied to increase local authority loan limits and, when the time is opportune, an announcement will be made that they will be increased.  At a future date, when it is deemed suitable for political or other purposes, the increase will take place but in the meantime people are worried, are anxious and are fretting about putting together the deposit for a house.  Index-linking of local authority loans would avoid that.  It would also take into account factors which the public must take into account, increases in prices of all items, and it would be seen to be fair.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider introducing a new type of loan scheme under which the loan advanced would relate to the amount of money saved by the applicant.  That scheme could be complimentary to those operated by building societies and local authorities. In my view such a scheme would encourage people to save and those savings could be invested in a Government fund.  Young couples would be encouraged to save rather than squandering their money as, unfortunately, too many of our young people do after getting their first job.  There is no encouragement to save at present.  I do not accept that such a move is up to the individual. We have a duty to point out to teenagers that within a few years they will be looking for a house and will need a substantial amount of money.  It should be suggested to them that if they save the Government will meet their savings pound for pound.  I am aware that certain social comments could be made about such a scheme and some may say that those who do not have money and who do not have a job will suffer, but in a comprehensive housing programme such individuals would be catered for in other ways to meet their needs.  This is a time when imagination, flair and new ideas should be utilised in the housing sector.</P>
    <P>There should be more support for housing co-operatives and for in-fill housing construction.  The Minister congratulated the housing co-operative association and I should like to join with him in paying a compliment to that group.  I would like to see more financial <Col N="1270" /> support for such co-operatives which are, essentially, non-profit making. Housing is a constitutional and basic right and is the environment from which all ill or good stems.  Therefore, we should not spare any effort in encouraging people to get involved in self-help in this area.  In the case of in-fill housing construction it is very sad to see streets like a mouthful of bad teeth with rotting decayed slums in their midst.  Because of our traditional approach to housing policy we generally think that they are easier managed and that the economies of them are lower per unit and so on but there is room for doing a great deal more about in-fill.  Not alone would we elevate the aesthetic, social and local environment of areas but we would be providing homes.  In some cases the cost would be quite attractive particularly in view of the price of land.</P>
    <P>Proposals for the simplification of the procedure governing the buying and selling of houses should be introduced.  The buying and selling of a house, because it is related in terms of costs to the total price of the house, has escalated substantially. I am not aware that the amount of work has escalated, although I admit that the return for an hour of work has increased because people are being paid more.  However, there are unwholesome elements in this.  I am aware of people who have to pay up to £400 for the legal formalities attached to buying their houses.  I cannot see any justification in an estate of 200 houses for that price being retained as cost in each case where, I am willing to bet, the work is essentially on a once-off basis and is then fundamentally, duplicated.  It may be that there are good legal and technical reasons why that amount should be charged in such an estate, but I believe it is extremely unfair to ask people at the outset of their married life to pay out such a sum for a procedure that could be simplified to the extent of being little more than a car registration book.  I am aware that it is not quite so simple because questions of title are involved but it could be simplified in the case of new houses.  Would it be possible to introduce sliding scales for legal costs particularly in new housing estates where, it is arguable, the same work is <Col N="1271" /> done for all the purchasers?</P>
    <P>It is clear that there will be a shortage of houses in Dublin city.  I have failed to get any indication of the Minister's concern in this area.  I should like to know if the Minister will seriously consider the situation in the city in relation to the prospects for housing.  Dublin Corporation, the local authority for the area, have sites for approximately 2,000 houses.  That is their total land bank.  The number of people on the housing list in the total Dublin area is of the order of 8,000 families.  That figure includes people who are anxious to go out to the county.  The number of people who are anxious to live within the city boundary&mdash;the same area for which Dublin Corporation have sites for 2,000 houses&mdash;is in the order of 4,500 families.  The sites for 2,000 houses is the only land bank Dublin Corporation have for ever.  The amount of land being worked on at site development or construction of house stage is in the order of 650 or 670 houses.</P>
    <P>If magically we could transform all the land in the possession of Dublin Corporation for the purposes of building houses we would not be able to house even half of those anxious to live in the city.  There is a housing shortage in the city now, and it is deceitful for councillors and for the Minister to pretend that we have the answer to the problem.  The truth is that we are about to wrench many families from their environment, to tear them from the areas of their birth and upbringing and implant them in a hostile clinical atmosphere outside the city, from which the husbands will probably commute into the city centre causing more transport problems, and in which many of the wives in growing number will have recourse to valium and other sedative drugs, according to the evidence of doctors.</P>
    <P>What I am saying is that you cannot take housing policy in isolation from other social policies.  I am concerned that every effort should be made to acquire land in the city first of all and then look at other possible options in relation to housing policy in the city.  In regard to land acquisition in the city, does the Minister know that a recent survey was <Col N="1272" /> carried out not by the Department whose job one would imagine it to be, not by local authority, but by a group of students, voluntarily.  It happens to be the most up-to-date information available on the area of dereliction in the city.  The survey indicates that 9 per cent of the land area in Dublin is derelict, that is, 2,000 to 2,500 acres.  It is hard to credit, but that is the information in the survey.</P>
    <P>Anyway, it is acceptable in the face of lack of evidence to the contrary, and the contrary situation at the moment is that the Minister in his Department does not have an up-to-date inventory or list of areas of dereliction in any city.  Neither does the local authority in Dublin have information on the number of derelict sites, the areas in which they exist, who owns them or what action the local authority propose to take.  There is a certain amount of scratching going on but of course the Derelict Sites Act of 1961 is seen for what it is, and it is like throwing custard through a sieve to be talking about that Act.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the availability of land is a major problem.  It is something the Minister has not tackled in the Bill and I am therefore asking him to introduce legislation to make war on those who own derelect sites, to take into public ownership derelict sites when it is considered to be in the public interest to do so, always giving full consideration to the rights of individuals to make appeals, but not to have appeals interminably going through the courts, when the rights of people looking for houses would be totally outweighed by some mythical or mystical notions about the rights of private property.  In many cases people do not know they own the property.</P>
    <P>In the survey I have referred to, the extraordinary information emerged that some 40 per cent of the land deemed to be derelict is in unknown ownership.  The Department do not know who owns it, the corporation do not know who owns it, and obviously that should nearly immediately fall within the ambit of public ownership.  About 30 per cent of the remainder is in public ownership, presumably waiting for the elephantine consideration which Government Departments invariably give to <Col N="1273" /> proposals for utilisation of such sites. The remaining third is in private hands.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it would be wrong for us at this stage to pretend that the problem of dereliction in Dublin is purely a matter of hard nosed private speculators who dream up schemes behind closed doors between puffs of cigar smoke.  The truth is that much of the land is in public ownership and not a thing is being done about it although we have an acute housing and land shortage, all germane to house prices.</P>
    <P>Apart from taking action on derelict sites, we should also consider a major grant scheme for the refurbishing of older houses in the city.  Unfortunately there is not a provision in the Bill in this respect.  It is timely to talk in these terms because if we find ourselves getting tight for acquisition of new land we should try to conserve what we have.  There is no activity or interest in that area and consequently we have rows and rows of what have become known as tenement type houses.  They are structurally sound, in many cases suitable for large families, and in some cases for two families, though I do not consider that to be ideal.</P>
    <P>Instead of encouragement in this respect, what is happening is that we have a system under which people living in these dwellings are encouraged to assist in their destruction so that conditions can become so bad that the families living in them will gain recognition by the local authority and therefore be rehoused.  The situation is so bad that the local authority find their hands tied and they are not able to act unless a court order has been got for eviction.</P>
    <P>The situation is, therefore, that people are being compelled to live in bad circumstances, in some cases hoping to God the situation will get worse so that the place will be condemned or declared unfit to get them out of the hovels they are in.  It is an extraordinary policy but that is the situation at the moment.  That is why I have suggested a major grant scheme for refurbishing older houses as a plank towards combating the present waste and dereliction of such dwellings.</P>
    <P>I should like to see what has been referred to as a ballon mortgage scheme.  A general peripheral provision <Col N="1274" /> has been made in the Bill in that regard, but it is not sufficiently graduated and it is not flexible enough.  Apparently the principle has been considered by somebody without sufficient imagination to work out a scheme which could be applicable to individual cases.  The scheme I am advocating would have repayments at their lowest in the early years&mdash; indeed I suggest there should not be any repayments in the first year, but repayments would then commence and would be increased until the full loan had been repaid.  I should like to distinguish between that kind of increase and the increase that is occuring at present.</P>
    <P>After the first five or six years of a married couple in a mortgage house they find themselves relatively well able to cope.  At the price of mortgages now, I am not sure anybody is able to cope at any time.  I have seen people having to sit on orange boxes while they wondered about repayments to building societies, and that is the year in which they are likely to have a child.  That is a most unsatisfactory environment for the commencement of a family.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister consider having a scheme which would allow the first year free of repayments?  The repayments later would probably be a little easier, and I suggest that most couples would welcome the breathing space.  Deposits nowadays can be anything between £3,000 and £5,000&mdash;I do not know how couples manage them.  The scheme I am suggesting would allow couples to get some furniture around them and it would ease the extreme anxiety they suffer if the woman has a child, and so forth.  They would be able to settle down to the new personal relationships of marriage and they could concentrate on knitting the marriage together well.  They will have other bills to pay anyway, but the big lump sum of anything up to £300 a month could be put aside for a year.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider that, and then the grading of repayments in the following years.  I am now talking about a repayment situation which may go into the second or third generation, but I believe that most couples would welcome this kind of compassionate approach to repayments at the beginning. Many couples at the moment are in extreme <Col N="1275" /> shock because of having to repay the vast sums demanded in the first vital year of marriage, often not knowing where the next meal will come from.  I do not think that is the kind of environment the Minister wants new families to set up in.</P>
    <P>There are also other couples who find they have not sufficient money to pay the deposit on a house and yet they are not eligible for the local authority housing lists.  Those are the people who fall between two stools.  I would like the Minister to consider a suggestion from this party on what we call a shared purchase scheme where part interest in a house is bought out pending the purchaser's readiness or ability to buy outright.  That scheme would allow a purchaser to say: &ldquo;I have sufficient deposit to raise a loan now to buy half of the house&rdquo;.  I know there are problems attached to the scheme and the Minister might consider it is rather unusual.  A house which is part owned by a person would inevitably receive more attention. If such a scheme was adopted it would give those people a stake in the community, which is very important.  A man who rang me yesterday had been waiting six years in a particular flat to get out of it but he has no chance of getting out of it.  He told me had wasted six years.  That man considered that the first six years of his married life were wasted in that flat. His flat was a waiting room and there was no point in putting money into it as he hoped eventually to get out of it.</P>
    <P>Could we not say to such a person that we would let him own a quarter interest in a house or a half interest in a house and later on if he could find the money or he could get assistance in some way he could buy out the rest of it. This idea is worthy of consideration because there would be a desire among young people to have a stake in the community. This is a very narrow Bill and does not take any consideration of suggestions like that.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider the possibility of introducing a regulation which would allow local authorities to purchase second-hand houses.  This could be done in two ways.  One way is to go to elderly people living alone, <Col N="1276" /> whose families have now left them and who are often, particularly in urban areas, living in very large houses in which there are from three to five rooms where nothing happens except the rooms become damper as time goes on.  Further down the road from some of those people there are some other houses which are over-populated.  We should be able to marry the various housing resources. I would like to see local authorities being free to invest in houses like that, indeed, as a scheme suggested by ACRA stated, to be able to purchase houses from elderly people on the basis that those people would be allowed remain in their houses until they died.  Those houses would then become the property of local authorities.  Obviously there would have to be some financial consideration where the local authorities would have to commit themselves to buy such houses possibly at today's price for houses which would not be theirs until some time in the future.  Another way of doing it might be to pay the people living in such houses a certain sum of money weekly or monthly, which would have to be offset against repairs and remedial attention to the houses.</P>
    <P>There is, in city areas particularly, a vast amount of unused private housing, which elderly people would be quite willing to sell.  Many of those people would be only too happy to sell their houses to the Minister or to local authorities if they had security of tenancy and a few pounds to spend in the meantime.  This would mean that a substantial amount of housing would be released now.  It should be borne in mind that when those houses become realisable assets they are assets obtained at prices in ten to 20 years' time for today's prices.  That is not a bad deal.  It would take an economist to work out the actual percentages and the kind of sliding scale that is involved. I would like to see the Minister take the initiative in this area.  It is not an innovation in this part of the world.  I understand that a scheme something like this operates in France.  It is worthy of consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider introducing amendments with specific reference to insulation and general antienergy wastage.  I hope the Minister is <Col N="1277" /> concerned about this as he has referred to it previously but I do not believe enough emphasis has been placed on it. Deputy Kelly recently referred to the amount of money the Government have spent on campaigns to conserve energy. Surely, when one considers the amount of money involved in owning and running a house today it is only good economic sense, sound social sense and good policy, energywise, to ensure that people are educated to conserve energy? I am afraid we do not get much encouragement in this Bill.  The Minister might say that the conservation of energy is not essentially a housing matter but I believe it is.</P>
    <P>There is massive wastage of energy in houses.  Many people have never considered the idea of insulation.  I believe the introduction of district heating schemes for the purpose of heating estates is relevant to the question of the financial approach to housing.  I mention this because if the Department of the Environment can procure greater funds for the provision of houses so that the various local authorities can provide more houses, then obviously our housing problem will not be as bad as it is now. We should ensure that the heating of houses is done as economically as possible.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Minister introducing stronger measures to compel developers to finish estates.  Although it is not a great problem in my constituency I am very familiar with the plaintive cries of people from other areas where there is no statutory provision to insist on developers actually finishing estates before they leave.  This refers back to what I said earlier on about road builders who can escape without carrying out their full responsibilities.  There are strong complaints about the way many estates are not properly finished before the road builders leave.  That is very relevant to house development.  I would like to see the Minister having stronger powers in relation to that matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider a campaign to combat the road builders, about whom I know he is very concerned. While stressing that the Construction Industry Federation and the vast majority <Col N="1278" /> of builders are decent professional people I believe there is room for initiatve, which might have a bearing on company law, and it may be necessary for the Minister to have consultations with his colleague, the Minister for Justice.  I ask the Minister to get together a convention of interests in the building profession, people like the Construction Industry Federation and the other representative organisations and work out a campaign which will ensure that the unworthy members of that profession are put to the wall.  This is too serious a business to be trifled with by people whose only interest is in making the maximum profit in the shortest possible time with scant consideration for the effect that has on people purchasing houses.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of local authority housing land, I ask the Minister to initiate a public inquiry.  I am convinced there is need for a public inquiry in this sector.  I have never understood how the local authority house per unit is higher in price in almost all cases than a similar type house built by a private builder.  I am aware that perhaps there is greater surveillance on the standards and quality of the local authority houses in some cases, although as the Minister knows there were a number of cases not long ago where the standards of surveillance fell down and so did the house.</P>
    <P>The Minister should ask one of his officials to carry out an investigation into the names and tenders forwarded in reply to advertisements by local authorities through the country and particularly in Dublin in the past six or seven years.  It would be interesting to see if a pattern emerged.  I am not sure whether it would but I am inclined to think it would.  That pattern might or might not be meaningful, but certainly some explanation is needed apart from off-the-cuff references to the price of acquiring land, which is true for all builders.</P>
    <P>Some explanation is necessary about the extremely high cost of local authority houses which more than a year ago the Minister for Economic Planning and Development said could assume proportions as high as £26,000 or £27,000 per unit.  Incidentally, this figure was put forward as an argument in <Col N="1279" /> favour of encouraging the private sector as opposed to the local authority sector as though the private sector had a magic want to keep land prices down and so on. The irony is that the local authority housing sector is supposed to be non-profitmaking and yet it is more expensive.  I know that there may be reasons why the private house situation may be a little more reasonable, perhaps having something to do with economies of scale on the edge of the city, but I am not satisfied with that.  On behalf of this party I ask the Minister to initiate a public inquiry into the cost of local authority housing.  If the Minister lifts that stone it would be very interesting to see what is underneath.</P>
    <P>In view of the shrinking allocation for local authorities from the Department I have increasing sympathy for them.  The housing problem is the greatest problem I have encountered as a public representative. About 60 per cent or 70 per cent of the representations I get relate to housing and I suspect other Deputies have a similar experience.  The situation is getting worse.  The ability to help these people is lessening.  At best all it means is jostling one person further down the line in favour of somebody else on the grounds that perhaps are just better argued or employed.  Local authorities are fair and just in their housing allocations. Occasionally there are allegations that all is not well in that regard, but I know that the officials in Dublin Corporation are painstaking in their endeavours to ensure fair play and justice.  The tragedy is that there are simply not enough houses, and no amount of manipulation or references in green or white papers to the need for revision of the points system will alter the essential fact that there are not enough houses.  This Bill will ensure that there will not be any more houses than the very moderate gradual output obtaining at present.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to consider another suggestion, namely, allowing local authorities to become more involved in non-social housing for the purpose of boosting revenue.  Occassionally one reads of some Minister returning home with a large grant&mdash;as <Col N="1280" /> an urban Deputy I would point out that it usually applies to a rural area&mdash;for some scheme or undertaking.  I do not deny the right of the rural community to enjoy a decent standard of living and I wish them all the best with that.  The Minister may say they have no money to carry out any suggestion but a number of avenues could be explored.  Capital could be raised abroad or at home, because capital is available for any scheme where there will be a return.</P>
    <P>The Minister might allow the local authorities to become involved in non-social housing.  I have never understood why local authorities are expected to pick up what might be called the &ldquo;lame duck&rdquo; element in our society and I do not say that in any way disparagingly. In the area of the private housing sector there is the belief that there is almost a God-given right to cream off the profitable end of the housing market.  It is an unwritten rule that a couple with a child cannot get a place in a private housing situation.  That is unjust, unchristian and amoral and it should be illegal. However, that is another story.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that the local authority have flexibility, that the kind of estate that was mistakenly built at Ballymun could be utilised in another way.  I could see that estate being quite suitable as a local authority estate for bedsitters.  I am not very keen on highclass flats but as they are there we must accept the reality.  There are no gardens back or front but the flats themselves are very good.  There are situations like that which could be used to make money.  I am not talking of exploiting people in private rented accommodation but I am talking of making a reasonable return which could be used for social housing which is the primary responsibility of a local authority.  The main argument against the suggestion is lack of finance but finance could be borrowed because it could be returned, unlike many of the funds for social housing.  Essentially they are written off and this is quite right because it is an investment in underwriting a basic constitutional commitment. Non-social housing would be profit-making and there should be no apology about it.  I should like the Minister to investigate that possibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1281" /> That proposal, allied to my earlier proposal of being involved in buying once-off houses&mdash;sometimes occupied by elderly people&mdash;would have the useful social advantage of encouraging a better mix.  Many of us are sick and tired of the ghetto mentality with regard to local authority housing.  Fortunately that shadow is dying and the sooner the better. There is no reason why one category of people should be sectioned off from other categories.  It would be accepted by all that a good mix of all classes and categories is the right thing and my proposals would encourage that.</P>
    <P>Elderly people and single people have problems when they try to buy their own homes.  The Minister did not refer to this matter and perhaps he would consider it now.  Elderly people have come through a fairly lean period.  In the case of some senior civil servants&mdash;when I say senior I do not necessarily mean seniority in rank but in terms of age&mdash;they may not have been able 20 years ago to put the money together for a deposit on a house. In some cases, they find themselves obliged to move out of houses which are tied to certain occupations, such as prison officers, gardai and so on.  I am very conscious of this because it comes quite close to home.  When these men needed money it was not there.  It is now too late for them to buy houses because very few people will give a loan to a man of 59 years of age facing retirement on a slim pension.  These people find their daughters and sons are earning more than they are and have a better chance of getting housing loans.  I know these people are not a big lobby and will not walk the streets of Dublin or articulate their grievances, but there is a social problem here and I would like the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of answers.  These people could be given loans which could be guaranteed in some cases by their sons and daughters.  I have always felt it was most discriminatory that Army officers, prison officers, gardaí and so on, who, by virtue of their occupation, were moved around the country&mdash;sometimes they were given only a couple of hours' notice&mdash;lived in tied accommodation but because of their transferability were actively discouraged from being able to <Col N="1282" /> save or purchase a house even if they had the money.  These people now find themselves in a very serious situation.  I know one man who had a nervous breakdown because of the anxieties and worries facing him.  These people need attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is extending the scope of the Bill, which is already very wide.  He is making an Estimate speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is deficient in a number of respects.  Some single people come into the same category as the elderly.  One of the ironies of this housing situation at the moment is that some single people find it more economic to buy a house than to rent a flat.  This is an example of waste.  I am pointing out the areas of waste where this Bill could be modified to cope with these situations.  I know some young women who are at present buying their own homes&mdash;and good luck to them&mdash;and who, up to now might have been living in rented accommodation. I wonder if we are juggling our resources to the best advantage.</P>
      <P>I understand there is no reference in this Bill to the area of housing finance for flat accommodation in the private rented sector.  This is the Cinderella of the housing area.  There are approximately 300,000 people in private rented accommodation.  In many cases they live under conditions which are not ideal.  In some cases this is indefensible and smells of Rachmanism.  In many other cases it is a little more understandable in view of the outdated way we have treated this area.  The Minister should consider amendments in this area.  It is not unreasonable to expect that the private rented accommodation sector which accommodates so many people should be the beneficiary of the same largesse which applies to other areas of the housing spectrum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A massive grant scheme should be provided so long as people maintain their houses for the purpose of giving accommodation. We should encourage this.  We should review the Rent Restrictions Act.  We should set up an independent rent tribunal.  We should do all things that are right and proper in this <Col N="1283" /> area so that the pressure is taken off the areas of primary concern, that is, the insatiable demands for finance in the local authority and private housing sectors. This legitimate area is doing great work. As I said, it is the Cinderella area of housing.</P>
    <P>What have we got?  Neglect.  Conditions are very bad.  There is substantial abuse which may or may not be the fault of landlords and/or tenants.  This is an area of challenge for the Minister but regrettably there is nothing in the Bill about it.  Perhaps the Minister would look at this again since private rented accommodation is a legitimate part of housing policy and deserves consideration in terms of legislative and financial attention because of the impact it would have on the other areas which are demanding the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>We are told that the big problem in housing is finance.  Section 18 deals with new house prices.  In his efforts to try to combat this the Minister said that he was convinced there was a need for a satisfactory framework for the operation of controls in the price of new houses. We welcome that conviction.  We would welcome it even more if something practical had been done about it&mdash;for example, if he said he had controlled the price of building land or building profits or the price of new houses.  Any of these proposals would be worthy of consideration. It is much easier for the Minister to say he is convinced there is a need for a framework for the operation of control in the price of new houses.  That is an interesting semantic exercise.  Look carefully at the words used.  The Minister is convinced not that the Government need introduce a particular scheme but that there is a need for a framework for the operation of controls in the price of houses.  What he really means is that he hopes certain peripheral measures he takes will have the effect of depressing house prices.  In other words, he will not take responsibility in this area; he will leave it to somebody else.  That is the fault of this Bill, of this Minister and of the Government in this area.  The nettle has not been grasped, to use a cliché.</P>
    <P>The scourge for so many young people today is the price of a house.  The <Col N="1284" /> irony is that the Government will not win anyway, because if they do not tackle this problem in a realistic way they will have to tackle it through the local authority scheme.  If the local authority allocation is persistently reduced as a percentage of expenditure on housing, as it has been since this Government came into power, the people will be on the streets.</P>
    <P>A new look must be taken at the whole question of local authority fund raising.  Where is the money to come from?  I do not believe this country should be going abroad cap in hand looking for loans.  Every time we get a loan it is hailed as a major initiative.  On a news bulletin last week there was not even a mention of the interest rates to be paid.  It is as if loans were God's gift and we did not have to repay them.  We will not have to repay these loans but our children will, if they can ever see over the debt we are getting into and for very shallow purposes in some cases.</P>
    <P>The banks, the insurance companies and pension trusts should carry more of the burden.  The Minister should talk to them and put pressure on them so that funds lying dormant should be used for the good of all the people.  They should not be allowed simply to gather wealth for a few people.  The amount of money being provided by these institutions in recent years has been decreasing as a percentage of total expenditure on housing. The Minister should get after these companies.  He should use some sort of moral force and, if that does not work, use legislative force to ensure that the basic fundamental need of decent housing for all our people is met.  I am not suggesting that the Minister should engender friction with our financial institutions, but if the Government do not dictate the pace and trends in this area there is no point in having a Government. A lot more should be done in that area.</P>
    <P>I have tried to outline a few suggestions and proposals from a Fine Gael policy paper entitled <i>An Urban Affairs Policy Document</i> which states the policy of this party.  It is not the last word on housing policy.  It is not necessarily even very good word, but it gives a number of ideas of what could be done in the housing <Col N="1285" /> area.  I would like to think that it contrasts favourably with the arid approach in the Minister's Bill, which is very cosmetic and does not grasp the fundamentals of housing needs.  Just imagine a lengthy discourse on housing and house prices which does not refer even once to the price of building land and which has qualified out of existence the most punchy part of his speech in relation to CRVs.  Before preparation of the speech was completed apparently the Construction Industry Federation and other agencies were in touch with the Minister and, whatever pressure was brought to bear, we find certain qualifications coming into the Minister's attitudes to CRVs.  I am worried about this.  The Minister should also have referred in the Bill to ensuring that his Department will have the power in future to insist on standards in new houses which are not merely basic but which are essential to, for example, safe conduct and the welfare and good health of the people in the houses.  Before me I have an independent report, given to me today, of houses in the County Dublin area which were inspected for compliance with the requirements of the national rules for electrical installation.  I do not propose to read out the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I want to refer to the Minister's speech introducing this Second Reading.  Early on he said:</P>
      <P>In general, the Bill is largely a validating measure relating to changes made since 1972 in the schemes of financial assistance in the form of housing grants, subsidies and loans under the Housing Acts, 1977 to 1970.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to house construction and the regulations which the Minister can take to himself in that regard, the Minister, as the man who answers, is negligent in relation to trying to ensure that housing constructions and particularly electrical installations are up to modern standards.  I want the Minister to ensure that schemes of financial assistance in the form of housing grants, subsidies and loans will not be payable to any of the gerrybuilders who <Col N="1287" /> in recent times, it may be argued, have been responsible for the deaths of young children due to the installation of defective wiring.  I will supply the Minister with this very lengthy, detailed, independent report on an estate.  Unless we mean what we say in this House, unless we ensure that builders who indulge in this kind of thing find it does not pay, we are negligent in our duty.  It is scandalous that housing grants, subsidies or loans should be payable in respect of estates or to builders having a poor record in this regard.  This has been discussed previously in the House but nothing has been done about it and I do not know why.</P>
      <P>Let me give one instance which occurred recently in a house on this estate.  A young baby was burned to death, and without any question of doubt the independent contractor called in found that this was due to defective wiring which would have cost an extra £8 to £10 to put right.  I know that the Minister would not for a moment condone that standard and it is my job to bring the matter to his attention so that he can get cracking on it and ensure that it will not recur.  I look forward in due course to either a private or public response from him in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent report from the NESC called <i>Urbanisation and Regional Development in Ireland</i> shows clearly that there will be an enormous burgeoning demand for housing in the city of Dublin and in other areas.  If we are going to deal with it we have a long way to go, not only in relation to the kind of schemes for housing grants, subsidies and loans to which the Minister referred today, but in relation to our basic vision of social development for housing generally.  Whether we like it or not, money being spent on housing as a percentage of total expenditure in the public area is declining. That is extremely unfortunate because the demand is going up all the time. Presumably the Minister has to battle with his colleagues around the Cabinet table to get the extra finance, but the social argument is the most compelling one here.  If we invest the money now&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;invest&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;we will offset the need to have to spend <Col N="1288" /> money later on remedial schemes and schemes for building a plethora of places like Loughan House.  If we give housing the priority which it deserves in social policy and if we try to create the domestic environment to which people are entitled, we will never regret it.</P>
    <P>There is much in the Bill with which nobody could disagree.  The Bill contains provisions to strengthen the present statutory basis for the control of prices of certain new private houses and flats. That is inadequate, and I would like the Minister to have the courage of his convictions. From the tenor of his remarks on a number of occasions I know that he has a passionate dedication to trying to make progress in this area.  Leadership here would be responded to.  Let him take the necessary measures and implement them and the respect which people have for him will grow and great social and economic good will follow.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give more flexibility to housing authorities in allocating their houses and will empower the Minister for the Environment to direct the housing authorities to sell or not to sell houses of a specified class.  That also is welcome.  It empowers the local authority to have greater flexibility in that area.  Generally the idea is commendable in so far as it places more autonomy and more sovereignty in local hands.</P>
    <P>The reference that the Minister made to the arrangements which were terminated on the introduction of the new State grant schemes in respect of new houses and house improvements with effect from 6 July and 1 November 1977 respectively, in order to avoid unnecessary duplication of administration, is also well noted and I am glad that provision is in the Bill.  I have mentioned the cognisance which the Minister has taken of the expansion of co-operative housing activities in recent years and I would like to see more financial support and more back-up for them.  Apart from the solitary and very worthy acknowledgement which the Minister gives of the effort, there is not a great deal more to help in this Bill.  The Minister stated that the Government are anxious that NABCo be given every encouragement <Col N="1289" /> and have accordingly approved a grant towards their administrative and general expenses in 1979.  Greater budgetary powers and fiscal possibilities would be more in line, but a grant towards administrative and general expenses is always helpful.  The Minister might consider giving them a budget of some kind or empowering local authorities to do so to a greater extent than is possible at present.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 6 of the Bill have been drafted on the basis that a broad general power is conferred on the Minister or a housing authority to pay grants for specified purposes.  This is commendable. We look forward to seeing the regulations governing the principal features of the grants.  I am pleased that the Minister wants in the future to simplify still further the grants scheme. Many of the grant schemes are so tortuously spelled out and so labyrinthine in the complexity of the literature accompanying them that one would need to be a cross between an Einstein and a professor of English to understand them. This applies to all types of Government grants.  I have no doubt that much money and many possibilities are lost because people are unable to come to grips with the proposals.  Simplification is necessary so that people can understand their rights.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to the accommodation of physically disabled people and the extension of that scheme in 1975 to include severely mentally handicapped people.  There is some evidence that we are succumbing to pressure from lobby groups only.  All people have a right to be heard but the weakest in our society, people like the handicapped and the blind, are represented by groups whose spokesmen are often reticent and whose experience of bringing pressure to bear is often limited.  I would ask the Minister to take bold initiatives in this area and to insist on local authorities playing their part.  I may take the opportunity of corresponding with the Minister on some minor details relating to this area, assuming correspondence in the normal sense will soon be resumed.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the important scheme <Col N="1290" /> relating to the making of grants to approved bodies providing housing and caretaker accommodation for elderly persons.  This is very worthy.  I know of many people who are condemned to live in garrets where they lead lonely, lean existences far removed from the romanticism of the stereotyped artist or painter.  My constituency has a great deal of that type of accommodation and this proposal will undoubtedly help these people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to increase unsecured loans to people carrying out improvement works and the decreased amount of administrative work which will accompany these proposals in the future.  The Minister proposes to increase these loans from £200 to £600. This will have a good effect, although I am not sure what the extent of the impact will be.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will enable the Minister to pay a subsidy to housing authorities towards the annual loan charges incurred by them in providing sites for private housing, subject to such regulations as may be made.  This is precisely the kind of section which could be open to certain amendment.  These sites are sometimes provided without sufficient guarantees about the full spirit and letter of all that attaches to the housing being carried out.  We should insist on certain guarantees or bonds so that the provision of sites for private housing will be tightened up.  Something must be done to stop complaints about unfinished estates. The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>I have taken steps to increase the supply of serviced land by increasing substantially the allocation for sanitary services this year and I asked local authorities last August to consider the development of part of their land reserves with a view to making sites available for private housing, particularly as an incentive to tenants or prospective tenants of their houses to secure their own accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the difficulty experienced by some local authorities because they do not have the land.  The compulsory purchase order procedures which enable them to acquire land are outdated and I do not anticipate that <Col N="1291" /> there will be any remarkable improvement in their capacity in this area.  The financial potential which a local authority have does not necessarily result in a greater provision of serviced sites.  The cost of serviced sites is very germane to the whole area of housing finance.  I am worried that the reference might be a little superficial and may not zone in on the right area.  The increased allocation is obviously welcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the provision in section 10 (6) whereby, in the case of moneys borrowed from the Commissioners of Public Works, subsidy can also be effected by writing off moneys owed to the commissioners by housing authorities.  This would give rise to some savings in administrative costs.  The Minister should look at the whole area of overlapping and duplication in administration which, because of the varying grant schemes and the burgeoning weight of documentation, may be unnecessarily costly.  The Minister says that unfortunately it is not feasible to introduce this change just yet and he might explain in his reply why this is so.</P>
    <P>We must welcome also the recent modification in the scheme which will allow certain two-person families to qualify for the low rise mortgage scheme.  I am glad the Minister acknowledges the fact that two-person families&mdash;or single-parent families&mdash;are on the increase.  They have a representative group in this city who are concerned about the availability of housing. In the local authority context housing needs are usually assessed on the number of heads in the household and not on the intricate and sometimes traumatic psychological needs of people, which are admittedly hard to quantify for the purposes of allocating housing. Because a mother and child are classified only as two people they can get relatively scant attention.  The low rise mortgage scheme may be the answer and I am convinced this is so.  It is essentially a loan scheme.  Without wishing to fall into the trap of categorising any element in society in a particular way, there is reason to believe that a substantial number of single parents might not have ready access to the kind of deposit <Col N="1292" /> necessary in the case of a low rise mortgage scheme.  We might have to go a little further.  At least this recognition by the Minister is welcome and I hope it will be reflected in other Government Departments which will probably be dealing with this issue on an increasing scale.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister is concerned about delays in having pre-sale work completed.  These delays hold up the sale of local authority houses.  Last week in reply to a question here the Minister expressed concern when I told him that in some cases it can take two years.  The Minister's suggestion is sensible and will allow people to get on with the jobs involved and recoup the cost later.  I am slightly worried about what I might call public distrust of recoupments from Government Departments.  There is not a great deal of enthusiasm in that area on the part of members of the public who bewail the fact that it takes many months to get back money to which they are entitled.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that the financial transaction between the individual and the local authority will be so expeditious that no extra cost will be incurred.</P>
    <P>Section 60 (8) of the 1966 Act requires a housing authority, in determining the order of priority to be followed in letting local authority houses in accordance with their approved scheme of letting priorities, to obtain and have regard to a report from their chief medical officer. Medical certificates have become an increasing factor.  I would not be surprised if the chief housing allocations officer in Dublin city assumed that a medical certificate was an essential qualification for an applicant.  The vast majority of applications are accompanied by a medical certificate.  In some cases they carry little or no weight.  The problems in this area are very delicate.  I am not over-happy about the degree to which the Minister appears to have confidence in the suggestion&mdash;unless I misinterpret him&mdash;that the staff of housing authorities could perform certain duties in the assessment of these certificates. Maybe that is not what the Minister meant.  Maybe there are certain types of certificates which could be assessed by <Col N="1293" /> somebody who is not a medical practitioner.</P>
    <P>We are talking here about medical, psychological and psychosomatic factors which are difficult to quantify. Harassed housing officials might be unable to give them adequate time and consideration due to pressure of other work, and might find they have not the skills necessary to evaluate such statements fully.  I am not sure that the medical profession would be overjoyed either.  If a particular type of illness or disability is certified as being experienced by the applicant, the medical practitioner involved might feel aghast at the fact that the certificate is apparently open to any one of a number of people.  Possibly the question of medical ethics would be involved.</P>
    <P>I know many people who are reticent about opening the letter they get from the doctor.  One lady of my acquaintance underwent an operation and when she came out she looked quite well.  When I asked her how she felt she said she felt very well.  When I asked her what she suffered from and what the operation was all about she said: &ldquo;I am afraid I do not know.&rdquo;  She had not the courage to ask the doctor.  There is a time-honoured reverence for the medical certificate.  I am not sure that the medical profession or the applicant would be all that happy about its being opened up in the way in which the Minister appears to imply that it may be opened up.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the system of certifying reasonable value in respect of the prices of new houses and flats no longer provides an adequate statutory framework for the operation of this form of control on house prices.  I do not believe the new regulations will make the slightest difference to the price of houses.  They will make certain differences in what might be called the administration of the CRV system.  They are bound to mean some slight improvement for some people.  They could also mean a disimprovement for other people. Certain builders might now pitch their prices very high.  This relatively innocent proposal could mean that, in order to ensure that adequate profits are made, people would insist on certain <Col N="1294" /> types of CRVs whereas heretofore they may have been willing to settle for slightly less.</P>
    <P>There should be a mandatory control by the Department of the Environment not just on monitoring house prices but even certificates of reasonable value and land prices.  This is a very fundamental area and there should be no apology from the Government for stepping in, in the wake of an 18-month period when house prices rose by anything up to 50 per cent, and saying they intend to take an initiative, whoever likes or whoever does not like it.  That would earn respect for the Minister and his colleagues.  The Minister said a flexible approach must be adopted and controls adjusted in consultation with interested bodies to take account of changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>That can only be called a let-out clause.  It is a classic of its kind.  It uses all the appropriate phrases: &ldquo;flexible approach&rdquo;, &ldquo;controls adjusted&rdquo;, &ldquo;consultation with interested bodies&rdquo;, &ldquo;changing circumstances&rdquo;.  It is the Achilles heel of that proposal.  There can be no ambiguity if a Bill is introduced which specifically states that something will be such-and-such in accordance with the law of the land.  When the Minister introduces a framework within which certain things are expected to occur, and the Minister feels in his heart that they will not occur, and I feel in my mind and in my heart that they will not occur, I get very worried.  I would be even more worried if I were waiting to buy a new house.  I am a little unhappy about that, to put it mildly.  I do not think it will work.</P>
    <P>The suggestions the Minister makes are helpful but I do not think they go far enough.  He suggested that certain loans might be required to be accompanied by a CRV before they could be obtained. That is a good suggestion but there is a possibility of avoiding or evading it. Some months ago the Minister found difficulty in trying to ensure that the lending agencies would comply with his request in relation to loans for houses up to a certain value.  There were obvious difficulties in implementing that because there was no statutory backup.  Here we have a proposal which apparently goes a <Col N="1295" /> little further.  I wish him luck and I hope it works, but I do not think it will.  The fundamental approach to house prices is too weak.</P>
    <P>Steps are to be taken to reconcile the anticipated level of mortgage lending for new houses with the financial needs of the national housing programme.  The Minister must be extremely worried about the mortgage rate.  I do not see anything in the Bill which would give any consolation there.  Perhaps the Minister has a separate proposal.  If there is any area of social policy which is most fundamental surely it is housing.  If we give all our resources, all our ideas and all our commitments, and the necessary legislation, to ensuring that young couples and the not so young individuals to whom I referred earlier on have a chance of providing a decent domestic environment for themselves and their children, a major advance will be made, and the social malaise which afflicts many urban centres in other countries and which is being duplicated here tragically, will be avoided.  A great deal of it stems from bad housing and the pressure it places on marriages and on young people growing up.  All these things do not have to be spelled out.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment responsible for housing, the Minister has the opportunity to introduce dramatic initiatives in this area.  I appeal to him to look at the Bill again, to consider the improvements which could be made, if necessary to introduce a new Bill, to consider some of the suggestions we have made in an effort to be constructive, and to provide a great deal more than is in this Bill.  We wish the best to all the proposals in the Bill and we hope they are successful, with the reservations we mentioned earlier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Any debate on housing is of great importance both economically and socially and I am glad to have an opportunity of contributing to it.  The economic and social factors in the housing sphere are of the utmost importance to people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 1979, contains many worth-while provisions and few innovations. <Col N="1296" /> The package seems to have been put together in a furtive way.  The Minister seems to be looking over his shoulder at people he fears might exert some pressure for some reason or other. This is the impression I get from reading the Bill and from the Minister's speech. Bodies such as the CIF exert pressure to look after their own interest and their own people.  At times one wonders whether the political head of a Department, while he should consult with these people and seek their views as they are experts in their own field, should not take his courage in his hands in dealing with an area as important as housing.</P>
    <P>In dealing with housing one is dealing with the largest investment of a family. The rights of the house purchaser ought to override any other consideration.  I am speaking about the basic idea of value for money.  We have consumer legislation covering advertising and, while we have further legislation pending in the Sale of Goods Bill, such legislation excludes housing&mdash;something which is very strange.  We are left with a scheme which was initiated and is being implemented by people who have a vested interest in housing and in the construction industry generally.  This is a wrong approach.  The Minister should see to it that the regulations governing value for money and guaranteeing consumers their rights come from this House.</P>
    <P>As a member of two local authorities and as a Deputy I am very interested in social housing.  The concern I express about the provision of local authority houses is based on some years of experience. There is a backlog of houses to be provided.  There is a problem regarding the type of house being provided and of ensuring the proper location of the houses.  Not many weeks ago, dealing with this problem in a Private Members' Motion, the Minister reluctantly admitted that there was a limit in the case of isolated cottages.  The words &ldquo;unit cost&rdquo; were mentioned. There is a limit to the amount of money allowed for the provision of an isolated cottage.  I know this to my cost.  Local authorities who seek tenders from contractors for the provision of houses or isolated cottages find that they cannot <Col N="1297" /> accept these because they are in excess of the guidelines laid down, be they unit cost or whatever.  In my own county I know of three cases where it is nine months since tenders were received for houses.  They have yet to be commenced simply because no contractor was prepared to take them at the going rate, that is the limit rate beyond which the local authority cannot let them to a contractor. This is a problem and it is unfair. We are dealing with people who cannot provide this facility for themselves.  They are depending on the Minister, on the Government and on the local authority, and they are let down.  It is not good enough.  They are in a hopeless position and cannot make their voices heard.</P>
    <P>In regard to isolated cottages, as I said before there are subtle pressures being used by local authorities to force people into housing schemes rather than building for them in their own localities. This may be due to pressure on them to extend their allocation of money as far as possible.  I presume that the provision of ten houses on one site would be cheaper than providing ten houses on ten separate sites.  Sight must not be lost of the social and compassionate aspect of providing housing.</P>
    <P>There are people who are dependent on others to provide them with the basic right which they have by law, the right to be housed.  They are being pushed around.  While the saving of money and the provision of housing at the lowest rate possible is a laudable objective, at the same time the pressures under which these people are put is not to the credit of any Minister or Government.  I am not blaming the Minister for it, but he should look into it.  He is talking here about flexibility and consultation.  This is one area where a flexible approach ought to be applied and the Minister should be seen to be impressing this upon the minds of the people in the local authorities and in the health boards and so on who are in the field dealing with these people.</P>
    <P>I would also like to mention another area where an anomaly has arisen and it concerns the abolition of rates.  This idea <Col N="1298" /> started some years ago when the National Coalition intended to abolish rates on a yearly basis over a four-year period.  Fianna Fáil did it in one go and abolished rates on domestic dwellings thereby losing revenue to the Exchequer which they had to provide by other means.</P>
    <P>There are two anomalies which arise from that.  The people who have benefited most from this are the people in the very large houses with high valuations. A recent anomaly has also arisen in that the major increases in rents that have taken place in the case of local authority houses have hit the local authority tenants.  Indeed, in many cases, the increased rents now demanded are in excess of the rates they would have been paying had the rates not been abolished.  While that has happened the biggest beneficiaries, the people in the big houses with big valuations, are not paying rent to anybody; they are still off the hook and they are not asked for an increase in anything at the moment. Again there is a very definite anomaly here and I feel that it is something that the Minister might consider looking at to see if there is any possible way to ensure that there is equality of treatment for tenants as against people who own their own houses and who are now rate-free.</P>
    <P>There is a further anomaly and a very blatant one which arises again in the case of local authority houses.  There are many local authority houses, many of them built many years ago.  Even yet these have not got the facility of water and sewerage schemes.  They are, by definition, substandard and, as the Minister is aware, if a tenant in that house without sanitary facilities applies for a grant for reconstruction, the provision of sanitary services would have to be part of that reconstruction in order to get the grant.  In other words he would not get away with putting in doors and windows and qualify for a grant without providing what is regarded as a basic requirement, the provision of sanitary services. So, by the Minister's own definition, these houses are substandard. While on the one hand that can be said and is being said, the local authority, the Exchequer and the Minister come along <Col N="1299" /> and expect an increased rent from the tenant.  There is something very wrong with that kind of double think attitude. On the other hand, a person is living in a substandard house and it qualifies for nothing, yet the Minister, the local authority, the Government, the Exchequer are benefiting from the acceptance of rent from that unfortunate tenant. There is something here that is very wrong.  I suggest to the Minister that the number of these houses is diminishing in relation to the total housing stock in the country.</P>
    <P>I know of one local authority, an urban council, which a few weeks ago decided to investigate the possibility of providing bathrooms and toilets in the houses they had without these facilities in their area.  They ran into the problem of the cost of this and the fact that the repayments falling on the tenants in such houses would be excessive and discovered that the tenants would be incapable of making the repayments.  In those circumstances surely the onus ought to be on the Minister and on the Government to provide a once-off grant in the estimate for housing to provide houses, from whose tenants they are accepting rents, with sanitary services.  It would be a very generous gesture and it would be a sensible one because he would be improving the local authority housing stock and he would eliminate this blatant anomaly that is there at the moment.  It is something for which the Minister would be thanked and it would be a very worth-while and laudible approach by him.  It is something which would not cost that much, in relation to the total cost of the housing vote.</P>
    <P>The question of house purchase schemes was also referred to by Deputy Keating.  We have had in the past experience of different house purchase schemes.  There are certain provisions relating to concessions in schemes down through the years where tenants are given credit for rent paid up to a ten-year period at 3 per cent per annum.  So, together with the grant originally paid, they get a 30 per cent reduction in the market value of the house.  I have here this green Fianna Fáil housing policy which was circulated in large numbers <Col N="1300" /> some few years ago.  The first provision that I note is to give tenants who purchased prior to 1973 a reduction of one quarter of the number of repayments, for example, seven and a half years repayments on a 30-year term.</P>
    <P>That is a very laudable suggestion and, coming at election time, it was a very fine vote-catching gesture.  There is here at the moment a certain house purchasers' association and they feel that they are in a very strong position to make a claim that this kind of suggestion would be implemented in their case. They maintain that in 1968 a house purchase scheme was introduced and, as Deputy Keating has said, due to the kind of publicity this got and possibly due to the terminology used, the tenants of the day did not know what they were entitled to and let this house purchase scheme slip by.  It was 1974 before they discovered that many people were eligible for inclusion in a house purchase scheme which would give them ownership of their own house.  They feel that because of their own culpable ignorance and because of the fact that the Department of Local Government, or the local authority in question, did not handle the matter properly or give it the desirable publicity instructing the tenants of their rights under the provisions of the purchase scheme, they are entitled to consideration and to the concession of the seven and a half years write-off in a 30-year period.  It would be a gesture of goodwill in many of those cases if the Minister did that because most of those people are finding it difficult to meet the mortgages they arranged after purchase.</P>
    <P>The question of structural repairs is a very thorny problem which causes long delays in many cases.  The Minister in his introductory speech stated that he will introduce a certain degree of flexibility in this regard in operating what he described as the optional procedure, that the tenant may get somebody outside a local authority to carry out structural repairs.  The problem is that, unless the Minister instructs local authorities clearly that this provision is to expedite matters and not hold them up, he could have a hassle going on between a tenant, the contractor and a local authority about <Col N="1301" /> the possible cost of repairs.  A contractor may suggest that a chimney should be knocked down while local authority engineers may disagree.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, such an appeal is a long drawn out affair.  Appealing to a Department on any issue takes months, even years, if one goes on the track record.  I hope the Minister will expedite things in his Department in this regard.  Were I a tenant who disagreed with a local authority on the level of repairs to be carried out I could not envisage myself appealing to the Minister and hope to get a reply within a matter of months.  That reply may arrive within six or nine months.  Such an appeal is a slow process.  The idea is a good one but I wonder if it will expedite existing procedures.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that the low rise mortgage scheme was not availed of to the extent it might have been.  When introduced it provided a facility for those vacating local authority houses and purchasing private houses.  Initially, this provision made sense but private housing has become so expensive that the low rise mortgage scheme should be made available to certain categories of people apart from those vacating local authority houses.  The SDA loan stands at £9,000 with an income limit of £4,000, which is nothing short of ludicrous in this day and age.  I accept that many people are availing of that scheme but I am sure the Minister is aware that in many cases the amount of the loan only goes half-way towards providing the type of house some purchasers have in mind.  The social problems resulting from the pressures brought about by this massive commitment on the part of a young newly married couple are serious for the couple, their family and the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister ought to apply something in the form of the low-rise mortgage scheme to all who become eligible for SDA loans.  A person earning <Col N="1302" /> £76 per week is not in a position to face the commitment of a mortgage which could be twice the amount applicable to a mortgage of £9,000.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not seek to extend the provisions of that scheme to all applicants eligible for SDA loans.  I was also disappointed that the Minister omitted to make any mention of conservation of energy in the Bill.  We are all aware that VAT applies to insulation materials here and that in other countries, countries which are suffering a similar fate to us on the question of energy, grants are being given towards conservation of energy in the form of incentives to insulate homes.  People are being penalised for providing insulation in their own homes.  While travelling to this House yesterday I heard a statement on the radio to the effect that a grant was now available for the provision of a solid fuel cooker in homes.  That individual then made the point that those with a fireplace in their homes would not qualify for the grant.</P>

      <P>In the press and radio yesterday the impression was given to people more gullible than I that the grant was available to people who wanted to instal solid fuel boilers.  That is not so.  It applies only when a house has not got a chimney and is without facilities for solid <Col N="1303" /> fuel burners.  The anomaly is that people who have modern bungalows or houses with oil fired central heating and without chimneys can avail of the grant whereas people who normally would be totally dependent on oil and who would have at least one fireplace, cannot avail of the grant&mdash;one more in the long litany of anomalies in regard to housing grants.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has a major problem: if he were given plenty of money he could do all these things. That will not happen, so the Minister has provided a housing service for people in need when there are many things which would not cost too much money not being done.  I reiterate that the rights of people as consumers, house purchasers, are not being protected either in consumer legislation or in this Bill.  It is unfortunate that the regulations governing purchasers' rights seem to be coming from the wrong side of the fence.  It is anomalous to have a manufacturer laying down laws about cars for car purchasers, about what they might or might not do.  Although there are common law rights in regard to housing, there are not any specific housing rights <i>per se</i>.  In the <i>Evening Herald</i> today there is a report in regard to what are called rogue builders.  There is reference to what the Minister has said about it: &ldquo;All builders in the country are not rogue builders&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We have had a fairly wideranging discussion on housing matters generally, lasting throughout the morning, afternoon and evening, with occasional references to the provisions in the Bill.  I will deal with a number of the points made in a general way and more specifically when I come to the Committee Stage.  Deputies have suggested that the Government are committed to a policy of cutting back the local <Col N="1304" /> authorities' housing programme.  This has no relevance to the Bill except that the Government are proposing to take powers to provide an unprecedented generous subsidy towards the cost of this type of housing.</P>
      <P>To get the record straight I want to state categorically that it is not part of the Government's policy to run down the local authority housing.  That programme had been run down sharply before the change of Government in 1977&mdash;from 8,974 completions in 1975 to 7,263 in 1976 and 6,333 in 1977.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>This year £86 million has been provided for local authority housing, including the low-rise mortgage scheme, as compared with £72.6 million in 1977, and the Exchequer subsidy in 1979 will amount to more than £54 million against £30.65 million in 1977. Government policy is aimed at maintaining a steady output in the local authority housing programme thereby encouraging stability in employment and in the supply of materials and contracting resources.  The number of houses completed by local authorities or financed by low-rise mortgages, directly catering for the needs of persons on housing waiting lists, totalled 6,791 in 1978 as against 6,635 in 1977.  I am confident it will be about the same level in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to subsidising mortgage interest charges on building society loans as had been done by the Government of which he was a member.  I would remind him that the interest subsidy was introduced by the Coalition Government in 1973 not to help borrowers directly but to stimulate an inflow of funds to building societies which were very low at the time.  The mortgage rate then was 10 per cent and the subsidy was reduced to ¾ of one per cent in 1975 and was abolished in February 1976 when the mortgage rate was 12½ per cent.  That Government did not make any move to introduce a subsidy when the mortgage interest rate rose to 13.95 per cent.  A 1 per cent subsidy now would cost about £7 million a year and it would benefit people who are already adequately housed.  Money of <Col N="1305" /> that order would be better applied to provide proper living accommodation for families in genuine need of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn and others referred to the desirability of tapping the potential contribution which co-operative housing could make to the national housing programme.  Section 3 of the Bill is real evidence of our commitment to supporting the principle of co-operative housing.  I have also pressed local authorities to make developed sites available for individuals who wish to build modestly priced houses for their own accommodation and have greatly increased the subsidy in respect of those sites.  This is an aspect of housing policy I would very much like to see expanded. I would like to put on record the real achievements which dedicated groups such as the Rural Housing Organisation, which was referred to by Deputy Tully and which was founded in my county about a decade ago, can bring about. The Liberties Co-operative in Dublin has helped families in corporation houses or on the waiting lists to buy their own private houses.  People on the waiting lists have been helped through those particular co-operatives.  The encouragement I have given to co-operative housing, including the powers proposed in section 3 of the Bill, contrasts with the complete lack of any action by the National Coalition Government in their four years in office.  They did not give any kind of effective stimulus to the co-operative movement during that time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn and other speakers tried to create an impression of a state of conflict and tension between the CIF and myself, which is not true.  The construction industry know and appreciate that they were rescued from acute depression by the policies of this Government.  Employment and output in the industry are higher than at any other time in the seventies.  Output in 1978 was an all-time record and present indications are that output in this year will be well above the average for the national economy generally.</P>
    <P>There has been a regular sequence of consultations between the CIF and <Col N="1306" /> myself, the Minister of State and my Department about matters of mutual concern, the most recent of which actually took place earlier this month when a general review of the output of this industry in 1978 and the outlook for 1979 took place.  It is natural that house builders should resist any controls over the price of their products but their opposition to house price control must be considered in relation to the objective that house purchasers should get reasonable value for their investment.  It seems that we all agree on this.  This is the purpose underlying section 18 of the Bill.  However, I feel that builders may have a legitimate grievance about the lack of any form of appeal or any machinery for appeal against the refusal to grant a CRV.  As I said this morning, I intend to deal with this on Committee Stage by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully criticised the amount of capital made available this year for SDA loans.  I suggest that he compare the £44½ million provided this year under the public capital programme with the £17.66 million provided under the 1977 budget, when he was the Minister responsible for the scheme.  The number of loans approved under the scheme has been increasing rapidly as a result of the two increases given in the maximum loan and the income limit just two years ago.  I would remind the Deputy also that between 1973 and 1977, when he was Minister, no increase was given in either the loan or the income limit.</P>
    <P>In 1977 5,052 SDA loans totalling £25.8 million were approved.  Last year the totals were 7,515 loans and to the tune of £50.2 million.  In the first three months of this year 2,163 loans totalling £16.9 million were approved.  This on an annual basis is equivalent to 8,652 loans totalling £67.6 million.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully questioned whether or not local authority houses would be eligible for house improvement grants, which were formerly known as reconstruction grants and still are by most people.  Any local authority tenant or tenant purchaser is entitled to a grant as any private dweller is.  Jobs such as the installation of a fireplace and chimney in a house without those <Col N="1307" /> facilities are covered under the scheme.  I intend to issue a circular to local authorities dealing in a comprehensive manner with the subject of repairs and improvements to their houses and will deal specifically with the financing of the work which will be involved in the very near future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully had some comments to make about section 16 of the Bill which gives local authorities a discretion whether or not to get advice from the local medical officer when deciding the order of priority for lettings of local authority houses.  This discretion was requested by a number of our local authorities who were influenced by the fact that the medical officer of health is not an officer of the local authority concerned and is not answerable to and is not subject to control by the particular local authority.  The decision as to whether or not the medical officer in question should be involved in lettings will be made by each local authority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully criticised the levels of grant assistance available for the provision of new houses and the improvement of existing houses.  He was the Minister responsible when the Coalition Government in 1976 severely curtailed eligibility for new house grants by relating it to the ludicrously low income limits then applying in the case of supplementary local authority grants.  This was done at a time when house building costs were rising rapidly.  A year later the Deputy introduced valuation limits in order to reduce the number of people qualifying for the hopelessly inadequate reconstruction grants at that time.  I would like to point out that this year's Estimate for my Department provides £30 million for housing grants.  When this is compared with the £4½ million allocated by the National Coalition in their 1977 budget it is very difficult to accept that Deputy Tully was serious when he criticised Fianna Fáil in this particular area.</P>
    <P>He also asked about the staffing position in the section of my Department dealing with CRV applications.  I would like to assure him that since taking office I have kept a close eye on the position and have increased the staff level considerably <Col N="1308" /> as it was necessary to do so. This is borne out by our record in regard to the time taken to issue decisions.  The staffing implications of the measures incorporated in this Bill will be attended to whenever they arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick alleged that the low rise mortgage scheme is not being availed of to any extent.  This is quite untrue. Payments under the scheme totalled £5.47 million in 1978.  A further £1.36 million was paid in the first quarter of this year and at 31 March 1979 the total applications on hands amounted to £8.41 million.  It took some time for this scheme to get off the ground but in the last two years it has really taken off and I am glad.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn indicated that his party proposed to move an amendment on Committee Stage to the effect that regulations made by the Minister may be amended by the Dáil.  I am advised legally that it would not be possible to give effect to such an amendment.  However, I should make it clear that if this House considers that specific provisions of regulations made under this Bill should be amended I will be prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the making of revised regulations providing for the amendment of the existing regulations along the lines suggested.</P>
    <P>The question of delays in issuing CRVs was referred to by more than one speaker.  It was said that the average was 21 days, but since I stated that in this House I am now aware that in 1978 during which 2,400 decisions were issued the average time was only 15 days.  In May 1979 the average time was only 14 days.  It is important to distinguish between decisions and certificates since in some cases a number of negative decisions may have issued prior to the CRV which would have been granted because the price had been reduced.  In these circumstances it can be misleading in terms of the service provided by the Department for a builder to say it took him four months to get a CRV.  That is not a just criticism in these circumstances.  Of course there are a small number of applications which for one reason or another it is not possible to process within the 21-day limit which was <Col N="1309" /> originally envisaged when CRVs were introduced but these are very much the exception and a large number of cases are decided within a week.</P>
    <P>The CRV system was designed specifically to impose as little extra paperwork as possible on builders and to permit quick decisions.  All possible assistance is given to builders in making applications and requests from the CIF for improvements to the relevant memoranda have been acceded to.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, the Committee Stage will give an opportunity to be more specific with regard to certain points made.  This is a Bill to validate the actions taken since 1970, such as changes in grants, the levels of grants and loans and many other matters that needed to be validated.  It is retrospective in the sense that it is validating everything that took place during the Fianna Fáil Government at the beginning of the decade, during the term of office of the National Coalition Government and in the past two years.  It was time to do this as well as dealing with other matters such as tightening up the situation with regard to CRVs and so on.  For the information of the Deputies, I wish to tell them that amendments are stencilled now and they will be circulated as soon as Committee Stage is ordered.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their interest and their contributions but I take exception to part of what Deputy Keating said.  Despite the fact that the matter he referred to was debated fully last night and his accusations answered, he was permitted to go back over the whole scene again today and to make the same accusations.  He even named an individual of this House and a company.  I will make no further comment other than saying that what I said on 15 May, as explained last night, was true.  It is still true and I have no intention of changing that to any kind of incorrect statement or answer just to satisfy Deputy Keating.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that but they are separate items and I am entitled to discuss both of them.  I am availing of the opportunity of speaking against item No. 11 on today's Order Paper which is only now being introduced because it serves as an opportunity to underline my party's very strong opposition to the proposition that levies should be introduced. Item No. 11 is a separate item from the Bill.</P>
      <P>I am very strongly opposed to the concept of a levy for a number of reasons.  This levy is being introduced to finance disease eradication and is one of a number of levies being introduced at present by the Government.  We had the 2 per cent levy which is being imposed across the board to finance general Government expenditure without any excuse being given, notwithstanding the fact that it is accepted by anybody with a reasonable knowledge of economics that a levy on production is the least effective and the least fair way of raising money because it is indiscriminate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This levy is paid whether or not people are making a profit.  It is paid by all <Col N="1312" /> people whether they have an income which would put them in the tax net or not.  We now have this bovine diseases levy.  We had another increase in fees charged at exactly the same point for nearly the same purpose, the increase which took place last year in the veterinary inspection fees, again introduced by this Government.  On today's Order Paper we have another fee being introduced for the first time&mdash;the dairy inspection fee.  This service was carried out in the interests of public hygiene at public cost in the past and is now to be paid for by the farmer in the form of a levy.  The important thing to remember is that this levy is unfair because it bears no relationship to ability to pay or to whether the person paying it has an income which would be taxable.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances in the case of meat this levy may be paid by the consumer. Where demand exceeds supply&mdash;we are talking about heifer meat which is used on the domestic market and is different from bullock beef which is usually exported&mdash;the butcher is forced to pay a price which is inclusive of the levy.  In other words, he pays the levy, not the farmer as was intended. This bovine disease levy, in addition to the 2 per cent levy, can in certain circumstances&mdash;and I make this statement quite categorically&mdash;of demand exceeding supply be a consumer levy.</P>
    <P>What is causing concern in respect of this levy is that it is permanent.  The 2 per cent levy will not be permanent but will be replaced by another equally unpalatable form of taxation.  There is no indication as to the length of time it will continue.  It could continue forever.  It could continue beyond the time when tuberculosis and brucellosis has been eradicated.  There is nothing in the Bill which says that this levy will cease to be paid as soon as the disease in question have been eradicated.  There is no means of cutting off the levy at that point. Furthermore, there is no proper provision made as to how the levy will be used.  It could be used for purposes other than disease eradication.  There is nothing in the Bill which would require that the levy be paid into a particular fund where it would be kept separate <Col N="1313" /> from other Government funds.  This levy could be used for different functions than disease eradication.  At some future time it could happen that only a small amount of money would be needed for disease eradication but three or four times as much money was collected by this levy and it could be applied for purposes totally unrelated to disease eradication.  There is no guarantee that this levy will be used as it should be, that is solely for the purpose of disease eradication.</P>
    <P>As far as the development of our agricultural economy is concerned, the introduction of this levy, in common with the other levies, could not have come at a worse time.  We are at a point where farmers' confidence is, in the opinion of many people outside this House, at a lower level than it has been at any time, certainly since 1974 and perhaps since long before that.</P>
    <P>In the recent price negotiations at Brussels there has been what amounts to a virtual price freeze&mdash;a 1½ per cent increase in prices at a time when costs to farmers have been increasing at not 1½ per cent but about ten times that amount.  Farmers also have to pay much higher interest rates on their borrowings as a result of changes made in the bank rate in the recent past.  People on all sides of the House have encouraged farmers to invest and borrow substantial amounts of money.  They now find their interest rates are increasing at a time when the prices they are getting for their products are being increased by only 1½ per cent for most commodities and nil for milk which is the one line of production from which our small farmers had been able to make a reasonable income in the past.</P>
    <P>At this time when, on the one hand, farmers are being squeezed by a small increase in the prices they are receiving for their goods and, on the other, by increased costs for inputs and interest charges, the Government deem it right to introduce not one levy but four different levies&mdash;a 2 per cent levy across the board, a 1 per cent levy for bovine disease eradication, increases in fees for veterinary inspections and the introduction <Col N="1314" /> of a fee for the inspection of dairy products.  I do not believe any Government which have the interests of Irish agriculture at heart would have taken these actions.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to anybody who believes these measures are fair and just that if they result, as I believe they will, in accelerating the decline in farmers' confidence, the consequences will be felt not solely by the farming community. The number of cattle being sold to our meat factories will decline if farmers cannot make a reasonable profit on sales of cattle.  Already our factories are slaughtering at about only half of their full capacity.  The factories are having to pay overheads and to maintain buildings and staff and yet they are slaughtering cattle at only half the rate that they should be if the cattle were being supplied to them.  Our meat industry is working at half-cock and that is endangering the employment of people engaged in that industry.</P>
    <P>The effects of the agricultural depression in so far as they affect employment in the meat industry are reaching right into the centre of this city.  A very substantial meat plant is located in Grand Canal Street.  That plant will be affected because this levy will reduce the profitability for farmers supplying meat for slaughter in that plant and indirectly will affect employment in that industry. Also over the past eight or ten months there has been a remarkable decline in the number of cattle being exported from this country in the form of beef carcases. If my figures are correct, in the past eight months fewer cattle have been exported dead from this country than were exported in the same months last year. This is the very time that this Government decide to accelerate that process by introducing a 2 per cent levy and now this disease levy, to make it even less profitable in the future than it was in the past for people who were already sending fewer cattle to the factories. Surely no policy could be less wise in the interest of this country than one designed to accelerate a process whereby the number of cattle being slaughtered for export is falling.</P>
    <P>Further, the levy which it is proposed <Col N="1315" /> to authorise in the Financial Resolution will be paid on an animal regardless of its value.  If you send for slaughter a pedigree animal which is of very high value&mdash;say £1,000 if such were possible&mdash;you will pay £3.  If you send an animal to the knacker and you get only £5 for it, the animal is useless but apparently you will still have to pay £3 levy on that animal.  Furthermore, this levy would have to be paid on reactors. If you have to get rid of an animal because it is a reactor for which the Government have decided you must be compensated, and the Government are paying this compensation, they will be handling the compensation to you with one hand and taking it back, in the form of the levy, with the other hand.  Could anything be more ridiculous?  The Government are giving a man compensation because he has to have his animal slaughtered and then they are taking the money back from him in the form of a levy on the slaughtered animal.</P>
    <P>This is a good example of what could be called circular payments, with administrative time being used up collecting money with one hand and giving it out with the other and leaving the farmer in exactly the same position as he was.  We have a levy on the very animal for which compensation is being paid at the same time for exactly the same transaction. This is all creating employment in the public service administrating the compensation scheme on the one hand and the levy scheme on the other.  Could anything be more ludicrous?  It surprises me that reactors have not been exempt from this levy.  In the case of the 2 per cent levy, which admittedly is only temporary but very objectionable, reactors have been exempted but they are not exempted from this one.  If there was a case for exempting them from any levy it surely should be from the levy being charged for the purpose of eradicating a disease to which they have reacted and for which reaction compensation is being paid.  Yet, under the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Bill the levy is being charged on reactors and it is not being charged under the 2 per cent levy.  This is a very anomalous situation, to say the least.</P>
    <P>I have made these points in respect of <Col N="1316" /> the levy itself.  On this resolution I do not wish to deal with the provisions of the Bill and some of the collection powers being taken.  However, I will make one concluding observation in relation to the resolution.  The purpose of this levy is not specified clearly anywhere, but it is ostensibly to pay for the cost of disease eradication.  Disease eradication is primarily a matter of public health and is of concern to the entire community because these diseases can and do spread to humans in certain circumstances. They are known as zoonoses.  I will spell it for the Minister if he wishes me to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy.  I have never heard the word before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have more to tell about that later.  These zoonoses, namely diseases common to both humans and animals, are tuberculosis and brucellosis and they can spread from one to the other.  There has been quite a high incidence of brucellosis among humans in this country and this is not only among people engaged directly in the livestock industry, and obviously veterinary surgeons, but also among people who have very tenuous connections with agriculture.  The eradication of brucellosis is a matter of concern to the entire community, not solely to farmers.  Also there is strong evidence that bovine tuberculosis also can spread and lead to tubercular conditions in humans.  This gets very little attention in the media or elsewhere.  In my contribution on the Bill itself I hope to go into greater detail about that.  Very substantial reports have been made by the Joint Services Committee on Zoonoses in relation to the prevention of the incidence of these diseases among humans.  One concerns meat and the other milk.  I regret to say that these reports were presented to the Minister for Health as far back as 1973 or 1974, and, to the best of my knowledge, no action has been taken by either the Minister for Health or the Minister for Agriculture, and that includes the previous Minister for Health and the previous Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a very serious danger of <Col N="1317" /> brucellosis and perhaps tuberculosis being contracted by humans by virtue of the fact that approximately 25 per cent of all the milk consumed in this country is consumed in an unpasteurised condition. In other words, action has not been taken to ensure that brucellosis is eliminated from that milk.  One quarter of all milk consumed is in that condition. A lot of milk is produced in parts of the country where the rate of brucellosis among herds is 25 per cent and the risk of this disease being passed from infected herds to human beings is quite serious.  When an outbreak of brucellosis occurs the Department of Agriculture are very sedulous in warning members of the farming community not to feed milk from infected animals to other animals.  They are not so sedulous in telling people not to give that milk to members of the family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the levy is to pay for disease eradication.  The concern about these diseases is not solely an agricultural one.  There is a very substantial human health dimension and I do not believe sufficient action is being taken to prevent the danger to human health.  Sufficient warnings have not been given about the use of unpasteurised milk and the consequences for public health of outbreaks of brucellosis and tuberculosis.  This is a very serious matter which transcends any considerations farmers might have in relation to the sale <Col N="1318" /> of milk.  I should like to see a much closer liaison between the agricultural authorities and the health authorities in respect of this matter.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the farming community should be saddled with the entire cost of disease eradication.  This may well be the direction in which we are moving with this levy.  There is provision in the Bill for the levy to be increased by order to an unspecified and unlimited extent and it may well be that the entire cost of disease eradication and more will be imposed on the farming community. Disease eradication concerns human health just as it concerns animal health and it is not right that one section of the community should be asked to bear sole responsibility.</P>
      <P>It is unfair that farmers who have been making every effort to eradicate disease from their herds and have been taking every possible precaution should have to pay this levy at the same level as people who have not taken any precautions and whose diseased herds may spread infection to the herds of other farmers.  There is no discrimination between the farmer who has been cooperating with the Department and the farmer who has not made any effort at all.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider other ways of paying for disease eradication. During the course of the debate on the Bill I hope the Minister will see the error of his ways, although I fear that this levy was not dreamed up in the Department of Agriculture; I believe it emanates elsewhere.  It does no credit to the Minister's negotiating abilities that he was not able to prevent the introduction of this levy, the 2 per cent levy and all the other levies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Minister must be judged by results and not by his good intentions or what he may privately say to the press.  I say this without any animosity towards the present incumbent.  As far as farmers are concerned, the results are a 2 per cent levy, a disease eradication levy, a fee for his dairy inspection, a fee for veterinary inspection and at the same time a price freeze for milk and a 1.5 per cent increase for other products, combined with a 15 per cent increase in <Col N="1319" /> farming costs.  We all accept the good intentions but these are the results which will count in the ballot box.  The results are in the form of these levies and in the form of declining farmer confidence at this time.  This is to be regretted by the Minister and by the country, although the Minister may regret it for different reasons.  The verdict on these measures will not be favourable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is entwined in several ways with the Bill we dealt with some days ago.  My party consider that a levy is the wrong way to raise money from farmers.  It is necessary to instil a feeling that bovine TB and brucellosis must be eradicated as a matter of urgency.  For various reasons the eradication scheme has not been as successful as it might have been, but a levy is not the correct means of tackling the problem.  It is unfair for several reasons and bears no relation to the ability to pay.</P>
      <P>Any form of taxation or any levy collected by a Department of State must have some reference to ability to pay.  It is a wrong approach to say that a person who sells the milk of one or two cows has to pay the same percentage of his small cheque as the man who sells the milk of 200 or 300 cows.  The same applies to cattle for slaughter.  If a person has only a few cattle for slaughter whether they go to the butcher, the meat factory, or for live export, it is unfair to say he must pay as much from his small profit as the man who has hundreds of cattle for slaughter and makes a bigger profit.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is providing that it is per head so the amount is bigger for the bigger person.  A levy is a tax in another form or in another word.  This is a tax on a very limited source of income for the smaller person who sells a small amount of milk or a small number of beasts.  A large percentage of that small income will go on this levy.  That is unfair to the small man.  Like the 2 per cent I object to the levy for that reason.  It is unfair in its application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of cattle for slaughter the levy is £3 per head.  With the 2 per cent levy which has already been introduced, <Col N="1320" /> this will have a serious effect on our meat factories and our beef producing industry.  When I spoke about the 2 per cent levy in this House I said this, and I say it now in regard to this levy of £3 per head.  Some people have been engaged in the production of fat cattle and have been feeding them during the winter months and producing cattle at a time when they were not available from any other source for the meat factories. These people are considered rich. They are known to some people as beef barons.  At certain times of the year they were the only source of supply for our factories.</P>
    <P>I discussed this problem with three factory managers in my constituency. As I say, these people are known as beef barons and they are not the kind of people with whom I have much sympathy because they are big, rich and influential. At certain times of the year they provide the wherewithal for our meat factories to keep up their employment.  It is freely admitted that the amount of profit in that business at present is low.  The crucial point is whether or not they will continue in that business, and whether the profit available to them from fattening cattle during the winter is lucrative enough to keep them in the business.  I want to impress on the House and the Minister that they can change their way of farming.  That is no bother to them, and it is no skin off their nose, but it will mean unemployment in our meat factories.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I mention it.  The 2 per cent already introduced has had some effect on employment in the meat industry in Leixlip, where there had to be a temporary close down.  Let us hope it is as temporary as we hope it is.  The profit is admittedly low at present, and if these people do not continue in the beef trade&mdash;and there are many reasons why they should not if they are thinking of their own personal gain&mdash;and I presume they think of that mostly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if they do not continue in the production of beef during the winter months when cattle are not available from grass, and when the factories have been finding they have not got a very big supply, if that source is cut off, or partially cut off, we will have lay-offs in our meat factories.  This will mean temporary lay-offs for 1,000 workers in my constituency.  That is why a levy is not a good thing for the meat industry.  We should think about it.  I am not against the Minister or disagreeing with him.  I believe that taken globally farmers should make a contribution to the cost of services, but it should be an overall tax situation.  Otherwise some people will be paying more than their share of their income in relation to other people.  I believe farmers should pay tax like everybody else.  Services should be provided out of general taxation to which the farmer has contributed his fair share.  I make no apology to anyone for saying the farmer should pay his fair share.  Because cattle disease eradication is so important and so much in the national interest, it should be paid for out of general taxation to which the farmer has contributed his fair share the same was as everybody else.</P>
      <P>When I made a suggestion four or five years ago I was not very popular with farming organisations who are now proposing the same thing themselves.  I suggested that they should pay on the accounts system like every other business.  That should be the easiest thing in the world for farmers.  They have accounts which they are doing their best to boost in regard to farm modernisation. They are endeavouring to prove that they are farming well.  It is ridiculous and foolish to say they cannot produce accounts.</P>

    <P>Having said all that, I am against the principle of a levy because I believe it will discourage the kind of people who produce the beef for our factories.  We should be trying to encourage them.  I want to say a word about butchers who buy mostly heifer meat now and who are, I understand, bringing the Minister for Finance to law to ascertain whether it is constitutional or not to impose <Col N="1322" /> the original 2 per cent levy.  Where a small farmer sells a heifer to a butcher there is no question of a levy.  He wants his price and that is it.  The butcher buys from him and if the levy is being paid it is being paid by the person who buys the meat from the butcher.  It is a consumer levy.  There is no way in which, if the levy is imposed on farmers who sell to butchers, it can be separated from the total price paid by the butcher.  If a levy is to be paid between the farmer, butcher and consumer, the consumer will pay it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the length of time the levy will last.  When we have eradicated the disease will the levy be withdrawn, or will it have been increased a number of times before that?  Will it be applied to something else?  Regardless of whether it is a steer, calf or heavy bullock the levy is £3.  I condemned the 2 per cent levy but, bad and all as it was, it had some merit in that it was only 2 per cent.  For a small bullock it was less and for a big bullock it was more.  This is £3 regardless of size.  It is £3 for a calf a butcher buys and kills and it is £3 for a bullock worth £700 or £800.  A flat rate on all beasts killed does not make sense. Has it to be paid on reactors or on beasts one gets rid of to a knackers for dog meat?</P>
    <P>I do not disagree with the Minister when he says that farmers should make some effort to pay for services they are receiving.  The eradication of disease is important to the country.  It is vital to the meat and milk industries which form the greater part of our economy.  Instead of imposing taxation on farmers by way of levy we should face them and say: &ldquo;You have accounts.  Do not try and fool anybody&rdquo;.  Any farmer worth his salt keeps accounts.  It is ridiculous to think we cannot get a proper system of taxation for them and get a proper contribution from them.  We should not be messing around with levies which are unfair and unjust on the weaker section of the farming community.  On the face of it, a flat rate of £3 per beast slaughtered is unfair.</P>
    <P>If this levy came from, as has been suggested, the Department of Finance I would ask the Minister to go back to the Government and ask them to introduce <Col N="1323" /> a fair system of taxation for farmers and not to do it by way of levies.</P>

      <P>I join with my colleagues in voicing my unqualified opposition to this levy.  As I said before, it was a pity that Fianna Fáil did not tell people in the last general election that they were going to do these things. When we were in power we were branded as socialists by those now on the Government benches.  In a canvass in rural areas it was made clear to the farming community that if Fianna Fáil were successful they would alleviate these taxes and life would be rosy.  When Deputy Clinton was Minister for Agriculture he raised farm income from £250 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose the levy because it is unfair.  It bears no relation at all to a farmer's ability to pay.  As Deputy Bermingham said, is it to be on young animals slaughtered, on heavy animals slaughtered, on very small farmers and on very big farmers?  It is so unfair that I am amazed that the Minister let it through the Cabinet.  The Minister is a farmer and understands well the small margin of profits enjoyed by the beef farmer.  In the difficult winter we had minimum profits were made and in some cases they barely broke even, as the Minister well knows.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bermingham said that people would move out of beef.  What worries me is that the people who are in beef at the moment are so heavily committed to lending institutions that they cannot readily move out of beef.  Nor can they readily move out of dairying.  How can they face these lending institutions and tell them they cannot meet their commitments now because, on top of everything else, they have to pay a levy on the sale of every animal, they have to pay a levy on the sale of every gallon of milk and further than that, there is a 2 per cent levy on the sale of all these products. This is grossly unfair and unjust.  I hope the Government will give it serious consideration for the sake of the industry. While there may not be a swing away from beef or away from dairying in the immediate future because farmers cannot afford to move out of these areas, in the long term, unless this thing is stopped now the farmer is going to move out into an operation where he will not suffer these penalties and where he will not be asked to pay a levy on an article on which there is little or no profit after he has paid back all the people that he owes all along the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Intensive beef production today is probably one of the highest capital intensive operations in the country.  The <Col N="1325" /> amount of money already spent is colossal because there was an enthusiasm generated by Deputy Clinton for dairying and beef production.  The farmers acted on the best advice available.  They took the advice and they measured their profits and some of these were encouraging and they have had a few good years. But now, out of the blue, the Government slaps on a levy.  If the Government were to go along to an industrialist in the morning and tell him that regardless of his profits he must pay a levy on every tractor going out of his factory, he would be run out, and quite rightly so. That is how unfair the levy is.  It bears no relation at all to profit.</P>
    <P>There is another serious side to it.  At the moment farmers are getting no credit at all for paying taxes but now, as the Journal pointed out recently, we have a series of taxes between levies and everything else and the farmers get no credit from the other sectors for paying this additional burden of taxes.  I would urge the Minister to bet rid of the levy, to think again about it.  It could lawfully wait, and the Minister could take the long summer to talk it over with his colleagues and not rush it through this House on the eve of breaking up.  There is no hurry about it.  The Minister should take it easy and consult some of his experts, and they will tell him that if we go along this road we will be paving the way for disruption&mdash;and I use that word deliberately&mdash;of Irish agriculture.  It will not happen quickly but it will happen surely.  If a farmer moves out of dairying&mdash;and why should he milk cows if he can afford not to?  &mdash;many jobs are at stake.  As Deputy Bermingham pointed out, the farmer has a free choice, and if he can afford not to milk cows why should he not go into easier systems of farming?  They may not be as remunerative as dairying but at least that man will not have the tough job of milking cows every morning and evening, Sunday and Monday, in order to ensure that the Government of the day can pay their bills.  That is what the levy amounts to.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that in the long term, if he continues with the 2 per cent levy and with the levy on disease <Col N="1326" /> eradication, he will discourage farmers from expanding into dairying and beef enterprises, and we know the effect that will have on the Irish economy.  It is generally accepted in Europe, and indeed among our own best advisers, that this country of ours, climatically and every other way, is ideally suited to dairying and beef production, and any action by the Minister and his Government to prevent the development of this industry is nothing short of catastrophic. We have progressed a long way but we can go a lot further; we are by no means at the peak yet.  There are a lot of fresh lands to be developed with EEC grants. The job potential of the dairying industry has not been tapped at all, and before we have started out properly somebody comes in to stop it.  We are all interested in creating jobs for our families at home.  We are all interested in seeing more and more co-operative societies, more and more meat factories, more and more processing plants.  It is wrong for the Minister and his Government to do anything to discourage that development now.  On the contrary, wherever he finds the money he should be encouraging that industry and encouraging those people to develop and expand and, as a farmer, he must know that every young farmer who is expanding nowadays is doing so with the help of the lending agencies and not out of any capital he has stacked away. Because the Minister has this knowledge I lay the blame on him fairly and squarely for allowing that abominable levy through the Cabinet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I really believe that farmers will soon be charged a levy by this Government for breathing country <Col N="1327" /> air.  Everything that is done now in agriculture must be levied.  The Government have not the courage to have a straightforward income tax system for farmers.  They have not the courage and they call it anything and everything but income tax and the people outside farming will not accept that it is income tax. It is the craziest system imaginable.  The Minister has the job of going to Brussels to negotiate prices and to oppose levies in Brussels, and he is going with his hands tied behind his back because he is levying at home in the very same way.  It is a most appalling approach.  It is getting money from farmers by devious ways which appear not to be taxing the farmers, simply and solely because the Government said that they would not tax farmers and that they would double the food subsidies and so on.</P>
      <P>The Minister is concerned, as all of us are concerned, about the reduction in cattle numbers and about the numbers of people who are becoming redundant in the meat processing business.  With the expense the farmers have to suffer at present with disease eradication and the very serious losses they are suffering, how does the Minister expect to produce £10 million on top of this as a contribution to Government funds?  In my view it is appalling.  We must bear in mind that levies are now so numerous that they are hard to count and describe.  Every day newspapers are produced we read of a new levy.  I do not know where this will stop as far as levies are concerned.</P>
      <P>We want to raise cattle numbers and increase farmer confidence in the future for cattle and milk production and for that reason I was surprised that the Minister when he returned from Brussels stated publicly that the leaders of Irish farming are in cuckoo land if they think that we are going to get something special for Ireland.  He stated that unless those leaders appreciated what the over-supply is like in Europe next year, whether we like it or not, we will have quotas imposed on us.  Perhaps that is something which the Minister would be justified in saying in confidence to farmers he was trying to get to appreciate that there was a problem but to say that publicly is admitting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It will not be long until even fresh air is levied.  I should like to know how this is intended to encourage an increase in cattle numbers or milk production.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the basis of the whole beef herd.  If we introduce levies on everything we must remember that those levies apply to the same cattle.  I expect that the estimate of £10 million will be more.  I am opposed to it because in no other country in Europe which we must compete against is such a levy paid.  I should like to know what contribution is made by farmers in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom towards disease eradication.  When I was in office I was criticised regularly because, for instance, there were national aids in Germany five times those given here, because there were national aids in Holland four times ours, in Belgium three times ours and in France double what we were providing by way of national aids.  That situation remains unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time there was a great rush by everybody, by the Commission in particular, to have the national aids assessed and equalised or abolished altogether.  They got all the information they required in a great hurry but they did not do anything with that information when they got it.  The present position is that Irish farmers are in competition with farmers in mainland Europe and in the United Kingdom where no levies are paid by farmers.  National aids in those countries are a lot higher than those given to farmers here.  How can we justify this?  How can we create the confidence that will enable us to increase cattle numbers and milk production on <Col N="1330" /> which the whole future of our livestock industry is dependent?  We are also talking about the future of the processing industry which can employ many people, particularly if we are going into cheese and other processing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is not prepared to admit that this is a discouragement in a big way I do not know what to say.  We all want to see disease eradication.  When I left office we were providing about £20 million for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis but the Minister that year gave back £7½ million of that money which was unspent.  I am aware that the Minister can refer to the strike and the damage that caused.</P>

I would not defend anybody who is trying to carry on in a hookey way in relation to disease eradication; they deserve all they get.  The Minister deserves all the co-operation he can get in his efforts to eradicate disease.  Frankly, farmers have been involved in substantial expense as a result of decisions made by the Minister. When he made a decision on the 30-day test I thought at first glance that it was a way to catch some of these smart alecs who thought they could make a quick buck by getting out one way or another. During the last five months while travelling throughout Leinster I learned that that is doing damage and costing farmers a lot of money.  That is another additional expense they must bear.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister concerned whether Irish farmers will be in a competitive position when they go to sell their produce on European markets or here at home or across the Border or in England?  Should he not compare the position of producers in those countries with our producers?  Should he not consider the distance we are from the main European markets and the additional costs that entails?  All the evidence indicates that the income derived from beef is the lowest possible from farming. It is very modest.  Why then should we hit the farmer in this additional way in a year when expenses have been so much higher than in previous years, with a long winter and a severe spring lasting up to the middle of summer, with costs rocketing?  The Minister should consider seriously where he thinks we are going. Cattle numbers will inevitably go on dropping, milk production will continue to drop steadily.  There is no point in wondering why these things are happening, why the position has been worsening all the time instead or improving or at least keeping pace with inflation.  In the price fixing meeting in Brussels we got a minus factor which will reduce income substantially.</P>
      <P>They are the circumstances in which the Minister is asking us to agree to a motion which will take more money from farming.  I could not possibly agree to it, and if I were in office I would fight every inch of the road against it because it is the craziest method of getting money.  The farmer is now levied on every damn thing he produces at a time when the cost of every service provided for agriculture is going up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister give us a comparison <Col N="1332" /> with other European countries in regard to what they are contributing in levies on the commodities we are now discussing?  How can he maintain that our farmers can remain competitive, can increase livestock numbers and employment in the processing of meat and milk?  This levy represents only further discouragement for the farming community. It is very easy to lower confidence but damn difficult to raise it, and it is pretty low now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am opposed to this levy. It is in the national interest that animal disease be eradicated so that we may get the best price possible on foreign markets for our livestock.  As Deputy Bruton has said, it is also in the interests of humans that animal disease should be eradicated because it is accepted that humans can contract animal diseases.  It is also in the national interest because livestock exports bring in the large sum necessary to pay for the things we do not produce here, such as machinery for industry and agriculture.</P>
      <P>All this makes an excellent case for saying that the cost of animal disease eradication should be borne by the general taxpayer.  There is not any justification for asking one section of the community to bear the cost of a service that benefits the entire community.  I am against the levy because it does not relate to the capacity of the farmers to pay it.  It is not based on profits&mdash;it is a flat rate on cattle slaughtered or exported, whether they are the property of a farmer with a PLV of £10 or a farmer with a PLV of £250.  It does not bear any relation to the earning capacity of a farmer, of his financial or family circumstances. I am opposed to the levy because it comes at the end of a two-year period in which farmers were asked to contribute in several ways to general taxation.  I will mention only the headings under which that was done. First of all the agricultural grant was slashed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I am dealing with these other matters to show why it is unfair to ask farmers to pay this levy in addition to the other imposts I have mentioned. We have got the 2 per cent levy which started all the trouble we have experienced over the last few months.  I do not believe that those levies are the brain-child of the Department of Agriculture.  I believe they were created by the Department of Finance who have no knowledge of how the agricultural industry works or of how rural Ireland operates.  As Deputy Clinton said, there has been a litany of levies.  There is the 2 per cent levy, this levy, the dairy inspection levy, all thrown into the House in the last days of this session with 20 other Bills.  The House would be in grave dereliction of its duty if it did not oppose this levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a constituency where there are a number of meat processing factories.  There is one in Ballyjamesduff which processes cattle and there is one in Cavan town which is mainly concerned with the processing of pigs but, on occasion, slaughters cattle.  Deputy Bermingham made a very excellent case in relation to this levy.  He said that farmers should be taxed on accounts the <Col N="1334" /> same as the shopkeeper, the businessman, or any other person, but that to impose this levy would tend to reduce the number of cattle available to those meat factories and this means there will be a reduction in the number of people employed.  He comes from a constituency where there are a number of meat processing factories and knows what the result of this imposition will be.</P>
    <P>Those levies are being introduced without any thought.  Some of the Minister's party throughout the country have been saying that the 2 per cent levy was a last-minute operation introduced by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  If there is strong opposition to this levy in the House it should strengthen the hand of the Minister for Agriculture to oppose them in the Cabinet room and anywhere else they should be opposed.  That is the stand this party take on levies.  It is not just possible to stand up and say: &ldquo;I oppose the levy&rdquo; and sit down.  That is not making an argument against the levy.  I have been able to point out the series of levies which have been imposed on farmers over the last two years.  This is certainly the last straw.  This will be opposed by this party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The people engaged in agriculture cannot welcome this levy. There are many farmers on the other side of the House and if they were allowed a free vote I doubt if they would vote in favour of this levy and the other levies which are being imposed because their farmer constituents would not want them to impose those levies on them.  I come from a county which has geared itself to increased production of milk over the last few years by bringing in a better quality cow, having better manuring of land and installing modern dairies. This necessitated a huge investment and that has to be paid for to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and to the banks.  In many cases property is mortgaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had about four levies introduced. They will affect the people engaged in dairying more than any other type of farmers.  I can see almost £1 million being extracted from the farmers of County Clare through the imposition of <Col N="1335" /> the 2 per cent levy on the processing of milk, the levy which is supposed to pay for the eradication of brucellosis and the further levies which are imposed on the sale of cattle to factories and at the point of export.  I believe that dairy farmers are carrying more of the taxation imposed by such levies than any other section of the farming community.  In a county where the size of the holding is 200 or 300 acres in an area where the herds have an average of between 50 and 70 cows the income of those farmers can carry this taxation, but in a county where the average valuation for 70 per cent of the people is £20 the taxation imposed on such farmers is out of proportion to that which they should be expected to bear.  Therefore, I am totally opposed to this method of swelling the coffers of the Exchequer.  It reminds me of the bad days of the economic war when a tariff was imposed on our stock exported to England.  This went on for years.</P>
    <P>The idea the Government have of reintroducing this type of levy is an easy method of collection but I am sure it will be resisted and resented.  There have been indications of this resentment quite recently in the European and local elections. Have any of our EEC partners introduced this levy?  Does it help the Minister when he is trying to resist the co-responsibility levy when this levy is imposed here?  I believe the introduction of this levy is weakening the Minister's position.  It is quite easy to see that there is no limit to which this levy might be extended in the future.  If this levy proves successful it could be a permanent impost in our tax system.  Does this brighten the future for farmers?  The imposition of this levy certainly does not brighten their future at the end of a very hard winter when costs have escalated. This has been ignored by the Minister for Finance who is responsible for keeping taxation at its present level.  There is a real danger that in order to avoid levies the slaughtering of animals will not be carried out but that they will be smuggled across the Border.  As a consequence there will be a reduction in employment in our meat processing factories&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If what the Minister says is true it might discourage smuggling and I would welcome that.  Generally a system of levies is a form of discouragement and one would be less than honest to one's constituents if one did not oppose this method.  It is reminiscent of landlordism: when a person made improvements to increase milk production or stock the rent was increased.  This was in the bad old days.  People with limited holdings and those who are in congested areas will carry the heaviest load.  For that reason I am totally opposed to any levies being put on people who are taxed already or who will be taxed next year on a valuation of £40.</P>

      <P>I am surprised the Minister for Agriculture agreed to the levies which will fleece and crucify the farmers.  The Government have imposed other levies on the farmers in the past few months and they propose to introduce further levies in the future. Farmers have always been prepared to pay their fair share of taxation.  They have never said otherwise.  When their income increased under our Government we imposed tax on farmers and this was opposed by the present Government.  We believed that the taxation we imposed was fair because the income of farmers <Col N="1337" /> had increased.  Each year their prices increased by 20 per cent to 25 per cent and their overheads remained static.  In those circumstances we saw nothing wrong with imposing tax because it took into consideration the ability of a farmer to pay and he was allowed expenses as were other sections.  When we taxed the farmers the present Minister and the present Government opposed it.  Prior to the general election the canvassers went round in the dead of night promising that if Fianna Fáil were elected they would remove the tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Instead of reducing the taxation we imposed the Government have imposed a new kind of taxation which is unfair, unjust and iniquitous. It is a type of taxation that will retard and stifle production.  We have 12 million fertile acres of soil, we have grass second to none and it is essential that every encouragement be given to farmers to increase production instead of the Minister introducing a Bill to stifle production.  If we have a larger national cake, if we increase our exports, we can give more employment in our meat factories instead of the situation where some of them are closed and people put out of employment.  The Minister knows that 400 workers are threatened with redundancy.  The Minister knows that if the farmer is wealthy the whole nation will be wealthy, but if the farmer is poor and struggling the whole nation will be poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor mentioned an important point, one that I heard mentioned in <Col N="1338" /> the EEC on many occasions.  It is no wonder the Minister came back with a bad agreement.  He spoke about increased milk production but we know that milk production is dropping.  So far as the co-responsibility levy is concerned, how could the Minister oppose that levy when he met the EEC Ministers?  The first thing they would say to the Minister was that his Government were imposing a levy of almost 1 p per gallon on milk. Their view would be that if our Government thought the farmers were in a position to pay that levy out of their profits, what was wrong with the EEC imposing a co-responsibility levy?  For the first time in the past 10 years a Minister for Agriculture has come back from Europe with a very bad agreement so far as the farmers are concerned.  It is certain the Minister was in no position to argue against the co-responsibility levy when his Government were imposing a levy. We know he did not get any increase for the milk farmers despite the fact that their production costs are increasing as are their rates and taxation.  In addition, there is this further levy that will harm milk production here.</P>
    <P>It is an unfair, unjust and iniquitous form of taxation.  Any taxation that does not take into account the ability and earning capacity of the farmer is unfair and unjust.  A sum of £3 per head will be taken for each beast sold or exported. This is happening after a bad winter when there was a scarcity of food stuffs. The farmers had to pay enormous prices for foodstuffs and in many instances they amounted to 50 per cent of their total profits for wintering cattle.  If the Minister consults his friends who fed cattle during the whole year he will find that they were lucky if they had a profit of £6 to £10 per head on each beast.  The taxation will impose a charge of from 33? per cent to 50 per cent on each beast sold.  A farmer with a PLV of from £12 to £14 who is getting the dole and who has four or five cattle could find himself paying taxation of £12 to £20 per head on cattle sold.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The nuclear reactor at Wylfa in Anglesea is approximately 60 miles uninterrupted sea from the city of Dublin.  Obviously the safety of this reactor is a matter of the gravest importance to this country.  There are two reactors at Wylfa, what are known as gas-cooled graphite moderated Magnox reactors using uranium metal fuel rods as the basic fuel.  One has been in operation since November 1971 and the other since January 1972.  Since the nuclear accident at Harrisburg, there is every reason to be concerned about nuclear safety in this country as in any other.  In relation to the Magnox reactor there were problems with the corrosion in the reactors themselves during the development of this type of reactor in Britain.  I understand that in Britain they have moved on to a more advanced reactor.</P>
      <P>It is a very important point and worthy of note that there does not seem to be any regular system whereby Irish personnel, either from the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy or from the Nuclear Energy Board, regularly visit this reactor which is only 60 miles from our coast.  Apparently officials from the Nuclear Energy Board visited the reactor but from inquiries I made it seems that this was on one occasion and some time ago.  There is no system for the regular inspection of this reactor by Irish personnel, even though, if there were an accident, it would be of greater danger to the people of Dublin than it would be to the people in the United Kingdom which is further away, notwithstanding the fact that we are not getting any benefit from this reactor while the people of Britain derive direct benefit from the energy produced there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are consultations with the personnel of the United Kingdom regulatory agencies.  Have our official personnel access to all the information obtained by British personnel in the course of their regulatory activities? I understand that not all the information obtained by these personnel is published in the United Kingdom.  Do we get not <Col N="1340" /> only the published material about the safety of these reactors but also the unpublished material?  Are our agencies independently able to satisfy themselves of that?  It is not enough for us to accept the activities of the British regulatory agencies on faith.</P>
    <P>Irish health could be at risk in the event of a nuclear accident and there must be Irish personnel responsible to an Irish Minister who can satisfy themselves, independently of anything done by the British personnel, of the absolute safety of this reactor.  We cannot afford to accept this matter on faith from people in Britain who obviously have an interest in minimising any concern which might be brought to notice because they have already invested a substantial amount of money in these reactors and do not wish to be proved wrong.  We do not have that commitment but we should have access to that information.</P>
    <P>There are other dangers apart from an accident at the reactor itself which usually occurs as the result of a breakdown in the cooling mechanism.  There is also a danger that some of the highly radioactive material could escape while in storage.  On 19 June 1979 in reply to my Question No. 9, at column 476, volume 315 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Spent fuel containing the highly radioactive waste products is, on removal from the reactors, stored at Wylfa for a period normally less than one year and then transferred in specially designed transport casks to the Windscale Works near Seascale in Cumbria for reprocessing.</P>
    <P>Both Wylfa and the Windscale Works are on the Irish Sea.  Therefore, any escape of radioactive material from either of these storage points could pose a danger to us.  It is worth nothing that radioactive material, similar to that being put in storage in these various places, will remain a potential hazard up to the year 2500 AD.  This material does not become safe quickly and the storage of this material will be a matter of concern to Irish authorities for the next 600 years and vigilance will have to be maintained for that period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1341" /> On 19 June the Minister admitted that small quantities of low-level gaseous and liquid radioactive effluents were discharged to the atmosphere and the Irish Sea in accordance with authorisations issued by UK authorities through their licensing and control arrangements.  In other words, he admitted that radioactive material is being discharged into the Irish Sea.  The British will obviously make the case that this radioactivity is of such a low level that it is not a danger to health.  However, in theory at least, there is no such thing as safe radioactive material because radioactivity remains in material a long time after it has been discharged, and there is the possibility it will accumulate in the sea into which it is being discharged over a period.  While no individual discharge may be dangerous, the accumulation of discharges over a period could create a dangerous situation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is evidence that even low levels of radiation can injure health.  Studies carried out on people, such as radiologists, who come into regular contact with radiation, show that they suffer some consequences. Therefore, even low level radioactive material being discharged into the Irish Sea could pose a danger to our health.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to a report which appears in today's <i>Irish Times</i>, page 13, which reads:</P>
    <P>The discharge of atomic waste from the Windscale nuclear plant into the Irish Sea is increasing the risk of cancer among people who consume fish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister himself was the first to mention this discharge in the course of the reply which he gave me in relation to my question about Wylfa.  He was the first man to bring this matter to the floor of the House and make it relevant in this context.  I am merely following the Minister.  The quotation continues:</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;caught in the area, a report has warned.</P>
      <P>The danger comes from Caesium&mdash;137, which builds up in plaice, brill, and other bottomdwelling fish living near the end of the discharge pipeline.</P>
      <P>I will quote from a book entitled <i>The Energy Question</i> by Gerald Foley, page 181, published by Penguin:</P>
      <P>Bass, for instance, produce a concentration of caesium in their flesh which is 1,000 times that in the surrounding water;...</P>
      <P>In other words, the radioactivity which is discharged into the water in general trends to become concentrated in the fish and there may be a higher level occurring, as a result of this concentrating effect of radioactivity, in the fish than there is in the water around.  As Irish boats are fishing in the Irish Sea, that could create concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am bringing these matters to the Minister's attention, not because I am in a position to judge technically whether the danger is as great as some people might believe.  I do not know whether it is as great a danger as some people fear. I am not qualified personally to make a judgment in the matter, but I am qualified to make a judgment about the fact that there does not seem to be any system whereby Irish personnel physically visit regularly and inspect the places where this reactor activity is taking place, the places where the radioactive material is being stored and places where this material is being discharged into the Irish Sea or into the atmosphere, which material, in the case of the prevailing wind being from east to west, will blow over Irish soil.  Our Government, our Minister and our Nuclear Energy Board must be involved directly in the safety precautions being taken.  The Minister, instead of being unable to <Col N="1343" /> answer the question which I put to him when this matter last came up in the House as to when a visit took place by Irish personnel to Wylfa, should be able to say that there is a system whereby Irish personnel visit this plant regularly and to the best of his knowledge a visit took place last month or two or three months ago, and another visit will take place in a month or two.</P>
    <P>That would be appropriate to a sovereign State.  We are a sovereign State and our citizens in this sovereign State are affected by what is happening. We in this country, with officials responsible to our Minister, must inspect any source of danger to the health of our community.  That is not taking place in relation to a nuclear reactor which is only 60 miles from our coast, at least as near to Dublin as the reactor which it is proposed would be erected on our own soil at Carnsore and which is the subject of an extensive public inquiry at the moment. There has been no similar inquiry in relation to safety and the possible effect on health of this reactor.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter so that the Minister will be able to initiate the proper precautions. It is not going to be possible for us to get the British to cease to operate this reactor.  It is in being and they are going to continue its operation.  The best that we can do is to make sure that the precautions are taken to ensure that no danger to the health of Irish citizens is incurred as a result.  To do that we must inspect the thing regularly, something which is not being done at the moment. All we are doing is saying to the British that if it is all right for them, it is all right for us and we will accept what they say. We are saying, &ldquo;if you think it is okay, mate, you know best, even though you are getting the benefit and we are not getting any benefit, even though the reactor is only 60 miles from our coast and about 200 miles from London.&rdquo; That is not the proper attitude for a sovereign State and I hope it is not the attitude which the Minister on reflection will adopt when he is replying.</P>

      <P>This is the second time in the last week or so that I have been in here on matters on the Adjournment.  I was here last Thursday on one of these matters and I am here again tonight.  It would appear to be a matter of scares, scandals and innuendos on the part of the party on the far side.  It is nice to know that the Deputy has discovered that there is a nuclear plant at Wylfa eight years after it came into operation. He says he is not qualified personally to make any comment on it.  Having listened to his contribution I can confirm that he is not qualified personally to make any comment whatsoever as to the effectiveness of it.  Through his innuendo he talks about 60 miles to Dublin and 200 miles to London.  He forgets that there are many major cities a lot nearer than London to the Wylfa plant itself.  It seems to be a habit and a developing bad trend on the part of the Deputy's party to disturb and try to distort fact by innuendo and by scares and suggestions.</P>
      <P>As has been explained already in the reply given by the Minister on 19 June, all nuclear activities in the UK are subject to very strict statutory controls. This is on behalf of the citizens of the UK but it is also very beneficial to the people of Ireland, and I am sure the Deputy will be delighted to hear that the strict controls are there.  I am well aware that the Wylfa nuclear power station in the UK is the nearest to this country and is only 60 miles away from Dublin.  I remember mentioning it on the Late Late Show some time in the middle of January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern and that his heart bleeds to ensure that there is a continuing monitoring safety system at this station.  The Nuclear Energy Board, who are the advisers to the Minister for Industry, Commerce and <Col N="1345" /> Energy on nuclear energy, have advised that they are satisfied that the authorities in the UK are taking all steps necessary to ensure safety in the operation of nuclear power stations in accordance with internationally established regulations. The UK authorities have undertaken to notify the authorities here immediately in the event of any incident likely to give rise to concern at any nuclear power station in the UK.  It goes without saying that the UK authorities have much more reason for concern than we have in regard to safety in the nuclear power stations operating in their country.  This would make sense even to Members opposite.</P>
    <P>I should point out again that the closest liaison and co-operation is maintained by the Nuclear Energy Board with the relevant UK authorities and that the close contact which exists between the two bodies ensures that the Nuclear Energy Board are kept fully and promptly informed of any nuclear incidents at the Wylfa station or at any other nuclear power station in the UK.</P>
    <P>Officials of the Nuclear Energy Board have visited the Wylfa station and are fully conversant with its operation and safety procedures.  I have no doubt that the Nuclear Energy Board are satisfied as to the number of visits made by their officials to nuclear power stations in the UK.  Nonetheless, I will have brought to the board the views expressed about the need for regular visits by the board's officials to Wylfa and other power stations in the UK.</P>
    <P>As regards waste disposal the position is that small quantities of low-level gaseous and liquid radioactive effluents are discharged from the Wylfa station into <Col N="1346" /> the atmosphere and the Irish Sea.  The Nuclear Energy Board have indicated that the quantities discharged are, however, very low and not of any significance.  Control is exercised over the discharge of effluents in accordance with authorisations which are issued by the UK authorities through their licensing and control arrangements which fully conform to international standards. Low-level solid radioactive wastes produced at Wylfa are normally stored at the station and storage does not give rise to any problem.</P>
    <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have advised that the risk at any UK nuclear power station of an incident constituting any significant health hazard in this country is extremely low.  The board constantly monitor radio-active waste levels in the Irish Sea and they are satisfied that the levels are well below the limits prescribed by international requirements, despite the bass and other fish mentioned by Deputy Bruton.</P>
