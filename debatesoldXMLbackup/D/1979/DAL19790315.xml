      <P>On the Order of Business, in reply to Questions Nos. 23 and 24 on the Order Paper of yesterday the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment stated that the Minister for Education will be introducing a Constitutional Amendment Bill dealing with the question of university representation in the Seanad and that possibly this will be taken in a referendum on 5 July next.

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I gave you and the Taoiseach notice in writing yesterday that I intended to seek Government time for a debate on the industrial conflict, especially in the public sector.  I wonder if the Taoiseach has had time to consider that request and if he will now agree to give time for such a debate.</P>

      <P>As the House is aware, the members of the Government will be meeting the Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions this afternoon to discuss the matter that the Deputy wants to raise by way of debate in the House as well as other matters. We will be making arrangements to meet employers, or representatives of employer organisations next week. These meetings are likely to be continued for some time, so I do not propose to accede to the request.</P>

      <P>I should like to urge on the Taoiseach further consideration of the point raised by Deputy Mitchell, because his reply and his mention of discussions with employer organisations does not seem relevant to the issue of conflict in the public sector where the Government are the employers, and that is where the disorder is.

I would urge further consideration of the debate for that reason.</P>

    <Title>European Council Meeting: Statement by Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I wish to make a statement on the European Council which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I attended in Paris on 12 and 13 March 1979.</P>
      <P>The meeting was concerned with:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the economic and social situation in the Community and relations with Japan;</P>
      <P>&mdash;employment and social policy;</P>
      <P>&mdash;energy;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Euro-Arab-African relations;</P>
      <P>&mdash;Convergence of the economies of the Nine; and the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>I have arranged to lay the Presidency conclusions before the House, for the information of Deputies, in accordance with normal practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agenda items on the economic and social situation, and employment and social policy were taken together. With 6 million people out of work in the Community, unemployment is obviously one of the most serious and difficult problems facing Europe.  In 1978, unemployment increased in Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  In the United Kingdom the level remained more or less the same.  It decreased only in Germany, Ireland and Italy; and on our estimates of economic growth for this year, it is likely to decrease further here, if we observe the proper disciplines.  There is little likelihood of a reduction in the numbers out of work in the Community as a whole if the Commission estimate for economic growth in 1979 is realised: <Col N="1577" /> and oil shortages could aggravate the problems.</P>
    <P>I emphasised the need to get economic growth in the Community moving again, as an essential prerequisite to the elimination of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There was considerable emphasis on the need to reduce inflation, which the Council stressed must be the first objective of economic policy.  The Council noted that growth is currently strongest in those countries with the lowest rates of inflation.</P>
    <P>Apart from general measures to sustain or stimulate growth, without increasing inflation, the Council stressed the need to improve relations with the social partners.  A full understanding of the problems and opportunities is essential to economic progress.  The Council also asked the Council of Ministers to study a number of specific measures, including:</P>
    <P>training better adapted to employment, particularly for young people;</P>
    <P>limiting the systematic use of overtime; and improving employment conditions for women.</P>
    <P>I emphasised the need for measures to develop youth employment.  As is well known, the rate of increase in Ireland in the labour force due to the inflow of young people is at a much higher rate than obtains in the Community generally. The rate of inflow of young people to the labour force here is three times the Community average.  The Council accepted my proposal and confirmed the importance it attached to youth employment.</P>
    <P>We can sustain economic growth and reduce unemployment only if energy policy is right.  Our dependency on external sources&mdash;more than 80 per cent&mdash; for coal, oil and other materials makes us dangerously vulnerable to any interruption of supplies.  And it is essential for our own security that we, like the rest of the Community, reduce this dependency. The Council discussed the difficulties created by the Iranian situation in relation both to supplies and to economic growth generally.  A number of specific measures were adopted&mdash;including <Col N="1578" /> emphasis on conservation, New sources of energy, including in particular nuclear energy, and measures to ensure directly a reduction in the consumption of oil by the Community.</P>
    <P>I indicated the need for Community assistance for exploration, in particular for hydrocarbons in areas off the west coast of Ireland which have promise but which, because of deep waters, are expensive and difficult to explore.  Even a small find by world standards would enable us to meet our own needs and leave a surplus for Community use.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of discussion on the use of Community finances to advance convergence of the different economies, with particular emphasis on the Common Agricultural Policy.  I said that only a small part of the Community resources, in total, are spent on agriculture.  It is, in fact, of the order of 0.5 per cent, or half of 1 per cent of the combined GNP of the member countries or less than 3 per cent of total Community spending on food.  And what is perhaps even more relevant, the Community spending is only half what national governments themselves spend on agriculture.  I urged the need for an improvement in structures policy, particularly for the less favoured areas of the Community: and this point was accepted by the Council.  On prices, there was considerable pressure for a complete standstill this year.  I said that a complete standstill was a blunt instrument which should not be used. Farmers' costs, like those of everybody else, are rising and the Community must have regard to them&mdash;as well as to the need to moderate inflation.  At the same time, the problem of surpluses is real and must be tackled.  I supported the Commission's general approach in this area.</P>
    <P>The Council recognised the importance of adhering to the principles of the CAP and decided that there would be continuing review of these principles with special regard to security of supply, a reasonable standard of income for farmers and to distortions in the market.</P>
    <P>On the European Monetary System, technical difficulties were raised in Community institutions as to the method of transfer of resources to Ireland.  The House will recall that the Brussels Council <Col N="1579" /> last December decided on a resolution providing for loans of up to 1,000 million EUA per year to less prosperous member countries on special conditions. These loans were to be concentrated on infrastructural projects and programmes. The resolution provided for interest rate subsidies of 3 per cent for the loans, to be capitalised in annual tranches of 200 million EUAs over a period of five years.  These decisions were supplemented by a further decision that if Ireland and Italy both decided to join the system, the interest subsidies would be allocated as to one-third to Ireland and two-thirds to Italy.</P>
    <P>Following discussion at the Council, the difficulties to which I have referred were resolved.  What is involved is the transfer to Ireland of the capitalised value of the subsidies on loans to be advanced to us from the European Investment Bank.</P>
    <P>There are still uncertainties in the way of the subsidy payments.  These uncertainties are not due to any act or omission on our part.  They concern differences between Community institutions. They are:</P>
    <P>(1) the difference between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament as to the budget for 1979.  Until these difficulties are resolved, it will not be possible to enter the amount of the subsidies in the Community Budget; and</P>
    <P>(2) differences between Parliament and the Commission on the formalities for the making of the subsidy regulations, and as to the nature of the subsidies in Community terms, that is, whether they are obligatory or nonobligatory expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that these questions will not be resolved, in time, but it is well that the House should be aware of them.  When the questions are resolved the subsidies will, on present Commission proposals, be paid on loans made available from 1 January 1979. While the difficulties to which I have referred may delay payments, they are not insurmountable.  The subsidies can be paid in 1979 and subsequent years <Col N="1580" /> according as we raise the necessary loans.</P>
    <P>We also had a general exchange of views on some world current political problems, including the situation in the Middle East, the Euratom Treaty, nuclear proliferation, and Turkey.</P>
    <P>There is considerable concern among the Nine about the growing tendency towards the use of force and the lack of respect for the principle of territorial integrity&mdash;as set out in the UN Charter and the Helsinki Final Act.  This is evident in various world trouble spots&mdash;in Asia, in Central Africa, as between the two Yemens and so on.  President Giscard expressed the general concern of the Nine on this question at the Press Conference when he presented the Presidency conclusions.  We also discussed East-West relations and proposals by the President for a Euro-Arab-African Conference.</P>
    <P>Foreign Ministers met separately on Monday night and discussed a number of current issues.  I understand that in their discussions they covered the situation in Southern Africa (including the prospects for a settlement in Rhodesia and in Namibia).  They also exchanged views on the situation in South East Asia.  However, they decided not to issue a formal statement on any of these questions.</P>
    <P>When the idea of the European Council was first developed in Paris in 1974, the French emphasised that their purpose was to bring together the Heads of Government of the Nine for informal contacts.  Councils are important for this purpose and can do much valuable work.  At the Paris Council the utmost goodwill was shown by all Community countries towards Ireland.  There was complete understanding of our unique problems and of the measures we are taking to tackle them.  I would like to record here my appreciation of that support. We are members of the European Community and believe in co-operating fully in working to advance its objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points in the Taoiseach's statement and several which are not, on which I would like to comment or raise questions. <Col N="1581" /> I will follow the sequence of his remarks in dealing with them.</P>
      <P>At the outset I note from the statement that the Council have noted that growth is currently strongest in those countries with the lowest rates of inflation. I am glad that the Council, which includes the Taoiseach, have noted this fact.  But it is very disturbing from our point of view as a country in which inflation has now risen from 6.1 per cent at the end of last May to what in any event will be double figures when the February figures are published in a couple of days time; exactly how high into double figures remains to be seen.  To that the Government themselves contributed notably by the removal of the food subsidies and by their taxation measures. What may amount to virtually a doubling of our rate of inflation in a period of nine months is certainly disturbing and is not going to assist growth as the Taoiseach's own statement makes clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to his statement about the Council studying a number of specific measures including training better adapted to employment, particularly for young people, I hope that in addition to the Council studying these measures the Government will also do this.  It is really a matter that should concern us all deeply that after so many years during which successive Governments have succeeded in expanding our training facilities and have tried to adapt them better to employment that there is still a severe shortage of necessary skills inhibiting the growth of industry.  This is one of the major complaints of industry here and yet we have this massive unemployment. There is a failure here to which we should direct ourselves and it will not be solved for us by the Council of Ministers in the Community although any measures they may take could be helpful. We have a domestic problem here that we have not tackled effectively and I would direct the Taoiseach's attention to that because it is an absurd anomaly, an unacceptable anomaly, that there should be this shortage of trained people inhibiting the growth of industry when in fact we have this massive unemployment. In relation to the systematic use of overtime the Taoiseach seems to have been less forthcoming to the House than <Col N="1582" /> I understand he was to the press because nothing is said here about any action we are to take on the matter, whereas I had understood it from press reports that it was the Taoiseach's intention to proceed to some legislation in the matter.  I had expected at least that the question of initial legislation would be mentioned and perhaps clarified here and I hoped that some indication would be given to the way this matter is being approached.  I personally would support, in principle, legislation of this kind.  I believe that at present the abuse of overtime is a factor leading to high unemployment.  I feel the Taoiseach should have clarified to the House what he has in mind in this respect.  Not even to have referred to his promise of legislation was less than fair to the House.</P>
    <P>On energy conservation I note that a number of specific measures were adopted including measures to ensure directly a reduction in the consumption of oil by the Community.  Those words imply to me a reduction on actual consumption, not just on projected consumption. Given the growth of demand all the time and given the fact that our economy is still growing, even if more slowly than it was a year ago, the demand for oil here would be higher this year than last year in the ordinary way. If it is agreed to reduce consumption in terms of what was actually consumed last year the cut, <i>vis-à-vis</i> our actual need this year, could be quite severe.  I would ask the Taoiseach when he proposes to indicate the scale of cuts that would be required <i>vis-à-vis</i> our needs in relation to the rate of growth in the economy projected for this year, how these cuts are to be achieved and in what way the impact of this on our economy and on individuals in our country is to be minimised.  We need, urgently, information on this subject.  I hope the Taoiseach will let us know as soon as possible what is proposed.</P>
    <P>In regard to the agricultural policy I note that the Taoiseach said he supported the Commission's general approach in this area.  I am a little worried about this because I note from press reports that the President of the Commission appreared to give some support to something that seemed close to the <Col N="1583" /> British position on this issue and that the President of the Council, President Giscard d'Estaing, dissociated himself from the Commission's remarks.  If the Council as a whole and its President took a different view, not merely from the British Prime Minister but from the President of the Commission, in regard to agricultural policy it would seem odd to me that the Taoiseach should support the Commission's general approach. Perhaps the Taoiseach in the words he has used here is speaking very genrally. I hope he will clarify what he has in mind and indicate in due course whether he supports the position of the French President in rejecting part at least of the Commission's approach in this area. Solidarity between ourselves and France, among other countries, on this issue where there is a threat to the CAP is important and I would have thought that the Taoiseach and his party would have wished to maintain that solidarity. What is said here sounds like a dissociation from the words of the President of the Council at the end of the meeting when he expressed his disagreement with the President of the Commission on an issue of vital importance to this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach then spoke of the uncertainties that stand in the way of subsidy payments and he gave reasons why there may be delay in making the payments, reasons related to the European Parliament.  I do not understand why these difficulties were not foreseen.  The Taoiseach told the House on 15 December:</P>
    <P>I have also been assured that there would be sufficient flexibility as to the manner in which the interest subsidies operate to enable us to benefit fully from these arrangements early in the New Year.</P>
    <P>Of course one understands that with the delay of two and a half months in the entry into force of the EMS there must be a lag of two and a half months in relation to the subsidies and the benefits but it is disturbing that apparently the Taoiseach accepted assurances of immediacy in this matter that were ill-founded for reasons that should have been foreseeable at the time.  The <Col N="1584" /> problems that arose in the European Parliament were not brought to the attention of the House at that time and I think the House was misled as to the likelihood of these payments being made at an early date.  The impression the people received at that time from what was said was that the payments would not only be early in the New Year but that they would occur independently of and in advance of the actual borrowings to which they would relate.  I recall my own puzzlement as to how such an arrangement could be arrived at in relation to what were described as interest subsidies. All that optimism seems to have evaporated very rapidly and I do not think that the differences with Parliament account fully for that.</P>
    <P>I note also that the Taoiseach's statement makes no reference whatever to the moneys to be raised to lend to us and to provide interest subsidies to us through the consortium of certain member states. I understood this subject was to be discussed informally with the other countries concerned but there was total silence in the Taoiseach's speech which seems to relate only to the arrangements directly with the Community in respect of the loan of £225 million a year and the subsidies of £45 million per year.</P>
    <P>What is the position with regard to the consortium?  We have been put off when we queried this.  We were told in December that it was only a question of working out some details.  There has been ample time to work out the details. The delay regarding the EMS has ensured that.  Have the details been worked out and what are the arrangements? How are the payments to be made?  Are they to be made to us at the outset of each year?  Are they independent of the amount borrowed?  As appears now to be the case contrary to earlier expectations, do these subsidy payments also become payable only according as we raise the necessary loans, to use the Taoiseach's words?</P>
    <P>Much of the euphoria of December seems to have evaporated.  It would appear now we are back from the arrangements we were told about then to a situation where we must first borrow the money, where we may not be able to borrow the full amount in the necessary <Col N="1585" /> period and where we may not get the full benefit, although we seemed to be assured otherwise at the time.  The Taoiseach's silence on the consortium loan and the inadequacy of his statements on the EEC loan and subsidy situation is disturbing and I ask him to arrange that the Minister for Finance clarifies these matters to the House as soon as possible.  We are entitled to know what arrangements have been made, whether they have been finalised with the consortium, what they are, and how and when the moneys will come to be paid.</P>
    <P>These seem to be the main issues that arise although there is one other point I wish to make.  We have now entered the EMS.  We welcome that decision.  We supported it at the time although we were unhappy with the negotiations that led up to that decision.  Among other things we queried the wisdom of adhering to the 2¼ per cent band when we had the opportunity of a wider band.  The doubts we had at the time remain and while the economic situation has changed radically because of the Iranian situation and while we now face the position where sterling is strong rather than weak, this unexpected turnabout&mdash; although turnabouts occur all the time&mdash;does not alter the validity of our concern in the matter.  We still remain of the view that by tying ourselves to the 2¼ per cent band in relation to all other currencies simultaneously through the parity grid, we could find ourselves pushed off parity with sterling for technical reasons by a marginal amount causing great confusion and disturbance in our trading, commercial, tourist and other relations with Great Britain and Northern Ireland without any economic effects, good or bad, accruing because of the small extent of the slippage.</P>
    <P>Already movements have taken place in the past few months in certain currencies which, it has been stated in the financial press, would have pushed us off parity with sterling within that period had we entered the EMS at the beginning because of the narrowness of the band allowed.  One international correspondent asserted&mdash;I have not had an opportunity to check the figures&mdash;that movements in the Belgian franc in the <Col N="1586" /> first two and a half months would have forced us off sterling by a small margin simply because of the narrowness of the band.</P>
    <P>I regret the Taoiseach did not take the opportunity of the delay in the entry into force of the EMS to have second thoughts about this.  Many people would have welcomed reconsideration of the band.  If something happens in the next few months, as happened in relation to the Belgian franc, and we find ourselves diverge by ½ per cent or ¾ per cent in relation to sterling with all the inconvenience that would involve and with no economic benefit, the Government will merit considerable criticism for having dug in their heels on this issue and for not taking the opportunity of a wider band.  I do not know if the Government were forced to choose between 2¼ per cent and 6 per cent or whether they were allowed a band up to 6 per cent, but one way or another the 2¼ per cent band is the less good of the two and if there was the possibility of an intermediate band&mdash;perhaps of the order of 4½ per cent&mdash;that might have been more appropriate. We may find that the stubbornness of the Government may give rise to quite unnecessary difficulties in the period ahead.</P>
    <P>In the concluding section of his remarks the Taoiseach referred to various matters in the international arena that were discussed by the Foreign Ministers meeting separately.  I note they included discussions in relation to Rhodesia and Namibia.  I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to take very careful consideration of our position in relation to Namibia in particular.  Two years ago before the Government changed I had some responsibility in this matter and I thought then that the Five-Power initiative in relation to Namibia was constructive and that the Community should support it.  However, it seems to have evolved in a manner which is not consonant with the basic principles of the United Nations and which may be endangering a settlement in Namibia.  I urge the Minister to put the basic principle first rather than solidarity with the EEC&mdash;if the Five Powers, including some of the leading EEC states, seem to <Col N="1587" /> be pursuing protection of their own interests in southern Africa rather than the achievement of independence for Namibia, something that I do not think was the case two years ago but which has seemed to emerge since then.</P>

      <P>I find myself questioning the whole exercise of these Summit meetings.  Too much vital decision making is being pushed up to the level of Heads of Government with a subsequent disregard for the due process of detailed consideration.  The danger of illusory short-term solutions to complex problems being cobbled together for public relations purposes is definitely growing.  If one looks at Paris this week it provided a good example of the use of the Summit for domestic political purposes with the opportunistic British attack on the Common Agricultural Policy.  This attitude by the British is becoming a tiresome and repetitive matter which will doubtlessly go on whatever the political persuasion of any British Government.  Their particular version of a cheap food policy is, I fear, one of the hangovers of Britain's colonial past and it will be a particularly difficult one to change.</P>
      <P>I am of the firm opinion that the necessary process of improving and strengthening the CAP in line with the dictates of the Treaty and with the real needs of all sectors, particularly the small farmers and consumers, is being damaged by this outdated British approach. Equally, the ritual use of European Council meetings for these outbursts is calling their usefulness more and more into question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But, as the British Government are seeking to undermine the CAP, I think our own Government should be aware that their domestic policies are themselves gradually undermining the willingness of a growing section of the Irish electorate to support the CAP.  The continuing failure to redistribute some of the benefits of high EEC prices more widely throughout the community is damaging public support for that policy. When one adds to that the Government's reduction of food subsidies, with <Col N="1588" /> two more phases to come, urban support for the CAP is being put very seriously at risk.  The failure of the Government to protect the consumer against high food prices is undermining that national policy of supporting the CAP, a national policy to which this party subscribe. Because of the tendency on the part of some Heads of Government to see Summit meetings excessively in terms of domestic public relations I believe there should be recourse to such meetings within the Community much less frequently and also much less formally.</P>

      <P>Summit meetings such as that held in Paris in 1972 can, under the inspiration of a leader like Willy Brandt, give a special impetus to the Community but some of the more recent, more confused and leaderless Summits have done precisely the opposite. Making a routine of what should be a focus for hope and progress is a sure way to devalue anything that can emerge from it.  The hollow talk this week about the need for concerted economic action is a good example. Some more resources for the Regional or Social Funds decided at a Finance Council would have been much more beneficial, have made much more sense and contributed more to the future of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the EMS question I should like to make these points.  First, the events of the past week have confirmed everything I have said here about the incredible incompetence of the Government's handling of the whole EMS affair.  Given that the French objection, inspired largely by the Gaullist camp of the present majority in France, held up the starting date, we might have expected a smooth exercise in Paris.  Instead, we have had another instalment of the confusion and indecision which has marked every stage of the negotiations since Spring.  At this point I should say that I have absolutely no confidence that the Government know what they are doing.  I agree entirely with the opinion of one leading business man who said on an RTE programme the other night that the EMS issue was being played as a short-term <Col N="1589" /> political game by the Government with no real regard for the vital long-term economic consequences.  The Government's incompetence in this whole affair has been simply staggering.  From last Summer up to Christmas the Taoiseach and the Government have stumbled from one miscalculation to the next.  The amount of resources transfer considered essential to protect our basic national interest was reduced by no less than two-thirds, from £650 million in transfer by way of grant to £225 million by loan, and all this has been done with utter shamelessness.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Economic Planning and Development have apparently declared open season on all facts and figures.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about what the Taoiseach has done here this morning in regard to the EMS.  He has, in fact, stood up before the Irish people and admitted total failure by his own criteria in the negotiations for our entry into the EMS.  These negotiations reached a point where we were told that we would get loans of £225 million each year over a number of years and that we would get them at 9 per cent.  In regard to the £45 million, we are now being told that it is uncertain whether it is coming to the Exchequer, being paid into the European Investment Bank or what is happening to it.  But even to take it at best, as the Taoiseach tried to present it to the media after the Summit meeting in Paris, these are precisely the terms that the Taoiseach would not recommend to his Cabinet, to the Irish people or to this Parliament for our entry into the EMS.</P>
    <P>After the Taoiseach had made the decision not to recommend to the Government and the Government had decided not to recommend to Dáil Eireann and the Irish people that we should join on the basis of what was announced here this morning as the conditions for joining, a frantic effort was made to go around various member states who were and are well disposed to this country.  In fact what we did, as I said here before, is that we went with our cap in hand asking and pleading with them to throw in a few pounds each in order to justify the Government recommending our entry under the terms that <Col N="1590" /> were negotiated by them.  There is no mention this morning of that unilateral gift or loan.  We do not know what it is or where it is coming from.  We are not sure of the details, not sure how it will be paid.  We are not sure what conditions govern our getting that money, but it is the factor that tipped the balance between the Taoiseach recommending acceptance and not recommending acceptance by the Dáil and the Irish people of entry to the EMS.</P>
    <P>Is it not an incredible situation that we are making this major decision and that we do not know under what conditions we are entering?  It is so staggering that one wonders can it be really true, but we have as little information now as we had right through the negotiations for entry. I appeal to the Taoiseach&mdash;I am not just making a political point&mdash;for the sake of Ireland at least let us know under what conditions we are entering the EMS, because the decision that has been taken by the Government can have very serious repercussions on our economy and on our people.  The Irish people, Irish industry and our trade union movement are at least entitled to know the conditions under which we have joined the EMS.</P>
    <P>We are in the EMS now, whether for ill or for good, but we know that the Government have failed totally to obtain what is necessary in money terms to deal with the inevitable consequences of membership for the Irish economy and for Irish jobs.  Neither will the Government deliver the necessary package of policies which were spelled out so clearly by us earlier in the debate on this question. There is a real threat of monetary instability.  The inaction and indecision on the part of the Government have led directly to an unprecedented run on the stock exchange.  These factors add up to an indictment of the Government but, more seriously, to a threat to our economic prospects.  As we enter a new, extremely damaging and demanding system there is little hope and little reason for confidence.  Rather, there is every reason for grave concern about the future of this country.</P>
    <P>We are told that membership of the EMS would provide us with a wonderful opportunity, that we could break the link <Col N="1591" /> with sterling and link ourselves with the strong economies and currencies of Europe but we were told also that certain conditions must prevail at home if we are to take advantage of this opportunity. Can anyone suggest seriously that there is any prospect of our being able to meet those conditions?  Inflation is once again into double figures.  There is deep-rooted discontent concerning the social injustice that has been perpetrated continuously on our people as a result of the policies of Fianna Fáil, especially since their return to office in 1977.  We have a situation that spells potential grave danger for our whole society.  The quest for social justice by some sections who have been long suffering is being interpreted unfortunately as a division between urban and rural Ireland.  Should there be a persistence of that attitude our nation will be split.  Therefore, there is a grave responsibility on the Government to take immediate action to prevent a widening of that division.</P>
    <P>Another development that has been referred to briefly in another context by the Taoiseach is the question of developments in Iran.  The one member of the EEC that has not joined the EMS is also the one member that is able to supply her own domestic needs of oil.  What is to be the position when the multinational oil companies move in to ensure that they get their profit?  What will be the effects of that situation on our economy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. Unfortunately, though, the incompetence of the negotiations on the part of the Government are likely to have wide-ranging and detrimental effects for this country.  If we are to survive <Col N="1592" /> and advance within the EMS there must be a planned approach to all aspects of economic and social development. By that I mean exactly what I spelled out here before Christmas.  We must have firm control of investment decisions and a comprehensive programme of public sector development in key economic areas.  There must be a profound and radical change towards real economic democracy and a full sharing by workers in the major decisions at national, industrial and firm level.  The massive slide towards foreign control of every sector of Irish economic and commercial life must be halted. Banking and credit must be brought increasingly under direct State control.  All the talk of discipline and responsibility and all the drumming up of Fianna Fáil-style nationalism will cut very little ice within the Europe of the EMS.  There must be a real and genuine effort and an appreciation of the hard facts.  We do not need a re-hash of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously someone who was a lot better at his job than the person who wrote the speech for the Taoiseach.  This whole affair has demonstrated the inherent weaknesses within the EEC.  The Community have neither the decision-making system nor the economic and social structures that are necessary to deal effectively with an issue which cuts across the existing relationship within the Community.  This reinforces some of the worst features of the free market system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EMS spells potential disaster for a weak and peripheral economy such as ours.  It threatens jobs and industries and threatens also the whole process of the economic development and of the living standards of our people.  Equally, it can lead to a totally unacceptable degree of external control of Irish economic policy in a situation in which the Community have no effective regional or social policies to offset the inevitable effects of the capitalist system.  It is the view of this party that this whole development must be watched closely in the coming <Col N="1593" /> months.  We cannot accept that the decision to enter the EMS should lead to a diminution of the authority of the elected Irish Government in their fiscal, economic and social policies.  If the results are to be negative and if there is to be interference in our affairs to an intolerable degree there will have to be unilateral action of a protective nature.  The whole history of the Community to date is that of a failure to achieve a proper balance between various key aspects of policy.  In the socialist view there must be a balance between monetary integration of any kind and countervailing policies in the investment, regional and social areas.  Failure to achieve such a balance can do nothing but damage to our national interest.  We must preserve at all the times the right to ensure that the Irish people are not hurt by the unbridled exercise of the economic muscle of non-national interests.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the question of energy.  Before going into detail on matters of supplies, alternatives and strategies for energy saving there is one fact that we must note.  Recent weeks have seen the re-emergence of the unholy alliance of the private multinationals in the petroleum world.  Outrageous and unjustified price rises are being extorted and more of the same is undoubtedly on the way with Governments apparently helpless before their activities.</P>
    <P>The European Council would have been well occupied if they had got down to the business of putting an end to the private enterprise stranglehold of the oil companies.  This is a matter for State enterprise and for Government and inter-government action and not a matter for private profit.  We believe it is essential that there should be a common Community approach.  In 1973-74 lack of co-operation at EEC level almost wrecked the Community following the OPEC venture.  The lesson should be learned and learned well that a common approach necessitates not alone a strong and planned view of the supply demand and price relationship, but equally a just and balanced internal approach.  No member state should or must be left to its own devices as was the case with Denmark on the last occasion.</P>

      <P>I hope so too.  Talk of new prices must not lead again to panic decisions in this dangerous and controversal area.  The public inquiry on nuclear energy must go ahead and the vital issues of public safety, waste disposal and so on must be dealt with to the full satisfaction of the population at large.  We in the Labour Party are totally unconvinced of the use of nuclear power as an option for the country in the absence of real guarantees of waste disposal and risk to life.  We believe public opinion is on the side of those who will be cautious in this matter.</P>
      <P>The issue of alternative sources of energy naturally arises and it is surely the responsibility of the Community to see to it there is a full investigation with all the necessary resources available of every potential field of development.  A large Community research programme is called for as one of the highest priorities.  The question of energy conservation must also be approached on a balanced basis, taking into account not only overall figures and trends but relative needs as well.  On this whole energy issue action will speak louder than words and there should be a Community action plan as well as a national plan in this country without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to point out again that as far as the EMS and the operation of the common agricultural policy are concerned, which are the two major issues of concern to Ireland in this <Col N="1596" /> Summit, the EMS and our negotiations for entry have by the Taoiseach's own criteria been a total, dismal, failure which unfortunately could have very serious repercussions for our people. The Taoiseach's defence of the Common Agricultural Policy was correct, but if he pursues the policies he has been pursuing he will undermine the willingness of the electorate to continue to support him in his defence of that policy.  I ask him in the national interest to think very seriously about the grave possibility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> We must endeavour to assess the 1979 Budget and judge it by the extent to which it helps to reduce unemployment, ensures a more equitable taxation system and increases the real value of social welfare payments.  These three criteria of assessment will remain valid. As we near the end of the first quarter of 1979, it is evident that unemployment continues at an exceptionally high level. It is interesting to note that many thousands of people march and stop work in relation to the income tax system, but it is ironic that they do not march through the streets or stop work in protest at the fact that over 100,000 people are registered as wholly unemployed.  They, perhaps, are the section in the community who are most discriminated against and penalised and who do not have the privilege of paying taxes.  There is a need to put some of our grave economic and social problems into correct perspective.</P>
    <P>We still have an unemployment rate of 11 or 12 per cent and we have become blase and fatalistic about it.  Successive Green and White Papers from the Government have had very little short-term effect on unemployment.  If it were not for the job creation work of the IDA and the creation of public service employment by the Government, we would be in a far worse position.  It now appears that in 1979 and 1980 we shall have to rely exclusively on the job creation programme of the IDA, because undoubtedly there is now a very considerable slowing down in the rate of new public service employment because of budgetary considerations and lack of current finance.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party suggested in pre-budget submissions that there is an urgent need for a further substantial increase in public capital expenditure on labour-intensive projects and I am pleased to note that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has announced a major programme in relation to our telecommunications system.  It is not before its time.  The last major programme was initiated by his predecessor, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, and that had some impact.  It was at that time a very large programme.  But as a result of chaotic industrial relations, within the <Col N="1599" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs, particularly within the past two years, that programme barely got off the ground.  One must welcome the decision of the Minister and the Government to support our telecommunications system by a fresh input of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>All Members of this House are acutely aware that several thousand jobs have been lost and are being lost because of the total inadequacy of our telephone and telex system, particularly in the west.  In my own constituency 30 or 40 jobs have been lost during the past 12 months because firms decided they could not expand because additional lines were not available and could not be provided by the Department.  The situation is critical.  Industrial firms setting up in Ireland, especially those who wish to avail of grants from CTT, generally wish to engage in marketing work and to have accounting complexes attached to their Irish concerns.  This is not possible without and adequate telephone and telex system, because these firms need to communicate instantly with their offices in Europe and America.  It is all very well for the Government to say that by 1983 a substantial programme will be in existence.  These installations are needed now and this area needs emergency treatment by the Government.</P>
    <P>The effect of the poor communications system on employment is critical and it also creates a lack of belief that the public service is capable of doing anything.  As a result, the public service gets a thoroughly bad name which is undeserved in some respects.  This saps the national morale and causes disillusionment among civil servants, particularly those working in the telecommunications area.  The national economic effort splutters on, instead of going ahead in a more dynamic way.</P>
    <P>The solution to our communications problem is an internal, domestic solution. We cannot blame the British because it is now many years since we inherited a telecommunications system. We cannot blame anyone except ourselves.  The solution to the problem of industrial relations, capital investment, the purchase of sites, building on these sites and the employment of an effective <Col N="1600" /> corps of engineers and technicians in the Department is within our own compass. There is nothing to prevent us developing a more energetic programme in this area.  A public capital programme of this nature would inevitably generate employment in technology, engineering and among Irish construction firms. That aspect of public capital expenditure, which is labour-intensive, should be extended.</P>
    <P>I would also urge that another aspect of our communications be dealt with urgently by the Government because it is vital to our economic well-being and to the creation of jobs, that is, expenditure on our road system and on a rapid rail system.  I live in the suburbs and represent a constituency which has the highest number of cars <i>per capita.</i>  The absence of an adequate and efficient transport system is choking Dublin. Many larger European capitals have coped with a higher number of cars and a greater density of population.  In Brussels, Stockholm and other European capitals they have efficient urban transport systems.  The traffic situation is as bad in Cork and Limerick as it is in Dublin.  I am a member of Dublin County Council.  Recently we met Mr. Higgins, General Manager of CIE.  He expressed grave concern for the chaotic situation in Dublin and its inevitable effect on the country.  He told us that the population rise in the Dublin area with the consequent increase in the number of cars had not been accompanied by an investment in infrastructure despite the fact that the need for investment in improved road and rail services was not unforeseen.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government not to delay the electrification of the Howth-Dún Laoghaire line and to provide capital for CIE to purchase new rolling stock.  If this is not done, by the middle of this year the suburban services in Dublin will break down.  I am not being dramatic when I say that CIE make no bones about the fact that their rolling stock is creaking at the seams and ready to collapse.</P>
    <P>We have asked the Government to do a number of other things.  We suggested to the Government that there is a reasonable case to be made for the examination <Col N="1601" /> of the possible role of a State development corporation.  Every opportunity must be availed of to establish new enterprises, for example, joint ventures between the public and private sectors, or between firms in the private sector, or between State enterprises, or between foreign, State and private undertakings. We must be flexible in this regard.  I am extremely critical of the almost total disappearance of the Government's Industrial Development Consortium who met six times in 1978, a few times this year, and who seem to be making little contribution to job creation.</P>
    <P>The Government should spend more money on a national programme of oil and gas exploration.  I am not too sure that we have been pressing the EEC strongly for substantial aid to supplement our exploration programme.  I am glad that amending legislation concerning the ownership of mineral rights has been passed through the House but there is a need for greater Government activity in relation to oil and gas exploration. We should insist on Community aid despite opposition from several other countries because the cost of energy is returning to the 1974 increase phase.  It seems that the price of a gallon of petrol will soon be more than £1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I approve of the Government's decision to introduce a special 10 per cent corporation tax for manufacturing industry until the year 2000.  I approve of the fact that that tax applies for the first time to profits on domestic sales because that decision enhances further the prospect of a more attractive return on investment in the manufacturing sector.  The overall fiscal <Col N="1602" /> and tax climate is still favourable and there is a need for greater incentives to maximise industrial production, particularly in processing, in beef and dairy products, in timber, which is an oncoming product.  There is great potential here, and I would mention zinc particularly. The markets for metals may not be favourable at the moment but we should make an intensive effort to reap the maximum benefits from our natural resources.  We could increase employment in these areas in the near future.</P>
      <P>I hold the view that, thought we must continue to encourage foreign investment here in the coming years, we should not rely excessively on incoming firms as practically the whole part of our industrial strategy.  Such a strategy would be fraught with great danger.  At the moment about 60 per cent of our new job creation efforts comes from foreign industrial firms.  Of course we have the age-old problem of definition of a domestic firm.  Apparently when a firm has been here for a number of years and becomes integrated it is classified as domestic.  I welcome such firms provided that our industrial structure does not become unduly lopsided.  We have opportunities to counterbalance these matters by maximising development of our natural resources and by expanding our specialised national undertakings, such as Waterford Glass.</P>
      <P>I will now turn to some of the more pressing issues of the past few weeks and I will be very critical of the budget strategy in this respect.  In their election manifesto and during the campaign, the Government party created expectations of an ever-higher standard of living, for ever-higher increases in incomes, and these expectations were compaigned for massively in the six months before the general election.  I recall vividly the Minister for Economic Planning and Development assuring audiences in our shared constituency that there was not a problem, that all we needed was a bit of growth, a bit of buoyancy, and that if there were difficult income policy problems to be resolved, growth and buoyancy would take care of them.  It was difficult not to be convinced by it&mdash;that Minister convinced half the shadow cabinet at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> We all had the gravest reservations that life could be so gloriously easy and, of course, what has happened is that the chickens are coming home to roost in a very savage, damaging and disturbing manner.  Social expectations were created by Fianna Fáil, income and standard of living expectations were created, which no budget even in the richest oil-producing State could sustain. It has not been possible for the Government to sustain that kind of society and it will not be possible to do it.  Indeed it may well be that in two or three years, such is the reaction of the electorate at the moment, that the National Coalition might find themselves back in office to try to cope with these problems.  I would not wish it on any Government to have to cope with such a situation.</P>

      <P>At the rate Fianna Fáil are going all we have to do is to sit back to get them kicked out on their ears.  In 1977 Fianna Fáil assiduously cultivated what can only be called a grabber society.  If a man had a car, no problem, car tax was to be abolished.  If he had a house, it did not matter a damn what the valuation was, whether he was a millionaire or a pauper, rates were to be abolished.  Income tax allowances were to be doubled&mdash;&ldquo;No problem, you just vote for us&rdquo;.  If he found a Garda Commissioner he did not like, &ldquo;No bother, we will get rid of him, too.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall some of the statements made, particularly to people on the Border when gardaí were getting browned off: &ldquo;We will settle that, too&rdquo;. And they settled it.  Consequently, we now have a situation when there is not a single sector in the nation which does not feel that it should not have all it can possibly grab and to hell with the national interest.  That climate is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1604" /> One can go right down through any section of the community and ask those in it: &ldquo;What about the national interest?&rdquo; Is there such a thing now as the national interest?  They will say: &ldquo;No.  Why should we give a damn when they gave £3 million to a few speculators in the Irish Trust Bank, when they handed back £10 million to wealth tax payers, when every millionaire in the country with half a dozen domestic houses and a nice holiday house in Kerry had his rates wiped out overnight and when he could put the £800 or £900 which he should be paying in rates into his pocket and go off for a winter holiday in the Canaries?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The current climate is like that.  I said that throughout 1977, and I lost hundreds of votes in Dún Laoghaire when I had to say to bank clerks what Deputy Michael O'Leary had said &ldquo;I am sorry, it may be very unpopular but we will not give any more&rdquo;.  I had to say that and of course my poll dropped. Now every economic and social group in the community, whether in poverty or plenitude, says, &ldquo;To hell with the national interest.  We are getting as much out of this situation as we can possibly grasp&rdquo;, and we see the results every day of the week.</P>
    <P>The poor in the Irish community are not getting very much.  They have no power.  They get their ritualistic 12 per cent of social welfare, but that is all. They can vote or they need not vote. Politicians do not pay much heed to them.  The poor, of course, do not contribute the cheques of £5,000 or £10,000 into the national collections of the political parties.  In the last election the Fianna Fáil Party got about £500,000 from certain business interests.</P>

      <P>It is amazing what a national collection increase can do when certain interests say &ldquo;We will pay your party X amount of money, you look after us and change taxation and we will get it back&rdquo;.  That is what happens. I want to stess this regressive policy.  It is no pleasure whatsoever for me and no consolation or pride to the Labour Party that we should have a situation in this country where, for the first time in the history of the State, or of Dublin certainly, we are going to be faced with a national stoppage of work. This arises from and is related to the budget strategy pursued by the Government. The Government decided to bring in a 2 per cent farm commodity levy.  It was brought in with a flourish and the urban community were assured that an essential for the national wellbeing was that there be a 2 per cent farm commodity levy.  Then we had the cowardly retreat of the Minister for Finance at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fhéis and people became totally cynical about that retreat.  Three days later we had the abject humiliation of the Government and we found that we had two Taoiseachs in this country, Deputy J. Lynch and the president of the IFA, Mr. Paddy Lane. That is the standing joke in the urban community.  We are at the critical juncture where one would expect the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance of the day to say to the workers next week&mdash;&ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be absolutely clear that I do not approve of one-day, half-day, two-day, weekday or any other day political strikes.  As a trade unionist, as a former official of my own trade union, the ITGWU, and a former officer of the ICTU I have never supported, and will never support as long as I am in public life, the idea, concept or practice of a political one-day strike as such.  I believe in the ballot box.  I believe that if a Government suffer from such a about of irrationality as the Government have suffered in relation to the 2 per cent, which has exacerbated the attitude of every PAYE worker in this country, which has caused a wave of revulsion in <Col N="1606" /> the community and has resulted in demonstrations culminating in a stoppage next week, there is a way of curing that irrationality.</P>
    <P>These matters must be dealt with by the workers voting in or voting out politicians who have the courage of their convictions and are prepared to introduce taxation reforms of a more egalitarian, just and positive nature. Many tens of thousands of workers will lose wages on Tuesday next and the country will lose massive industrial production.  The Government are bereft of the moral authority to say anything about it because the automatic reaction on the streets will be &ldquo;Who the hell do you think you are?  You caved in to the farmers.  You introduced a 2 per cent tax levy and then you ran away from it within a week&rdquo;.  We have a Government naked of any moral authority to influence the course of events.  That is a bad situation and is not in the national interest.  It is not in the interest of any section of this community, whether they be urban workers, rural workers, employers or farmers.</P>
    <P>The power of democracy should reside, and should be seen at the Cabinet table to reside in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the democratic exercise of power must remain at that level and not on the street.  I hold that view as one who has the deepest understanding of why people react in such a manner. Their reaction is understandable but is in the long-term not particularly productive. The only productive outlet for such anger, the ultimate weapon is, of course, the ballot box.  That is where people have the real and final say.  The question must inevitably arise after such protests, what happens then?  Do we have another one-day strike next week?  Do we have a week-long strike?  Do we have a national stoppage <i>ad infinitum</i>?  It is obvious that the only redress for workers is to support politically those individuals or parties whom they believe represent clearly their economic and social interests and not to support those economic and social interests.  That is the answer, it has to be stated unequivocally in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It might be as a last refuge of argument by the Government that these <Col N="1607" /> events are really inspired by trade union members of the Labour Party or something like that or by some odd collection of left-wing individuals or by people who have to get something off their chest.  It runs much deeper than that.  As a Member of the Labour Party I can state that most certainly we do not dominate and have never dominated the Dublin Council of Trade Unions.  A very large number of members of that council ionists in Dublin city vote for the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have no influence whatever over them in that regard, nor would we wish to have any influence.  I separate the political from the industrial and there is a clear separation.</P>
    <P>We are not an industrial political party involved in strikes.  That distinction must be continously made because people tend to confuse the situation with that of the typical one-day political strikes on the Continent in France or Italy which have the support of the Communist Party.  We have not a similar political structure here.  We regard ourselves as a democratic political party.  Many of us have association with the trade union movement.  The Minister for Finance, when speaking on the food subsidies debate wanted to know where all those people were.  He wanted to know who was causing all the trouble.  He had returned from Washington and he found a few Reds under his carpet in Government Buildings.  He will have to think deeper why there is a current malaise and why people have reacted so critically recently in regard to the decision of the Government on the 2 per cent levy.</P>
    <P>There has been an inconsistency of policy within the Government, which has produced this reaction. I would like to refer to the decision in the budget to phase out food subsidies. It does not seem to be appreciated by the Government that when those food subsidies were introduced they were part of a national pay agreement bargain, a contract between the then Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the social partners.  The Taoiseach, when speaking on the White Paper on 31 January last, said they were introduced <Col N="1608" /> originally when inflation was running at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent. That was not the full reason. Subsidies, admittedly, were related to the exceptionally high rate of inflation at that time, the highest annual rate the country has ever experienced, and there were very definite reasons why that came about.  The subsidies were part of a bargain in which workers agreed to curtail their wage increases under the National Pay Agreement.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling abroad, not only in relation to the 2 per cent levy but in relation to the food subsidies, that the Government have violated that partticular on-going agreement.  I do not know how the Minister for Economic Planning and Development can justify that abolition because its effect has been very substantial.  Deputy Clinton said to me the other day that it was not just food subsidies, that I should recall that immediately prior to that a £1 million subsidy on cheese was taken off. He said at the rate we were going we would become a high food price country.  That will have a substantial effect on tourism apart from the effect it will have on the cost of living for the ordinary family.</P>
    <P>I remind the press, in particular, that this afternoon we expect to have the consumer price index figures for mid-February. I have no doubt that those figures will show an inflation rate of 11½ per cent and they will show, in relation to food items, that we are talking about something in the region of 14 per cent or 15 per cent. We certainly want to bear in mind in that critical situation that there is cause for the current concern.</P>
    <P>I believe the income tax concessions given in the budget have provoked some of the current reaction.  The 2 per cent levy was bad enough but then when people found out exactly what they got out of the income tax concessions there was further reaction.  If we take the average earnings of a married couple with three children and the wife is not working, at £4,500 a year the income tax concession and the increased social welfare allowances for the three children mean that that family are better off by £125 a year.  A tax concession of £125 a year is regarded as marginal in terms of a real <Col N="1609" /> impact on the living standard of such a family.</P>
    <P>Part of the substantial reaction of wage and salary earners and part of the PAYE protest is undoubtedly because the Government seriously miscalculated the amount of tax relief which should have been given in the budget if it was to have any real impact on opinion among wage and salary earners.  There has been a lot of criticism about the rate of inflation during the term of office of the Coalition Government.  There was a lot of criticism that we had a rate of inflation of 20 per cent.  Despite that horrific rate of inflation in 1973, 1974, and 1975 we attempted&mdash;there was a lot of Labour Party pressure involved&mdash;to reform the taxation structure.  In a very short time we reformed the system of taxation here.  It is forgotten that during our period of office indirect taxes were greatly reduced particularly on items which have substantially influenced the standard of living of workers in the lower income group.  It is forgotten that within six months of taking up office the National Coalition Government removed VAT from food.  Fianna Fáil, within 18 months of coming back into office, removed food subsidies.  Could there be a more glaring comparison of strategy?  We pledged in the 1973 election campaign that we would remove VAT from food and we did so.  These things tend to be forgotten because it is contended that because of some of the other mistakes we made we deserved to be removed from office.  They were not economic mistakes.  By and large they were mistakes of personality and strategy by individuals, whether it was the Donegan affair or anything else which I think was the principal reason we were finally kicked-out.</P>
    <P>It tends to be forgotten that, during our term of office, VAT was removed from clothing, as it was from electricity and footwear.  That was part of our policy.  One can contrast that with the decision of the Government to immediately abolish food subsidies as soon as they came back.  It is reminiscent of 1957.  I would point out also that in the 1975 Dáil session the Coalition Government introduced three taxes to deal with wealth, capital gains and acquisitions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> The passage of those Bills did have an impact at that time on wage and salary earners, who were satisfied that a genuine effort was being made by the Government to come to grips with the anomalies and inequities in the taxation system.  We assured wage and salary earners that we would broaden the taxation system and attempted to do so.  The present Government have narrowed the taxation system and have wiped out 80 per cent of that capital revenue.  As a result the average worker around the city says: &ldquo;Well, if that is what you did with the wealth tax, with capital gains, with the capital acquisitions tax; if that is what you are doing with food subsidies, with the 2 per cent, can you blame us feeling so strongly about the situation?&rdquo;  That is why there is the current, critical reaction on the part of wage and salary earners, whereas we broadened the tax base and insisted that those with wealth in our community would make a contribution.</P>
    <P>I had a most interesting reply to a question I posed in the past week to the Minister for Finance.  In that reply the Minister gave the number of returns of individuals who were assessed to wealth tax.  It is enlightening to recall that in 1975 there were 1,170 people in the country who made returns of up to £250,000; there were 257 persons who made returns of up to £500,000 and 60 persons who made returns of over £500,000.  That was the range of taxable wealth under the wealth tax system.  It is no wonder they screamed blue murder when they had to pay £1,000 out of £500,000 in tax&mdash;a miserable £1,000 tax levy, which is about, on average, all they had to hand over.</P>
    <P>There is one other aspect I wanted to raise that is relevant to Government policy on housing.  I am extremely concerned about the present housing situation not only in the private sector but in the public sector as well.  For many years this country had the unique and proud tradition of it being possible for most young married couples to aspire to buying and owning a home of their own. I regret to say that increasingly this is no longer the case.  There has been a major increase in mortgage interest rates, a rapid escalation in the cost of houses, <Col N="1611" /> with the result that the possibility of a young couple acquiring a home of their own is going out of reach, particularly when one talks about houses costing nowadays anything from £30,000 to £35,000, particularly in the south Dublin area where I live.  The Fianna Fáil stated intention to assist first-time house buyers has proved to be the most spluttering rocket ever launched in this country. The £1,000 house grant has gone&mdash;and we must repeat this in this House&mdash;straight into the pockets of builders who have become very clever on how to use and abuse the system of certificates of reasonable value.  There is additionally the rocketing increases in the price of building land.  Is it right that a field used for centuries to graze cattle&mdash;and which has no more an economic value as agricultural land&mdash;should suddenly increase twenty-fold in value simply because a county council&mdash;and I am a county councillor&mdash;grant planning permission or change the zoning and classify it as building land.  Why should a bonanza of that nature, why should the owner of such land&mdash;with taxpayers' money going into it, servicing it&mdash;reap a massive capital gain at taxpayers' expense?  I believe that the persons who profit from the sale of such lands should recompense the community so that aspiring house-owners can buy houses within their price range.  Therefore I strongly urge the Government to introduce legislation along the lines recommended by the Kenny Report.</P>
    <P>I would ask also for substantial amendments to the law relating to compulsory purchase and arbitration.  It is outrageous that young married couples should have to get a mortgage of some £25,000 or £28,000, additionally have to scrounge a few thousand pounds from their parents, then get a bridging loan of another £5,000 or £6,000, spending their early married years rearing a family with a massive mortgage around their necks, living on a very reduced income for which there is no good social or economic reason.  I am very critical of the failure of the Government to come to grips with the explosion in house costs and the massive increases confronting <Col N="1612" /> young couples in relation to the purchase of new homes.  It is rather like the unemployed&mdash;those who have houses are not too worried about those who have not; those who have jobs are not too worried about those who have not.  But it is an area of self-interest in relation to building land which we should close in the national interest.  We should do so even if it means amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>These are my views on the current aspects of this budget.  I regret that my comments have had to be so critical but we live in disturbing times and I regret that a Government that came to power with so much alleged talent, with the largest majority in the history of the State, should find themselves in such an abject and unpopular minority position in relation to public opinion here.  I regret that that should be so but then the country, in the local elections, the European elections and the general election will have ample opportunity of putting that situation right.</P>

      <P>The 1979 budget which we are discussing at the moment will certainly go down in the history of the State as an historical budget.  It is a further development of the election manifesto which we placed so successfully before the Irish people in June 1977.</P>
      <P>This morning the Taoiseach came into the House and made a very good statement in relation to his meeting with the other EEC leaders on Monday of this week.  I would like to congratulate the Taoiseach on his negotiations and on his efforts in bringing home £45 million this year.  This will give further assistance to the development of this nation.  This injection of funds was not taken into consideration at all in the budget but I am sure that in the coming year we will hear more about it in relation to the development of infrastructures and the provision of more jobs.</P>
      <P>I would also like to comment on the Taoiseach's defence of the common agricultural policy.  It is consistent with our approach facing the electorate in June in relation to the European Parliamentary elections.  The Labour Party's line should be seen in the light of the objections by the British Prime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> Minister, Mr. Callaghan, to the continuation of the CAP and to improvements and increases in farm produce.  I would like to say to the Leader of the Labour Party that if these are his policies as well facing the electorate in June and if they are, I can assure him that he will get very few votes for his candidates, especially in the rural constituencies because his party are totally opposed to the development of this nation.  We have benefited more than any other nation in the EEC in relation to the CAP. Therefore it is vital that this policy should be continued and this Government are consistent in their approach.  I know that the Taoiseach actively sought the continuation of the policy and the expansion of the grants and aids to agriculture here at the meeting on Monday. I must say that the efforts of the British Prime Minister to remove the CAP will be frowned on and indeed, as I said, the Leader of the Labour opposition in our Parliament should dissociate himself from the statements made by Mr. Callaghan at this meeting in Paris.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer again to the budget which was put before the people here in February.  This budget has been the subject of much debate and discussion since its presentation in this House. The debate was mainly in relation to the proposed 2 per cent agricultural levy and ignored the 73 pages of the Tánaiste's financial statement which provides the total package, the second stage of the Government's strategy for economic and social development recently published in the White Paper, Programme for National Development 1980-1981.  Indeed this debate is presently raging about farming taxation and the contribution made by the PAYE sector.  It started as a result of the budget statement of 7 February.</P>
    <P>Many people view with admiration the brave and courageous efforts of the present Government to investigate and initiate methods of raising taxation, of sharing the burden among all working people in our community.  The conservative opposition here are unable to grasp the effort this Government are making to initiate this great debate.  It is only right and proper that this debate should be commenced because it will allow <Col N="1614" /> a situation to develop where eventually we will have a fair and equitable taxation system.  This is what every section of the community is seeking.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that this proposed one-day stoppage should have been suggested at all.  It will serve no useful purpose and it is regrettable that so many people throughout this State will suffer as a result.  I hope it will be prevented even at this stage, that the trade union organisations will ask their members to call it off. The Government, in initiating this debate, are prepared to suffer a degree of unpopularity in order to arrive at a fair solution.  I feel the public should realise the work which the Government are doing at this time.  Unless a fair system is agreed the nation as a whole will lose out and the weaker sections of our community will suffer most.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, at all stages in our history made strong and unpopular decisions for the common good.  Let this present situation be viewed in this light. This Government are prepared to grasp the nettle and take decisions in the national interest.  That was always the case.  It is consistent with the traditions of this party that at all stages in the history of this State when in government we were prepared to bring in legislation and to initiate debates, and in many cases these have resulted in major benefits to the nation as a whole and in some cases in a loss of support by this party.  But with Fianna Fáil the nation has always come first and the party has come second.  We are a national party, represented throughout the whole country.  We have the largest majority in the history of the State but we are not a dictatorial party using hammer tactics to push through legislation in this House.  It is a question of consideration, discussion and debate with all sections of the community, with all interests, whether farming interests or trade union interests.  The fact that we have a majority in this House does not mean that we will use this majority to force our will against the interests of the nation or the public as a whole.  I think if the present opposition parties had the type of support that we have at this time they would certainly be a dictatorial government, as indeed they <Col N="1615" /> were during their period of office.  Fortunately they have not got the type of support that we have.</P>
    <P>Coming up to the last general election it was obvious that the former Government were losing control and were adopting a dictatorial approach to all aspects of policy.  This is something Fianna Fáil will not do because it is not in the best interests of the nation as a whole.  We will not use the jackboot type of policy of the previous Government. Where adjustments can be made in any aspects of taxation, those adjustments should be made in discussion and consultation with all the interested parties. This is the right approach in a parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>The Government are governing with the support of this House and with proper respect and regard for all sections of the community.  The Government must always be prepared to listen to the wishes of the people.  In the national interest they must be prepared to change or revise decisions after proper consultations and at the end of the day make decisons that will benefit the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>Since we took office in 1977 our fight against inflation has been successful. There was an inflation rate of 21 per cent in 1975 but this dropped to 7.6 per cent in 1978.  We hope to continue on this path and to reduce the inflation rate to somewhere in the region of 5 per cent in 1979.  This must be seen as an effort by the Government to tackle the great scourge of the country in the period 1973-77, namely, the scourge of inflation. During that time the earnings of people were useless.</P>
    <P>The PAYE people were far worse off in 1973-77.  We are giving those people a better deal.  When the National Coalition Government were in office there were members of the ITGWU on the Labour Party benches and it is strange that there were no one-day strikes or marches in relation to PAYE.  Maybe it is a coincidence, maybe it is not, but the matter must be considered in the light of developments and improvements in the PAYE sector since 1977.  There is no doubt that PAYE people are paying a massive share of expenditure.  All <Col N="1616" /> Members of this House are PAYE people and I personally am prepared to give my contribution to help those who are less well off.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the revenue collected by way of taxation is going to the less well off members of the community.  The massive social welfare increases in the budget are welcomed.  Before the budget I urged strongly that a massive increase be given to social welfare recipients and I was pleased to see that they were included in the budget.  Social welfare recipients should be given priority treatment. They should be given the necessary support and aid to ensure that they have enough food, heating and electricity and that they have decent housing.  Adjustments must be made in each budget in line with those made in this budget.</P>
    <P>Old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives and other categories have been given an increase of 16 per cent and there have been short-term social welfare increases of 12 per cent.  If we can bring down the rate of inflation to 5 per cent these increases will mean even more to social welfare recipients.  We have given those people two to three times more than was given in the period 1973-77. The previous Government always boasted that they were the only Government who gave decent increases to social welfare recipients but they had to introduce mini-budgets every autumn in order to make up to the less well off section for the ravages of inflation which eroded the benefits of the increases given.  We are giving real increases to the less well off section.  These people rely totally on the Government.  They have not a strong lobby and they have no union to back them.  Their only voice is the elected Members of this House.  I shall always support the lesser well off members of our society, particularly social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>I am proud to be a member of a Government who have given the benefits of taxation to the lesser well off people. Fianna Fáil will always continue this policy.  It is our policy to support the old, the disabled, the widows and social welfare recipients.  We have always been prepared to raise taxation, even unpopular taxation, to support those people <Col N="1617" /> who have not a strong voice.  Unfortunately they cannot have one-day strikes.  I think they will be genuinely satisfied with the increases the Government have announced.</P>
    <P>There have been increases of roughly £2.55 and £2.20 per week for contributory and non-contributory old age pensioners.  Recently I made an appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that patients and residents of welfare homes and psychiatric hospitals, including the Sacred Heart Home in Roscommon, the home in Carrick-on-Shannon, the welfare homes at Mohill and Boyle and the psychiatric hospital in Castlerea should get the increase announced in the budget for old age penisioners.  I asked that the health boards should not pocket the increase of £2.20 per week granted to old age pensioners. At the moment these people get a pocket money allowance of £3 per week.  An increase of 50p was granted last year and I initiated that increase by approaching the Minister for Social Welfare.  He was willing to instruct the health boards to increase the allowance to £3.</P>
    <P>That £3 allowance is totally inadequate and I appeal to the Minister to instruct the health boards to give the full increase of £2.20 per week to the old age pensioners in their institutions and homes because the increases in tax on drink and tobacco have affected those people more in relation to their allowance than any other section.  Their one pleasure&mdash;perhaps a pint or two and a cigarette or a pipe&mdash;should be allowed for.  The health boards that are adequately financed at present and have been adequately financed should not be allowed to take this increase.  The Minister should ensure that when these increases become payable they go direct to those for whom they are meant and not the health boards.  I was speaking to the Minister recently and I am confident that he will instruct the health boards to give the recipients these increases, so that they may have proper pocket money which will ensure them some enjoyment for the remainder of their lives. They are entitled to these increases. They have no union or organisation to represent them.  Whenever I have spoken <Col N="1618" /> on the budget I have always spoken about social welfare recipients.  I know that in this case my voice and their voice will be heard here in regard to these improvements.</P>
    <P>Many social welfare improvements in the budget have been in a sense ignored. These should be noted by the public generally.  I mention specifically improvements as regards means tests for old age and widows' pensions.  These have been long out of date and I am delighted that the Minister for Finance has ensured in this budget that special consideration will be given when calculating the means of applicants for old age and widows' pensions.  In the summary of the budget the section concerned allows for an increase from £25 in the case of claimants for old age non-contributory pensions and from £100 in the case of widows non-contributory pensions to £200 in the amount of capital that will not be assessed as means for such claims.  The previous allowances were long out of date and deprived many applicants of the maximum pension.  This anomaly is being removed, but again this has been ignored by the media generally in their concentration on one aspect only of the 1979 Budget.</P>
    <P>There are many other improvements in regard to the assessment of means in the budget and also improvements in regard to the extension of free or subsidised telephone facilities to allow for a case where there are two people in the house and the second person is handicapped in some way.  This was badly needed.  Also, in the case of the blind and the mentally handicapped there is an extension of free travel facilities.  Free travel is already available to blind persons over 21 and to mentally handicapped persons, but it is proposed to extend free travel to blind persons between 18 and 21 to enable them to travel free to special work or training.  It is also proposed to exempt all mentally handicapped persons who are entitled to free travel from the restrictions applying to free travel at peak hours.  These concessions should be widely welcomed by those they benefit.  At present the free telephone facility applies only to pensioners living alone and it is proposed to <Col N="1619" /> extend this to include pensioners where the only other person residing in the house is permanently incapacitated.  I welcome all these improvements which have not been given sufficient publicity in the media.</P>
    <P>A further item is the improvement of the <i>exgratia</i> public service widows' pension. This scheme, which comes into operation this month, will give greater help to widows and orphans of members of the public service who have died.  This is also welcome.  There are also improvements for veterans of the War of Independence with effect from 1 July 1979.  The means test ceiling for special allowances will be increased by £100. That will give an increase of that amount to all eligible holders over and above the increase they will receive as a result of their annual revision of public service pensions.  War of Independence veterans will also have the telephone rental subsidy scheme for veterans living alone extended to apply to a veteran living with his wife or with an invalid or an old aged, blind or widowed pensioner, or with a person residing with him for the purpose of providing constant care and attention.</P>
    <P>Recognition of the position of War of Independence veterans is always welcome because without their sacrifices this Parliament would not exist.  It is only right that the Government should always recognise, as they have done since returning to office, the special position of these veterans and give them all necessary aid and assistance.</P>
    <P>The new system of social insurance comes into force on 6 April.  It will result in a real saving to widows and deserted wives of approximately £2 per week. People in receipt of low incomes will also make a saving due to the fact that social insurance contributions are related to earnings.  This is a budgetary provision of 1978 which is coming into force this year.  It will mean an improvement for the lower income group and it will simplify the whole system of collection of social welfare contributions.  The stamp is being abolished and there is a direct percentage payment to the Exchequer which has been reduced for the lower income group.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> Another aspect of the budget is the general improvement in regard to the financing of the building sector.  In a speech here on 1 March the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment gave details of expenditure in his Department in regard to house building, house development, reconstruction grants and all aspects of his Department. Local authorities will benefit to a great extent by the budgetary provisions.  This year the local authorities will spend £610 million of which they will raise £170 million. The role of the local authorities is vital and they are being enabled to fulfil this role by the funding they are receiving from the central authority.  Because local authorities have responsibility for such essential services as roads, water, sewerage and so on we must ensure that they continue to have the necessary support, especially now that domestic rates have been removed.  I am happy with the amount voted this year for the counties I represent.  During the time of the previous administration we were not given any worthwhile finance for infrastructural work, but Fianna Fáil have changed that situation.  In Roscommon a sum of about £3 million has been received in respect of water and sewerage schemes.  This money has resulted in greater employment in the area as well as in an improvement in these services.  In addition, the improved infrastructural facilities will result in more factories and more houses being built.</P>
    <P>The grants in respect of group water schemes are very welcome.  These apply to areas in which the local authorities are unable through their own efforts to provide regional water schemes. But there is one point I should like to make in this regard, and that is that the Minister might investigate the question of introducing legislation to control the organisation of these group schemes.  In the present situation exorbitant sums are charged sometimes to new applicants.  In many cases where the local authority provide the water and the group involved in the scheme provide the pipes and so on, those involved initially in the scheme charge newcomers a very high price for the service.  Apparently the <Col N="1621" /> Department have no control in this regard and that is why I suggest that legislation be introduced setting out a maximum charge for new connections. Some regulations are needed to control the development of these schemes.  They are very worthwhile schemes and much credit is due to the people who are involved in them, but there is some room for improvement on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of house building, a very welcome aspect in this sector has been that since being returned to office Fianna Fáil have increased the local authority loan from a level of £4,500 to a maximum of £9,000.  We have increased also the income level in respect of eligibility for these loans.  During his contribution on the budget the former Minister, Deputy Tully, reminded us of the good work he did during his term in office, but I would remind him that during the years of Coalition rule the house-building industry reached the worst stage ever in the history of the State.  Some of the reason for this situation was the difficulty in obtaining loans and also the removal to a large extent on 1 January 1976 of the grants.  The £1,000 grant for new house purchasers has been a tremendous help. Last year about 12,000 applications for this grant were approved and the number paid was 7,140.  The shortfall was not due to any delay on the part of the Department, but it appears that the houses were not completed at the rate expected.  Such delays are normal in building, but the money is available for those who qualify for the grants.</P>
    <P>On the question of local authority loans I would appeal to the Minister for Finance to bring to bear whatever pressure is possible on the banking institutions in relation to bridging finance.  I appeal to these institutions to set the minimum interest rate in respect of bridging loans for people who have obtained sanction for the £9,000 local authority loan but who are experiencing delays in receiving the loan, because of delays in relation to title of property, for instance.  The banks are exploiting these sorts of situations.  Some of the massive profits they are making might well be given to subsidise the bridging finance <Col N="1622" /> required by people either building or buying a house for the first time.  Even to confine this facility to people who qualify for the £1,000 grant would be a great help.  Perhaps the banking institutions could fix the interest on bridging loans at a maximum of 1 per cent more than their deposit rates.  It is grossly unfair and unjust to charge interest rates of 15 or 16 per cent on bridging finance in respect of a house, especially as this is finance that is guaranteed by the local authorities and which is paid directly to the banks.  If necessary, perhaps the Minister would introduce legislation to ensure that at least some of the funds of these private banking institutions are made available to people who are first time buyers of houses.</P>
    <P>Because of delays in regard to titles, delays in the Land Registry, delays on the part of solicitors and so on, people often have to pay interest on bridging loans for as long as two or three years. This situation is totally unacceptable. Perhaps one way of coping with the difficulty would be for the Department to set up building societies within the local authorities on the lines of a national building society which would attract finance from the public generally, pay the current rate of interest and then give special loans at a minimum rate to loan applicants.  The present building society charges are exorbitant.  The difference between the investment rate and the loan rate is excessive and their profits are also excessive.  This situation should be investigated.</P>
    <P>One way to deal with that problem would be for the State to set up in direct opposition to private enterprise.  That could be organised efficiently and effectively through the local authorities.  This would give them a new role to raise money directly from the public, as is the case in Britain and elsewhere.  The local authorities have the necessary personnel to administer such a project.  They would administer it at a minimum charge and the money would be available to people who are not eligible to apply for the present £9,000 local authority loan. Although the building societies are serving a need the State should and could get directly involved in the direct financing <Col N="1623" /> of housing.  I do not advocate any nationalisation or takeover of building societies; I am advocating a national building society operated through local authorities.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I researched this aspect of financing for local authorities. In my view the present system of local authority loans is very satisfactory.  The difference between the rates paid by the local authorities for the money they get and the rate they charge is roughly about half of 1 per cent.  This is the maximum which should be charged by any institution.  Building societies are making massive profits and should be brought to heel, their profits should be reduced and they should give loans at better rates.  If they do not do this the State should play a direct role in raising finance through local authorities.  The public in each county would have tremendous confidence in placing their money with the local authorities because they would know that the money they invested directly in their own areas would be used to finance housing there.  In other words, they would benefit their own area if they invested in their local authorities with the guarantee that the money would be spent locally.  There is a great deal of money which could be invested in this way.</P>
    <P>The money which will come back to the Exchequer as a result of our membership of the EMS could be channelled into this very productive development. Priority must be given to assist young married couples who are finding it increasingly difficult to provide the most important necessity of life&mdash;the provision of a home.  It is Fianna Fáil policy to encourage young people to provide their own homes.  Since 1977 the amount of the house loan has been increased by 100 per cent.  This area still requires special attention and a fresh look should be taken at it.</P>
    <P>This Government are prepared to bring in any legislation required in this area.  I have complete confidence in their ability to take the necessary steps to ensure that anomalies will be dealt with as quickly as possible.  Reconstruction grants are very welcome.  The amount of <Col N="1624" /> finance being made available to assist the disabled to extend their homes and provide the necessary sanitary facilities has been increased.  At present a disabled person can receive a maximum grant of £2,400&mdash;an increase on the maximum granted during the previous administration of £800.  They can also receive, for additional reconstruction work, a grant from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that the Minister of State at that Department is present. Earlier I complimented him on his excellent speech on 1 March.  I would like to compliment the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State for their excellent work in that Department. At column 18, volume 312 of the Official Report of 22 February 1979 Deputy Tully, Minister for Local Government in the previous administration, was proudly boasting about his efforts in that Department.  He said:</P>
    <P>When I was sitting on the Government front bench representing a Department I took my own responsibility. While I had to report to the Government and get a Government decision on various matters, if I thought it right I made my case.  If I got the right to do something I did so without going around and asking people if it was right or wrong.</P>
    <P>From my experience of his Department he made many wrong decisions but I am delighted he is prepared to take responsibility for his mismanagement of that Department.  No Department was such a disaster as that Department under Deputy Tully.  He has taken responsibility for removing the grants on 1 January 1976, thereby depriving many people of the grants to which they felt they were entitled and for which they are still fighting.  I am sure he was not very proud of that decision.  It took this Government to bring back credibility to the Department and to ensure that there was sufficient finance available for new houses, reconstruction grants and the disabled persons' grants which are being administered by the local authorities and financed by the Government.  Under the instruction of the Government local authorities are being liberal in granting <Col N="1625" /> disabled persons' grants.  Under the previous administration one had to be almost dying to get those grants but under this Government it is relatively easy to get them and they are being granted to the people who are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the possibility of allowing the local authorities to carry out this work directly where disabled persons are unable to arrange for the work to be done.  As public representatives we can help in obtaining the grants, but we are not able to organise builders to carry out the work.  That would require not only negotiation but supervision of the work.  Possibly the youth employment scheme could be extended to enable local authorities to undertake this task and the grants could then be paid directly to them.  I suggest that the Minister should have discussions with the managers of local authorities to see if that policy could be implemented.  At present many people who are eligible for these grants are unable to benefit because they cannot organise the work.  Perhaps some scheme could be devised, even on a pilot basis.  Local authorities would be enabled to give more employment to skilled personnel on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>The role of the Department of the Environment is vital in the development of rural areas.  Finance is necessary for sewerage and water works, drainage works, local improvement schemes and group water schemes.  The Department are getting the necessary recognition in regard to finance and some of the money which the Taoiseach has succeeded in obtaining from the EMS could be used to improve road structures.  The road from Dublin to the west is not in a satisfactory condition and it must be brought up to a proper standard.  A huge volume of traffic has been generated as a result of improvements in the economy since 1977, as can be seen by the large numbers of juggernauts on the roads. Improved road structures are necessary to ensure that the products of rural Ireland are brought to the ports for export as quickly and safely as possible. Whatever finance is necessary should be directed towards this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond spoke about <Col N="1626" /> the development of CIE services.  He did not comment on services to western areas, but I would appeal to the Department of Tourism and Transport to investigate the urgent need for the improvement of the rolling stock serving the west.  There is need for the development and improvement of public transport. It seems that in the years ahead there will be certain restrictions on the use of oil and energy in general and we will be relying more and more on public transport services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond neglected to mention the sale by CIE of some of their hotels.  The Coalition Government, which included so-called socialists, allowed a semi-State body to sell these hotels.  If they were really socialists they would have been advocating the development of all semi-State bodies and all aspects of their business and would not have allowed CIE to sell these fine hotels to private enterprise.  I have always said that I am a member of the only socialist party in this country because they are the only party who are concerned with the weaker sections of the community&mdash;they are concerned with all sections.</P>
    <P>I welcome all the improvements announced in the budget.  I regret that much attention has been paid to one aspect of the budget and many of the improvements have been ignored.  They will be recognised as the year proceeds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget has traditionally been seen as a financial statement but it is, I believe, a great deal more than that.  Traditionally budgeting procedures have rarely or never fully comprehended the basic concept of the budget.  It is not so much a statement of financial accounting as a statement of political philosophy.  A budget should reveal the basic thinking, the basic philosophical and ideological outline of a party's commitment to the kind of future and the kind of country they wish to create and bring about.  Unfortunately, traditional budgeting procedures have never been founded on this basis and regrettably we have no fundamentalist thinking or rethinking when it comes to budget strategy.  The funding of Government <Col N="1627" /> Departments is generally increased to take account of inflation, perhaps a little growth or development or electoral promises, and the budget is then presented as a total package.  I believe many opportunities are being missed to set national targets and goals which the Government, Parliament and the country could strive towards achieving.</P>
      <P>Therefore, budgetary procedure is becoming less relevant and less meaningful to the pattern of social development.  At this stage the concept of zero budgeting would be almost incomprehensible. That is an attitude which would analyse from the first penny of expenditure upwards in any heading of the budget whether or not the money was being spent properly in that area or whether a more fundamental approach should be taken by, for example, deciding that as a national target housing lists would be abolished within five years or that full employment would be created within X number of years.  The implications of accepting such targets would include that, whereas more money would have to be spent and more resources committed to these national goals, other areas would have to take a lower order in the priority list than heretofore.  Unfortunately, our politicians do not seem to have the courage to set these national goals and to be able to explain to people, by utilising the leadership which is surely latent in all parties, the reason for this approach. Instead, we meander along from year to year, adding a little bit here, subtracting a little bit there, and changing very little.</P>
      <P>Because the budget is little more than an accounting exercise there are invariably glaring omissions from budget strategy.  In some cases these omissions are not new; they are repeated every year.  However, there are times when the social, international or economic context of one of these omissions tends to make it more glaring than usual.  I intend to deal with one such omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is, regrettably, anti-child.  I am mindful of the fact, as I am sure we all are, that this is the International Year of the Child.  It would have been a marvellous opportunity for a Government <Col N="1628" /> inspired by vision, courage and leadership to say &ldquo;Let us do something special this year.  Let us decide to end the anomalous inequitous situation in which many children find themselves.  Let us make this truly the Year of the Child by ensuring that all our children are equally cherished, have warm houses, adequate pre-schooling facilities, adequate nutrition; that they have the full commitment of affection, love and interest which children badly need and of which they are so often deprived.&rdquo;.  That kind of basic headline could have been set in the budget this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health and Social Welfare spoke at a press conference in December last on the International Year of the Child and said:</P>
    <P>At present, nearly one-third of our population is made up of children. This is the best part of a million people. This proportion is high when compared to other European countries.  On the same scale, Ireland has a high birth rate compared to its neighbours.  This means that we have a very large segment of our population which is totally dependent on the remainder for its well-being.  The important question for the future is how do we cope with this challenge?</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that our most fundamental long-term challenge is how to cope with the growing number of young people and their social needs.  Unfortunately, the budget flies in the face of the Minister's challenge.  All it does is undermine any confidence we have that a serious attempt is being made to meet the expressed and implicit requirements in relation to the treatment of children, either at international level in the context of the UN Declaration on children's rights or domestically in the context of our Constitution.  In a number of specific respects the budget penalises the existence of children; it makes having children less rewarding; it makes it less financially feasible for a family to supplement and complement the subsistence of children.</P>
    <P>The UN Declaration specifies that children are entitled to affection, love and understanding, to adequate nutrition and medical care, to free education, to <Col N="1629" /> full opportunity for play and recreation, to a name and nationality, to special care, if handicapped, to be among the first to receive relief in times of disaster, to learn to be useful members of society and to develop individual abilities, to be brought up in a spirit of peace and universal brotherhood, to enjoy these rights regardless of race, colour, sex, religion, national or social origin.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to spell out how our basic social and economic policies are the antithesis of much that is in that declaration.  Specifically, the budget is anti-child, and therefore anti-family, in that it reduced the level of child tax allowances which offset the benefits of the increase in children's allowances for the average taxpayer.  Last year, when the Government were giving substantial sums of money to many people who could not be said to be in the same kind of need as some of our children, they ignored the family man by leaving children's allowances and child tax allowances unchanged.</P>
    <P>More extraordinary was the decision to penalise the family man with more than two children.  If he is an average taxpayer&mdash;with the paltry increase in personal allowances, he is certain to be-the increased allowances are worth a net halfpenny a week.  Apart from this decision being an uncalculated insult to many people, it reveals once again in all its ugliness, in all its narrow obsession with the rights of people of wealth and property, the basic deficiency in the social thinking of the Government, especially in relation to their barely-concealed disregard for people who are less able to speak for themselves.  Surely our children are in that category.</P>
    <P>The Government's real policy towards children is to attack the basis of the family, to penalise the existence of children.  That is extremely sad, because a glorious opportunity to do something constructive is being missed.  I appreciate that some efforts are being made to mark the Year of the Child and that some Ministers are conscious of it.  No amount of goodwill, no amount of easily-mouthed platitudes, no amount of fringe essay competitions or marginal exercises of a public relations nature will <Col N="1630" /> replace a basic gut commitment by a Government who would say &ldquo;This year in our budget and in our economic policies and plans we will do something meaningful and relevant to mark the Year of the Child.  We will ensure that the apparent injustices against children in our society will end&rdquo;, or even, &ldquo;We will introduce amending legislation in order to ensure that some of these injustices end&rdquo;.  There is no such commitment. It is much easier to make the general statement in the after-dinner speech about people from whom there will never be a backlash, people who will never take to the streets.</P>
    <P>In an article by an ex-Secretary-General of the International Union for Child Welfare and the International Catholic Child Bureau, Julia Henderson tells us of the problems of children.  She reveals to us at great lengths the difficulties which the average child experiences and outlines the vital needs which they have.  She also brings to our minds the fact that other governments around the world appear to be doing something tangible and substantial to make this an extremely important year. The importance of the International Year of the Child and of economic concern about children is that it marks in a very real way the very basis for our future.  If we respect the child today, I think we can rest easy about the security and the integrity of our tomorrow.  A total of 144 Governments apparently have agreed to participate in this effort, 92 of them have established commissions, and UNICEF alone have devoted more than three million dollars to help those commissions to organise, to survey children's needs and to survey the services already available, and so forth. Many organisations have responded enthusiastically and many Governments have committed themselves in a very fulsome way to a practical and pragmatic programme of doing something concrete and achievable.</P>
    <P>I was saddened by the budget because the obvious international, political and social theme of this year was so easily overlooked.  I am not clear for what gain it was overlooked, because since the budget was introduced we have had <Col N="1631" /> many headlines about this matter.  It appears to have opened the door to a period of vacillating government, weakness and passing over of responsibility which belongs in this House for running the country to some group or groups outside.  That is only in line with the tradition which unfortunately we have come to expect, of presenting options as a substitute for making decisions on the basis of a democratic consensus which has emerged in the context of the last election.  Julia Henderson, in her article, refers to the prospects for children. These are very germane to the economic policies of the Government and to the budget.  She says:</P>
    <P>What then are the prospects for children in the short-term and in the medium-term of the year 2000?  With such massive numbers of children living in countries where poverty, disease and illiteracy are still the lot of a majority of the population it is hardly realistic to expect that great improvements in meeting the basic needs of children will take place in the short run.  More than half of these children are undernourished, more than half will not find a place in school and will go only a few years if they do.  While their parents will continue to be swept up in great migrations, in &ldquo;natural&rdquo; disasters, and in wars, the benefits of development schemes will be slow to reach the subsistence farmer or the shanty-town dweller.</P>
    <P>Governments are likely to make many resounding policy statements but the fulfilment of these plans will constantly be curtailed because of an economic or political crisis, a flood, a plague of locusts, or a civil war.</P>
    <P>The year 1977 was such a &ldquo;sombre year&rdquo;, as the Executive Director of UNICEF reported to his Board, with tragic consequences for children.</P>

      <P>Will the Deputy give the title of the document he is quoting from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an article called &ldquo;A Crusade for Children&rdquo; in a magazine <Col N="1632" /> called &ldquo;People&rdquo;.  I do not wish to imply that the worst features of the tragic systematic deprivation and exploitation of children internationally is present in our society.  Nevertheless, we have elements of it at the moment within our community.  I believe we should be doing a great deal more about it and that the budget is an ideal opportunity to undertake such a task.</P>
      <P>We have heard of some of the activities which are about to be launched for International Children's Year.  I hope they will all be successful.  Some of them are fairly marginal in their impact but I hope that all of them will help to focus the minds of all concerned and interested people on that most important and fundamental element of our society, the child and the right of the child.</P>
      <P>This need for real reform is not realised in the budget.  There does not appear to be any basic interest in this social group.  Perhaps it is a little unfair to put it like that because I believe that one of the deficiencies in the way we have been budgeting over the years is that there cannot be an approach to regional problems, or if there is, it is the extreme rarity rather than the rule. Instead of being able to analyse the problems of an urban area or, to use Julia Henderson's term, &ldquo;a shanty-town&rdquo;, and of being able to respond comprehensively by an integrated and comprehensive programme of social, economic and political reform to cope with the needs in that area, we still operate in a way which is increasingly out-dated, that is, by means of nationally orientated Government Departments, each considering that their job is the same whether the area under their jurisdiction be Donegal, Cahirciveen or Gardiner Street when perfectly clearly that is not the case.  A regional approach is vital.  It would allow a specific goal to be set, a specific target or headline to be made, and the realisation of that wonderful social programme would then be feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the real crime in relation to children is not so much visiting cruelty, deprivation, hunger, misery and bewilderment on the bodies and minds of children, but remaining silent, passive, inactive in a so-called Christian country <Col N="1633" /> in the face of obvious injustice and inhumanity and the systematic exploitation of our greatest resource and the basis for our future.  No opportunity should ever be missed to try to cope with the growing tragedy of children and the way they are abused.  We do not hear much about it because there is no vested interest group, there is no lobby, on behalf of those young people and they threaten nobody.</P>

      <P>We are not dealing with the Year of the Child.  It does not come up to that extent on the budget.  It is in order to deal with children's allowances and children's tax allowances, but the budget only deals with financial matters and taxation.  The Year of the Child could be suitably discussed on another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I contend that the economic policies of the Government, as exemplified in the budget, continue the mission of analysing social needs, such as those of children, and responding to this by economic measures.  The economic measures in the budget lack any commitment to social justice for those young people.  If social justice does not have a place in a budget debate, I do not see any point in continuing my modest contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, the Chair has not said that.  The Deputy is debating the Year of the Child and what can be done in that year.  It is a suitable subject for another occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Chair's caution. I want to try to spell out why I believe it is important that the Government frame their economic and budgetary policies for the achievement of an end to injustice to children.  The rights of children have been outlined in a number of documents.  There is no need to quote from them here but they include Article 25 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, the Encyclical by Pope John XXIII, <i>Pacem In Terris</i>, 1963, the Proclamation of <Col N="1634" /> Independence of 1916 with those hard words about cherishing all the children of the nation equally, and our Constitution. In my view this budget directly conflicts with all of them because it sets at nought the commitment to social justice for children and social justice for other sections of the community as well.</P>
      <P>My specific concern today is with those children.  We have a great number of them in the country.  The amount of capital investment in relation to them is negligible when related to the kind of investment we cheerfully allow for temporary economic gain or in order to create a few paltry jobs at enormous cost.  The total sum specifically geared to children's needs is miniscule when related to the vast expenditure at the other end of the social spectrum, where the vested interest groups and the lobbies are louder and stronger.  If a Government find themselves being forced to meet social and economic needs on the basis of the loudest lobby they are a weak Government and have not the right to call themselves a Government.  One of the primary hallmarks of good government should be the degree to which the Government can cherish and respect the rights and needs of those who have no voice or those whose voices are so tiny as to be very rarely heard.</P>
      <P>We have many examples of serious problems in relation to what is under discussion this morning, a matter which should be dealt with comprehensively by a social and economic programme of the Government.  I should like to see the Government appointing a Minister of State for children's affairs.  I should like to see him having an allocation from the national budget specifically to remedy the injustices we have inherited from the past.  I should like to quote from an article by Janet Martin in <i>Magill</i> magazine of January 1978 in which she said:</P>
      <P>Child abuse, including frequent reports of sexual assaults on children, is another, although arguably different facet of domestic violence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have spent half an hour dealing with <Col N="1635" /> various matters and only a minor portion dealt with the budget.  I agree that it is the Year of the Child and it is suitable in that year to talk about the child.  But it is not appropriate on the budget debate except as far as it concerns two or three taxation matters which were in the budget&mdash;children's allowances, allowances for children under the income tax code and that sort of thing.  The budget only deals with taxation and financial matters.  The Deputy's speech would be perfectly in order on another occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

The matters relating to child abuse and the necessary economic provisions to create an adequate social care network, to ensure that <Col N="1637" /> those abuses stop, are germane to the Government's economic and social policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Government expenditure and the allocation of Government expenditure in the social welfare area.  In my view, there are a number of omissions here which I am trying to develop, and which I believe is right and proper to do.  I ask the Chair to listen for a few moments and, if he still disagrees, I shall not continue speaking because there will not be any point to it.  I am not interested in restirring the cold soup of four weeks ago and I do not want to repeat what other Deputies have been saying.  I have a commitment to a certain viewpoint in the context of the budget and I would like to get an opportunity of getting it across.  If that is not relevant, I will let in the next speaker.  I do not wish to be out of order and I will try to bear very strongly in mind the need to relate my remarks to the budget.  I can only meet the Chair half way on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen from a number of articles and extracts from articles the need for a specific social response in the budget.  A few weeks ago we had the publication of a report on North-Central Dublin which referred to unemployment, education and deprivation and showed clearly that young people once again were getting a very bad deal and were being exploited.  It was said in that report, based on a survey which was undertaken, that 96.4 per cent of those surveyed, either in jobs or out of jobs in a <Col N="1638" /> very big part of our city, were taking home less than £30 per week.  That kind of economic exploitation is a direct descendant of the exploitation of young children.  I believe that, until we restructure our budgets to take into account specific local regional needs, we will continue getting that kind of report and the blinkered thinking evident in this budget.</P>
    <P>I am not going to quote from the many reports which support my view on this, but they refer to a number of newspaper articles.  One of them in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 21 March 1977 is headed &ldquo;One in 700 Child Patients the Result of Abuse&rdquo;.  Why that should be and why a Government in their budget&mdash;or in their social welfare thinking which goes only so far as budgetary constraints permit&mdash;should allow it is beyond me.  The whole purpose of Government is to tackle these social challenges.  I have had recently extremely sad and depressing reports relating to the possibility that some children, in Dublin at least, have been deliberately maimed in order to evoke sympathy when they are used for begging purposes.  That is shocking. There was the case of a child obviously badly scalded by boiling water who had been left on O'Connell Bridge and then removed, apparently by the parents, prior to being reached by any social care.</P>
    <P>The extraordinary exploitation of children needs to be tackled, and one way of tackling it is to provide in the budget substantial funds which meet the spirit and the letter of ensuring that we care about children in this country.  That spirit and that letter are not there.  We find bountiful largesse in some regards but we find also the special rights of children flouted in the cruelty of allowing young children in an injured condition to be on the streets for the purpose of begging in order to supplement the incomes of those who live off them.  This is an intolerable situation for any Government. It is sad that we do not get a specific social commitment in the budget to ensure that that stops, but we do not.</P>
    <P>One could develop this at some length but, in view of the strictures of the Ceann Comhairle, I will not go on as <Col N="1639" /> long as I had intended in this regard. However, it is sad that reports have been made to very high authorities that day and night very small children are left to lie in filth and cold on O'Connell Bridge in Dublin and other places, often in their own excrement, for purposes of begging. I do not know, neither do I care very much, to which debate this is appropriate, but every power necessary should be taken, every appropriate Act should be invoked and every financial measure waiting to be introduced should be introduced to ensure that this deliberate exploitation of children ceases.  That or analagous social thinking is what should form the mainstream of thought in a budget statement, but that is not what we have.  Had there been one of the goals that I mentioned at the outset I would have understood, but there has been nothing like that.  It is difficult to articulate this, but we find that in some cases not much is needed to be done, that the problems are not so very insuperable and do not need enormous sums of money in the budget.  Proper analysis of the problem reveals that what they do need is the application of resources to specific groups of people. They need the invoking by the courts of certain legislation such as the Children Act, 1908, which could be used more extensively than it is in order to ensure that this exploitation of children stops.  These cases of extraordinary, mindless, vindictive cruelty to children must cease.  The Government have an opportunity to bring them to an end, but only if budgetary policy so allows.</P>
    <P>Some months ago a family of small children were found abandoned, their mother being in prison and their father, an alcoholic, absent from the area.  They had been left alone without food, heat or adult care for about a week before being discovered accidentally by a passerby. Their ages ranged from six months to 11 years.  Children, babies even, can be left alone for as long as a week while their parents are committed to prison or perhaps to hospital.  Maintenance care orders should be made mandatory in these cases by the courts.  Governments in their economic strategy should underline <Col N="1640" /> that this is a problem which we must ensure does not continue.  The various agencies already active in this field are coping with different aspects, but unfortunately there is often a weak spot in the mesh through which some cases slip.  Now that this matter has been brought to the attention of the Government in a more formal way than heretofore, I hope that action will follow. I will be happy to supply the Minister with more ample evidence and supportive documentation, some of it of a confidential nature and outside the context of this discussion.  I believe that it is timely to raise this in the context of the budget, where the tone, in so far as it relates to children at all, is anti-child. This is tragic in the context of this International Year of the Child.</P>
    <P>There are many children's organisations which are doing very fine work and many&mdash;indeed most of them&mdash;operate on a voluntary basis without support, interest or help.  There are Dr. Barnardo's homes, CARE who have some very fine publications, Children First, HOPE, Irish Save the Child, ISPCA, The Marrowbone Lane Fund, Women's Aid and other organisations.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to consider the possibility in the next budget of funding these organisations and, in so far as it is necessary, the structures needed to ensure that once and for all exploitation of children comes to an end. I am talking about food, shelter and heat.  I am talking about cruelty, about cigarette burns on children's arms. Social deprivation in terms of housing and nutrition are not as easily solved, but the basic things should be solved in a country that considers itself Christian if we have any conscience at all.</P>
    <P>I am far from impressed when I hear people talking complacently about magnificent increases in social welfare or the magnificence of this, that or the other, when in parts of Dublin, and no doubt parts of other major cities, a great deal needs to be done.  I say to the Government, &ldquo;Listen.  For a change seek out those who do not have a voice and who are not lobbied groups.  Seek the people who are not going to make substantial contributions to you.  Seek out <Col N="1641" /> the people who have no voice at all and try to do something for them, because they have a birthright, too, and they have the same rights as any other group.&rdquo;  Indeed, the rights which they seek, or would seek if they had the maturity and strength to seek them, are rights which we agree in our Constitution and our laws and in the vows we make in our churches on Sundays are rights which should not have to be sought.  We should seek these people out instead of inviting in the groups who come pounding on the door seeking their own salvation and benefits for their own members.</P>
    <P>Very good work has been done in other countries, for example, in Great Britain in this area.  These findings have been, and are being, reflected in budgets abroad.  The report from a select committee on violence in the family, presented to the House of Commons in 1977, is full of sensible recommendations, some of which have been supported by substantial budgetary measures designed to isolate and deal with, and eventually eliminate, particular social problems.  Some elements are more complex than others.  I do not expect everything to be cured overnight. However, it is very sad to read reports, such as the O'Kennedy Report, which were produced through the years in relation to children and to find that, if the date was changed, many of the requests and appeals in those reports would be as relevant now as they were then.  It is particularly sad when one considers the misery and turmoil that was endured.</P>
    <P>There are many suggestions one could make.  First, there is the basic budgetary one.  There should be a specific budget as part of the national budget which would spell out a campaign to eradicate once and for all the discrimination against and deprivation and exploitation of children.  Itinerant children particularly are at risk.  Whether they are on the streets all night or living without parents in tents or huts without food or heat, they should be taken into care.  A Minister with proper budgetary flexibility could ensure that the fostering services of the health boards would be developed to include itinerant children. <Col N="1642" /> Proper budgetary allowances to either the Department of Health and Social Welfare or to the local authorities could ensure that shelters were created where children who had nowhere to go could stay overnight.  Even this evening, there will be children on the streets begging and singing for money.  Many of them will not want to be given food because if they get food instead of money they will be beaten.  That is a fact.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Government when they next prepare a budget to identify areas of social need and leave aside the glancing back at last year's figures and the adding on of 2,6 or 8 per cent in the hope that the political flak will not be too strong.  Obviously, the provision of jobs and houses is a major social priority. However, this year it would have been appropriate&mdash;it is still not too late&mdash;to tackle the problems I have referred to. The onus and responsibility rests with the Government and they are not taking that seriously.  Their actions show no insight, care or compassion in relation to these problems.</P>
    <P>The Government's budget in this, the Year of the Child, shows a group of men whose concern revolves on the fulcrum of the people of property and power.  It reveals the hardening of the Government's attitude, which lacks moral responsibility, to the children on the mean streets&mdash;the waif whose voice is tiny and who knows nothing about politics or politicians but yet who depends on us.  They put their trust in all of us and we are all failing them.  Our advice to them appears to be that if they have tears to shed, they should shed them as silently as possible lest they disturb the neighbours and especially the groups we are busily attending to because they have louder voices.</P>
    <P>The children of our cities are entitled to dream the same dreams as their peers in any other walk of life.  The Government had an opportunity this year to bring together a programme which would tackle the major problems in relation to children and which would have national support and the support of everyone in this Parliament.  Not alone would it help to solve the problems but it would act as a catalyst to show that we <Col N="1643" /> have a Government who have leadership and vision.  It would help to harness the energy and focus the will of people in all walks of life who, unfortunately, seem to be only concerned about themselves to the exclusion of people who have a lot less.  It would exemplify a Christian spirit in a very real way.  This should be exemplified by Government.  The Christian spirit is not something for church on Sundays.  If the Government give a lead in this, many will respond and it could set a headline for selfless giving and selflessness in many other walks of life. Unfortunately, the clamouring we hear all around us is not heartening if we want to create that kind of society.  I do not blame the people for this.  Their desires and aspirations have been fuelled, perhaps unwisely, for political purposes by promises of material gain which have seduced many people into believing that there is nothing but the material to life.</P>
    <P>Why not have a special budget for children's year?  We have had special budgets for inferior reasons.  If we do not tackle this problem now it will overwhelm us in the future.  We cannot expect children to live indefinitely in overcrowded houses, on streets that do not have basic recreational facilities, or to cope with traffic going by a window ten feet from where a young child is sleeping or is trying to study.  We cannot expect that situation to continue forever and hope that we will have a healthy society.  I believe in an Ireland where the frozen attitudes of the past give way to the warmth and compassion blatant in the finest levels of all human kind.  I believe in an Ireland where the greatest sin will be to deprive by act, omission or deed the young child of his birthright, that is, a birthright of bountiful investment of love, shelter, education, protection, moral training and equality of opportunity. I believe in an Ireland which sees a new its Christian missionary role of looking to other nations, not so much to supplicate for material self gain, but to give a lot to others who have a good deal less that they might have a little more.  A nation that respects the child and fulfils its obligation to this most <Col N="1644" /> vulnerable section of the community may put its mind at rest about the future because the future will look after itself.</P>
    <P>From this point of view, the budget is a missed opportunity.  I would not be harsh in blaming the Minister or the Government for this.  To some extent, we are all prisoners of the past and are blinkered by the traditions of the past.  In this case, we are blinkered by the structures of budgets in the past.  I should like to ask the Government and the Minister to reconsider the way budgets are structured and to reconsider the social implications of the fiscal statement which is at present in the budget and, in this momentous year for children internationally, to rise to the challenge and to take on the major programme of reform which is so necessary and so fundamental for people whose voice is weak, people who will not form a lobby, and will not take to the streets.  The success of such a campaign would depend on the honesty, the integrity and the Christian conscience of the men and women in Government.  With that I rest my case, and I hope my remarks will be given some consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to get in earlier because of some commitments I have this afternoon.  I will endeavour to make my contribution without indulging in the repetition and reiteration we have heard from both sides of the House.</P>
      <P>The budget introduced by the Minister for Finance was designed to accelerate the rate of economic growth.  I have no doubt it will achieve that aim. Our economic record in the past two years puts us well ahead of many nations which are more developed and have greater financial and material resources.  Our growth rate of 7 per cent last year was the highest in the EEC for the second year running.  Our figure was almost double that of the OECD average, and almost treble that of the EEC.  With this fine record it would be most unfortunate if our growth rate were to suffer a set-back because of our industrial unrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since Fianna Fáil returned to power, economic activity has shown a rapid recovery.  The benefits are to be seen in <Col N="1645" /> every county in Ireland.  It was heartening to hear the Taoiseach's statement this morning on the EMS.  With six million people out of work in the Community, unemployment is obviously one of the most serious and difficult problems facing Europe.  In 1978, unemployment increased in Belgium, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.  In the United Kingdom the level remained more or less the same.  It decreased in Germany, Italy and Ireland.  This is very significant in relation to the way in which our economy is moving.</P>
    <P>Like most of my colleagues on all sides of the House, I am concerned about the increasing polarisation between our urban and rural communities. Sometimes people on both sides of the fence are not as responsible as they should be.  They often help to drive a further wedge between the two communities.  If this is allowed to happen, the country as a whole will suffer at a time when we have a golden opportunity to create jobs and give a decent standard of living to all our people.</P>
    <P>To a large extent we can understand the attitude of the trade unions on behalf of the PAYE sector who have had to carry an intolerable burden in recent years.  At the end of the day, the Government may decide the income-tax structure will have to be looked at again. What good will the one-day strike which is to take place next Tuesday do for the country?  Driving up here this morning I listened on the radio to the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo;.  I heard him read a passage from this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> in which Desmond Rushe stated that he would not take part in the one-day strike.  To me the reasons he gave were positive, honest and constructive.  What good will it do?  At the end of the day Mr. and Mrs. John Citizen are the people who will suffer.</P>
    <P>Like many other Members of this House I subscribe to the view that farmers must make a bigger contribution to revenue from income tax.  The farming community are willing to do so.  I do not come from a fortified city constituency. I come from a mixed urban-rural constituency.  Perhaps this is a sensitive <Col N="1646" /> issue for a Deputy like me to speak about, but we must speak honestly, constructively and positively.  We must not polarise the farming community and the industrial workers.  We must bring them together.  No one can seriously suggest the farming community are not willing to make a fair contribution.  I have met many of them in recent weeks and I know they are willing.</P>
    <P>When account is taken of the £36 million from rates on land which farmers will pay in 1979, the percentage of income taken in tax and rates will amount to approximately 5½.  They are the first to admit this is not enough.  The problem does not begin and end with the farming community.  Members of the professions across the board are not contributing their share to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion to make which may not have been made by previous speakers.  I should like to offer something new, to add some new dimension to the debate.  I have often marvelled at the tolerance and patience of the Ceann Comhairle and others who have to listen to speeches being repeated on both sides of the House during a debate such as this.  If we are to be serious about getting the professional people to toe the line, I have a suggestion which may be worth looking into.  The clients of members of the professions should insist on getting receipts for all payments made by them.  On production of those receipts, the clients should be allowed to claim income tax reductions.  This arrangement would be beneficial both to the clients and to the Revenue Commissioners who would have access to the true earnings of professional people.</P>
    <P>This type of system operates quite successfully in the United States of America.  There is no reason to believe it could not be implemented here.  If we are serious about introducing an equitable tax system, it behoves the Government and the Minister for Finance to look seriously at my suggestion.</P>

      <P>AnCO have advised me that the current apprentice recruitment is such that the present shortage of bricklayers is well on its way to being eliminated through the normal four-year apprenticeship scheme.</P>
      <P>The number of apprentices recruited in any one year is determined by the requirements of the trade and by the aggregate of individual recruitment decisions made by employers who have the consent of AnCO to the taking on of apprentices having regard to qualified craftsmen employed and their capacity to train the number of apprentices approved. In assessing an employer's suitability for the training of apprentices the number of craftsmen in his employment is taken into account along with other factors.  There is no fixed ratio of apprentices to craftsmen.</P>

An indication of the progress being made is that the figure for registered bricklaying apprentices at 31 December 1975 was 687 and the intake in that year was 94.

      <P>In a written reply on 15 February 1979 I stated that the Manpower Consultative Committee had under consideration a report of their sub-committee on occupational shortages. Since then the sub-committee have submitted a further report and the main committee have adopted the recommendations for improving the supply in the identified occupations.  The necessary follow-up action is being taken.</P>
      <P>The reports cover occupations coming within the scope of the Industrial Training Act, 1967, and certain occupations outside the scope of the Act.  In the case of the former, AnCO will be carrying out the necessary action and in the case of the latter, the authorities concerned are being approached.  It should be understood also that the shortages include some of experienced personnel which it may not be possible to correct fully by training additional young persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> In so far as AnCO are concerned the present position is as follows:</P>
    <P>AnCO organises courses for computer programmers of 32 weeks' duration. AnCO plan to train 66 programmers in 1979.</P>
    <P>Systems analysts are generally developed from experienced computer programmers.  AnCO encourages companies to train to meet their own needs.</P>
    <P>AnCO's engineering industry training committee have conducted a survey which points to a shortage of approximately 200 electronic technicians in Irish industry.  AnCO are currently organising a course at their Cabra training centre at which 18-year-old school leavers with mathematics and physics will be trained over six-month periods to become electronic testers/inspectors.  On completion of this course its graduates will not be qualified as electronic technicians but it is hoped that they will secure employment in industry and by means of day-release courses complete their training for qualification as electronic technicians.</P>
    <P>In relation to mechanical/electrical draughtsmen, AnCO run courses in four training centres for junior draughtsmen. There are 40 places on such courses, which have a 36 weeks' duration.</P>
    <P>The normal source of toolmakers is the apprenticeship system.  At the end of 1978 there were 253 toolmaking apprentices&mdash;47 of these were in their fifth year of apprenticeship and registered with AnCO.  AnCO provide first-year off-the-job training for toolmaking apprentices in three of their training centres which between them provide 36 places.</P>
    <P>A major study of the toolmaking industry is to be carried out to see whether any changes are needed in future training policies for this category.</P>
    <P>In relation to maintenance and turner fitters, the normal source of fitters is the apprenticeship system also.  At the end of 1978 there were 2,655 fitter apprentices, 474 in their fifth apprenticeship year, and 64 turner apprentices, registered fifth year apprenticeship, registered with AnCO.  AnCO provide first-year off-the-job training for fitter apprentices in 11 training centres which between them provide 259 training places.  In addition <Col N="1653" /> AnCO provide 12 places in their Cork training centre for the accelerated training of adults as fitters.</P>
    <P>The normal source of bricklayers is the apprenticeship system.  At the end of 1978 there were 932 apprentices, 120 in their fifth apprenticeship year, registered with AnCO.  AnCO provide first year off-the-job training for bricklaying apprentices in seven training centres which between them provide 120 training places.</P>
    <P>For industrial pipefitters and plumbers AnCO operate a conversion course in their Cabra training centre where suitable plumbers are training as industrial pipefitters.  There are 12 training places on this course.</P>
    <P>The normal source of plasterers is also the apprenticeship system.  At the end of 1978 there were 662 plastering apprentices, 95 in their fifth year of apprenticeship, registered with AnCO. AnCO provide first-year off-the-job training for plastering apprentices in five of their training centres which between them provide 72 training places.</P>
    <P>AnCO run courses in 12 training centres for production welders.  There are 382 places on these courses, which vary in length from 12 to 24 weeks.</P>
    <P>The clothing industry has, in the opinion of AnCO, adequate training facilities to meet its requirements for sewing machinists.  Additionally, AnCO runs courses for sewing machinists in four training centres, which between them provide 48 training places.  Annual throughput is in the region of 300. AnCO also use spare capacity in industry for the training of sewing machinists and there are currently 81 trainees being trained under this scheme.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the shortage of bricklayers is 400? As the number in their final year is 120 and, assuming normal retirements, it could be up to seven years before the shortage is eliminated.  How many bricklayers are in their first year apprenticeship? That would indicate how we are working.  In relation to industrial pipefitters the Minister indicated that there are 12 training places for such fitters <Col N="1654" /> and that the shortage is estimated at 150, an indication that it will be a long time before we can eliminate that shortage, assuming normal retirements.

I was made aware of that situation because of the research and survey carried out by the sub-committee of the Manpower Consultative Committee I referred to.  There are 150 apprentices in their fifth year of apprenticeship.  I should like to remind the Deputy that 932 apprentices are registered with AnCO at various stages of apprenticeship.

In the short term I hope shortly to embark on an intensive advertising campaign to attract emigrants back, if that is possible.  In the medium term I have arranged talks between the sub-committee of the Manpower Consultative Committee, the HEA and the NCA.  Within the next week or so I hope to chair a meeting between the Department of Education and the sub-committee. The reason for the meeting with the HEA, NCA and the Department of Education is to look at possible conversion courses in the medium term and increasing courses for such skills in the long term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of satisfaction with existing safety legislation in the sense that satisfaction implies not having to take any further action.  Legislating for safety standards and revising present standards are a continuous process in so far as the Department of Labour are concerned.  Safety laws emanating from the Department&mdash;be it primary or secondary legislation&mdash;are subject to review as a matter of course both in the light of practical experience of their operation and in the light of technological progress made since they were introduced.  Thus, in the case of primary legislation, such as the Factories Act of 1955, a Bill entitled the Safety in Industry Bill, 1978, has been brought forward to update that Act.  As regards secondary legislation, <Col N="1660" /> the wide powers for making regulations contained in the 1955 Act are used to set safety standards in a variety of operations and circumstances every year. Existing regulations are also amended, where necessary, on the advice of the industrial inspectorate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

In each centre the training programme is reviewed by local advisory committees which are representative of all interested parties&mdash;employers, trade unions and educational interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A central test and training audit section has been established in AnCO under which testing procedures are being introduced for all courses and relevant certificates issued.  The scheme is already in operation for a number of courses.  In addition, the range of courses conducted in the centres is reviewed periodically by AnCO internal groups, such as research and planning, curriculum development section, training advisory services together with an input from local IDA and local NMS offices and officials. Evaluation/appraisal studies have also been carried out in conjunction with the European Social Fund.  Finally, trainees <Col N="1662" /> are followed up in their industrial employment and the placement rates of all courses are continuously monitored.</P>
    <P>Courses organised in firms with spare training capacity, such as the ESB, CIE, the Sugar Company, Irish Ropes and Guinness, are also designed to meet specific identified needs and are subject in the same way to an ongoing evaluation and monitoring by AnCO.</P>
    <P>Formal training for the hotel and catering industry is largely conducted within the educational system and courses are in accordance with agreed curricula.  Trainees have to reach a standard of certification or diploma or degree level depending on the course being followed.  CERT are also concerned with the supervision of the particular industrial experience element of the courses which the trainees are subjected to in the actual industry.  In this connection CERT set minimum requirements under which this training takes place.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The resolution of disputes whether they be in the public or private sector is a matter, in the first instance, for the parties directly concerned. As I have emphasised many times in this House, it is important that all the agreed procedures be used to the full in order to achieve the settlement of disputes.  In situations where such procedures have been fully used and have proved incapable of resolving a dispute in areas of serious public concern, I would be prepared to consider any initiatives open to me to help settle the matter in dispute.</P>
      <P>As regards the postal dispute referred to by the Deputy, I am very concerned about the hardship and the difficulties for industry and the public arising from this dispute.  It is a matter of regret that the action being taken by the union concerned breaches both the conciliation and arbitration scheme&mdash;to which the union is a party&mdash;and also the national wage agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1664" /> The Government cannot condone action of this kind.  While the Government are anxious that a settlement should be reached as quickly as possible, a settlement will have to be one that, as well as being equitable, ensures the continued use of orderly means of resolving pay claims in the Civil Service.</P>

Would the Minister therefore agree to give the Labour Court that independence which it ought to have so that it can involve itself in bringing about settlements of disputes of this nature?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that services do exist.  As my colleague, the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, said in this House the essential point is that the Department are quite prepared to continue negotiations under agreed procedures at conciliation or, if the union wishes, the issue can be assessed by the independent arbitrator.</P>

      <P>It is a fact that the dispute is now continuing and causing great inconvenience to everybody.

      <P>I said in my reply that the action being taken by the union concerned breaches both the conciliation and arbitration schemes to which the union is a party; it also breaches the national wage agreement.  The Deputy must be aware of that.  The union had talks last week with the Congress of Trade Unions and the Deputy will appreciate the situation that arose on that occasion when they were actually told that they were in breach of the national wages agreement.</P>

I can give the Deputy some further information on strike numbers which relate to the three previous years.  I cannot, as I said in my reply, give him the statistics for the period immediately prior to 1978 but I will be able to do so in the future.  For example, in 1976 the total number of strikes in the private and public sectors was 199 of which 42 were public sector strikes; in 1977 the total was 232 of which 54 were public sector strikes; in 1978 the total figure was 170 of which 45 were public sector strikes.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for wage developments and related issues are shared by a number of Ministers.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous Ministers for Labour have been involved in developments relating to national wage agreements, as have all the relevant Ministers.  I can produce some evidence from 1976.  As I pointed out in my reply, it is a shared responsibility between quite a number of Ministers.  Understandably, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would also have a role to play.  On 5 July 1977, on the establishment of that new Department, the Taoiseach in the Dáil expounded on the functions envisaged for that Minister. Among other things the functions were to cover medium- and long-term economic and social policy and planning for the economy as a whole including sectoral and regional aspects, functions relating to public bodies and institutions with a role in economic planning and development and co-ordinating dialogue with the social partners.  It is a shared responsibility of government.  In our Government as compared with the previous Government it is very much a shared responsibility.  There was an admission in this House by Deputy O'Leary some time ago that that did not apply in the case of the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Dr. Fitzgerald Dr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what has been said by the Minister about the co-ordinating function of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and I am sure that is useful.  When it comes to dealing with matters of this kind, is the Minister aware that the experience of governments has been that it is better to have one person concerned with labour matters and dealing with these matters rather than having a number of economic Ministers involved? In our experience the allocation of clear responsibility to the Minister for Labour contributed to the success of our efforts in 1976 in achieving a national wage round.  Does not the Minister agree that it is a matter that is best handled by the Minister of his Department, which is the relevant one for this purpose?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy was <Col N="1670" /> a member of the previous Government I should like to quote a point made at that time in a letter by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.

Even then there was an acceptance by the previous Government of that shared responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter the Minister has quoted relates, from my memory, to the conduct of discussions of a tripartite nature that were proceeding at that time.  As the Minister knows from the rest of the file, other Ministers whose areas were concerned were called into meetings but the principle was adhered to during the period of the previous Government that one member of the Cabinet had responsibility both for reporting to the Cabinet and for the management of liaison between the social partners in such matters as those relating to the national wage agreement.</P>

Since taking office, I have held consistently to this policy.  At the same time, I have never ruled out the possibility that it might be desirable, in the public interest, to intervene in a situation where serious hardship was being caused to the community and where all the machinery available to the parties for settling the dispute had failed.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite certain what Deputy Mitchell has in mind by his reference to a &ldquo;national manpower study&rdquo;.  A number of studies in the general manpower area have taken place in recent years.  The most comprehensive of these was the OECD Examination of Manpower Policy in Ireland published in 1974, for which a background report was prepared by the National Manpower Service in 1972.  In the early 1970s also the Manpower Service was active in drawing up forecasts of worker supply and demand at various levels of skills and co-operated with the Department of Education in this area at that time.  Forecasting had to be dropped, however, when the usefulness of existing statistics especially the 1971 census figures, had been exhausted.</P>
      <P>Other studies on more limited aspects of manpower matters have also taken place in recent years.  For instance, the National Manpower Service have for many years carried out local labour availability surveys to establish the supply of workers in particular areas and in addition have carried out national surveys each year since 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have recently arranged, with the agreement of the Manpower Consultative Committee, that the Manpower Service resume forecasting of the labour market situation on the basis of information <Col N="1675" /> accumulated by the service themselves, by AnCO, the IDA, the educational authorities and by employer, industrial and trade union organisations and information acquired by the General Statistics Office by way of the labour market sample surveys carried out in 1975 and 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify the situation?  Is it a fact that the National Manpower Services had not itself got the national manpower study and therefore did not know what sort of skills it should be seeking or placing and, secondly, that the same information was not available to the IDA?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that there are two very strong contributing factors to that situation. One was the lack of recruitment to the National Manpower Service during the Coalition's term of office and the second was the lack of usefulness or exhaustion, as I said in the reply, of the statistical value of the 1971 Census seeing that there was no following census to replace it with relevant and necessary information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that one of the great needs in the job-creation effort is for proper manpower forecasting?  Could he tell us in more detail what exactly he has done to improve the situation and when, for instance, we might expect the manpower report?</P>

I have made those arrangements.</P>

I would envisage this exercise being a continuing one taking account of changing economic and labour market situations and that educational and training bodies would be consulted on the implications of the current and foreseen rapid expansion of industry and certain services.</P>

This curriculum is essentially an integrated entity involving the linguistic, mathematical and artistic organisation of the child's knowledge and experience. Teachers are encouraged to select the programmes most suitable for each school and it is emphasised that the child's own environment is a relevant consideration when this selection is being made.  The curriculum handbook made available to all teachers provides detailed guidelines as to the way in which these objectives may be realised.</P>

I am not convinced that any form of aggressive statement will help in the situation.  I am still hoping for the co-operation of the teachers.  This year, for the first time, I have introduced the payment of substitutes for the teachers concerned in the examination.  In addition I have increased all the fees substantially. These include travel, subsistence and the actual examination fees and I have asked the union concerned if they would submit the matter to immediate arbitration, not to any long-finger type arbitration. I have undertaken to accept the findings of the arbitrator beforehand.  As the Deputies who have asked the questions are acting in the interest of the students, I think the best course for us to adopt is to be as low-key as possible and to strive for the co-operation of the teachers.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time I was remarking that it is an easy matter for people to march by way of protest but as Members of this House we have the responsibility of putting forward constructive suggestions regarding the bringing about of a more equitable form of taxation.  In this regard I was suggesting that, perhaps, members of the various professions are not contributing their fair share of income tax. In these circumstances we must consider ways of ensuring that this situation is rectified and to this extent I was suggesting a system whereby people availing of the services of these professional people would obtain receipts and that these receipts in turn could be used for purposes of the assessment of income tax by the Revenue Commissioners.  In this way we would be devising a system that would benefit the taxpayers generally. I am aware that a system on those lines operates elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Regarding the march arranged for Tuesday next we might ask what it is hoped to achieve by this form of protest. Inevitably the people who are hurt most in situations of strike or confrontations are the ordinary citizens.  People in Government, in charge of trade unions or of farming organisations must think of the man and woman, the boy and girl and how it affects their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While second and third level education, in principle, are free for all, many parents find it increasingly difficult to keep their children at school.  It is a strain on the family income and we must give them some financial help if our young people are to be educated. Parents should be allowed to claim a tax <Col N="1685" /> concession on expenditure in this area. In many cases parents with children in university have to pay the cost of keeping their children in flats, digs and so on. I ask the Minister to give urgent attention to introducing tax concessions in this area.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to another shortcoming in the taxation regulations, one that has been aired many times in the past and is now more relevant than ever.  Thousands of workers are obliged to use their own transport to and from work because our public transport service is not as good as the public transport systems in other countries.  In Navan the direct rail service was closed down in the early fifties, and now thousands of commuters who would normally use the railway line are obliged to drive to and from Dublin and elsewhere. Because of the heavy traffic between Navan and Dublin I want to ask the Minister for Transport and Tourism to instruct CIE to introduce daily rail services between Navan and Drogheda to link up with the service to Dublin.  If it were introduced it would not only mean fewer motorists on the road; it would mean less traffic congestion in Dublin and a cutback in petrol consumption. There are many other towns within commuting distance of Dublin where traffic could be diverted to the railways if a satisfactory service were provided.</P>
    <P>One immediately thinks of the brilliant undergound transport system in London.  Most commuters use that system and do not have to use their own cars to travel to work.  This is relevant especially in view of the Private Member's Motion taken yesterday on the traffic in Dublin city and CIE's rapid rail plan which has received favourable comment and which it is intended to implement one day.  Until such transport is available, the Minister for Finance of the day should look at the feasibility of giving tax concession to the people who must use private transport to get to and from their jobs.</P>
    <P>I now want to draw attention to the problems many industries are experiencing in getting their employees to work overtime.  Many workers are not keen to do overtime because of the high rate of <Col N="1686" /> taxation deducted from their wage packets.  The present system of taxation tends to kill incentive and reduce productivity.  The Minister should alleviate the taxation burden on these people to make overtime more attractive.</P>
    <P>I will now venture into an area which is of interest to my constituency, that is, the furnishing industry.  The Irish Goods Council have recognised that furniture and carpets are manufactures in which the Irish producers are under great pressure from imports.  Most of the major promotions of Irish products by the council have included these two categories.  One hundred and seventeen furniture manufacturers and nine carpet manufacturers are participating in the council's Guaranteed Irish scheme.  It is the function of the council to convince Irish people that it is in their interests to support Irish industry and that the urgency is greatest where competition from imports is heaviest.  This is not to say that the only way to improve the position of Irish industry is to persuade the Irish people to buy Irish.  Irish manufacturers must improve their positions and sharpen their competitiveness by engaging more and more in exports.</P>
    <P>The position in the domestic furniture market is that it has increased by 150 per cent in value terms in recent years. In 1978, it stood at £51 million, but the bulk of the increase came from imports. While Irish exports have also increased substantially, the need exists to stimulate the industry in order to improve its potential in the home and export markets.  In order to exploit the sizeable market opportunities arising at home and abroad, it is essential to concentrate on improved design and marketing and to pay particular attention to the specialised demands of the consumer where necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt about the extent of the opportunity for expanded sales which exists in the furniture sector.  Annual per capita expenditure on furniture here is £7.29 in the <Col N="1687" /> United Kingdom the figure is £15.39.  It is much higher in the continental markets, reaching £36 in Germany and over £46 in Denmark.  We have a lot of leeway to make up in that area.</P>
      <P>Irish participation at the London Furniture Show a few months ago saw the first official Irish representation at a UK furniture exhibition since 1971 and sales in excess of £300,000 were reported.  Indications were that attention to quality finish and marketing will enable Irish manufacturers to achieve increased sales in the competitive UK market.  We must improve in this field.  There has been a slight reduction in the numbers employed in this industry and between 1973 and 1978 the figure fell from 4,000 to 3,500.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy should thoroughly investigate this industry, particularly in regard to the amount of imports. It is well to remind the Minister for Finance and the Government that our furniture manufacturers are competing at a disadvantage because VAT on furniture in this country is 20 per cent, while it is only 9 per cent in the UK.  Furniture manufacturers and their employees cannot understand why a chair, a table or a bed should be regarded as a luxury.</P>

      <P>The carpet industry is also important to Navan and other towns.  It has an annual turnover of £48 million and current employment stands at about 2,500 people.  Approximately 75 per cent of output is exported, mainly to the UK.  Industry in the UK had been in recession to 1978 and this had repercussions for Irish industry.  There has since been a pick-up in the UK market and this has helped our industry. Prospects for the Irish carpet industry are now better than they have been for many years.  This is symptomatic of the progressive and dynamic Government we have enjoyed for almost two years.  It is not by accident that when Fianna Fáil are in office the building industry does well and because of that the furniture industry <Col N="1688" /> also does well, resulting in more people being employed.</P>
      <P>This is a socially-minded and generous budget which the Irish taxpayer will yet appreciate.  It is a tremendous stimulus to the creation of a better climate for private enterprise, greater productivity and greater optimism for a brighter future.  If we keep the welfare of the people at heart during negotiations between the Government, trade unions and other organisations we will create a brighter 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard Fianna Fáil Deputies making that kind of speech many times during the last 25 years: &ldquo;Wrap the green flag round me, boys, and vote Fianna Fáil and everything in the country will be marvellous. There will be a great increase in productivity and employment.&rdquo;  In other words, it is patriotic in their view to vote for Fianna Fáil.  I cast that assertion aside and say there are men of great standing, ability, energy and other qualities on all sides of the House.  This is a democratic political assembly elected by the people and that should not suggest that there is not ability or effort or absolute attention to detail on this side of the House also.</P>
      <P>During his budget speech the Minister dwelt on the fact that this is a budget of strategy whereby more people will be employed, there will be less inflation, our balance of payments position will improve and so on.  I would condemn it as a budget of no strategy.  The previous budget contained the strategy of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and tax was removed from cars and rates from houses.  To a teacher, civil servant, local government official or an executive in industry living in a semi-detached house and owning a modest car, these measures were worth about £400, depending on the rates payable on the house.  We had gone through the oil crisis and had brought the ship of State safely through and that man had to bear the brunt of our difficulties.  We tried to be fair to everybody.  To him that £400 represented his continental holiday, more carpets for the house or the wiping out of his bank overdraft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> Fianna Fáil did not pay the cost of taking tax off cars or rates from domestic houses.  The people have to pay and the chickens are coming home to roost.  Fianna Fáil were exceedingly lucky because in the succeeding year, largely due to the work of the Coalition Government, the inflation rate was down to 7 per cent.  We had created that situation and it was not affected by Fianna Fáil pump-priming the economy, as they call it.  All they did was increase consumption spending and that did not in any way reduce inflation.  If anything, it would be disposed to increase inflation slightly.  They had the wind in their sails and they had a low inflation rate of 7 per cent.  According to the Minister for Finance, the real increase in earnings was 16 per cent, that people were 8 per cent or 9 per cent better off.  Whether he is right or wrong I do not know.  I merely wish to tell the House that Fianna Fáil were lucky that the inflation rate did not rise spectacularly during their first year in office.  Having had an extremely favourable year in 1978 they should have been able to produce a budget of strategy.</P>
    <P>We saw how hard-pressed they were for money by the undignified manner in which they rushed to join the EMS.  By rushing into the EMS they threw away their bargaining power.  When they were offered membership of the EMS they rushed in and left themselves in the position of buying a pig in a poke.  The other nations bargained, even the rich French, while we ordered champagne to celebrate our decision.  Fianna Fáil rushed in because their profligate budget of the previous year had created a diabolical shortage of money.  All Fianna Fáil were talking about was how much they were going to get.  They rushed in because they hoped to get £79 million this year.  They have a good chance of getting something during this financial year but it will be less than we would have got if we had not thrown away our bargaining power.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about jobs in the public sector.  I am in favour of employing more teachers, more gardai and more Army personnel to look after our security situation.  I am proud of the fact <Col N="1690" /> that, as Minister for Defence, I increased the number of Army personnel from 8,700 to more than 15,000.  I am sorry to say that this Government have allowed the number to decrease.  They should remember that, before a man patrols the streets or guards a Border area, 5,000 must be written off.  When each man is given an eight-hour day in a five-day week, one realises how necessary it is for the Garda to have a backup service from the Army.  Fianna Fáil have economised on the Army and I believe that that trend will continue.</P>
    <P>We are getting only 1,250 teachers and about 3,000 civil servants.  The use of modern office methods in the public service would mean a great deal more efficiency. It would also mean that we would have need of fewer civil servants or that we could continue with the same number.  In their manifesto Fianna Fáil stated that we must get this, that and the other and they are still prepared to buy these things with the people's money. The budget shows that the Government are still trying to hold on to office by buying their way through.</P>

      <P>I am not trying to claim credit for anything.  I am trying to show that Fianna Fáil have failed.</P>
      <P>I have heard the Minister for Finance make great play of the increases in personal allowances.  These increases must be considered in the context of the 7 per cent increase in inflation.  Many things which everybody uses are not on the CPI.  If a married woman whose husband has a good job goes to work she will have to pay 45p in the £.  On a wage of £55 her tax-free allowance will be in the region of £5.75 and her take-home pay will be less than £30.  Let us consider the case of a young girl who starts work in an office after doing her leaving certificate examination at a wage of £30 or £40.  If she is a reasonable girl she will give her parents money towards her keep.  If she lives in a flat she must pay rent.  After tax, her take home pay is small and she must find it difficult to manage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1691" /> I believe that the next financial political move will be the substitution of a large amount of PAYE tax for indirect taxation.  That will happen because people will not take what is being dished out to them.  It will be the next move.  Fianna Fáil always think of the next election.  It used to be said that a statesman thought of the next generation and a politician thought of the next election.  In Fianna Fáil's political bible there are three priorities.  Fianna Fáil is No. 1.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  No. 1 is Fianna Fáil.  No. 2 is a sort of photo-finish between God and the Government, but the first thing is Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil must get back into office at the next election. That is why they get back: that is their philosophy and that is why they do things that are quite wrong for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to these personal allowances, they are ridiculously low and are pressing extremely hard on a decent section of society who are now rightly turning on the Government.  One facet of this which should be exposed as a failure is that this seems to have come up as a confrontation between the farmers and PAYE payers.  There are 765,000 PAYE payers in the public and private sectors. I do not know what others there are; there may be a few in some other sectors which I cannot think of, but the budget speech gave that figure.  They are paid consumption money or savings.  As far as the theory of taxation is concerned, the PAYE payer collects £100 or £120 at the end of the week, takes it home and it is consumed in the support of his wife, his family, his house, himself or whatever it is, and then if he can save money and wishes to do so, he saves. When he saves £5,000 or £10,000, he puts it into a little business and decides that he will do capital expenditure on that business.  He then can claim an initial allowance against tax and may perhaps pay no tax for years as he builds up his business because each year he is <Col N="1692" /> paying capital expenditure, setting his initial allowances the following year against tax and he pays no tax on that operation.</P>
    <P>To the farmer who collects his £100 or £120 that is not entirely consumption or saving money.  If he wishes to increase that to, say, £140 the following year or to maintain the standard of his farm he must do capital expenditure.  Therefore, when one compares the tax paid by farmers with the tax paid by PAYE payers, as was done <i>ad nauseam</i> by the Minister for Finance in his budget statement, one is being completely politically dishonest.  There is no comparison here. The comparison should be between the farmer and the self-employed.  If the owner of a little garage makes £5,000 and buys a new lift for raising the cars, a new compressor or any other article, he charges the cost of that against his tax and probably pays no tax.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance compares 765,000 unfortunate, crucified people, paying through the nose, with 180,000 farmers he is making a totally false, misleading and deliberately politically dishonest statement.  There is no comparison one with the other.</P>

      <P>Sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I also deliberately included the word &ldquo;political&rdquo;.  However, if I am on the wrong side of the rule, which I question, I will withdraw the words.  We are dealing on the one hand with consumption and saving money and on the other hand we are dealing with investment money.  Taking 180,000 farmers as against 765,000 PAYE payers, you then reach the stage of querying how many of those 180,000 farmers are solely farmers.  How many of them are doing jobs which make them PAYE payers also?  How many of them are on the dole or have been put off the dole?  What has that budget done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in my clinic a fortnight ago when a decent man came into me and said that he was farming 15 acres, he had a wife and two children and was <Col N="1693" /> drawing £15 dole money.  Now he finds his valuation exactly 50p over the new limit and that means that the £15 is gone.  He cannot support his wife, rear his two children and farm without that £15.  He asked me to contact the county engineer to find out if he could get a job as a quarry-man at a quarry which will be opened in the summer because that is the only kind of work he can do. That is what the budget did to people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in a very good area.  However, I want to proceed.  It would be a tragedy for this country if Fianna Fáil were to find that the PAYE payers had taken a dislike to farmers and that the farmers had taken a similar <Col N="1694" /> dislike to the PAYE payers.  Both have their problems and both need a fair and proper system of taxation.  Everybody knows that the farmer must pay his fair share of tax.  That is not what the Minister for Finance said nor is it what the Taoiseach said.  They have said time and time again that by 1 May they want as much money through another system of taxation as they would have got out of the 2 per cent levy.</P>
      <P>I have already said that our disgracefully inept and hurried entry into the EMS showed how badly off we were for money.  Now let us think of this equally disgracefully sad and inefficient approach of putting on the 2 per cent levy.  They included pigs under this levy. What are the facts in relation to pigs?  At present a pig ready for slaughter is worth between £55 and £60.  Taking into consideration feeding and the general cost of production, the man who would have that pig for sale&mdash;or maybe a hundred pigs&mdash;would be very happy with about £1.50 average profit per pig during the year.  It would be an excellent profit, and if he could fatten his pigs off in three months he could do almost four turnovers in the year.  Therefore, if he had 100 pigs and turned them over four times his profit would be £6 per pig and he would be quite happy with that.  If he had 1,000 pigs he would be all right. What is £1.50 worth approximately? The Agricultural Institute would tell the Deputy opposite, if he asked them, that it would be a very satisfactory average profit and 2 per cent would have wiped it out.  The pig industry here is very important.</P>
      <P>The Government sat for six months on the budget as we all do, week after week, and as I did myself during the four years we were in office.  It was unworkable and within days they had to slice £4 million from the £16 million&mdash;another example of how inept and inefficient they are.  In his opening statement the Minister for Finance used the word &ldquo;strategy&rdquo;.  This budget does not have strategy.  It has pandemonium. Now they are hoping for EMS money to carry them over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was in the Cotswolds recently and all the capital expenditure on the farms <Col N="1695" /> there has been done 40 or 45 years ago. Now they are re-adapting and it is in that direction that their money is being spent.  Here, we have still got to clean drains.  In the last few months our farmers have begun to see a fair income. What they most need is money put into improvement.  And this is the time Fianna Fáil chose to impose the 2 per cent levy.  What would the Government have done with the money so realised? Farmers were trying to improve their standards of life but, taking me as an instance, what I would have been able to do for myself, and my family in years to come, would have been completely negatived by the levy.  The money I would have had to pay for a new silage unit would not have been there.</P>
    <P>In his budget the Minister for Finance, instead of giving us strategy, spoke a lot of ga-ga.  For instance, when we were in Government I used the veto in the EEC Commission five times in seven hours.  Since Fianna Fáil came back it has not been used once.  I will point out once more what they did in the budget as far as agriculture is concerned. They substracted £6 million from the brucellosis eradication scheme, which the farmers will now have to pay.  They reduced the lime transport subsidy by £2.3 million, which the farmers now have to pay&mdash;three months ago I paid £3.80 per ton and the other day my neighbour was quoted £5.80.</P>
    <P>We must also consider the milk and butter subsidies, the removal of which have cost the housewife a lot of money. This was done at a time when the Government refused in the EEC to apply Ireland's veto against importation from New Zealand of £9 million of dairy produce.  Why did the Minister for Agriculture not impose the veto?  This is another example of how inept they are.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the last item on the Estimate for Agriculture.  The sum for appropriations-in-aid has been increased by £10 million, still more money to be collected from the farmers to be added to the £6 million which they now must pay towards burcellosis eradication.  It is frightening.  I will not say a word against the Department of Agriculture, but in <Col N="1696" /> last week's <i>Farmers Journal</i> we had a statement that many herds have been left out of calculations in regard to brucellosis eradication.</P>
    <P>This budget is not a strategy.  It is nothing but a plan to pay for Fianna Fáil's next general election campaign. For instance, reverting to the Agriculture Estimate, the amount for environmental improvement and in respect of dangerous places has been decreased by £1½ million.  Then we must look at the limits placed on local authority budgets following the removal of rates on domestic houses.  In the first year they were allowed to increase their budget by 11 per cent but that has been reduced to 10 per cent at a time when our main arterial roads are plainly inadequate, incapable of taking the increased number of cars now being used.  When they were producing their manifesto, it is apparent that Fianna Fáil never considered the possibility of increased prices for tarmacadam.</P>

      <P>This is another example of the irresponsibility on that side. Let us take relief on interest payments. On a sum of £2,000, in the past year there has been an increase of £400 and I suggest this is something the Minister for Finance must deal with in the Finance Bill.  I am afraid that in future all budgets will be suspect because when the Minister for Finance stands to read his statement Deputies will wonder which tax will stand and which tax will be removed, like the 2 per cent farmers' levy this year.  Of course, that was removed because of its impracticality. This Government have proved themselves incapable of producing a budget.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made certain statements this year at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis which were denied on Radio Éireann the following Sunday by the Minister for Finance.  Anybody who looks at the newspapers will find that I am correct.  When I was in Government I remember figures coming down from the Department of Finance which I knew to be wrong.  I pointed this out and the moguls in the Department discovered they were wrong and changed them.  The same thing happened in regard to the Taoiseach's Ard Fhéis statement: the figures he gave had to be corrected by the Minister for Finance the following Sunday.</P>

The situation is so bad in relation to farmers' taxation that one wonders if it is possible to get a budget that cannot be <Col N="1698" /> refuted.  I have the greatest sympathy for the Taoiseach.

      <P>I did not have privilege of being here for 25 years as had the last speaker.  It is amazing how the Deputy has survived.  Deputy Donegan is unique in many ways.  A lot of his friends hit the dust in 1977 but he showed that he is a very astute politician to have survived the wrath of the electorate in 1977.  Of course, Deputy Donegan is not a professor, he is a man of the people, as he has proved on more than one occasion. Many people talked of the Coalition Government as a Government of professors. They dealt effectively with them in June 1977.  Many of them have returned to their academic studies to promote their personal interests until another opportunity arises.  However, the political parties seemed to have learned their lesson in relation to entrusting the care of their politics to this kind of gentleman. That cannot be said of Deputy Donegan, he has survived to fight another day.</P>
      <P>I take issue with Deputy Donegan about his opening remarks when he talked about Fianna Fáil &ldquo;wrapping the green flag around me, boys, and everything would be all right.&rdquo;  We on this side of the House are proud to be wrapped in the green flag of republicanism.  We have a wonderful tradition that we are not ashamed of in that regard.  In fact, we have been charged with responsibility, since the foundation of the State, for safeguarding the national heritage on more than one occasion.  When it comes to true republicanism the Deputy must bend the knee to this side of the House and if that means wrapping the green flag around me, the Deputy can certainly bury me in it.</P>

On a few <Col N="1701" /> occasions in the recent past they left a lot to be desired so far as leadership is concerned.  I will deal with that later.</P>
      <P>I am glad the previous speaker accepted the fact&mdash;although many people on his front bench would not concur&mdash;that 1978 was a favourable year for the Irish people.  I am grateful to Deputy Donegan for that little morsel. The Fianna Fáil strategy is to continue to have a favourable effect on the Irish economy.  It is important that the Irish people understand Deputy Donegan was speaking with his tongue in his cheek when he suggested Fianna Fáil led the Irish people hastily into the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>His leader does not quite agree with that statement.  In a recent television programme he was interviewed about a document initiated by the Fine Gael Party and dealing with a possible confederation for the Irish people. He said on two distinct and separate occasions that one of the reasons why our separated brethren in the North might like to look southwards was the dynamism of the Irish economy.  Deputy Donegan will have to agree that, during the lean four years when the National Coalition were in office, there was no dynamism in the economy.  Therefore, the leader of the Fine Gael Party was referring to the Government which replaced the National Coalition, namely the Fianna Fáil Government, my friends on the front bench.</P>
      <P>In effect Deputy FitzGerald was saying the Fianna Fáil Government had done a good job in 1977.  Deputy Donegan has already agreed 1978 was a good year.  When pressed rather hard on that occasion Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the EMS and the astounding statement emanated from his lips that Ireland has the political courage, the economic courage and the economic dynamism to warrant joining the EMS.  He suggested that because the British were tardy in considering joining the EMS, and because of the strength which the Irish economy, was showing the people of the North might further consider joining in a confederation, as if confederation was something new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> I can remember a much greater and much more revered leader expressing views on that matter, the late Uachtarán na hÉireann, Eamon de Valera, the founder of this Party.  For so long, all the good ideas have come from our side. Now 20 to 30 years later, people pick up the record and come up with a hotchpotch of what was a genuine idea.  They are trying to regain the votes they lost in 1977.  It is a waste of time and effort as Deputy Donegan knows.</P>
    <P>In 1977 we had a strong economy. In 1978 we had political and economic stability.  A continuation of that strategy is reflected in this year's budget.  Given a fair chance to work, it augurs well for continued growth in the economy over the next few years.  People on the other side of the House talk about the Fianna Fáil bible and suggest that Fianna Fáil interest lies in one direction.  Politics is all about staying in power and convincing the people that yours is the right party to lead the country in the future.  If that is a slight on Fianna Fáil, so be it.  If I were to ask the only Opposition Deputy remaining in the House whether his interest lies mainly in returning to this House, I am sure he would give me an honest reply.  I am sure he would say that, if they had their way, they would hive off the boys on their left.  At least then we could have a Fianna Fáil Government and a pseudo-socialist opposition. I use the words &ldquo;pseudo socialist&rdquo; because I am not too taken by Crombie-clad socialists.  You get a lot of that kind of thing in a small country like this.  When it came to progressive socialism and socialist policies which could be applied in our situation, Fianna Fáil were always the party to deliver.</P>
    <P>I was here this morning when Deputy Barry Desmond was speaking.  He has an amazing facility for saying things which might have some substance in them.  He made a global statement about Dublin.  He said Dublin was choking itself to death.  I take it he meant it was very difficult to get from point A to point B without frustration and delay leading to depression and a lack of effort to conserve energy and a whole host of attendant problems.  I agree the traffic <Col N="1703" /> congestion is intolerable, and something will have to be done about it.  There are all kinds of hare-brained schemes such as concreting over the river Liffey, flyovers, electrified railways and so on. There might be another way which has been overlooked.  Would it be too farfetched to suggest the time has come to relocate the capital city of Ireland?  They used to say: &ldquo;Go west, young man&rdquo;.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Farm Retirement Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am raising this matter because it is of concern to many people who, in good faith and on the urging of all the official agencies, including the Minister of the day, entered into the farm retirement scheme.  Under this scheme, farmers who had less than 45 acres and who wished to give up farming were able to dispose of their land by selling <Col N="1704" /> or letting provided it was to an eligible person such as a development farmer.  Although they did not get the full market value of their land, they were allowed to keep the sale price and were paid an annuity for the rest of their lives. In view of the fact that they could only dispose of the land to a limited category of people, in most cases they disposed of it to the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>The impression was given that this annuity would keep up with the cost of living and with the requirements these people would have to meet in terms of expenditure. I put down a number of questions about this and I received the following information.  Since this scheme was introduced in May 1974 the rates of annuity have increased by only 66 per cent.  At the same time, the rates of old age pension, payable to other people in the same age category, have increased by between 86 and 89 per cent.  If one includes the increase in the current budget the rates have increased almost 100 per cent.  The people who entered into the farm retirement scheme, thereby ensuring that land would be available to younger farmers who needed it, did so with a clear understanding from the Government that their pensions would keep in line with other pensions.  The Government are breaking faith with these people if they do not do so.  I have demonstrated that the pensions for people under the retirement scheme have fallen 40 per cent behind pensions given to old age pensioners.  Everybody knows how inadequate the ordinary old age pension is.  How much more so must the pension of people under this scheme be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give figures which will indicate how miserable the increase of 66 per cent is in the annuities since May 1974. In the same period, that is, up to June 1978, industrial earnings went up by 135 per cent, which is more than twice as much as the annuities these people are getting.  The industrial earnings went up because people had to meet increased costs.  Those under the retirement scheme had to meet exactly the same costs, yet they got an increase of only 66 per cent.  The annuity which is paid to these people is £996 a year for a married couple.  How could anyone live on that <Col N="1705" /> sum in this day and age?  If the annuity which started off at £600 had kept pace with industrial earnings it would now be £1,410 a year for a married couple.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture in reply to a question which I asked on 7 March stated at column 916 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>I agree it is necessary to increase the annuities and an undertaking has been given by the government that they will be increased in line with the Consumer Price Index.  This had been accepted by the previous Government and that undertaking has been honoured by the present Government.</P>
    <P>To date, that undertaking has not been honoured by the Government.  The Consumer Price Index up to November 1978, the latest date for which I have figures, increased by 83 per cent whereas the pensions to people under the farm retirement scheme have increased by only 66 per cent.  If the annuity had kept pace with the cost of living it would be at least £1,098 a year.  The Government increased it by only half as much as the average industrial earnings.</P>
    <P>These people are being treated very unfairly.  Successive Governments miserliness in relation to this scheme is seen by the number of people applying for it. In 1974 1,055 people applied.  At that time it was presented as an attractive scheme.  In 1975 the figure had dropped to 392.  By 1977 it had dropped to 106 and last year only 82 people applied. People are being turned off this scheme. They are not interested in it, and why should they be if the annuity is not only increasing by less than half as much as industrial earnings but is even less than the cost of living despite the Government's undertaking that it would be kept in line?  When I asked the Minister of State for an undertaking that a realistic increase would be given, he said that the scheme as a whole was being reviewed by the EEC and suggested, by implication, that it would not be possible for the Government to increase the annuities without the approval of the EEC. Otherwise, there would be no point in making a reference to the EEC review.</P>
    <P>The Government are free to increase <Col N="1706" /> the annuities by as much as they wish; they do not need EEC permission.  The fact that a review of the scheme is taking place at EEC level, in so far as the Government's freedom to improve rates of annuity is concerned, is irrelevant. There was no reason for the Minister of State to refer to the review because it does not affect the Government's freedom to grant an increase in line with other increases in incomes or in line with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>In seeking to hide behind the review that is taking place in Brussels the Government were hiding behind something that had nothing to do with increases in annuities.  I hope the Minister will give a definite answer about the rate that will apply to the annuities this year.  I hope an increase is given to keep those annuities in line with other incomes in the community.  If it is just to give an industrial worker an increase of 135 per cent since 1974 then it is just to give an equivalent increase to those involved in this scheme.</P>
    <P>Increases in the voluntary retirement scheme should be announced by the Minister for Finance annually in his budget and take effect as a budgetary matter.  I cannot see any reason why increases in old age pensions should take place in a budget&mdash;such increases were in the region of 100 per cent since May 1974&mdash;and increases in annuities are ignored. The increases in annuities since 1974 has been 66 per cent.  It appears that it is left to the Minister for Agriculture, who, presumably, cannot get money to grant such an improvement, to grant an increase this year.  It should be remembered that the people involved are old and are not able to look after themselves adequately but they deserve the best from the community because they have voluntarily given up their land to have it developed for agricultural purposes.  They should be getting a reasonable income and any Government which fails to do that is failing in their duty.  Apart from that general case the Government should ensure, as a matter of policy, that the allowances are reviewed annually in the budget and not left to be dealt with when it suits the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any serious dispute on the general question of the effectiveness of the retirement scheme.  We would all like to see it working better and I expect that there will be further discussions on the subject of improving Directive 160 at the forthcoming price review.  It is necessary to get improvements in order to procure greater mobility of land on a voluntary basis, especially in the case of smaller holdings. Regard should be had at all times for the exercise by the farmer of a free choice in this matter.  When one discusses land mobility and the ease with which land might be acquired and disposed of normally one hears people speaking about it who do not have any knowledge of farming or of the attachment of such people to the land, regardless of their economic circumstances and the likelihood that they will tend to hold on to their land even if it means a drop in their incomes.</P>
      <P>The scheme has not been effective.  It has been in operation since May 1974, having been introduced by the Coalition Government.  There was a commitment then to take account of the consumer price index, exclusive of tax increases, when changing the annuity.  We were surprised that in 1975 there was no increase and that in 1976, when there was a 36 per cent increase in the consumer price index, there was a 33 per cent increase for married and single people. The following year, when there was a 17 per cent increase in the CPI, there was an increase of 14 per cent in the case of single beneficiaries and of 15 per cent in the case of married people.  That fell short of the percentage increase in the CPI.  In 1978 there was an 8 per cent increase in the CPI, a 9 per cent increase in the payment to single people and an 8 per cent increase to married people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that in order to crow because there is nothing to crow about, but I want to highlight the failure of our predecessors to line up to their commitment to keep pace with the CPI, exclusive of tax.  It is our commitment to keep pace, with tax increases included. We are doing a great deal better than our predecessors with a scheme which is <Col N="1708" /> in many ways inadequate.  Deputy Bruton said that what is decided by the Council of Agriculture Ministers in relation to improvements in the scheme was not relevant but my view is that it is.  It is important for the Government to relate their actions closely to the current situation and the situation that may arise in the foreseeable future in the scheme.  I have always expressed the view at Council meetings that this scheme, which has palpably fallen short of its aspirations, should be strengthened if possible.  In our context it is not easy for any Government, or Department, to be as flaithiúilach as an Opposition.  Opposition speakers always want large increases for industrial workers, for those in the public service and social welfare recipients but, at the same time, want dramatic reductions in taxes.  They should know from their experience in Government that that is not possible. They should know also that it is like the policeman's lot, the unhappy lot of Government in office whoever they may be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to distribute the available funds as fairly as can be and to meet the requirements of the different Departments as fairly as they can be met.  Why is it particularly under the Department of Agriculture?  Because it is an agricultural scheme operated by FEOGA.  That is why it is a scheme related to agricultural structures.  There is no other Department to which it would be proper.</P>

      <P>Social Welfare pensions, with due respect to the Deputy, are a different matter.  They are paid to some people who might be in the general care of the Department of Health or the Department of Social Welfare and are dealing with a different thing&mdash;a human condition.  The farm retirement scheme is dealing with people, yes, the owners of <Col N="1709" /> the land, but also with the land itself.  It is worth remembering that the recipients of these annuities also have what they are perfectly entitled to get, the cash value of their holdings; that is, as an addition to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as well to look at all the picture, even bits one may not wish to see and this is one of the bits. The economic security of a retiring couple is strengthened considerably by the value of the land with which they have just parted under the farm retirement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bruton.  I should like to see improvements in this scheme. Every Deputy, regardless of his party, would like to see payments made to people of this kind and being as beneficial to them as possible without injuring the wellbeing of others.  I am not so sure that we cannot do a great deal better.  Actually at present the allowances that were changed last year are under review and will be changed again.  In the last few <Col N="1710" /> years they were changed on 1 May.  I would anticipate that there will be changes made on that date again, taking into account the consumer price index and the taxes as well which were ignored up to 1977.</P>

      <P>The Baldoyle area is served by the existing <Col N="1683" /> health centre at Willie Nolan Road, Baldoyle, which provides an extensive range of community care services, including medical, public health nursing, community welfare and chiropody services.  A new dental unit at the centre was completed last year and is now operational.  A number of internal improvements, including decoration, have been carried out.  The Eastern Health Board are satisfied that the centre is adequate to serve the existing needs of the area.</P>
      <P>There is not at present any health centre in the Portmarnock area, but the health board provide clinics in a room of a local school which has been made available to the board.  The board are urgently seeking a site in the area for the provision of a health centre.</P>
