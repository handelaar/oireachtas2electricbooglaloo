It will have to be confirmed by legislation if it is to remain longer than a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party put down a motion to be taken in Private Members' Time asking the Government not to impose this most unjust form of taxation on any section of the community. The Chair notified us yesterday that it was not allowed as the matter could be debated in the budget.  We accepted that ruling because at that time we understood that the vehicle used to give it legislative effect would be the Finance Bill.  We now find that, in order to avoid political embarrassment, the Taoiseach and the Government are trying to use a parliamentary device which would not allow this House to take effective action against the imposition of this unjust tax for 12 months.  In view of this evasive action for a full discussion in the House and an opportunity of trying to avoid the imposition of this iniquitous tax, and in view of what the Taoiseach said, I would ask you to reconsider your ruling as regards our motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair ruled against the repetition of a debate which is currently taking place.  It is perfectly clear and unambiguous that, according to standing orders, we cannot have a separate debate on a matter which is already being debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it for granted that when you made that ruling you were under the same impression as everyone else in the House&mdash;that the Government and the Taoiseach would not seek to avoid their responsibility with regard to the imposition of this tax and that we would have an opportunity of discussing it, voting against it and registering our protest against that type of taxation which is totally unjust and contrary to all ideas of social justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>When we submitted the motion it was our intention, and we expressed our intention, to take it in Private Members' Time.  When you communicated with us yesterday that you would not allow it in Private Members' <Col N="1596" /> Time, the reason you gave was that we would have an opportunity of discussing it under the Finance Bill and would have an opportunity in the more or less immediate future of voting against that form of taxation.  In view of the action of the Taoiseach and the Government in trying to deprive this House of an opportunity of discussing this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the 15 per cent excise duty put on petrol four years ago.  Is it not true that at that stage the Government of the day clearly introduced it under the Act quoted by the Taoiseach?  It is not clear under what guise the 2 per cent farm levy is introduced under that Act.  Is it not also true that the Government of the day provided Government time to debate that order before it came into effect?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a cheap ploy by a Government with a majority of 20 to prevent the most important measure to come before the House, as all rural Deputies will tell the Taoiseach, being debated in the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly not being debated by the agricultural Members of the Fianna Fáil Party because no Deputy from a rural constituency has spoken.  Every Deputy from that side who has spoken was from Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like those unfounded and unwarranted charges being let go without some answer.  Deputy <Col N="1598" /> Cluskey just throws those charges around like confetti.

      <P>There is provision in this Bill that any person earning over £5,000 a year, though the Minister has power to amend that figure, would pay £50 and anyone earning less than £5,000 would pay 1 per cent.  By virtue of this amendment, which arrived this morning and <Col N="1604" /> which has not been referred to in any previous discussions on the Bill, the Minister now proposes to raise a separate levy on separate income earners if both husband and wife are earning.  Surely this is imposing additional taxation upon a couple who are both in employment.  It would seem to be a progression of the campaign by the Minister for Finance against well-heeled and articulate women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was always intended that a man and a wife would be treated separately in this context and I made this clear at the outset.  The Bill as drafted did not make that specifically clear and I want to do so now.  I made it clear that a man and a wife with separate incomes would be separately liable for health contributions and separately eligible for benefits.  The whole philosophy of this legislation is that one pays a contribution and that is related to eligibility.  It was the intention from the outset that a man and a wife with separate incomes would be liable for separate contributions and eligible for services in their own right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does this mean that a husband and wife each earning £5,600 must both pay?  Who pays for the children?  Shall we attach the benefits of the male children to the father and the benefits of the female children to the mother?  This is a very serious problem. If a wife is not working, the husband's contributions cover benefits for his wife and his children.  That is provided for in the Bill.  If the wife becomes a wage earner and has an income over £5,600, she pays £50 for herself.  There is an element of discrimination.  Whose payment provides benefits for the children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in line with modern thinking in regard to men and women.  There is no discrimination.  It was made clear from the outset that every income earner would be treated separately for the purposes of this legislation.  It will apply to everyone over 16 years of age.  Unfortunately the age must be 16 because that is the social welfare qualifying age.  Everybody over 16 years of age will be liable for health <Col N="1605" /> contributions.  The question as to whom the children will be related for purposes of eligibility will be decided when we publish the regulations.  I have an open mind on that matter as yet and it is still under consideration.  If both parents are wage earners and liable for contributions, the best interests of the children will be taken into consideration in deciding which parent will bring the children in the wake, as it were, for eligibility purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man is earning £11,000 a year the maximum amount he pays is £50.  If two incomes of £5,500 are coming into the household, the contribution from that household will be £100.  There is an element of unfairness there.  Will the male children be attached to the father and the female children attached to the mother?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I have made the position absolutely clear.  It was clearly stipulated at the outset that every income earner would be liable for a health contribution.  I do not think Deputy O'Connell can argue that he is on the side of the feminists when he suggests that we are wrong in departing from the income tax principle whereby a wife's income is considered as part of her husband's income.  In this legislation we are treating men and women separately, whether married or single.  Each will be treated as an income earner where that is the case and will be liable to pay the contribution.</P>
      <P>All persons over 16 will be brought within the compass of the legislation. Those under 16 or other dependants will be related, for eligibility purposes, to one or other, or both of the parents. That is a matter which is under consideration. I am examining the position to see what is the best thing to do in the interests of the children or other dependants. That does not arise under this Bill; that will be dealt with by the regulations which will be made under the Health Act, 1970.  The Deputy will be afforded an opportunity of going into that at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in the euphoric press conference, nor indeed in the Bill or in the explanatory memorandum.  Several points arise straightaway in relation to this.  I identified during the Second Stage debate very clearly that people earning over £5,000 a year would not get the same amount of insurance cover as people earning under that figure.  For instance, a man earning over £5,000 a year would still be liable to pay consultants' fees and would still be liable to pay the fees for maternity services in respect of his spouse.  What would be the position now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Only consultancy fees for maternity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What would be the position now&mdash;if that man is earning over £5,000 a year, his wife is earning less than £5,000 a year, and they are both being asked to pay the health contribution separately&mdash;will the wife be eligible for cover for all hospital costs, including consultants' fees, and the husband will not be?  In a case like that to whom is the responsibility for the issue to be assigned? Will they be covered under the wife's complete cover for maintenance and treatment costs or will they be covered merely under the husband's cover which would still render him in a position in which he would be liable to pay consultants' costs in respect of children?  I should have thought that in legislation, in general, the responsibility for the children would have been assigned to the father rather than to the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

Surely this single line amendment ought to have been dealt with more extensively further on within the Bill by dealing with this very situation.  I must admit that I had no comprehension that the husband and wife who are both earning would be made pay separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy made a specific statement that this was not dealt with in the explanatory memorandum. The Deputy should read the document. He should read what I say about these things.  It is quite clearly and specifically set out in the explanatory memorandum. Paragraph 2 on the first page of the explanatory memorandum says:</P>
      <P>Under the new arrangements all individuals over 16 years of age with an income will, with certain exceptions, be obliged to pay health contributions.</P>
      <P>Nothing could be more specific than that&mdash;individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I read the explanatory memorandum.  Of course I do not accept the allegations about false statements.  It seems to be a favourite ploy on that side of the House now, whenever one is embarrassed, to decide that the other person has made false statements.  Incidentally in this case the explanatory memorandum is not much more illuminating than the Bill itself because much of it is merely repetition of the wording of the Bill.  The explanatory memorandum says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> Under the new arrangements all individuals over 16 years of age with an income will, with certain exceptions, be obliged to pay health contributions.</P>
    <P>It could reasonably have been thought&mdash;and I certainly thought&mdash;that those exceptions would apply to a family where both husband and wife were earning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a long way away from the Minister's allegation of false statements.  Under existing VHI arrangements a husband and wife with no children are covered for all public ward hospital costs for a net expenditure of £59.20 after claiming income tax at standard rate.  I asked during the Second Stage debate if these health contributions would be allowable against income tax.  I do not think the Minister dealt with that in his reply.  If they are not, then in a situation in which husband and wife, without issue, are earning over £5,000 a year each, they will be paying now £100 a year between the two of them.  They will not be able to claim it for income tax.  As opposed to being insured totally for £59.20 with the VHI, now they are going to discover that they will still not be covered, having paid the £100&mdash;because they are both earning over £5,000&mdash;for consultants' costs.  On Second Stage when we were dealing with the people who gained and those who lost under this Bill&mdash;and I endeavoured fairly to point out the people whom I felt had gained under the Minister's Bill as well as those, in particular manual workers earning over £5,000, whom I felt had lost&mdash;I did not deal with this category.  Certainly this is another category of person who has lost entirely. They will be paying almost twice as much as they were paying to the VHI. They will discover also that they are not covered for consultants' fees which they would have been under the VHI scheme for an expenditure of £59.20 after tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same sort of calculations could be made in respect of a husband earning over £5,000 and a wife earning less than that figure.  I am not sure at what stage&mdash;because I have not done the exercise&mdash;the  <Col N="1609" /> cut-off point would be.  It is quite clear to me now that the majority of couples who are both earning will find themselves paying far more into the State scheme.  And if one of them is earning over £5,000 that person will be under the obligation still to cover himself or herself for consultants' fees. Therefore, such people will find themselves in a position in which it will cost them more to pay into the State scheme and cover themselves for some of their consultant's fees with the VHI scheme than it does at present.  It would have been far better had the Minister made that clearer from the beginning. No amount of blustering on his part will change the situation now.  I am quite certain I am not the only one who has been led astray in this connection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very serious implications in this.  I think we have honestly been misinformed on this Bill. These are the most serious implications I have ever encountered in any Bill coming before us.  I will tell the House why. The Minister is going to make regulations. We have to take the case of a husband and wife both earning money.  If the wife is earning under £5,000 and the husband over that figure&mdash;£5,500 as is said&mdash;I want to know to whom are the children attached with regard to benefits because this is the most serious aspect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister has not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer again if the Deputy will permit me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Minister the reasons I want to know.  If it is decided that the children, for benefit purposes, are attached to the mother's earnings of under £5,000, they get free hospitalisation, including maintenance and consultants' fees.  If they are attached to the father's earnings, over the figure of £5,500, they do not get anything; they do not get the consultants' fees, they do not get out-patient <Col N="1610" /> services free.  We are making sure we are not discriminating against women.  There is a great tendency to say that we are not when women have to pay.  When they are entitled to benefits it is one thing, but when they are paying there is no discrimination; we let them be equal.</P>
      <P>This is a case in point.  There is a very serious problem posed here.  To whom will the children be attached for the purposes of benefit?  It is a very serious matter. If they are attached to the mother and her earnings are under £5,000 per annum it could make an awful lot of difference. If they are attached to the father they will have to pay for everything if his income is over £5,500 per annum.  That is the most serious implication of this Bill.  The Minister is not spelling it out exactly.  He says that he will make up his mind about that in the regulations.  But this has very serious implications.  It could mean a great difference to what their entitlements are in the case of husband and wife both working, one earning less than £5,500 a year and the other earning more than £5,500 a year.  If the Minister would say that he will make a decision that the benefits to the children will be attached to the person earning the lower income then he may help to solve the problem.  The other aspect of it is that they are now paying double what was intended.  The whole Bill becomes a sham and a farce with the couple now paying £2 a week instead of £1 a week whereas if there was one income earner with the same amount of money he would be paying only half the amount from his household.  That is a very serious problem and one that was not made clear to us on the Second Stage of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, this was made perfectly clear on Second Stage.  Deputies should really follow what is happening in the House.  I quote from my Second Reading speech &ldquo;Under the Bill now before the House liability for payment of health contributions will extend to all individuals over 16 years of age who have an income&rdquo;. Could anything be more specific than that?  Any time I was asked by trade union delegations or by newspaper men or by anybody else I made it absolutely <Col N="1611" /> clear that a man and his wife would be treated separately, as individuals, for health contributions legislation.</P>

      <P>Give me time.  I will deal with the children in a moment. Every person over 16 years of age is also treated as an individual for the purpose of this legislation.  This legislation deals only with the contributions.  I will be making regulations later, before the 1st of April, which will deal with eligibility. Those regulations will have to come before this House positively.  They will not be the sort of regulations that go by default unless somebody moves to annul them.  I will have to come here and propose these regulations.  At that point Deputies O'Connell and Boland will have ample opportunity to go into the eligibility side of things.  I said to Deputies O'Connell and Boland that as of now I am considering and examining what the situation of children will be in their interests.  I want to make sure that whatever eligibility regulations we apply to children will be to the children's advantage. Will Deputy O'Connell accept that?</P>

      <P>There is a certain advantage in treating husband and wife separately.  If they are both working all free hospitalisation entitlements stop at £5,000.  After that they get free hospitalisation but they must pay the consultant.  It there are two people working and they are not treated separately then their wages would need to be very small before they would be covered, because it would be very easy for any two people working to earn over £5,000 between them.  Therefore they would have to have voluntary health insurance to cover consultants' fees the same as an individual person earning over £5,000.</P>
      <P>If my interpretation of the Bill is correct this Bill means that more people will be eligible to go into what we call the lower to middle income group and will have to have voluntary health insurance to cover the fees of their consultants. This applies if they are treated individually. If they are treated jointly where there are two workers I can see very few people needing to have voluntary health insurance to cover consultants' fees.  But the question is to whom are the children attached for the purposes of benefits?  I would ask the Minister to let them be attached to the lower income earner, but I certainly agree with treating husband and wife as individuals.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister just one more question in regard to the self-employed person.  Take for instance a person who has a valuation of £60 and who has a wife with a £20 valuation. Will such people be treated as being above the £5,000 bracket?  I assume that they will be treated the same as people with two separate incomes and will pay two separate contributions.</P>

Reckonable earnings relate to those people in the PAYE classes who are insured under the Social Welfare Acts. Emoluments other than reckonable earnings cover persons who come under PAYE but who are not insured, and reckonable incomes other than emoluments will apply to everybody else, including farmers, self-employed people, and company directors.  Proprietary directors in receipt of fees will come under section 6.  Everybody is covered in some way or another.  It is complicated, but sections 5, 6, and 7 take in every body.</P>

      <P>Existing guidelines in respect of medical cards bear no relation to the situation today.  I should not be taken as disgressing from the Bill, but food subsidies have been removed and people have been compensated in some way, and because they receive small amounts by way of compensation they have been removed from eligibility for medical cards.  More than 27,000 of them have been disqualified for medical cards simply because of the small amounts being given to them by way of compensation for food subsidies.  If the food subsidies had been retained those people would still be eligible for medical cards.  Because of the small sums of compensation they receive will they not become liable for health contributions? This is a serious problem for those people. Some of them are assessed for up to £17 per year income tax on their old age pensions and the pittances they receive from former employment in CIE.  Now they will have to pay health contributions as well.</P>

      <P>I know the Minister has the best intentions, but I have seen our best intentions in the House applied differently in the administration of the legislation.  I can cite particularly the deserted wife's allowance which we in the House gave with the best intentions. The Minister for Social Welfare at the time, the present Ceann Comhairle, had the best intentions about permitting a degree of flexibility but the people who implemented the legislation did not allow the degree of flexibility that we had intended. Can we ensure that in some way there will be a minimum amount below which people will not have to pay health contributions?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies know, £5,000 was originally set down in the general context of the Bill and I indicated that I would confirm or adjust this before 1 April, having regard to the latest statistics.  The sum of £5,000 was arrived at by taking the average earnings in the transportable goods industries as at September 1977 and multiplying by one-and-a-half.  That gave us £5,000.  In November last the average earnings in the transportable goods industries for March 1978 became available and on that basis, taking one-and-a-half times the average industrial earnings, we would arrive at a figure of about £5,187.  However, there have been strong representations from the trade unions to increase that amount. The trade unions are concerned primarily with increasing the ceiling for eligibility from the health point of view. One sympathises with them though they ignore as, perhaps, they are entitled to ignore, the social welfare side.  But I must concern myself with the whole package.  The scheme is an integrated and a complicated one with the health and social welfare aspects dovetailing &mdash;social welfare contributions and eligibility and health contributions and eligibility.  Therefore, taking everything into consideration I consider the sum £5,500 to be reasonable at this stage.  It is considerably more than one-and-a-half times the average industrial earnings figure at March 1978 would indicate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of Deputies there is one further point I should like to make in this context, that is, that the ceiling limit for health eligibility will be operative a year in arrears.  In other words eligibility and payments in 1979-80 will be determined on the basis of income in 1978-79.  There will always be that time <Col N="1618" /> lag in income levels but in the regulations I shall be fixing a figure of £5,500 across the board in respect of both social welfare and health contributions and health eligibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We should not legislate on the basis of administrative convenience.  It would be very wrong to act in that way.  I consider a figure of £5,500 to be unrealistic.  The ICTU who have been calling for free hospitalisation but realising the problems in that respect are asking that £6,500 be accepted as the ceiling.  Such a ceiling is not unrealistic. The Minister realises that changes are taking place even while this Bill is going through the Dáil but before he reaches a final decision I appeal to him to consider this higher ceiling.  I appreciate that there are problems in regard to consultants who, naturally, will wish to ensure that their interests are protected but it would not be stepping too far out of line to fix the ceiling at between £6,000 and £6,500.  This would not jeopardise the VHI who are planning to introduce a new scheme and it would ensure that the civil servants and other people who are on the border line would not suffer considerable hardship as will be the case if the Minister leaves the figure at £5,500.  I do not consider the question of dovetailing the health aspect with the social welfare aspect to be a valid reason for rigidity in this matter.  It should be possible without too much administrative inconvenience to separate the two.  If the Minister were to weigh whatever administrative inconvenience there might be against the hardship that would be caused to those on the border line I am sure he would agree that it would be better to put the administrative side into shape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I am impressed with the case being made by Deputy O'Connell for different limits in respect of social welfare and of health and presumably also for redundancy payments.  That would seem to me to be not merely administrative inconvenience but the administrative nightmare, not particularly for the Departments involved but for employees in trying to calculate the level of their liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having heard the long preamble from <Col N="1619" /> the Minister before announcing the changed figure I was surprised to hear the extent of the change.  For the sake of an extra £500 it was hardly worth making any change because such a small change will not be likely to make much difference.</P>
    <P>As I said on Second Stage, £5,000 was too low to have pitched the upper ceiling at initially.  I was inclined to agree with the unions that a more realistic figure would have been nearer to £8,000. For a number of reasons the £5,000 ceiling is too low because it will exclude from cover for consultancy services quite a number of people who are earning more than that amount.  These people will find it necessary to reinsure expensively with the VHI.  The figure is too low from the point of view of the State. It is clear from all the figures that the yield from this scheme will be infinitesimal in comparison with the health costs in general.  The Government have become committed to the concept of insurance that has been advocated by this party down through the years.  I should have preferred, though, that the Government dealt with the situation properly and with the eventual aim of having the insurance contribution cover a large part of the out-goings.  The entire costs of the health services are such that there is no way in which contributions will ever be meaningful in terms of covering those costs.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Callanan were here he would be asking the Minister whether, in deciding to change the upper limit of £5,000 in respect of income earners which had been related by the Minister to a valuation of £60 for farmers, it has been decided to make any change in respect of this valuation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that the £60 is now related to £5,500 and the multiplier will be calculated on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his colleagues must now be operating about four different types and levels of multipliers in relation to farmers.  It is no wonder everyone is dizzy looking at them and the Government running around each other.  We had the £60 <Col N="1620" /> valuation equated to an income of £5,000 in all the discussions leading up to this.  Now, without even a blink of an administrative eye, the Minister decides to equate £60 valuation to £5,500 income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the multiplier the Minister was using equating £60 valuation at £5,000 income, on a quick calculation, the same multiplier equating to £5,500 income would be £66 valuation.  It is not infinitesimal.  There is a great deal of difference between agricultural property at a valuation of £66 and property at a valuation of £60.</P>

There has been a great fanfare and public discussion on the impending new Health Act.

As I said before publicly, there may be pressure on the Minister from a section of consultants to ensure that some of the cream would still be left for them and that not too many people would be taken in.  This Bill has been given a lot of publicity and even with the amended amount it is not acceptable to the trade union movement and PAYE workers. The question of the VHI looking after these people should not come into it.  If the Minister is a caring Minister he will cover these people.  I do not accept that £5,500 is sufficient because of present-day costs.  The Minister's health scheme will fall on this low level of income.</P>

      <P>This is a major recasting of our social welfare and health services no matter what way one looks at it.  It is a major advance, particularly in the health services. We will have, for the first time, a health service which covers every single member of our community to a greater or lesser extent.  Put the package as a whole together and look at the extension of benefits we are giving, the new deal which the VHI are bringing in and the vast improvement in the situation of lower paid workers and earners and it will be found that it is an acceptable package.  It is fair and reasonable.  I am not saying this is the last word.  We have to bring this scheme into operation.  My predecessor failed to get his scheme into operation at all.  If we can get this scheme working we will have made a major advance as far as health and social welfare are concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 11 and 12, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;place&rsquo; in Part II of the Principal Act in relation to a person employed in the construction industry as defined in the Employment Agreement for that industry registered at the Labour Court means the actual place, location or site where the employee is employed, unless otherwise specified in a written contract of employment or in a written statement of terms of employment furnished under section 9 of the Act of 1973 if, but only if, a change or proposed change in the place of employment would be significantly to the disadvantage of the employee.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have included this amendment because I considered it a vital one to enable the legislation to be applied effectively, in <Col N="1624" /> particular to one large section of our workers, namely, men employed in the construction industry.  This group is liable to be located in any part of the country at any time of the year.  I believe my amendment must be included to ensure that these people are compensated properly and also to ensure that they will qualify for redundancy under this Bill. This is essential if we are to be seen to be concerned for all workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I must oppose this amendment.  By their nature some employments involve movement from one location to another and to discourage such movement could have very serious consequences for such type of employments and could affect the economic capacity of the country.</P>
      <P>Apart from this, if anything were to be done it would have to be done for all employees.  We could not discriminate in the case of building workers, as the Deputy has requested.  Basically, the Deputy is saying that those workers, working for a period on a site and then moving to another site, even with the same employer, should be entitled to redundancy payments.  I know something about the construction industry and I think it would create a ridiculous situation if an employee or a group of employees, perhaps spending a lifetime with the same building firm while moving to different locations, could have redundancy entitlement.  It would be an impossible situation.</P>
      <P>In addition, it could be regarded as discriminatory in itself to select those workers because there are other types of employment where people are obliged to move to different locations in certain circumstances. It is impossible for me to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The following paragraph is hereby inserted in section 7 (2) of the Principal Act (as amended by the Act of 1971):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(d)  the fact that the employer has decided that the work for which the employee has been employed (or had been doing before his dismissal) shall henceforth be done by a person who has a degree of capability, competence or qualifications (specified by the employer) which the dismissed employee did not have&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is purely a technical amendment and in my opinion it is justified.  It enables a dismissed employee to be compensated. There has been a previous example of this in the Department of Education where an unqualified teacher was dismissed and was replaced by a qualified teacher.  This amendment would widen the scope of redundancy and I should like to hear the Minister's comments on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This refers to a particular controversial decision.  I am sorry I must oppose the amendment for a number of valid reasons that I shall point out.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it is not good legislation just to legislate for one case or for one example.  In addition, a decision was taken in a particular case.  I do not think that could guarantee what would be the result of any decision in a similar case in the future.  In other words, the tribunal at any stage obviously would take into account the merits of a particular case.  To accept this amendment basically would be to legislate for one controversial decision.  Obviously, I cannot comment on the correctness or otherwise of that decision.  The Bill is well worded now and it should not be tampered with because of that one isolated case.  It could well be that the tribunal, in similar circumstances, could arrive at a different decision from that arrived at in the case mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> The amendment, as worded, could lead to a number of abuses of the scheme by people claiming redundancy because they were replaced by more capable workers.  It could be very difficult to define capability or competence in such a situation.  Acceptance of the amendment could lead to a number of abuses.  It arises only because of one case to which the Deputy has referred.</P>

      <P Just="Center">&lsquo;AMOUNT OF LUMP SUM</P>
      <P>1.  The amount of the lump sum shall be equivalent to the aggregate of the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the product of one-half of the employee's normal weekly remuneration and the number of years of continuous employment, with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal or by whom he was employed when he gave notice of intention to claim under section 12; between the date on which the employee attained the age of 16 years and the date on which he attained the age of 21 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  the product of the employee's normal weekly remuneration on the <Col N="1627" /> date of his dismissal and the number of years of continuous employment, with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal, or by whom he was employed when he gave notice of intention to claim under section 12 between the date on which the employee attained the age of 21 years and the date on which he attained the age of 41 years, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the product of one and a half times the employee's normal weekly remuneration on the date of his dismissal and the number of years of continuous employment, with the employer in whose employment he was on the date of dismissal, or by whom he was employed when he gave notice of intention to claim under section 12, after the employee had attained the age of 41 years.</P>
    <P>Provided that the minimum lump sum shall not be less than twice the employee's normal weekly remuneration'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If accepted, this amendment would bring our lump sum benefit calculations into line with those obtaining in Northern Ireland.  From the age of 16 years to 21 years a person would be entitled to one-half weekly wages for each year, from 21 years to 41 years he would be entitled to one week's wages for each year of service, and over 41 years he would be entitled to one and a half weeks' wages for each year of service.  I am not happy that the sum of £5,000 is sufficient and I have inserted a figure of £9,000.  The ceiling is much too low and £5,000 would not meet present day needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, this section puts a ceiling of £5,000 on the earning to be used in calculating lump sums.  The pay on which redundancy payments are calculated is normal weekly remuneration as defined in the Bill.  It is broadly an average gross pay including such things as overtime, commission, other payments, and so on, even payments in kind.  The Deputy referred to the amount of the lump sum <Col N="1628" /> and how it is calculated.  He also referred to the figure of £5,000.  This point has been made to me already.  We are removing the weekly payments and now providing a lump sum.  We are not sure what the demands will be over a period of a year.  Quite a number of different issues affect the fund, such as the numbers and the service of those becoming redundant. At the end of a period of its operation I have undertaken to review the calculation of the lump sum.  This might be the wisest way to look at it rather than going into the unknown and possibly running the fund into serious difficulties. It would be advisable to look at it again after it has been in operation for a year.</P>

      <Col N="1631" /> In general where there are sharp cut-off points this gives rise to questions of injustice not only in redundancy payments but in many other areas such as medical cards and so on.  In other areas of the public service many of these matters have been corrected.  It could happen that a man who was a week or two short of his 66th birthday would qualify for the full lump sum while, if he were one day past his 66th birthday, he would not qualify for anything, as I understand it.  I am trying to provide for a phasing-out situation and to allow for a change in the pensionable age.  A person who would otherwise qualify for a lump sum would get 50 per cent of the figure and in the second year of pensionable age he would get 25 per cent.  In his third year of pensionable age he would get nothing.  We propose to provide that in the third year he gets nothing but in the first and second years he would get 50 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.  I do not mind if the years are changed about a bit but I should like the Minister to consider my suggestion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to say to Deputy Mitchell that I have to oppose these two amendments for a number of reasons.  The provision of 50 per cent and 25 per cent would complicate something we are all endeavouring to simplify.  Obviously, that would not be the overriding or governing factor if hardships were created or if there were a need to overcome some difficulty.  I am pointing out that it would introduce some of the varied percentages that we are trying to eliminate and would cause administrative difficulties.  The overriding factor is the proposal to drop the qualifying age for redundancy from 70 to the old age pension age was discussed with both sides of industry.  There were no objections but both sides suggested a phased reduction.  The reduction that I have introduced affords a reasonable period in which both employers and employees can adjust to the new age limit, because the operative date in the case of those people is 6 April 1980.  In other words, there is a further year from 6 April this year.  The postponement of <Col N="1632" /> the reduction for that one year affords a reasonable period.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Deputy is making but I think that the section as it now stands meets his point.  To go further would only complicate matters and is regarded as unnecessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has problems in regard to simplification.  We ought to be trying to further simplify redundancy legislation. It should not be too complicated to divide by two and by four in the few cases that will arise.  It is bad law to provide for a situation in which a sense of grievance will fester.  Stark cut-off points are bad law.  If a man is given notice of redundancy a week before he is 66 he will qualify for a lump-sum payment. If he is given notice one week later he will not qualify for anything. Therefore, a man could lose as much as £3,700 in one week.  We should not be providing for that sort of situation when we can easily avoid it.  I would ask the Minister to at least consider the point and let us have his comments on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>The position has been examined.  The Deputy may be under a misapprehension when he refers to a one-week cut-off.  This is specifically why there has been a postponement of one year, and it was accepted that this was necessary.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make to the Deputy is that there will always be the danger of creating a hardship no matter how one creates a cut-off point.  There is general agreement that the proposals in the Bill give a substantial period&mdash;a full year&mdash;after the introduction of the Bill.  I accept the Deputy's point and his reasons for making it, but it is adequately covered by the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong of me not to press this point, which is a valid one.  I accept the Minister's point about the year's postponement affecting the pension age.  There is a possibility of the injustice being there in April 1980 and I believe that we could provide for such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that both sides of <Col N="1633" /> industry had asked for a phased reduction. If they have asked for it and I am asking for it, perhaps the Minister would consider the matter again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that there was general acceptance by both sides of industry of the terms of the section.  The position is that the section will reduce as from 6 April 1980&mdash;that is, a year from the introduction of the Bill&mdash;the upper age for qualification to coincide with the old age pension age.  Both sides urged that the reduction should not take place immediately and that there should be a time limit in which to adjust to it.  The section postpones the equation of the redundancy upper age limit with the old age pension qualification age until 6 April 1980.  It is true to say that, since the old age pension age is now 66 and insurability for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, 1952 to 1966, ceases on reaching old age pension age, it is by virtue of this that entitlement to redundancy payments up to the age of 70 still exist.</P>
      <P>It is also true to say that the original reason for the four-year extension was to enable non-manual workers to qualify for redundancy payments for some time after ceasing to be insurable on reaching the earnings limit for compulsory insurability. This reason no longer applies as non-manual workers no longer cease to be insurable on reaching a specific income point.  I am satisfied that the time limit has been met.  The extension is there and I am happy with the section.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;, but the amount of rebate when so reduced shall not be less than 40 per cent of the lump sum&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;by such percentage as he shall decide is appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am proposing to do is to give the Minister more power than he has taken <Col N="1634" /> for himself.  In a case where minimum notice is not given, as required by redundancy legislation, the Minister is suggesting that the rebate payable out of the redundancy fund could be reduced to 40 per cent.  I am suggesting that we do not confine the Minister to 40 per cent but allow him the discretion to reduce it to any figure.  It is not sufficient disincentive for some employers to confine the Minister's discretion to reducing the rebate to 40 per cent.  Any Minister would exercise discretion very much in this case, and for that reason I advocate that we delete the words, &ldquo;but the amount of rebate when so reduced shall not be less than 40 per cent of the lump sum&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;by such percentage as he shall decide is appropriate&rdquo;.  It is right that we should do that because where there is a blatant breach of legislation the Minister should have some effective sanctions to ensure that the legislation is abided by.  A reduction to 40 per cent is not sufficient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this amendment.  The provision specifies a standard rebate of 60 per cent with a floor or lower limit of 40 per cent for rebate where the Minister exercises his discretion to reduce the rebate for failure to comply with the notice requirements in section 17 of the Principal Act.  The amendment would have the effect of giving the Minister unlimited reduction discretion, in fact too much power in such cases by removing the limit below which the rebate could not be cut.  The existing rebate provisions provide for a possible reduction of rebates from 55 per cent to not less than 45 per cent.  Section 6 has increased the Minister's discretionary power by 10 per cent, in other words bringing it from 60 per cent to 40 per cent.  It is not considered that the rebate reduction provisions need be made even more drastic.  Take, for example, a case where a rebate of £2,000 is due to an employer.  He could be penalised under this section to the extent of £400, which is a sizeable portion of that £2,000.  The penalty is adequate and the provision should remain as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A slightly different position exists now from when redundancy legislation was first introduced.  The reason for the incentive <Col N="1635" /> to employers is to give more than the minimum two weeks' statutory notice but mainly to give workers more time to look for other jobs or training and to provide manpower information for the purpose of the replacement of redundant workers in new employment or training.  Since then we have had the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, which gives employees the right to notice of dismissal of up to eight weeks depending on the length of service.  There is also the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, which put certain duties on employers to notify the Minister and to have consultations with the employee and the trade union organisation concerned.  All of these are new since that legislation was introduced and they are on the positive side of the question.</P>
    <P>On the negative side, I see no benefit in giving the Minister any further discretionary powers.  The Deputy, who in the normal course would probably be taking powers from the Minister or charging the Minister with taking too much power, is going a little too far in giving the Minister more power than he should be seeking.  The increase of the percentage in the existing situation to what is now in the new one is substantial. The example I have given is what could be regarded as a £400 fine on a rebate of £2,000, which I believe to be adequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this amendment with some reservation because I believe that there should be, as far as possible, some check, as I also indicate in my other amendments.  On the other hand, I feel that the sanction in this section as proposed by the Minister is not sufficient.  We recall the Ferenka situation where 1,400 workers were involved when the minimum notice was not given. If a company were to lose the full 60 per cent rebate if they behaved similarly in the future, there would be very few repeats.  The legislation to which the Minister referred, the Protection of Employment Act and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, was not sufficient in the Ferenka case and very possible will not be sufficient in <Col N="1636" /> the future.  Perhaps my amendment is a little far-reaching, but we should put a little more bite into the Minister's power.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to stray too far from the amendment and the section, but in passing I remark that in the House here yesterday we had several cases where legislation was ineffective; it was there all right but ineffective.  We should look very closely to make sure that what we are passing in this House would be effective. I am not going to press the amendment but I ask the Minister at least to rethink and maybe go a bit further if he is not prepared to go the full way.</P>

      <P>My reason for moving this amendment was to allow for greater mobility of workers, particularly large numbers of workers in the clothing, footwear and construction industries, by reducing the number of weeks.  Constraints would be removed from these workers, there would be general movement and they would not be debarred from receiving redundancy payment.  It is a social question and one we should consider.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment or, if he does not, to reconsider the matter after one year's trial.</P>

The 104 weeks is the qualifying period for redundancy in general and the Deputy is proposing that it should be reduced to one year.

On consideration it is felt that the terms of subsection (1) should be less explicit. Omitting the reference to section 17 of the Principal Act is basically to avoid the possibility that employers might seek to avoid liability under section 7, that is, to allow reasonable time off by simply refraining from giving notice or by giving notice other than in compliance with section 17 of the Principal Act.  This is basically to prevent the possibility of an employer not giving notice and the employee not being able to get time off.</P>

      <P>I am trying to provide that the employees have four rather than two weeks.  I had other amendments which were too late for publication which would have helped to improve the section generally, but not having them in on time was my own fault.  Two weeks is rather short notice when a person is being made redundant, as it gives him little <Col N="1638" /> opportunity to seek alternative employment. For that reason I suggest that the period be increased to four weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to these amendments because we already have a worthwhile innovation; giving people the opportunity to have time off to seek alternative employment during the two weeks notice.  A Minister must balance the views expressed to him, and in a situation like this there would be on the one hand a complete rejection of the idea and, on the other, a plea for a longer period.  I have balanced the situation reasonably well.  The two weeks notice period, with an opportunity to have time off to seek alternative employment or training, is a major step forward.  I had discussions with the interested parties and I undertook to include this kind of provision.  However, this being an innovation, it is advisable not to extend the period beyond two weeks.  As Deputies are aware there are many other pieces of legislation, such as the Protection of Employment Act, under which industries have to notify redundancies to the Department in addition to having the consultations.  These redundancy notices are immediately brought to the attention of the placement services.  This two week period can now be utilised to assist people who succeed in setting up interviews or in making genuine efforts to find employment.  This new move is desirable but it should be left at the two weeks to avoid further complications.</P>

      <P>The last words in sub-section (4) of section 7 &ldquo;if it is not prejudicial to the employees interests&rdquo; seem to indicate that the case made by the FUE is right, that these words probably render the whole subsection meaningless. Will the Minister look at the entire subsection with a view to rephrasing it? The employer can ask an employee seeking time off during his notice to look for employment or training to give evidence that he is really seeking alternative employment or training, but the employee can refuse to give the information if in his opinion it is prejudicial to his interests.  Any sensible employee would take the two weeks off and would look for employment but would tell the employer that he could not supply information because it would be prejudicial to his interests.  The Minister ought to look at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that there must be a reasonable amount of flexibility between both sides.  In some cases it may not be in the interests of the employee to divulge his contacts or to give information about the alternative employment he is seeking and it would be unreasonable of any man in those circumstances <Col N="1640" /> to insist.  On the other hand, I accept that it would be unreasonable of the employee to avail of this clause to do something other than seek employment. This is an effort to balance as far as possible what is reasonable.  It is reasonable for an employee to be given a certain time off to seek employment during that period.  It is also reasonable that the employer should at least be able to be told as much as possible by the employee about his efforts in seeking work, but there could be confidential matters that in the interests of the employee should not be divulged.  There has to be flexibility here.  There must be goodwill on both sides, but we must be concerned about the employee's interests. If an employee feels that there is some danger to himself if he discloses some information it is important that he should have that little bit of flexibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is undoubted force in what the Minister says.  I do not wish to diminish the rights of employees. However, I feel that, as the subsection stands, it is very defective.  I believe we are leaving every employer open to a potentially serious situation during the duration of the notice.  With, say, 100 employees, it could happen that each would decide to take the maximum time off seeking alternative employment and this could scuttle the firm.  The subsection leaves that a possibility.  I think it needs a good deal of tightening up and reconsideration and not just deletion of the last few words.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that between now and Report Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied with the subsection as it stands.  The Deputy is forgetting an overriding consideration, that the tribunal is always there and can be resorted to if an employer feels that an employee is not complying with what he believes to be the terms of the Act. There was a request from the FUE to have &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; inserted after that.  If the Deputy reads that with the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; inserted, it does not alter the position.  I emphasise again that the tribunal is there as a body that can decide if the employer has recourse to the tribunal because he feels an <Col N="1641" /> employee has contravened the Act.  I believe this is a worthwhile provision which gives the employee a reasonable chance of seeking alternative employment or at least of availing of time when perhaps he would find it easier to get a job than when his employment ceases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the powers conferred in subsection (5) where differences arising out of subsection (4) would be adjudicated by the employment appeals tribunal.  Then, depending on the tribunals decision, if it decided that an employer did owe an employee money for time taken off the employee could then take the employer to court.  The fact is that many working people would not want to incur legal costs and go to court to recover pay for a day or two.</P>
      <P>Both subsections could be easily cleaned up.  For instance, in subsection (5) instead of having &ldquo;... paid by an employer to an employee shall be recoverable as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo;, it could be done by reducing the rebate by that amount and making it payable directly to the employee in the case of an adjudication by the appeals tribunal. There would be no necessity for the employee to go to court and there would not be congestion of the courts.  It is a simple suggestion that the Minister should stop out of the rebate any amount adjudicated by the tribunal, not pay it to the employer but pay it directly to the employee.  I had that simple proposal in, but it was too late.  The Minister should look again at subsections (4) and (5) because I think we are making bad law in both subsections.</P>

      <P>In page 5, after line 23, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1643" />&ldquo;(3B) (i)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of section 9 of the Principal Act, an employee shall be entitled to terminate his contract of employment in circumstances of uncertainty in which it is reasonable for the employee to anticipate dismissal for redundancy (whether or not he has received notice of dismissal or protective notice of dismissal or lay-off) if it is reasonable for the employee to expect that his remaining in the employment would seriously prejudice his prospects of obtaining suitable alternative employment which became available and was unlikely to remain vacant.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Where, in the circumstances specified in this section the employee has received an offer in writing from the employer and on a reference to the Tribunal it appears to the Tribunal, having regard both to the reasons for which the employee seeks, or sought, to leave the employment and those for which the employer requires, or required, him to continue in it, to be just and equitable that the employee should receive the whole or part of a redundancy payment, the Tribunal may determine that there shall be paid to the employee&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the whole of the redundancy payment to which the employee would have been so entitled, or</P>
    <P>(b)  such part of that redundancy payment as the Tribunal thinks fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This amendment was proposed by my party in 1967 for inclusion in the then Bill.  It would mean that the tribunal can decide on the entire circumstances of the case as to whether the party involved can be awarded either full or partial benefits.  I believe that is something that will come eventually and perhaps we could do it now since it is something we cannot stop.  I ask the Minister to include it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot.  I see a close link between the two amendments. As I said earlier, I fear that the danger of catering for possible redundancy or anticipated redundancy could <Col N="1644" /> be more harmful to suffering firms. Basically this amendment seems to be on the same principle.  As regards an employee who justifiably leaves employment because of various circumstances the inherent danger is that we are returning to the same problem we had in the past.  The subsection deals with the reasons why employees have left employment because of the employer's conduct.  It outlines the circumstances in which an employee would be entitled to terminate his contract where it is reasonable for him to anticipate, irrespective of any notice given or dismissal, a redundancy or if it is also reasonable for him to expect that remaining on in the job would prejudice his chance of other employment which is available but might not remain so.</P>
      <P>The reason I am reluctant to accept the amendment is that I believe it would prove a source of difficult disputes adding to the tribunal's already heavy workload.  It attempts to deal with contingencies related to such vague terms as &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;, what the expectation of the employee might be and the likelihood, or otherwise, of other employment remaining available and whether the firm will or will not survive. Those questions are dealt with in that section but the amendment would be likely to prevent the employer holding on to his workforce in what could be a tough situation which the firm might come through successfully.  The amendment would be a likely disincentive to an employer to hold on to his workforce and exhaust every possibility of keeping the firm viable and maintaining employment. There is an inherent danger here that the employer, rather than battling on to the final fence, might decide to close and this would not help any of us. For that reason I suggest to the Deputy that he should not proceed with his amendment.</P>

      <P>In hindsight I accept the weaknesses in the amendment and I also accept the Minister's concern that it would have the eventual effect of a closure rather than helping an industry.  I appreciate the heavy workload of the tribunal but I am anxious that the tribunal would have the power to decide, <Col N="1645" /> having heard the facts, whether the person concerned is entitled either to full or partial benefit.  I want additional power given to the tribunal to make the final decision as to whether the person concerned suffered hardship to the extent that he or she should be entitled to full or partial benefit.  I accept the Minister's view that the amendment is a weak one but there is merit in the next amendment.</P>

      <P>I am worried about building something into the legislation that might, in the long term, do more harm than good.  At present if people feel they have a case they can leave on the basis of rumours and have their case processed.  To include this amendment would be unhelpful towards maintaining employment.  It could put the appeals tribunal in a difficult situation disputewise and it may be an encouragement to an employer not to battle on to the end, as we would like to see him do, and maintain the jobs.  I see dangers in this and I would be afraid to include it in the legislation.</P>

    <P>(b)  the provisions of the contract as renewed, or of the new contract, as to the capacity and place in which he would be employed and as to the other terms and conditions of his employment would not differ from the corresponding provisions of the contract in force immediately before his dismissal,</P>

    <P>(b)  the employee temporarily accepts the reduction in remuneration of hours of work and indicates his acceptance to his employer,</P>
    <P>such a temporary acceptance for a period not exceeding 52 weeks shall not be taken to be an acceptance by the employee of an offer of suitable employment in relation to him.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that this is an attempt at consolidation and I do not underestimate the importance of that but it is our intention to consolidate the Acts, not just individual sections as is attempted here.  When the Bill is passed it is our intention to produce a comprehensive and simple guidebook in layman's language and give information on redundancy, redundancy entitlements and guidelines generally so <Col N="1648" /> that everybody will understand the legislation.  In the long term, the grounds of general consolidation will be attempted but at this stage this is not the correct way of going about consolidation. This attempt at partial consolidation is not the correct way.  Obviously, all these matters will have to be vetted by legal experts because of their importance.  I do not disagree with the Deputy when he stresses the need for consolidation but I have given an under-taking that I will do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1649" /> The inclusion of this new section is overdue since 1971 and is justified because of the existence of a limbo situation at present.  A number of cases are at present before the tribunal and the injustices involved in those cases has been recognised but, unfortunately, those people will not benefit from the inclusion of such an amendment.

    <P>(a)  the payment has been agreed and paid, or</P>

    <P>(a)  that failure to make a claim for a lump sum before the end of the period of 104 weeks mentioned in that subsection was caused by his ignorance of the identity of his employer or employers or by his ignorance of a change of employer involving his dismissal and engagement under a contract with another employer, and</P>

      <P>This section makes the redundancy lump sum a preferential debt on a receivership.  It has been pointed out to me that if two companies apply to a bank for loans there will be a tendency for the bank to give the loan to the company with the lower labour content. Under this Bill the Government will <Col N="1652" /> get paid before the bank.  The bank could create a floating charge over these assets and that would not be of benefit to the bank.  In such a situation the bank would not be inclined to give loans to labour-intensive firms.  This point was brought to my attention by bankers and people involved in receiverships.  They do not oppose the idea behind the section; they wanted to point out the difficulties that might arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by the Deputy.  I would be extremely disappointed if our banks and lending institutions took such a matter into consideration when determining a loan.  The redundancy situation is a very important and delicate part of our manpower policy.  It is something we all wish to avoid.  It would be very desirable if we did not need this type of legislation and that every job was guaranteed, but of necessity we must have this legislation to protect those who lose their employment. For that reason the banks and lending institutions should be told that this should not be a criterion for deciding to give a loan to a company.  In the event of closure, the question we should ask is why should banks get preference over a worker's claim.  In many instances these people may have spent 30 or 40 years in that firm and while naturally we cannot accept any responsibility for a bank decision, in fairness we must have regard to the people who are vitally concerned, that is the redundant workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that point.  The point I was trying to make is that a firm who may not employ so many people could influence the bank when a loan is sought.  Everyone knows the idea behind the section is to give preferential treatment to the workers but in the hard commercial world lending institutions might not take that view.</P>

      <P>It is easy for administrators to make orders that become law.  Before an order comes into effect it should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That would give it full legal sanction.  Orders as they are being made at present are removing from this House the power vested in it by the people.  I am surprised at the way politicians seem to want to divest themselves of very important powers.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter very seriously.  Normally those orders have the full support of the House because they make sense.  Those orders will alter legislation that is being passed through the House and they should be referred back.  I ask the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment not just for this Bill but for all future Bills.  It is convenient for a Minister to say by order: &ldquo;I do this&rdquo; but that is not good enough.  The House has got to protect its sovereignty against this sort of easy legislation.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment sympathetically.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a standard section in many pieces of legislation over the years.  I recall arguing Deputy O'Brien's case in my Opposition days.  I fully realise the reasons for it.  I must oppose the amendment.  The standard section I have referred to is in section 55 of the original Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, and a similar provision is in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978. <Col N="1654" /> I assure the Deputy that the rights of Members of the House are protected. Misuse of the Minister's powers is safeguarded simply because either House of the Oireachtas has power to annul by resolution any order made by him under this section within 21 days, the same as in many pieces of legislation which have gone through this House.</P>
      <P>There is nothing exceptional about this order.  The Deputies interested will, of course, be aware of that order being tabled.  If and when an order is made it is tabled in the House, it makes it easier for Deputies interested if they wish to raise that point in the House.  On the other hand, it is true to say that in the case of a Bill like this if orders are necessary they should be expedited as far as possible. If they are laid before the House and the Members have no objection to them they go through in the normal way.</P>

In my view if he had that feeling about it when he was over here in principle he must agree with it.  Now that he has taken over the role of Minister his whole outlook changes but that is not good enough.  The Minister agrees that legislation made by order is not good. We have machinery to annul such orders by bringing the matters before the House.  I accept that the Minister is going by precedent and obviously the people in his Department advise him about what to do and what not to do.  This is not good politics and is not good for Parliament.  If the Minister felt something was wrong when he was this side of the House his duty should be, when he steps over to the other side, to rectify the matter.  The Minister is not prepared to do that.

I want to say as well that nobody controls me.  I control myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now try to assure the Deputy why I believe that this section is important as it stands.  Deputy O'Brien said that no machinery was available but this is not right.  The machinery of the House is there for the annulment of an order within 21 days.  This section of the Bill only lasts for one year after its introduction. It is to prepare for a contingency where some unforseen difficulty may be picked up in the operation of the new scheme.  If some unforseen difficulty is picked up obviously that will be the only time it will be used.  I can assure the Deputy that this section will not be used only for minor procedural changes.  The machinery of the House will be available to the Deputy even for dealing with those minor procedural changes.  The probability is that this will never be used <Col N="1656" /> during the year of operation.  The reasons for this are very desirable.  It is a way of removing, if it arises, some unforseen difficulty in the fastest, most expeditious way possible.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment proposes to reduce the number of hours from 20 to 16.  It is felt that redundancy entitlement should be confined to jobs providing the main source of income as indicated by working more than half the working week and therefore this amendment must be rejected.  The limit settled in the Dáil during the passage of the original Bill was 21 hours, which was half the then normal working week of 42 hours.  The reduction of the limit as proposed in the section is in line with the general reduction in the normal working week.  It is now generally 40 hours.  This is why I have reduced the number of hours from 21 to 20.  It is also important to establish that redundancy entitlements should be confined to jobs providing the main source of income.  If we reduce too far the minimum hours, the danger could be that redundancy entitlement could be derived from a sideline.  I cannot accept the compromise.</P>

      <P>These amendments are intended to prevent discrimination against employees, particularly in the building and clothing trades.  Building contracts in rural Ireland normally do not exceed 18 months.  If the provision cannot cover 52 weeks, then it should at least cover 78 weeks or 18 months' employment.</P>

      <P>We are getting back to the earlier discussion regarding 104 and 52 weeks.  I am not convinced that this is the appropriate time to reduce the qualification period.  In the UK not only is two years the minimum qualification but it is two years reckonable service&mdash;in other words, it must be two years' full service.  In our circumstances it is two years' continuous service but one still qualifies for that service in spite of sickness and so on.  For that reason I cannot accept the proposed reduction.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Section 32 of the Principal Act, as inserted by section 14 of the 1971 Act, deals with payment to employees of lump sums from the redundancy fund.  Subsection (1) of section 32 sets out the circumstances in which an employee may apply to the Minister for such payment.  In the English version of section 14 of the 1971 Act the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; was omitted from the end of subparagraph (a) of the substituted section 32 (1).

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>On many occasions since my appointment as Minister for Labour I have advocated publicly in the House and elsewhere, and privately in discussions with employer and trade union interests, that the procedures available for promoting good industrial relations and for preventing and settling disputes be utilised to the full, that communications and consultations between employer and employee be reviewed and improved, where possible, and that efforts be directed towards promoting a better working environment.  I might mention also that my Department have already made a comprehensive submission to the Commission of Inquiry on Industrial Relations concerning many aspects of industrial relations.  In addition to supporting this approach to industrial relations, I have had under constant review the facilities provided by the State, with a view to effecting any improvements which would attract the support of both sides of industry.  As part of this ongoing review I have initiated moves to set up a fourth division of the Labour Court so as to enable that body to provide an even more speedy and flexible response to the increasing demands being imposed upon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1978 employment incentive scheme premiums paid to employers in respect of eligible additions to their employment levels totalled £4.4 million approximately, £2.6 million less than the provision for the year.</P>
      <P>As new jobs for young people under the age of 25 supported under this scheme in 1979 will likely qualify for assistance from the European Social Fund, it is estimated that the provision included in the Estimates will be adequate not only to continue the scheme at last year's rate of uptake by employers but for some increase in that rate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will give in man-years for 1978 the number of jobs created under the following schemes (1) the employment incentive scheme, (2) the work experience programme, (3) the community youth training programme, and (4) any other job creation schemes under the aegis of his Department.</P>

      <P>The employment incentive scheme was in operation for the whole of 1978.  Premiums were paid in respect of 10,410 employees, representing 5,200 man-years approximately.</P>
      <P>The work experience programme was launched at the end of September 1978. Up to 31 December 1978, 1,685 young people had participated in the programme, representing 225 man-years.</P>
      <P>The community youth training programme operated throughout the year and the number trained under the programme was 1,802, representing 750 man-years approximately.</P>

I should also remind the Deputy that the number of extra posts created in my Department in 1978 was 113 and 96 of those appointments were made for the NMS.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of placement officers to be appointed from the special competition which I referred to in reply to a question on 30 November 1978, is at least 30, and 24 of the successful candidates have already taken up employment.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the recruitment method used will not in any way diminish the effectiveness of the National Manpower Service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am right in assuming that the change in procedure for the employment of placement officers is essentially that the special competition to which the Minister referred is now an internal competition, is it not reasonable that the expertise and the knowledge which people outside the establishment of his Department could bring to the jobs, if appointed, could be of assistance? In other words, why is it now a closed competition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of posts filled by way of open competition held in mid-1978 was about 33, which was the biggest intake in any year since the establishment of the service.  It was found that more assistance of a temporary nature was needed for the various schemes.  Because of that it was felt more appropriate to recruit extra people, over and above the number I referred to, from a confined competition within the Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he will, in respect of the 28 cases being processed under the Equal Pay Act, 1974, on 14 November 1978 (1) name the parties to each of the 28 claims, (2) give the dates on which the claims were initially brought to the attention of the Employment Equality Officer of the Labour Court, and (3) state the order in which claims are processed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, section 6 (5) of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, provides that an investigation by an equality officer of the Labour Court shall be conducted in private.  In addition, section 8 (2) of the Act provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that any person concerned with proceedings under the Act, shall not disclose information without the consent of the parties concerned.  It has not been the practice to disclose the identity of the parties involved while cases are being processed, and it will be understood, therefore, that the information in the first part of the question cannot be supplied.  Once recommendations have been made by an equality officer, however, copies are circulated to the parties concerned as well as to various <Col N="1671" /> organisations such as trade unions and the media.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part, the dates of referral of the claims in question were as follows: one in June 1976; one each in April, May and August 1977; three in September 1977; one each in October and November 1977; seven in December 1977; two each in February and March 1978; one in April 1978; four in May 1978; and one each in July, October and November 1978.  Since 14 November 1978.  21 recommendations have been issued in respect of the cases referred to.</P>
      <P>As regards the third part of the question, normally cases are processed in the order in which all the submissions and documentation required by the equality officer are lodged.  Supplementary information and submissions, and replies to equality officers' queries may, however, prevent cases being completed according to the order of receipt.</P>

In respect of those 28 cases, 21 recommendations have been made.  I should point out that one of the delaying factors can be the difficulty in getting submissions, documentation and information from one or both parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance paid was increased from £15 to £17 on 1 January; the Deputy may be aware of that.  It does not include the midday meal for the five days of the week.  That meal is provided in the AnCO centres.  It compares favourably with some rates.  For example, Bord na Móna pay £18 per week for seven days full board including the midday meal.  The ESB pay £19 per week for seven days full board in Cork, Waterford and Limerick.  With those comparisons the Deputy will have to accept that the £17 for full board only at weekends and for the week without the midday meal appears to be adequate.</P>

      <P>Application for a building grant for new school accommodation at Knocknaheeny, Cork, was made to my Department on 11 August 1977.  Approval, in principle, was given on 25 October 1977 for the provision of two 16-classroom schools for the area.  It is intended that accommodation be provided initially in one 16-classroom building and that additional accommodation be provided later, as required.  Both schools will be located on the same site, in the townland of Hollyhill.  It is estimated that the two schools will cost about £760,000.</P>
      <P>Details regarding the financing of the school buildings are regarded as confidential between the Department and the school authorities.  The question as to whether or not the new schools should be organised on a co-educational basis is a matter for local decision.</P>

      <P>The question of the suitability and the adequacy of the accommodation at this school was first raised by way of parliamentary question in February 1975.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works were asked to report on the feasibility of extending the school to provide additional accommodation, with suitable toilet and other amenities.  The school authorities have obtained an extension of the school site with this end in view but, because of the difficult nature of the site, the commissioners find it necessary to have detailed investigations and feasibility studies made before planning can begin on a scheme of extension and improvement as proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 21 together. Two hundred and eighteen special trainee teachers have satisfactorily completed their course of training; the appointment of 95 of them has already been sanctioned.  Due to the time-lag in submitting appointments it is not possible to have up-to-date accurate figures on new appointments.  Due to the improvements in pupil/teacher ratios which I announced in April 1978, to take effect on 1 January 1979, immediately after they qualified and the creation of a substantial additional number of posts as remedial teachers, I am satisfied that sufficient posts are available this school year to absorb all the qualified teachers available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>Representatives of the graduates came and met officials of my Department who handed to them a list of 180 vacancies in schools throughout the country.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it right to assume that something of the order of six times as many graduates were initially expecting to be employed under the scheme as have been employed to date?  Has the Minister any proposals to speed up the intake of teachers who are available but who may not have applied for vacancies perhaps for geographical or other reasons?  Will the Minister speed up the figure from the present 95, which the Minister will agree is somewhat disappointing in view of the initial promise made in this case?</P>

      <P>There is no disappointment as far as the posts available are concerned.

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Information in regard to enrolment numbers in third-level educational institutions in the EEC countries and demographic statistics by age-groups is made available in the following publications: Enrolment Data: Eurostat Education statistics 1970-1975. Population Data: Eurostat Demographic Statistics 1970-1976. These publications are issued by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>In this connection I should emphasise that in drawing conclusions from statistical comparisons of enrolments in different countries it is necessary to have regard to factors which make it difficult to express such comparisons in terms which truly reflect the situation.  In so far as Ireland is concerned the early age of admission to third-level educational institutions and the relatively low percentage of students of 24 years of age and upwards are features which, <i>inter alia</i>, should be borne in mind.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned that the statement of the Higher Education Authority referred to in the question from the Deputy may give a misleading impression of the situation in Ireland in relation to access to and participation in education at third level.</P>
      <P>I may add that I do not consider that an approach based on an attempted comparison of international statistics of enrolments would be a proper basis for policy decisions in the formulation of educational policy for a programme of educational development at third level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in assuming that the Minister's reply indicates that the HEA statement is in fact inaccurate or wrongly stated?  Secondly, does the Minister accept that the evidence in that statement and the implication in the question is that by and large and allowing for the statistical differentials which he referred to there is nevertheless strong evidence to indicate that the percentage of pupils in higher education here is <Col N="1686" /> among the lowest in the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two parts in the Deputy's supplementary question. The first is: am I saying that the figures are wrong?  What I said is this: It is difficult to compare like with like.  For example in Ireland, quite a number of people go into third level at 17 and some even at 16.  The relevant figure in the first column of the statistics I mentioned give third-level enrolment as a percentage of the 18-24 population group.  For the United Kingdom that is 9.3; for Ireland, 9.2.  That does not take into account our 17-year-olds in third-level education whereas there are few if any at 17 years in third level in Britain and practically none on the continent where the normal starting age is about 19. There is another point: when you talk about the percentage of a particular age group in any level you must take cognisance of the percentage that group is of the total population of the particular country.  It happens that particular age group in our population is very high as of now.  It is not an easy thing to come to a straight conclusion in comparisons.</P>

      <P>Following is the press release:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Meetings of representatives of Patrons, Management Bodies, Teachers and Department of Education <Col N="1689" /> have been held over the past two months to review the operation of the scheme of management for national schools.  The purpose of the review was to establish areas of agreement in regard to the amendment of the scheme.  A revised draft scheme has now been completed and will be submitted to the various interests concerned. Copies will be available within the next few days.  There are a number of outstanding matters of principle on which complete agreement has not been reached, namely, structure of boards, method and level of financing and arrangements for the appointment of teachers.  However, a substantial measure of agreement was reached on practical and procedural matters which should greatly facilitate the operation of the boards.  In particular, detailed arrangements were made for the handling of relations between teachers and boards of management and the resolution of grievances and disputes.  Amendments have also been made to the arrangements for the appointment of teachers.  The Minister indicated to the meeting today that decisions have not yet been taken in regard to the level of financing of national schools for 1979.  It remains now to be seen whether the revised draft will be acceptable to the various interests concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Questions Nos. 11 and 12 on today's Order Paper I asked the Minister for Education for a certain amount of information in relation to the proposed new primary education facilities to be provided at Knocknaheeny, Cork.  In particular I asked the Minister whether he was aware that the majority of the parents in that area were in favour of a co-educational primary <Col N="1789" /> school for their children and if he would take steps to ensure that the parental wishes in this matter were respected.  In his answer to this question, or to another one put down in the name of Deputy E. Collins, the Minister gave a certain amount of factual information which had been asked for, and failed completely to address himself to the question of whether he was aware of the educational preferences of the parents in the area and whether he would do anything to ensure that these preferences were built into the kind of school that he and the State are providing for them.  I find it very strange that the Minister avoided any mention of this survey because I believe that the evidence upon the basis of which I framed my questions was made available to him in his Department and that copies of the survey and of the relevant findings from the survey were available for his perusal if he had chosen to take them into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to explain the background to the situation I had better say something about the area itself.  Knocknaheeny is a new housing area in Cork with a very high proportion of local authority housing. They have an active community association and within that community association they have an education action group.  They are also desperately in need of a school.  When the question of a school was first mooted, members of the education action group within the community association decided to try to find out from the local community precisely what kind of school the local residents wanted.  They went along with a carefully and, may I say, scientifically planned survey, designed to try to elucidate parental preferences about the kind of school.  The results of this survey are extremely interesting and to the best of my knowledge have not been challenged by anybody.  Approximately one house in three of all the houses in the estate were surveyed at that time and the results of their survey show that almost two-thirds, some 61 per cent of those surveyed, were in favour of a mixed, that is co-educational, school.  There was no possibility of misunderstanding the very simple question that was put to the householders involved or of misunderstanding their response to it.  They were <Col N="1790" /> quite clear in their majority decision in favour of a co-educational school.</P>
    <P>The other questions were also of interest. One of them suggested that 90 per cent of the parents wanted a say in the running of their children's school; they already have that to some extent.  The other question evoked the information that three-quarters of the parents surveyed were in favour of multi-denominational education, that is children of different religious denominations being educated together.  The real point at issue here is whether the people in Knocknaheeny should have the kind of school they want, which is a co-educational school.  In order to double-check the veracity of this initial survey the education action group in the association recently carried out another survey in which they surveyed a considerably larger number of houses and asked them again for their opinions about the kind of school they required. At the time they carried out the second survey there were about 650 houses in the estate in question and 500 of those householders, representing about 75 per cent of the whole area, were quite clear and unambiguous in their desire for a co-educational primary school.  The other 150 were comprised of people who either could not be contacted, who were not in at the time of the survey, or declined to sign in favour of a co-educational school.</P>
    <P>All that the people of Knocknaheeny have been told so far is that they are getting a school and they have been given to understand that the first 16-teacher unit which will be built, while it will naturally have to accommodate both boys and girls, will have accommodation separated by a corridor, some Cork equivalent of the Berlin wall no doubt, for fear that these unfortunate children between the ages of four and 12 should mix together.  The people there are extremely upset and angry about the situation because they believe with some justice their very real views in this matter have not been listened to.  They have certainly not been listened to by the diocesan authorities who apparently made the initial application for money to build the school.  They hoped to have their plea listened to by the Minister and <Col N="1791" /> the Department of Education.  They have sent the Minister details of the survey and they have asked him to take whatever action is open to him in order to ensure that they have a co-educational primary school.</P>
    <P>At the very end of his reply today the Minister addressed himself to the question of whether a co-educational primary school would be built and he said that the question of whether a new school should be organised on a co-educational basis is a matter for local decision.  With respect, this begs all the questions that were answered.  If it is a matter for local decision, would the Minister say whose local decision is involved?  Is it going to be the local decision of the parents or of the diocesan authorities who have put up the initial capital necessary to get this school built?  There is a peculiar irony here because there are no local representative structures through which the parents can effectively communicate their wishes and impose them in respect of the kind of school that they are going to have.  Of course, there is not even a school management board because this school will be built and operated before the school management board is constituted. All the decisions will have been taken in advance and the parents have to face what is effectively a <i>fait accompli.</i> They not only have to face this <i>fait accompli</i>, they have to pay for it.</P>
    <P>In his answer, the Minister gave me the information that the two schools would cost around £760,000.  He declined to give me any details regarding the financing of the school buildings, but it is fairly commonly rumoured in Knocknaheeny that the Department will be paying ten-elevenths of the cost of the school buildings which indicates that the local community will be required to pay about one-eleventh.  Of course, they will also be required to pay for the site.  Even at this initial stage there is enough evidence to suggest that they will be asked for something upwards of £60,000 for the 16-teacher school.  The parents are being asked to pay over £60,000 for a school which is not the kind of school they want and they have no effective way &mdash;because they have not got £60,000 in their pockets now and because they <Col N="1792" /> do not own a site&mdash;of ensuring that the school which is being built will match the needs in this regard.  Not unnaturally, they have come to the Minister for Education and on their behalf I have asked the Minister for Education what he will do about it.  In answer to supplementary questions the Minister said he was quite happy that the decision taken by the Department to go ahead with the building of the school was what the parents wanted.  This statement is perfectly defensible, because the parents want a school urgently. However, it ignores one of the fundamental aspects, which is the kind of school they want.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was satisfied that the wishes of the parents and the good of education were being served by the decision taken by his Department.  This is evading the issue, because the fundamental decision taken by the Department has nothing to do with whether or not the school is co-educational, but simply with whether there is to be a school there.  Of course the parents want a school, and of course it is for the good of education that there should be a school; but the Minister is suppressing one of the fundamental points I am making.</P>
    <P>The Minister said later that he had no line one way or the other as to whether the school should be co-educational or not.  I said that the parents would be very disappointed that the Minister had no line on this issue.  This is not to say that, if the Minister suddenly decided that all our schools should be co-educational, he should rush around the country twisting the arms of parents, management and teachers and forcing them to accept a model imposed from our district.  We are saying that there is a dramatically expressed local preference for a co-educational primary school, that the structures to give effect to that local decision do not exist and in the absence of some structures of this kind the parents have come to the Minister and asked him to take action and he is apparently declining to do so.</P>
    <P>In response to supplementary questions, the Minister finally said that the people in the area would have the education they want in accordance with their <Col N="1793" /> wishes and he assured me that nothing would be left undone in achieving that objective.  Can the Minister really stand over that?  If the Minister stands over it he will have to make sure that the school provided in Knocknaheeny will be co-educational. Will the Minister tell the House what he now proposes to do to ensure that the primary school in Knocknaheeny will be co-educational?</P>
    <P>In the Government's election manifesto the section on education contained a preamble saying that Fianna Fáil recognised the parents as the primary and natural educators and their right to provide education in schools of their choice.  If that preamble means anything today, if it is to mean anything to the parents of Knocknaheeny, the Minister will have to come down from the fence on this issue and do what needs to be done to ensure that these parental rights the manifesto talked about become something real and do not remain merely verbiage, which is too common in political statements.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are problems. The structure of our primary education system, despite the widening of participation by parents and teachers in recent years, is still relatively inflexible and there is some difficulty in ensuring that parental wishes are respected in many instances.  Here we have a classic case in which a majority of parents, in a given geographical area to be served by a school whose provision has been decided in principle, are looking unambiguously for a certain type of school and apparently cannot get it.  It seems to be the situation, that the real choice of school lies not with the parents but with the people who provide money for school sites and for a portion of the building costs.  The money for school sites and for a portion of the building costs, is the money of the people, of the parents, and the organisation concerned are basically channels through which that money is brought from the purse and used to help construct the schools.  The system is not working in such a way as to deliver the school of their choice to the parents of that city.</P>
    <P>One could make an entirely different argument, a theoretical argument, about the issue.  One could express one's <Col N="1794" /> astonishment that in 1979 it should be thought inappropriate for small boys and girls in the county and city of Cork to be educated together.  That argument has already been resolved by the parents; they want their children to be educated together.  The initial proposal for a school to serve their area comes from an organisation which apparently does not want to see the children educated together and the people are now looking to the Minister to fill the gap, to take whatever powers are necessary to ensure that their wishes are respected.  In the light of the year we are living in, in the light of the Fianna Fáil manifesto and in the light of the Irish Constitution, it is surely not too much to ask.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to clarify the statement I made today in reply to Questions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 on today's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I got an application for a building grant for new school accommodation at Knocknaheeny, Cork, on 11 August 1977.  Early in 1977, before I took office, my inspector had been in the area appraising the growing suburb and coming to conclusions about what schools would be needed in the future, in so far as that could be done in a developing situation.  Approval in principle was given on 25 October 1977 for the provision of two 16-classroom schools.  The accommodation will be provided initially in one 16-classroom building, and the additional accommodation will be provided later as the area develops.  Both schools will be located on the same site in the townland of Hollyhill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nub of the question as outlined by Deputy Horgan is about internal organisation, as to whether they should be organised on a single sex or on a co-educational basis.  That is, as I stated to-day, a matter not for the Department but for local decision.  So far as my Department are concerned if the parents decide that they want a co-educational school in the area, then it will be a co-educational school.  Either form of organisation is acceptable to my Department. Deputy Horgan stated that the parents had no way of communicating <Col N="1795" /> their views.  I find it very hard to accept that from a man who claims he knows their views and that he is expressing their views in this House.  There seems to be a lack of logic somewhere in that.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Horgan stated at the outset of his speech, a school is desperately needed in the area.  It was that I was seized with rather than with anything else.  I took steps to see that planning got under way for a school.  I stress again that how the school is organised internally must be resolved locally.  Any assistance my Department can give to the local interests in their efforts to resolve any differences that may have arisen will be readily forthcoming.  I think Deputy Horgan implied that it would not be forthcoming; I say it will be.  It is desirable that this matter be settled quickly as planning of the first of the new schools, the 16-classroom school that I mentioned, is going ahead.  The accommodation will be required in the near future and it is important that there should be no avoidable delay in providing it.</P>
    <P>In any event there will be only one school building initially and it will be necessary to accommodate both boys and girls in that building.  Deputy Horgan referred to that.  All that seems to be at issue is whether the school should be organised in such a way that there will be separate classes for boys and girls or mixed classes of both boys and girls.  Getting a modicum of goodwill it should be possible to resolve that issue locally, speedily.  Personally, I would prefer co-educational organisation. What is required is that the local people come together and make their wishes known in a clear, unequivocal way.  A group wrote to me about objections to planning applications.  I thought it a rather naïve letter because everybody knows that the Minister for Education has no function in regard to planning and the internal organisation of the school has nothing to do with the planning authority under the auspices of the Minister for the Environment.  Internal organisation is a matter to be decided at local level and I hope it will be so decided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1796" /> In regard to Deputy Horgan's statement that I did not give any information about the financing of the school, I did in fact state that the two schools would cost £760,000, a substantial investment in the area.  I am sure that it will provide primary education of a very high standard. Without being accused of being chauvinistic, I think we can say that, both from the point of view of qualifications of teachers and the physical standards of our schools, we have something to be proud of.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan said that 90 per cent of the people wanted a say in the running of the schools.  I think the efforts made over the past few years&mdash;I do not claim any credit for them because they had got under way before my time&mdash;to involve parents in the management of schools are creditable and have made progress, which I hope will go still further.  There has been a deepening of interest of parents in regard to the running of schools.  I trust that interest spreads and deepens because in some cases it is not easy to interest people in the actual schools.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say what I have already repeated twice or three times that in the Department of Education we have not any particular line to follow on whether schools should be co-educational or cater for boys and girls separately.  The resources of the Department are available where difficulty has arisen and we are prepared to make those resources available to the people in that area so that they can get the best possible primary education for their children.</P>

Though such teachers can be recognised in special national schools catering for the education of children who are mentally handicapped or emotionally disturbed, they are not regarded as being suitable for recognition generally as national teachers.

      <P>A major refurbishing scheme was undertaken at the Gardiner Street Employment Exchange during September-December 1978, following staff industrial action.  The undertaking given by the Office of Public Works was that the work would be carried out as a top priority.  It was undertaken by that office's operatives and specialist contractors; specific completion dates were given and, consequently, only materials which were available from suppliers at that time and which met requirements were obtained.</P>
      <P>Office chairs, swivel: Two-thirds of the cost of these chairs is attributable to Irish materials and labour.  The Irish Goods Council has set 40 per cent Irish input as the minimum for participation in the Guaranteed Irish scheme.</P>
      <P>Counter chairs&mdash;&ldquo;Evertant&rdquo;: No high adjustable counter chairs are manufactured in the Republic of Ireland.  The chairs were, however, assembled in the State by Irish labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tretford carpeting: This item was <Col N="1698" /> manufactured in Ireland by Waterford Carpets Ltd.</P>
    <P>Floor tiles: Because of the intensive traffic in the two public offices, floor tiles had to be a of a heavy duty vinyl asbestos type.  The Accoflex tiles selected were the only ones available which previous experience indicated as satisfactory in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Wall tiles: The tiling contractor was limited to selecting those wall tiles readily available from stockists.  Stocks of the Irish manufactured Carrigaline tiles were not adequate and it was not feasible, in view of our undertakings, to await the delivery period for these tiles.  The alternative makes were therefore used.</P>
    <P>Canteen chairs: These were chosen because their skid base would avoid damage to the floor covering.  They were assembled in this country and no comparable Irish made product is available. The Irish input is well above the minimum requirement of 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Toilet pans: These were obtained from Brooks Thomas under the schedule contract for the supply and delivery of plumbing and ironmongery materials to the Office of Public Works.  Practically all of the toilet pans supplied&mdash;over 90 per cent&mdash;including those in Gardiner Street Employment Exchange were made by Armitage Shanks, Arklow, County Wicklow.  On occasion when demand is greater than supply, additional units, which are similar, are imported from their factories in England.</P>
    <P>Toilet seats: These Modus toilet seats were obtained because there was no suitable alternative seats available from Irish manufacturers at that time.</P>

The county council have been advised that a sixth scheme&mdash;a sewer extension from Prosperous towards Clane&mdash;was not eligible to be considered as part of their programme as it exceeded the £30,000 cost limit for individual small schemes.

    <P>4A.  For the purposes of this Schedule employment shall be taken to be continuous unless terminated by dismissal or by the employee's voluntarily leaving the employment; but for the purposes of this paragraph &ldquo;dismissal&rdquo; does not include a dismissal within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and in respect of which redress has been awarded under section 7 (1) (a) or 7 (1) (b) of that Act.</P>

    <P>(iii)  any cause (other than the voluntary leaving of his employment by the employee) not mentioned <Col N="1706" /> in clauses (i) to (ii) but authorised by the employer,</P>
    <P>(d)  any period during which an employee was absent from work because of a lock-out by his employer or because the employee was participating in a strike, whether such absence occurred before or after the commencement of this Act,</P>
    <P>(e)  a period of not more than 13 consecutive weeks during which the employee gave birth to a child,</P>
    <P>continuity of employment shall not be broken by such interruption whether or not notice of termination of the contract of employment has or had been given.</P>
    <P>(2)  During the year 1968 subparagraph (1) (b) shall have effect as if &ldquo;52 consecutive weeks&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;26 consecutive weeks&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>6.&mdash;Where a trade or business or an undertaking (whether or not it be an undertaking established by or under an Act of the Oireachtas), or part of a trade or business or of such an undertaking, was or is transferred from one person to another, the period of employment of an employee in the trade, business or undertaking (or in the part of the trade, business or undertaking) at the time of the transfer shall count as a period of employment with the transferee, and the transfer shall not break the continuity of the period of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to take amendment No. 41 in conjunction with amendment No. 40 because they are related. The amendments concern reckonable service and continuous employment in regard to decisions to be made in redundancy cases.  In borderline cases where decisions have to be made on service we can avoid hardship in the case of workers due three weeks' notice for which they were not paid by including that period and adding it to the overall service of the employee.  That could result in the employee qualifying for redundancy.  I am only concerned with borderline cases where employees are a week or two short of the required number of weeks to qualify.</P>

I have sympathy for the cases referred to by the Deputy and, without giving any assurance, I should like to tell him that before Report Stage I will look at the position in relation to borderline cases.  I am concerned that an employee would not be ruled out in such borderline cases. The number of people affected would be very small but this could lead to a lot of confusion.  On the other hand, the narrow belt mentioned by the Deputy will be considered, without guaranteeing anything.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 20 and 21, to delete &ldquo;An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;An tÚdarás um Oideachas agus Seirbhís Talmhaíochta&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to substitute &ldquo;education&rdquo; for &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  There is no doubt they mean two different things. The title of the previous Act has been changed to read &ldquo;training&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  This is a retrograde step.  I do not think the advisory service was ever meant to be a training organisation and it does not act as a training organisation.  &ldquo;Training&rdquo; means showing someone how to carry out work.  In the agricultural advisory service a great deal more is necessary.</P>
      <P>The first and primary objective of the advisory service is to educate farmers and to advise them.  It is degrading for the agricultural advisory service to say they are training farmers and that they are setting up in the industrial field an organisation similar to AnCO.  This appears to be the Minister's intention.  I do not believe the advisory service could, or was meant to, work in that way because it would not be good for agriculture.  A farmer might need to train a worker who has no experience in operating milking machinery but to say that the advisory service would be training the farmers would not be accepted by them.  The agricultural advisory service are educating.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to accept these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Bermingham. One of the Minister's major reasons for postponing a decision on the reorganisation of the advisory service, upsetting the work of his predecessor and causing considerable delay, was to enable him to change the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; to &ldquo;training&rdquo; throughout the Act which had been enacted by his predecessor.  His reasons were spurious and at best semantic and did not justify delaying a decision in relation to the advisory service and educational research.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of this new body will encompass education to a significant <Col N="1710" /> degree.  Training is part of education, not <i>vice versa.</i>&ldquo;Education&rdquo; is the global term and therefore is the term which should be included in the title rather than the narrower term &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  I am not saying that part of the work of this authority will not encompass training; it will, but it will also encompass education. That is the point being made by Deputy Bermingham.  &ldquo;Education&rdquo; is a wider term which includes training as well as other aspects of improving the human mind and potential.</P>
    <P>I will give a practical example of this. If a farmer is to run his business properly he must know a good deal about economies, changes in the market place, what is proposed in Brussels in relation to farm prices and the relative changes in one commodity as against another. That is economics and nobody would say that when learning economics one is being trained.  Studying economics is part of one's education because it is a broad liberal subject and the learning of it is an educational process.  The same goes for other aspects of farming.  A farmer will have to have a knowledge of geology, soil science, crop husbandry and so on, all very broad subjects involving in many cases significant concepts of an abstract nature.  To develop, plan and implement new ideas on his farm, a farmer has to be educated in science.  Again, that will be part of the function of this new authority.</P>
    <P>The authority will have responsibility for the agricultural schools run by the Department of Agriculture and by various religious orders and foundations with aid from the Department.  Is the Minister seriously suggesting that these agricultural colleges are not educational institutions and that their primary purposes is not education?  Of course it is. Why then is he so anxious to remove the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; where it appeared in the previous Act?  To my mind, this is a backward approach to the whole concept.</P>
    <P>Training is concerned with teaching people skills, physical or mental, which are essentially repetitive.  Education is concerned not just with that.  It is concerned with giving people the mental equipment to deal with problems that were unforeseen by the trainer or the <Col N="1711" /> educator.  There is no doubt that in agricultural education that is what is being done.  Farmers are being given information, advice and education so that they can cope with unforeseen problems. That is education in the broad sense. The Minister in going back on the work of his predecessor and substituting the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for &ldquo;education&rdquo; is narrowly defining the concept in the Bill and is not in conformity with the facts.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has gone to such trouble to change the title and replace the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; by &ldquo;training&rdquo;, and as this is going into an Act of the Oireachtas&mdash;one assumes that if things go into an Act of the Oireachtas they are of some significance because one does not put in or remove something from an Act unless it means something&mdash;I want to ask him one question: What does it mean when he substitutes &ldquo;training&rdquo; for &ldquo;education&rdquo;?  Does it mean that some of the courses which are presently being run by bodies which are now being put under the aegis of AnCOT will be restricted because they are not sufficiently orientated and there is too much education involved in them?  Does it mean that there will be any practical change?  If there is to be a practical change the Minister must tell us now what practical change there will be.  If there will not be a practical change I ask him to justify to the House the waste of its time in considering changes in this Bill of his predecessor merely to change words which have no practical meaning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am naturally in support of this amendment because it gets us back to the terminology used in the 1977 Bill, where it was explained that education included training.  It was necessary for this Minister to do the same thing and say that training includes education but he wanted to pretend that he was producing something new when he was not.  It does not matter a lot what one calls this because it is what is done that matters in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the right of the Minister to come in here to proceed with the Committee Stage of a Bill that has been radically altered since the Second Stage <Col N="1712" /> was discussed.  It is not the same Bill because in the first instance the Government were paying the entire cost of those services and now the farmers are being asked by a Government decision to pay the entire cost.  Since the discussion took place on the Second Stage we have a completely new Bill.  I submit that the correct procedure would now be to have this Bill withdrawn and re-introduced as a new Bill.  If this Committee Stage discussion is allowed to take place and a discussion on the other Stages takes place, I believe the Bill will be found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why I believe it will be found unconstitutional, not only because we are now discussing a different Bill but also because it is without precedent to single out one section of Irish society and say to them &ldquo;You must pay the full cost of this service whether or not you use it and the rest of Irish society will pay no part of the bill&rdquo;.  I challenge the right of the House to go ahead with discussion of this Bill which I believe is being illegally discussed in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed that, since the Minister made so many changes in the Bill he failed to heed our plea to put &ldquo;education&rdquo; back into the Bill and not allow it to go ahead with the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; in it.  This matter was dealt with very fully on the Second Reading.  Education is vital in the development and the growth of agriculture, because the growth of the nation depends on the growth of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The insertion of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; would not inhibit the Minister in any way in changing the Bill of his predecessor. Deputy Bruton gave a few practical instances of how the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; is needed in agriculture.  I would like to <Col N="1713" /> refer to a few more.  Farm accounts are a very important matter.  How many farmers are equipped to do farm accounts? If the Minister asks his civil servants they will tell him how badly equipped farmers are to keep accounts.  If they are to run their farms properly or if they are to have any idea of the direction they are going, they must be able to keep accounts. A special course should be introduced and finance should play an important part in it.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to change his mind on this issue and to substitute the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; in the Bill.  He is making a vital mistake by downgrading the need for education in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to that of the other speakers on this issue.  As Deputy Bruton rightly pointed out, a man has to be well educated to farm successfully.  It is not a matter of being trained in tractor maintainence or the maintenance of a dairy herd.  Every farmer must be well educated to survive.  I cannot see any justification for the change the Minister is making.  He has a lot more experience of Europe than I have, but the whole emphasis in agriculture in Europe is on education.</P>
      <P>A lot of work is being done here by voluntary bodies.  We only contribute a very small amount to the Farm Apprenticeship Board who are training for jobs which are in existence.  Those jobs have not to be created but those people are being given very little help.  There is a great clamour at the moment for more places in agriculture colleges.  How many people were refused places in those colleges this year?  What are the Minister's plans for a new college?  The whole emphasis must be on education if farming is to survive and to do well under EEC regulations.  The Minister's Bill would be improved by inserting the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in the title.  The spotlight is on the education of young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton spoke about the diversity of farming.  We have now new problems because of intensification. The farmer has to know a lot about fungicides and herbicides.  The farmer <Col N="1714" /> has to be well up in fungicides and herbicides and must literally be a veterinary surgeon in his own right.  If he is in the beef or pig industry he has a lot to learn. He must have a broad education to cope with the new situation.  He needs a wealth of experience.  The whole emphasis of this Bill should be on education. I would ask the Minister to co-operate with us and allow that word to stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the amendments to relate to the Title of the Bill.  We have had a repetition of the Second Stage discourse on what Deputy Bruton has called the semantics of the choice between the words &ldquo;training&rdquo; and &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  Deputy Bermingham says that there is a difference and in the interests of accuracy and the proper use of the most accurate words, either in Irish or English, I felt the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comhairle Oiliúna&rdquo; should be used in the Title of the Bill.  Incidentally we use the Irish title since this is Ireland.  I felt the new authority should have an Irish title, which it did not have under the old regime because of ancient, inherited inclinations which are traceable to its origins.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Having called the difference semantic and therefore of no particular importance, Deputy Bruton went on to say that there are specialist subjects such as farm economics and soil science.  I did not grasp at that stage whether Deputy Clinton envisages in the future educational establishments where degree courses or third-level courses of some kind would be provided in those and many other specialised skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Fianna Fáil have in mind is the production of better farmers by training them better in their jobs.  We are assuming that a good general education will already have been received by those who will be the main users of comhairle services. I would think the use of the word <Col N="1715" />&ldquo;education&rdquo; is proper, meaning the drawing out of a particular person and his equipment with a fairly wide general knowledge.  I do not foresee a time when every farmer will be a very specialised fountain of knowledge about soil science, soil chemistry, physics and geology, crop husbandry and parasitology and so on.  That is really going to the level of semantics.  We had a declared intention of establishing a training organisation, not similar to but related to the AnCO service for the provision of better technicians.  These technicians work on the land with animals and with crops.  It is precisely as Deputy Bermingham suggested.  There is an important difference, but we did not go for the general and more diffuse objective of a specialised agricultural education which would probably be conferred to some degree by a third-level course in agriculture such as provided by the universities.  Such a course is not available to the average farmer.  It may be available to Fine Gael farmers but not to farmers as a whole.  We must provide a better service than the one which is available already and that is the intention in the Bill.  That is the reason for changing the title.  We express our intention succinctly by our selection of words in the Title of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Advisory work is evolving at a very rapid rate and since our entry to the Community the whole complexion of agriculture has been revolutionised.  Sometimes this simple message takes a long time to percolate into various quarters of our society, not necessarily political quarters.  We have to contemplate the situation where there will be rapid change.  I imagine there will be rapid change in the advisory field <Col N="1716" /> within the next decade and there may be a necessity to amend this Bill, for instance. Rapid changes are taking place in the field of specialist advice.  The old-fashioned GP agricultural advisers provided by the committees of agriculture have been doing trojan work and will continue to do so, but there is a new process going on.  Interestingly, it is being financed in the dairy sector by the dairy co-operatives.  Interesting inquiries are being made by meat firms as well regarding animal husbandry and meat production and it is in that area that we must envisage the provision of specialist advisers, not general practitioners.  In some cases these specialist advisers work with committees of agriculture and ideally that is how they all ought to work.</P>
      <P>In the dairying sector they are working in order to raise farmers' incomes and output and thereby guarantee employment and throughput in their own factories.  It is motivated by very mundane factors.  In the meat industry it is a general truth to say that we do not have meat processing plants as much as slaughter houses exporting slaughtered meat.  There were fewer facilities a few years ago than there are now for the enterprising beef processer who wished to process his meat further.  The inhibitions that the meat processer laboured under a couple of years ago have been removed.  In that context there is need for training.  It is not education and that is why I am asking the House to reject these amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not very impressed by what the Minister has said: that he chose the right word in &ldquo;training&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;education&rdquo;. As he said, the agriculture industry will be expanding and will be revolutionised. It will be revolutionised by new methods and the farmer, who will be a free agent, will have to be educated.  The Minister is juggling with words when he says that it is training, because to me it is educating the farmer to do the right thing.  The farmer must be convinced first of all, and that means that he must be educated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that the ordinary farmer will probably never be a scientist <Col N="1717" /> for testing soil and I agree with that. These tests must be carried out as an educational process and the farmer must be shown what he can grow in that soil and the methods that should be used. That is education, not training.  A man cannot be trained how to operate a tractor. He must be educated on how to run his farm properly and how to use his soil to the best advantage.  &ldquo;Education&rdquo; is the paramount word in this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it could not.  It is a permanent process, whether it is done through night classes or county committees of agriculture.  The knowledge is in the Agricultural Institute.  They have the technical knowledge and it is up to them to convey it to the farmer through the agricultural adviser.  The Minister is splitting this.  About 60 per cent of the farmers have not got this knowledge.  In this Bill the Minister is locking up this knowledge and putting it into safes in the Agricultural Institute.  I am more than disappointed at the Minister's whole approach. I interpret what he said to mean that there is not a great need for agricultural education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>With the Minister as head of agriculture this is a fatal situation. The Minister is making a big error here and may direct those who are involved in agricultural training and research in the wrong direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the AnCO <Col N="1718" /> courses.  These are three month courses. The Minister asked me if this could be done in six weeks.  It cannot be done in six weeks.  It must be an ongoing process related to the type of farming the person is carrying out.  That is what agricultural education has to be.  The AnCO courses train a man to cut out a piece of iron and measure it.  It is not the same in farming. There is the question of finance, which is massive in agriculture.  If a farmer does not have proper knowledge of how to borrow money and invest it, great mistakes can be made.  The Minister knows this as well as I do.  Farmers must be educated on how to invest money whether it be in machinery, land or stock.  No comparison can be drawn between the need for education in agriculture and the AnCO courses and this is what the Minister has done.  He is on the wrong track.</P>
    <P>As regards specialist fields, the creameries are specialists in milk production.  Are they specialists in all other sides of farming?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a very good development but it will not take care of the entire need in the milk industry as far as the farmer is concerned.  It is vital that he is trained in the use of finance, AI and equipment.  These are all separate things from what the Minister is talking about. There is also the question of producing feed for cows.  A man in milk production is not qualified in some of these fields&mdash;for example, in cereals.</P>

      <P>We are back to the Fine Gael dilemma about education and their evident incapacity to grasp this simple point.  A young man or woman going into farming is almost always well educated.  This applies to young people going into engineering or whatever. <Col N="1720" /> Thereafter he goes to work.  Sometimes he has a year in an agricultural school and sometimes he has a farm apprenticeship that is concerned with the training of the going out and doing farming work.  None of that is education.  It is training the young person to do his job better that he would have done otherwise.  It is essential.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bermingham, in his philosophical approach to this, said that I was degrading agriculture, as if to suggest we were merely training them&mdash;not educating them&mdash;but expecting them to be already educated to some degree. Education must be a general approach. It is the evolution of a philosophy suitable to the job you are doing.  Training consists of the mechanics of doing the job.  You are taking a young person by the hand and saying &ldquo;This is the way to do it.  You watch me doing it&rdquo;.  That is training and that is largely what the new organisation will be doing.  They will be dealing with people who are actually farming for their living.  The main task is to improve their living and by any stretch of the imagination and with a middling understanding of the King's English to call that &ldquo;education&rdquo; is a too liberal extension of the word.  It is training and there is nothing debasing about it.  It is ennobling rather than debasing.  If Fine Gael Deputies could grasp this simple point there would be no need for what they themselves have called all these semantics.</P>

      <P>I agree with much of what the Minister has said.  Training a young man is showing him the way to do the job.  Farmers will have a basic education, possibly even a good education, which will probably include even a farm apprenticeship. Farming is a complex subject and there will have to be several new approaches with regard to our processing industries.  Education is necessary to show what are the right kinds of operations. That is the predominant part of the advisory services programme.  To me education is showing a person what is the right and economical thing to do. The farmer is quite capable of doing the job but often he is not convinced that it is the right thing to do.  This is where education comes in.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister a very simple question.  I asked if there was any practical significance in the change he made in substituting the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for &ldquo;education&rdquo; or if it was purely a change of words.  The Minister said there was a change in philosophy.  I asked if he could give me a concrete example of how this changed philosophy would be expressed, for instance, in the courses that might be given at Warrenstown college or in the work of the advisory services.  If there is a change in philosophy presumably it means something and, therefore, influences the activities being run under this institution. I should like the Minister to give me not a lecture but concrete examples.  What changes will occur in the operation of the advisory services under this Bill because the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; has been substituted for the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; that would not have happened under the old Bill?  What changes will occur in the operation of agricultural colleges under this Bill now that they are described as being engaged in training that would not have happened if the old Bill with the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; was left?  If there is a change in philosophy there must be a change in practice because philosophy that does not affect practice is not worth talking about.  I should like the Minister to tell us exactly the type of changes he has in mind resulting from this momentous change in the use of words that he has inserted in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I had thought that the debate on Second Stage would have introduced some glimmer of light into this matter.  It appears that Opposition Deputies have difficulty in comprehending the basics of this matter. Deputy Bruton wants concrete examples. There are dozens of things one could say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great sources of mastitis infection in dairy herds at present is the improper use of milking machine apparatus. There are certain techniques that can be learned and instructions can be given about them in centres of education in a short period.  These instructions can be given in agricultural colleges&mdash;I presume they are&mdash;and in classes conducted by committees of agriculture&mdash;as <Col N="1722" /> I presume they are.  A great deal of information about this and other matters is disseminated by An Foras Talúntais. The farmer can be equipped with new knowledge in a short period but by no stretch of the imagination could the conveying of that specialised knowledge be called education.</P>
    <P>Deputy D'Arcy put words into my mouth to the effect that I said education was not important.  It is all-important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The proper assimilation of facts like this is related to a more general education in the basics that every child normally gets at secondary school.  I am talking about physics and chemistry.  That will teach a child the rudiments of soil chemistry.  Physics deal with the behaviour of soil under different moisture conditions and many other things.  Of course mathematics also come into it.  It is the rudimentary gateway to the whole area of farming financing and surveying.  Without this general education the farmer will always be at a disadvantage and he will have to make up himself where he is deficient. Many of them, particularly the successful farmers, can do this.</P>
      <P>I am talking about a more specialised type of training that will help farmers to face the next decade to begin with.  In the next decade we will be looking for rapid increases in production in the dairy, meat, pigs, cereal and sugar beet sectors. We have the potential to get them.  We have the knowledge that our present performance is nothing like it should be. The most acute requirement is specialist training.</P>
      <P>Many Fine Gael Deputies&mdash;not the Deputies who have contributed to this debate&mdash;find out about farming matters second-hand.  They would need to recognise the state of rapid change our agricultural economy is in and its enormous potential, that there is a pressing need for better training of the young men and women going into the industry. They will need a lot of education with a little bit of farming flair.  That is the error Fine Gael are falling into.  We are not dealing with general airy-fairy things here.  We are dealing with opportunities and special requirements.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister for a concrete example of the change that will occur in the practice of the advisory and educational services as a result of the Minister's substitution of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for &ldquo;education&rdquo; throughout the Bill.  He gave me an example.  He spoke of the improper use of milking machines causing mastitis and he said that short courses could be run to teach farmers how properly to use milking machines.  He gave that as an example of a change that would occur as a result of changing the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; to &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  I want to be clear if the Minister is saying that a course like that could not have been run by the National Agricultural Authority set up by his predecessor and which will now be run by the new authority.

      <P>I do not think the Minister seriously meant that a course could not have been run under the NAA but that it can now be run under the new authority because of the use of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  If the Minister did not mean that, what he said is not an answer to my question.  I know the Minister loves to answer general questions which enables him to go on a long verbal voyage on <Col N="1724" /> which few of us can follow him, so I will ask him a simple question.  What change in the curricula of the agricultural colleges, say in Warrenstown, will take place because they will be under a training authority instead of an educational authority?  Does he think that changes will be made as a result of this, that there will be a change in philosophy, not merely a change in words?  Does he believe that these colleges, which previously were operating under an educational Act, will now change their courses in any material or philosophical way?  If they are not to change their courses, then this is merely a change of words and of no significance.  If they are to change their courses, then there is to be a change in philosophy.  If the latter is so the Minister should tell us precisely what the change will be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bruton is asking me in effect to look into my crystal ball and say what the comhairle will do about courses in any year.  It is not in my capacity to do that.  What is in my capacity to do, and I will do it in due course, is to compose the board in a certain way.  I have adverted to the importance of the food processing industry to the whole farming sector and its growth. I am glad of this because it is producing more jobs on the land than off it.  People in that industry will have a new strong voice in the formulation of the comhairle and it is they, not I, who will determine the policy of the comhairle.  Naturally, I will consult with the comhairle from time to time on the general scheme of work and any Minister for Agriculture will consult with the comhairle on certain aspects that he considers to be of special importance.  That is only right because we must remember that we are here in an Irish Parliament, the meeting place of the democratically elected representatives of the people.  If this Parliament ceases to be that, we are all in trouble.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the answer to Deputy Bruton's question is that I cannot say in advance what the council will do, but I have certain ideas on how they should be composed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The composition of the comhairle has been laid down in the Bill <Col N="1725" /> and the Minister has only a small say in regard to the people who will compose it because most of them will be nominated by different bodies.  Therefore, answering my question by reference to the composition of the board is not an answer at all.  The number of people the Minister will be appointing will be quite small and therefore I do not see how he could make any significant difference in the overall result.  He has said that by the substitution of one word for another he is asking the House to agree to a major change in philosophy, yet when he was asked to give concrete examples of the possible results of that change he said that would be a matter for the board.  He is not coming clean with the House.  The Minister went to the trouble of making this change, and regardless of the board he must have a clear idea of what this major change will be in terms of practical results in County Kilkenny and elsewhere.  All the Minister has said is that it is a matter for the board, and I do not think the House should be asked to agree to buy a pig in a poke, which, on the face of it, is a regressive move.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister at least said that the question of education is all important.  He stressed the need for general education and specialised advice through short courses.  I do not accept that.  Education in farming must be a continuing process.  There must be courses over a three-year period, the majority of which would have to be night courses.  The Minister gave an instance of mastitis and said the greatest reason for it is the wrong use of machines.  That is not correct.  There are various reasons for the high incidence of mastitis and if the Minister believes he will train a milk man by some short course on how to put the cups on the teats, that that is all that is needed, he is on the wrong track as far as milk production is concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>These fundamental problems are the Minister's problems. He is in charge of agriculture and it is our duty to point them out to him.  Why is the overall milk production down to <Col N="1726" /> 640 gallons per cow while across the water it is 1,000 gallons per cow?  Why are we producing only two tons of barley per acre while across the water they are producing three tons of barley per acre?  The Minister must answer these questions and satisfy us.  He must also try to satisfy the farmers.  It is his job to educate the farmers.  Lack of education is the cause of the problems. The Minister has never had such a good opportunity to put these courses into operation, but his actions are only isolating the Agricultural Institute.</P>

Even the Minister admits that it has an educational function.  The agricultural adviser must also be a development officer.  The production of water schemes and so on for farmers is a broader issue than training.  The Minister is taking a retrograde step in eliminating education.  The idea is abroad that the authority will only be a training authority, and I appeal to the Minister to include education.</P>

      <P>This is a great breach of order since it is in no way related to section 3 of the Agriculture Bill.  What Deputy Bruton is asking me to do is to arrogate to myself the function of the Minister for Finance whose function under section 3 is very clearly stated.  It is merely an irregular, disorderly approach to raising the question of recent statements by the Minister for Finance on any Stage of a Bill unrelated to any such measures referred to by the Minister for Finance.  It is highly out of order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is true that, as the Minister said, the Government are collectively responsible.  We are told that in this situation which we have been asked to approve the expenses incurred in the administration of the Act shall, to such extent as may be sanctioned by the Minister for Finance, be paid out of money provided by the Oireachtas.  The Minister for Finance is specifically mentioned in the section and the role of the Minister for Finance under the section and his place in it must be defended and explained by the Minister who is taking charge of the Bill.  Therefore, in asking about any conditions that may be applied by the Minister for Finance to the exercise of the function he has under this section&mdash;namely, the sanction of the expense&mdash;in asking questions about any conditions that might be applied in relation <Col N="1732" /> to the grant of that sanction by the Minister for Finance, and in asking it of the Minister who is in charge of the Bill here in this House, namely, the Minister for Agriculture, we are perfectly in order in seeking answers to those questions. There is no doubt that that is the case.  I ask the Minister if the Minister for Finance, in determining this sanction for the expenses of the comhairle, would have regard to or be in any sense influenced by the existence or otherwise of the amounts of money which may be raised by any particular tax.</P>

Moneys provided by the Oireachtas come from the Exchequer for every Bill passed here and there is no question as to how the Exchequer raises that money.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty.  Does the Minister anticipate that the comhairle will be receiving receipts from other sources than the Oireachtas to a significant extent, for instance through any form of collection on some farmers?  We know that in the case of research, for instance, there is at present a levy on certain commodities for the purposes of financing research? It is possible that could be done also for educational advice.  Does the Minister anticipate that the comhairle will be receiving any moneys independently in that way to a significant extent apart from the expenses which we are told under section 3 will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas?  Could he say what type, if not what amount of money does he expect to come to the comhairle from sources other than those mentioned in section 3?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Committees of agriculture are to some extent self-financed. They will continue to function. I do not think it possible for reasons I have already stated to say in the case of any Act what portion of it will be Exchequer contributions except for the Minister's administrative expenses and that is what the section relates to.  These expenses will be defrayed after sanction by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that committees of agriculture will still be functioning and that they will receive money from rates.  I presume, therefore, that the expenses referred to in section 3 exclude money received from rates.  In the event of any other tax being introduced which might be described by those introducing it as having the purpose of paying for part of the agricultural and educational services&mdash;we do not know whether that will happen or not&mdash;would that money be provided under this section as an expense paid out of moneys granted by the Oireachtas or would it be paid directly to the comhairle?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is still reverting to what the Chair has said would not be allowed.  He is referring to the manner in which the Minister <Col N="1738" /> for Finance will discharge his obligations to the Exchequer and the manner in which he will disburse moneys which he collects.  That is not before the House. The provisions of this year's budget are before the House in another form but not in this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to find out a simple matter: what percentage, roughly, and what type of money will be provided other than under this section to the comhairle?  The Minister has told us county committees of agriculture are self-financing and, therefore, rates are excluded.  If rates are excluded and do not come within this section does that mean that in the event of an agricultural levy being introduced that would also be excluded and not come within the compass of this section and be paid directly to the comhairle or would it come within the compass of this section?</P>

      <P>It must be clear to the Deputy that the administration of the comhairle will incur certain expenses and these expenses will be defrayed by the Minister.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the Minister, in his own right, would have administration expenses in relation to the comhairle in that he will have to answer correspondence from the comhairle, will have to deal with complaints concerning the activities of the comhairle and pass those complaints on to the comhairle. They would qualify as administration expenses in the Minister's office but I should like to know if this means that in agreeing to section 3 we are merely agreeing to expenses directly incurred by the Minister or are we agreeing to the payment by the Minister of grants to the comhairle received either from the Oireachtas or some other source?  If we are talking about the administration expenses of the Minister's own office we are talking about a small sum of money but if, on the other hand, we are talking about the £30 million it takes to run these services we are talking about a very large sum.  In the former case we would not be that worried about any conditions that might be imposed in the sanction of the Minister for Finance but if it is the latter case&mdash;in section 3 we are talking about the entire finances of the comhairle&mdash;we would have good reason to be worried about any conditions that might be applied in relation to matters which will be discussed later.</P>

Does the Minister for Finance impose any conditions? For instance, would the Minister for Finance say to the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;I am not prepared to agree to the finance under this section because you do not agree to something else?&rdquo;  May I ask the Minister a simple and direct question?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 44, to delete &ldquo;&lsquo;education&rsquo;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The issue is not very different from the one we discussed earlier in relation to amendments Nos. 1 and 2.  They concern the change which is being made by the Minister in the use of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; and its substitution by &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  We have gone almost as far as one could productively go in discussing this issue because the Minister, despite repeated invitations, has not given any significant indication as to what difference in practice will result, in different colleges or in the advisory services of different counties, because those bodies according to this Bill are no longer to be concerned with education but with training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has not given us examples. However, he has told us that because the change is being made, that the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; is being replaced throughout the Bill with the word &ldquo;training&rdquo;, this involves a major change in philosophy.  Those are the Minister's words.  We have been trying to get an answer from him as to what in practice this major change in philosophy means. The best example of all to cite, because it will most likely be affected by the <Col N="1745" /> change in philosophy, is the work of the agricultural colleges.  Those have been known by many people throughout the country as educational institutions. Places like Warrenstown College are undoubtedly educational institutions.  They involve the education of young farmers. They are concerned with practical agriculture but they are also concerned with wider educational issues, helping them to be good, efficient farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a deliberate decision to change the Bill under which those educational institutions will operate by substituting throughout the Bill the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; in relation to their role.  I would like to know what in practice will be the changes that will occur in those colleges as a result of this.  The Minister has said that this is primarily a matter for the new board of agriculture but that new board does not yet exist.  The Minister is making changes in the Act now and in so doing he must have some idea as to what results will be brought about by these changes which, he says, represent a major change in philosophy. He must have some idea how the changes will affect courses in the agricultural colleges.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will come clean this time and say precisely what he has in mind.  In the case of agricultural colleges, does he want any of the courses operating at present to be dropped because they are too educational and have not a sufficient training bias?  Will he write to the colleges drawing their attention to the provisions of the Act and telling them they have no business carrying on a particular course because it constitutes education and not training? We know that what is mentioned &ldquo;in the Act&rdquo; is of great importance.  People in the public service will sometimes say they cannot do a certain thing because it is not authorised in the Act.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has gone to such trouble to change &ldquo;education&rdquo; to &ldquo;training&rdquo; throughout the Bill, are there some activities of the advisory service or of the agricultural colleges to which he objects because they are too educational and not sufficiently of a training nature?  If so, he should say so; if not, he should tell us why it is necessary to make the changes <Col N="1746" /> at all.  What is the point of this change if there is not to be a change on the ground?  If there is to be a change, what is it?  Does the Minister anticipate that any change will be made in the activities of the agricultural colleges?  Does he anticipate that any direction will be issued by his Department to the agricultural colleges because of the major change in philosophy in this Bill and on foot of the substitution of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for &ldquo;education&rdquo;?  I should like a frank answer because it is impossible to carry on any debate on the merits or demerits of the substitution of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; if we do not know what the practical results will be and if the Minister will not give explicit answers to these questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must repeat much that we have said during the discussion of this Bill.  We have taken into account the substitution of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  I was glad to hear the Minister say that education is all important.  The emphasis throughout the Bill should be on education.</P>
      <P>The county committees of agriculture went to great expense over the years in building offices in most districts within their administrative areas and the purpose of these offices was the on-going education of farmers.  It will be a backward step if the Minister believes training is all that is needed in agriculture today.  The offices to which I have referred operated the EEC schemes.  Much of this educational work must be carried on after working hours, that is, after 6 p.m.  As a member of the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture, I believe that farmers need on-going educational courses.  The more often the Minister responsible for agriculture stresses the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; the more likely it is that farmers will be interested.  Changing agricultural techniques need specialists in every field and a specialist can impart information only through classes in these centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have emphasised low production rates right across the board.  Certain farmers have reached a very high level of production, but they have educated and trained themselves in their own specialist fields.  They represent only 5 per cent or <Col N="1747" /> 10 per cent of those engaged in agriculture.  I am prepared to back that up with figures.  While I was chairman of the Wexford County Committee of Agriculture I asked the chief agricultural officer for some indication of how we stood in relation to maximum production. All the evidence is available in the Minister's office.  Our average milk production is about 650 gallons per cow. We produce on average two tons of barley per acre and approximately the same amount of wheat.  Certainly we have advanced over the years in the production of beet and I believe this was done by education.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to speak on this Bill as often as possible in an effort to persuade the Minister of the absolute need for education in agriculture.  The more we emphasise that need the greater is the chance that farmers will accept it.  It is not only farmers who will benefit by the expansion of agriculture.  The whole nation will benefit if we achieve the necessary growth.  Our potential is something like 60 per cent, according to the experts.  There is much leeway to be made up and the Minister must realise this.</P>
    <P>Short crash courses of six or seven weeks' duration, such as those organised by AnCO, are completely inadequate. The proper course takes approximately three years, based on 100 hours per year.  People with specialised knowledge must be brought in to educate people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments.  I have already made my case regarding the difference in the two words.  I believe most of the work being carried out at present by the advisory staffs of the county committees of agriculture is educational; it is not training. I refer to farm schools which young people are subsidised to attend at hours which suit them while carrying on their farming work.  This is not training, it is education.  As a member of the committee of agriculture in Kildare I believe these courses are educational and are the principle and most important part played by the advisory service.  I have <Col N="1748" /> given various reasons why &ldquo;education&rdquo; should be left in the Bill, even if it is in conjunction with &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  If the Minister wants to leave &ldquo;training&rdquo; in and feels strongly about it perhaps he would have &ldquo;training and education&rdquo; in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to go back over the debate we had on Second Stage and what we had today.  I would say to Deputy Bruton that Warrenstown is a private school run by an order of clergy.  They can arrange their own courses in whatever way they think best themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Ballyhaise?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that the imparting of this information was necessary. Deputy Bruton seemed to labour under the misapprehension that I would in some way interfere with Warrenstown and its courses.  I have no such scheme in mind.  I do not see a reversion to the old, as-you-were situation.  I foresee a condition of rapid change and development. There will be no opting for one system rather than the other.  Whatever system is operated will have to be altered and adjusted to meet the needs of future years.</P>
      <P>Some of what Deputy D'Arcy said about our capacity to expand production is beyond doubt, but he seemed to imply that the farmers were an uneducated and rather ignorant lot.  I dispute that.  It is one of the reasons why the substitution of an accurate word for an inaccurate one is most important in this Bill.  To make such an assertion is improper because some our best farmers did not have the advantages other people may have had as regards education.  Out of their own acumen and intelligence many of them have achieved excellence. It is our intention to make the means of propagation of knowledge in the farming sector more efficient.  That is the purpose behind this section.  With the greatest of respect, I would look upon these amendments as quibbling.  I ask the House to reject them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he would look upon these amendments as quibbles and yet he said that the changes <Col N="1749" /> he is making in the Bill by substituting for &ldquo;education&rdquo; the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; represents a major change in philosophy. Is he saying that in questioning this major change in philosophy we are merely engaged in quibbles?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There is undoubtedly a major change in the philosophy of agriculture in relation to Irish agriculture including the advising and training aspect of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister first used the term in response to a question from me as to whether or not the substitution for the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; was a mere change of words. He said that it was not, that it represented a major change in philosophy.  He was not talking about agriculture in general but about the implication of the change in these words. Am I misrepresenting the Minister in that?  The Minister is not disagreeing with what I am saying.  In making this change he believes that it represents a major change in philosophy.  Therefore, if we are questioning that major change in philosophy how can he say we are merely quibbling?  If it is a major change in philosophy, questioning it could not, by definition, be merely quibbling.  It is of major importance.</P>
      <P>The Minister failed to answer my question.  He decided he could get out of the question by saying I asked about Warrenstown.  I asked about agricultural colleges in general.  If he does not want to answer about Warrenstown on the grounds that it is a college run by the Salesian order, what about Ballyhaise which is directly administered by his Department?  Does the Minister envisage that the major change in philosophy represented by the change in words will result in any change in the courses presently being provided in Ballyhaise? The Minister has direct responsibility for Ballyhaise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a process of continuing change because the world is changing, but the Minister is seeking to move that change in a particular direction so far as agricultural education is concerned by the change of &ldquo;education&rdquo; to &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  I do not want to lecture about general agricultural trends&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Precisely what change does the Minister envisage will occur in the courses in Ballyhaise over the next five years, not as a result of general trends in agriculture but as a direct result of the change of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; to &ldquo;training&rdquo; everywhere it appears in the previous agricultural Bill? That is my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that as a result of the Bill in general and the new approach to the question of agricultural advice and training there will be many dramatic changes.  It would be quite absurd to predict some of these changes because they will be dealing with situations that will arise in the future and with the industry's requirements in the future. It is safe to say that in relation to the level of dairy and cereal production, both of which Deputy D'Arcy mentioned, and in the matter of farm incomes and the propagation of knowledge the facilities available will be expanded.</P>
      <P>One of the main purposes of the Bill is to establish a council or comhairle of agricultural instruction.  That is what the title signifies.  The task of procuring these ends will be given to them.  They and I, or my successor, will take counsel together from time to time in the light of the existing circumstances and so adapt their training to that best suited to the requirements of the young people going into farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions made by the Fine Gael Deputies so far have been a reversion to the old situation and the underlining implication that farmers, by definition, are a rather ignorant lot who require education.  Does anybody contemplate <Col N="1751" /> a parallel establishment for the legal or medical profession or that they should have re-education courses?  Is it not always assumed that they are educated already?  Sometimes it is inaccurate to make that assumption but it is made automatically.  It is not made in the case of farmers.  That philosophic flaw is absolutely endemic in Fine Gael; they cannot get rid of it because they come from the better endowed section of the agricultural population, or at least many of them come from that section.  They may have had the advantages of a better quality education than many of the young people going into farming who cannot aspire to it.  However, they can aspire to something much more than they could aspire to ten or 15 years ago. The reason is that the Fianna Fáil Government of the time provided the facilities for a good secondary education and it is on this question that Fine Gael are having all the trouble.</P>
    <P>We must begin with the person who is well educated, the young man or the girl leaving a second-level school with a leaving certificate.  Upon that minimum we build and if further education is required it will have to be third level.  The inbetween, the applied training, is being provided by AnCOT and the advisory services.  In my opinion the function of the advisory services will gravitate towards the planned production of crops and animals, towards a particular objective. The simplest case to understand is that which is taking place by itself on the farmers' own initiative, assisted in some cases by the county committee of agriculture, in the matter of boosting dairy production.  This is not merely a matter of animal nutrition.  It cannot avoid involving pasture management, a considerable amount of animal husbandry and animal genetics.  It embraces the raising of the average lactation levels and many specialised matters such as animal nutrition and so on. There is the question of production of crops as ration supplements and the production of cereals.  What puts the butter on the bread or dairy farmers is the level of dairy production&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is quite exasperating. I asked the Minister not for a dissertation about trends in agriculture in some general way in relation to pasture management but for an answer to a very specific question.  I ask him what changes would occur in Ballyhaise Agricultural College as a result of the fact that the Minister is now telling the college that they will work under a training mandate where previously they thought they were working under an educational mandate.  In the only attempt the Minister made to answer the question, he said that the changes are changes in the general sense and were impossible to predict.  I am asking him if he is making the change from education to training safe in the knowledge that the results of this change are so impossible to predict that he cannot give a single example of what might happen in Ballyhaise Agricultural College.</P>

I did not say that.  I was trying to stress the importance of agriculture in education and the need for it.  Is the Minister going to say that agriculture should go in a particular direction that he believes it should go?  He also stated that there are major changes in agriculture.  I do not accept that.  There is a need for information that is available in the Department to be passed to the farmers.  That is important.  How the Minister and his Department carry out that exercise is very important to the country.</P>

I cannot see where <Col N="1754" /> these new approaches or major changes are coming from or the need for them. However, I see clearly the need for information that is available in the Agricultural Institute and in the advisory services to be given to farmers to bring them up at least another 30 per cent in their production output.  The Minister says we are quibbling.  It is my belief that the only reason for the use of the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;education&rdquo; is because his predecessor used &ldquo;education&rdquo;.  Deputy Bruton asked the Minister many questions to try to find out what the change would mean in the agricultural colleges, but the Minister has not answered any of the questions.  It is most disappointing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not very forthcoming in his answers to any techniques.  I should like to know if the Minister believes that education is not a continuing requirement throughout life. Having worked in the Department of Education I have some knowledge of modern thinking in this regard, which is that education, formally or informally, continues throughout life, that it is not solely reserved to one's profession but to all experiences in life.  A doctor of, say, 45 years of age, who has been practising for a number of years will return to a medical school to improve his competence. <Col N="1755" /> He is being educated even at 45 years of age.  It is called recurrent education.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A farmer of 45 years of age who goes to do a course provided for in this Bill would also be engaged in education.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to section 12 of the 1977 Act.  Subsection (1) states:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall have the functions in relation to agricultural education (other than higher education) which, immediately before the commencement of this section, were exercised or performed or were capable of being exercised or performed by the Minister or by committees of agriculture.</P>
      <P>The subsection also provides that the authority may provide and organise residential or non-residential whole-time or part-time courses in agriculture.  It also provides for, among other things, the making of grants to institutions providing courses of study in agriculture.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to change that section by saying that the authority shall only have functions in relation to agricultural training, because in section 17 (a) he is providing for an amendment of the 1977 Act by the substitution in section 12 (1) for &ldquo;agricultural education&rdquo; of &ldquo;agricultural training&rdquo;.  I should like to know if that substitution makes any change in regard to the agricultural colleges, and if so, what the difference is.  Will the same responsibilities which were exercised by the Minister and the committees of agriculture, by virtue of the change from the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; to &ldquo;training&rdquo; still be exercisable?  Has the change any great significance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 39 in my name and that of Deputy D'Arcy seeks to insert the words &ldquo;education and&rdquo; after &ldquo;agricultural&rdquo;.  Section 12 (1) of the 1977 Act relates to &ldquo;educational functions&rdquo; and the section we are dealing <Col N="1756" /> with here states that the authority shall have certain functions to which I have already referred.  Does it mean that some functions will be transferred if the word &ldquo;training&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;education&rdquo;?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I am having some difficulty in trying to follow the Deputy.  The involvement of the committees of agriculture is laid down in section 33 of the 1931 Agriculture Act thus:</P>
      <P>(1)  Every committee of agriculture shall in every year prepare a scheme (in this Act referred to as an agricultural scheme) for giving assistance and instruction for the purposes of agriculture and other rural industries in its county.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1757" /> Section 12 (1) (d) relates to the making of grants to institutions providing courses of study in agriculture such as Warrenstown.  Earlier the Minister was trying to suggest that the change from &ldquo;education&rdquo; to &ldquo;training&rdquo; would not affect Warrenstown.  I believe it would and that the functions that were previously educational will be changed to training functions.  In making grants to institutions providing courses of study in agriculture they will now be confined to making grants only for courses of study which could be described as training courses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 is an objectionable one.  One of its purposes is to exclude the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; and to substitute the word &ldquo;training&rdquo;.  Other parts of the section are also objectionable, particularly the deletion of section 22 of the 1977 Act and the deletion of section 48 (3) and (4) of that Act.  We object to the removal of these two provisions. First, I would like to deal with the removal of section 22.  The best way to deal with this matter is to read the section in the 1976 Act.  Section 22 reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to <i>subsection</i> (2), the Authority may charge, receive and recover fees for agricultural research or basic veterinary research undertaken on behalf of any person, firm, institution or agency and for services, courses, seminars, lectures and demonstrations provided or organised by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1759" /> (2)  No fee may, however, be charged in respect of&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any advice that may be given by the Authority in response to a request from the Minister under section 21, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any facilities, assistance or courses of instruction that may be provided by the Authority under Section 14 or Section 16 (b),</P>
    <P>but the cost to the Authority of providing the services referred to in this subsection shall rank as an expense on the Authority and shall be taken into account when the amount of the annual grant referred to in section 48 (1) (b) is being determined.</P>
    <P>I would like to concentrate on the words, &ldquo;No fee may be charged in respect of any facilities, assistance or courses of instruction that may be provided by the authority under section 14 or section 16 (b)&rdquo;.  Section 14 concerns courses in agriculture for the purpose of implementing the EEC directives and section 16 (b) relates to the authorities who provide such facilities and assistance. Section 21 says:</P>
    <P>The Authority shall advise the Minister on any matter relating to agricultural education, advice or research or to basic veterinary research on which its views are requested by the Minister.</P>
    <P>What is the significance of deleting section 22?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is consequential on the separation of An Foras Talúntais, the body responsible for veterinary research and all other types of agricultural research.

I presume that section 14 of the original Act would relate to courses under Directive 161.  Under the original Act as introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Clinton, it was clearly stated in section 22 (2) that no fee could be charged for these courses.  Now the Minister is removing the provision that no fee can be charged for these courses.</P>

      <P>I see, but I do not believe that section 22 (2) relates in any way to the matters covered by section 22 (1). Section 22 (1) is concerned with agricultural research or basic veterinary research undertaken on behalf of any person, firm or agency and it says a fee may be charged for that.  Section 22 (2) (b) relates to facilities, assistance or courses of instruction and these are further amplified as being courses of instruction under section 14 or section 16 (b) which are EEC courses.  Section 22 (2) contained a clear guarantee that no fees would be charged for these courses of instruction.  Section 22 (2), which deals with courses, must be read separately from section 22 (1), which deals with research.  In removing section 22 (2) the Minister is removing a guarantee which existed against the charge of fees for courses of instruction.</P>

      <P>If section 22 (1) and 22 (2) are interdependent there is no problem, but if they are independent there is a problem because the guarantee in section 22 (2) is being removed.  It is particularly important to know if the fact that the guarantee is being removed means anything.  If in removing that guarantee we are leaving a situation where committees of agriculture or AnCOT can legally charge fees under the 1931 Act or some other Act for some of their activities we are making a significant change which should not be made. Before we agree to the removal of section 22 (2) it is important to know if its being removed will enable county committees of agriculture to be free under the 1931 Act, or legislation going further back, to charge fees.</P>

The Minister just saying that it will be clarified by an unspecified amendment does not really meet the case I am making.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes on to say that no fee may be charged in respect of advice given by the authority to the Minister under section 21 or any facilities, assistance or courses of instruction provided by the authority under sections 14 or 16 (b).  The Minister is removing the guarantee on these in section 22 (2). He is also removing section 22 (1).  I would like to know would it have been necessary to have section 22 (1) for fees to be charged for courses, seminars, lectures, demonstrations and so on?  Was the position prior to the enactment of that Act that no fees could be charged legally and that it was necessary to have section 22 (1) to allow such fees to be charged?  If that were the case it is not such a problem but if the case were that section 22 (1) did not really make any difference, that they had power to charge these fees in any case, then the important part is section 22 (2). Therefore my question is an important one: what was the position about the charging of fees before any of these pieces of legislation were introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The best thing to do here is to go over section 22 and examine what the Minister at the time had in mind.  It says that subject to subsection 2&mdash;which we will come to later&mdash;the authority may charge, receive and recover fees for agricultural research or basic veterinary research undertaken on behalf of any person, firm, institution or agency, and for services, courses, seminars, lectures and demonstrations provided or organised by it.  They can be charged fees for that vast range of things.  No fee may be charged in respect of any advice given <Col N="1767" /> by the authority in response to a request from the Minister under section 21.  Section 21 says:</P>
      <P>The Authority shall advise the Minister on any matter relating to agricultural education, advice or research or to basic veterinary research on which its views are requested by the Minister.</P>
      <P>No fees may be charged for that.  All the research functions are going to An Foras under the new Bill.  The matter becomes clearer as Deputy Bruton continues.  &ldquo;Any facilities, assistance or courses of instruction that may be provided by the authority under section 14 or 16&rdquo;&mdash;we can go back to those. Section 14 says the authority shall provide courses in agriculture for the purpose of implementing directives of the European Economic Community when requested to do so by the Minister. Section 16 says that the authority shall maintain close liaison and co-operate as may be necessary with the Minister and other agencies in the operation of such schemes and facilities for agricultural development as may be administered by them, and provide such facilities and assistance as the Minister may require for the purpose of implementing directives of the European Economic Community. What the deletion of the whole section amounts to really, in my opinion, is the deletion of the provision for the collection of fees by AnCOT which is not a fee-collecting body.  An Foras is the research body and we are talking about veterinary and general research and all that goes with it, seminars, lectures, demonstrations and so on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to pursue the issue in relation to section 48 (3) and 48 (4) of the old Act which are also being removed.  This says that the grant by the State to the authority&mdash;now AnCOT&mdash;shall not be less in real terms than the total amount provided by the Oireachtas in the financial year immediately preceding the date of the establishment of the authority in respect of the activities of the authority in the financial year to which the grant relates. <Col N="1768" /> There is a guarantee in the old Act that the finance provided by the Oireachtas to AnCOT shall not be reduced.  I would like to know why that guarantee is now being removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall, when the earlier Bill was going through the House, asking the Minister then, if my memory is correct, if it was not a poor guarantee for the future of the advisory services that the Minister should say that the provision shall be no less than it is in this year when what we should be envisaging, as I have already being saying in relation to other sections, is a rapidly changing and growing advisory service, a service that, as I have also being saying, has been changing in nature, a service that at this moment contains a factor consisting of the voluntary payment of fees by farmers for certain services rendered, altering at this moment the traditional texture of the advisory services in incorporating that very useful factor voluntarily called in to existence by the farmers.  It was the farmers themselves and their co-operatives who produced this very desirable development in agricultural work.</P>
      <P>Sections 48 (3) and 48 (4) envisages a position of total lack of movement, that the old order continue unchanged.  I have been endeavouring to get Deputy Bruton, and others, to accept the point that this is not the case.  The old order is changing in front of our eyes.  To enshrine it in legislation, as my predecessor did, would be to accept that things are not going to change themselves.  This is not so and I would not wish to legislate in a manner that would accept a proposition I do not accept.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister to a certain extent, that the part of the previous Act which guaranteed that it would not be reduced may have indicated a static performance but at least it was a guarantee.

      <P>There is a feeling at present that the co-ops and others will have to provide the service and that this may give the opportunity to some administration to cut back and pay less for the services.  The guarantee that was there was not great but it was one which ensured that the amount would not cut back.  If co-ops and others are expected to provide the kind of advisory service that is necessary there is the possibility that the Government and the comhairle may rely on that source and give less themselves.</P>

They may decide that it is very good when done voluntarily but even better if farmers could be compelled to do so by the Government.  If the Government could get £30 million from the farmers direct for advice, education and research they might reduce the amount being provided by way of grant under section 48.  That is what the Government have in mind.  They are <Col N="1770" /> proposing to introduce a levy to finance these services.</P>

In the event of that amendment not being accepted I may wish to introduce some amendments on section 5 on Report Stage.

      <P>This section relates to the dissolution of the National Agricultural Authority.  The National Agricultural Authority was set up by the previous Government to achieve a purpose which we believed to be right: to unify agricultural education, research and advice in the one authority which would direct all of them for the common objective of increased agricultural production and increased incomes on the land.  We must object very strongly to the dissolution of a body which had that purpose.</P>
      <P>We are now putting forward in an amendment to this Bill an alternative method to achieve the same object as was intended by setting up the National Agricultural Authority.  I believe the setting up of the National Agricultural Authority was the best way to do this job because it brought all three services together under one authority.  I object to section 6 because it is undoing that good work.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bruton and the House know that I disagree profoundly with him on this fundamental matter, the independence of our research arm in <Col N="1774" /> agriculture.  All the objective scientific analyses of this problem have been done by the OECD and by other objective people with no particular axe of their own to grind.  I have not any axe to grind.  All kinds of things have been attributed to me and I can only say that they are not correct.  My only wish is to see An Foras Talúntais continue its present excellent work and maintain its high international position rather than be confronted with the inevitability of running down through the dissolution that awaited it in the passage of the old Act.  I remember during the Committee Stage of the older Bill that only two Deputies on the Government side spoke on this matter and they both spoke against the motion on the amalgamation of research, advice and training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the ground has been covered so exhaustively on this issue that there is not much point in going very much further on it this evening.  I believe that research should not be separated from advice and education because they all have the same objective: helping farmers to increase production and helping to increase the efficiency of the processing section of our economy so far as food is concerned.</P>
      <P>This is not the type of research which is being carried out in the Agricultural Institute.  It is research for the sake of agriculture.  Advice and education for the sake of agriculture is not the type of research that is carried out in a university which, rightly, has complete academic freedom and is not directed to the service of any particular interest in the economy, any social political or economic interest.  It is free from all of those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Agricultural Institute was set up separate from the universities with the purpose of being more directly related to the needs of the economy and agriculture than the work of the universities, which was concerned with other criteria, the general advancement of learning, truth and so forth.  Other criteria will also be used in universities so long as there is academic freedom. That is fine for universities.  But for an agricultural institute which is separate from universities, and was set up <Col N="1775" /> separate from them for a particular purpose, the same criteria of academic freedom in relation to research do not apply, because it is a different institution with a different purpose.  I do not have any violent views about the issue and I am not anxious to get involved in an argument with the Minister about it.  I want to report my view of the issue that it would have been better if the Minister had allowed the three institutions to continue together.  He has decided otherwise.  Although we may object we must for the time being accept the consequences of his decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 10, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;10.&mdash;Section 12 of the Act of 1977 is hereby amended by the addition of the following subsections:</P>
      <P>(3)  Courses or lectures to be provided in agriculture under subsection (1) of this section may include preventive veterinary medicine, and the Authority shall make arrangements to ensure that qualified persons are available to provide such courses or lectures insofar as they concern preventive veterinary medicine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The Authority shall provide courses and lectures specially designed for employed farm workers <Col N="1776" /> if, in respect of any part of the country it is satisfied that employed farm workers are not being adequately catered for in existing courses and lectures provided on a general basis'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of these amendments is to request the comhairle to do work which they might not otherwise do.  It is work which we believe would be of great value.  The amendments are not intended to be controversial and I do not suggest that the Minister is likely to disagree with the sentiments expressed.  The question is whether we need to specify that these things need to be done.</P>
    <P>We are seeking in amendment No. 11 to change the provisions of section 12 of the old Act relating to the educational functions of the comhairle.  We are proposing that the comhairle should be allowed to run courses or lectures in agriculture which would include preventive veterinary medicine and that they should make arrangements to ensure that qualified persons are available to provide such courses or lectures.  I believe preventive veterinary medicine is a very important part of agriculture and to the best of my knowledge there are not any veterinary surgeons on the staff of the county committees of agriculture or on the advisory arm of AnCOT.  This is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I attended a 100-hour course under Directive 161.  Two lectures were given by veterinary surgeons who were brought in from the district veterinary office.  One felt that this was a concession and was not really part of the course.  I believe preventive veterinary medicine is an integral part of agriculture and AnCOT have a clear mandate to provide these courses.  The Minister may say that the district veterinary offices are equipped to provide farmers with any information they may want on veterinary matters and that they can deal with the issue.  I would not agree with that because the district veterinary office staff are not educators or trainers.  Their functions are basically administrative and they are not equipped to spend a large part of their time giving courses to farmers on veterinary matters.  Neither is the <Col N="1777" /> farmer's veterinary surgeon equipped to do this because he is too busy.  He is concerned with curing disease and, while he is professionally concerned with the prevention of disease, he has not the time to become involved in educating farmers about preventive veterinary medicine.  Prevention is better than cure and effective prevention requires knowledge and information.  This is true not simply in the context of brucellosis and turberculosis eradication but in the entire area of agriculture.  An agricultural training or educational authority which does not have a specific mandate to deal with preventive veterinary medicine has not a complete mandate.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept this point.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 21 also concerns preventive veterinary medicine and the advisory aspect of the work.  Advisers should be in a position to obtain advice from specialists on veterinary matters. There might be some objection from some veterinary surgeons.  They may not want to see any State agency becoming involved in giving veterinary advice to farmers and may say that they, as private practitioners, are the only people who should do this.  I do not think any profession operating privately should have a monopoly on an important matter such as this.</P>
    <P>The last part of amendment No. 11 states:</P>
    <P>(4)  The Authority shall provide courses and lectures specially designed for employed farm workers if, in respect of any part of the country it is satisfied that employed farm workers are not being adequately catered for in existing courses and lectures provided on a general basis.</P>
    <P>My impression is that the vast bulk of courses, if not the entirety, are provided for farmers or their sons and little or nothing is being done to improve the professional competence of the employed farm worker.  With modern trends in farming, particularly in certain lines of production like cereals, the employed farm worker is a very important and highly skilled man who should, and in many cases does, command a <Col N="1778" /> high wage.  It should be made quite clear to the authority that they have a duty to provide courses for employed farm workers and not just for farmers and they should ensure that the courses are suitable for such workers.  In some cases there would be a need to change the courses to suit farm workers.  They are not free at the same times of the day as farmers, who are their own bosses and can make themselves free.  No compensation has to be given for their absence. They are doing it on their own time. That does not apply to farm workers.  If one is to get farm workers involved in agricultural education in a way in which they are not involved at present special provision must be made by the authority.  Amendment No. 11 is not requiring the authority to provide special courses for farm workers in every county but rather to provide them in any county where it is satisfied they are not adequately catered for by existing courses.  That does not tie the authority down.  It is requiring them to take whatever steps are needed.  It is a constructive and useful amendment and one which I hope the Minister will accept.</P>
    <P>The second part of amendment No. 21&mdash;I do not know how all these amendments were put in together&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair wonders sometimes too.  They are related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not question the Chair.  They are diverse.</P>
      <P>This amendment requires that:</P>
      <P>In the exercise of these functions the Authority shall devote special attention to those farm families and others engaged in agriculture whose economic performance falls furthest below the economic potential of the resources (land and otherwise) available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of inserting the amendment is that it is all too easy for people involved in advice and education to spend the vast amount of their time dealing with 10 or 15 per cent of farmers who are most efficient.  These are the people who come to the advice centre looking <Col N="1779" /> for advice.  If you are an adviser and you visit their farms you are as likely to learn something as you are to impart advice. An adviser who has been trained in agriculture in a university is naturally interested in the type of work the best farmers are doing.  The temptation is there for them to spend much more of their time with such farmers than they should.  This amendment requires the authority to do the opposite and give special attention to those farmers who are less efficient, particularly small farmers who are in greatest need.  That is a sensible requirement to have in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The amendment is concerned with cases where economic performance falls furthest below the economic potential either of the farm, the farmer or the land. There are great differences in performance of farms in different parts of the country.  There are some counties where land of the same productive capacity is yielding three times as much as it does in other counties.  The resources of the advisory and education service should be concentrated in those areas where performance is falling furthest below potential. If that means diverting them away from areas where there is already high performance, so be it.  If such a provision is not included in the Bill the authority will leave staff as they are in the counties where they are and will pay no attention to the fact that there are some parts of the country which could achieve a great deal more if they got special attention. Such a provision would require the authority to take account of where need is greatest and to allocate resources to those areas.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the amendment deals with an entirely different issue.  It concerns the farm home management service which consists mainly of women advisers although there is no requirement as to the sex of the adviser.  They advise farmers' wives on how to make arrangements for the housing of the family, management of the home, clothing of the children, food, nutrition and so on.  This advice is only available to farming families.  At the time when this service was initiated the need for such assistance was probably greatest in the agricultural section of our community.  Things have <Col N="1780" /> changed since that time.  In my constituency most farmers now have a sufficient income and their wives have sufficient education to enable them to manage a home, maintenance, clothing, textiles and so on as well as any other section of the community with similar incomes.</P>
    <P>It is not fair that this service should be exclusively confined to farmers' wives. Advice about home management, clothing and textiles, food and nutrition and so on would be very valuable to deprived families living in towns.  I know from my work in the Department of Education that one of the reasons why there are so many social problems and malnutrition in places such as Seán MacDermott Street and also among old age pensioners is not that they have insufficient income, although some of them have, but that they are not sufficiently advised on how to use it in managing their homes, buying the right food and ensuring that they have a proper diet.  In the farm home management service there are people specifically qualified to give advice on these matters and yet they may only give it to farmers' wives.  They cannot give it to the people in Seán MacDermott Street or anywhere else.  There is a greater need for the work of home management advisers in deprived areas of the city centre than there is among farmers' wives in my constituency.  They attend 100-hour courses and receive substantial payments to do so.  The need for such advice and courses, subsidised or otherwise, is greater among many non-farm families both urban and rural.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that, no matter how prosperous a parish may be agriculturally or industrially, there are always a minority of families who cannot cope.  Perhaps the father is gone away or the mother is an alcoholic. Unless they are farmers they cannot get the advice of the home management service. That is wrong.  It should be possible for the service to help such people.  My amendment is proposing that, by arrangement with the appropriate health board, they may make provision for the giving of such advice to needy families of a non-agricultural or non-rural <Col N="1781" /> background.  It is left open.  The authority may make such arrangements but they are not required by this amendment to do so.  It is merely leaving it open to them to make such arrangements by agreement with the health boards.  Many health board would welcome having available to them the staff of the farm home management service to give advice on home management matters to some people, for instance, those in receipt of supplementary welfare allowances.  Those people would be able to make far better use of that money if they had advice of the sort I have mentioned from this service which is at present confined to farmers.  I hope the Minister will be able to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opinion, the amendments concerning the provision of veterinary advice are not necessary, although I agree with much of what the Deputy said about dissemination of sensible veterinary knowledge in the preventive sense among stock farmers generally. In the context of animal disease we have reason to exercise particular care not only with regard to the major infectious diseases such as brucellosis and TB but also with regard to sources of serious loss to the country such as calf and lamb mortality and animal mortality generally, a great deal of which I believe is avoidable.  I think calf mortality is in the region of 10 per cent.  It is far too high and it amounts to an enormous loss each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no getting away from the fact that the propagation of knowledge about basic hygiene and basic attention to animals before and after birth is very important. I still regard the amendment as unnecessary in view of the fact that lectures, instructions and seminars can be provided by the present arrangement and are provided.  In the future I believe that the Department of Agriculture will assist and encourage in the expansion of our efforts in the propagation of this kind of knowledge, in particular with regard to prevention of losses of young lambs, calves and pigs.  I believe that the motivation of the Deputies is right but I do not think the introduction of the special amendment is necessary having <Col N="1782" /> regard to the fact that the facility is there already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the employment of veterinary staff by AnCOT as well as by the Department would be desirable.  The more informal arrangements that the individual committees have at the moment and had in the past&mdash;and there is no reason why they should not have them in the future&mdash;preclude the necessity for the appointment of specialist vets whose main daily work would not be in the lecturing and instruction area.  Many of the people who would benefit from such instruction would be engaged in their ordinary daily work.  I am talking about the propagation of information and knowledge and, as an example, I took the conservation of young livestock.</P>
      <P>Ideally this would be conveyed to groups of farmers in a series of lectures. I presume these lectures would be delivered in short weekend courses or in evening courses and at winter schools. They present no problem.  They are being done but possibly they could be done to a greater extent.  The same applies to the special provision made in the part of the Deputy's amendment concerning the provision of special facilities for people employed on farms.  These facilities exist at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>More could be done. They are a new breed of workers now. They are more skilled and better paid than was the case.  A lot of the time of men working with tillage farmers is taken up with machinery and they would need to be competent in the management of that machinery.  The same applies to stockmen&mdash;a high degree of stockmanship is obviously necessary. Farm workers who have competence in these departments, and in regard to dairy cattle and sheep, can command incomes far above the standard wage, which is not in my opinion high enough for the type of worker we require in farming at present.  The need is so obvious that there is no necessity to have a provision saying that you must do certain things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> On the question of the provision of farm home guidance, not being familiar with the origins of this service, which originated in the old days of the poultry instructresses, in the average farmyard nowadays poultry has disappeared completely. In the old days a small flock of poultry was kept for the use of the household.  That day has gone and poultry raising has become a specialised industry.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there are cases such as Deputy Bruton spoke of in rural communities with problems of a social kind.  There are people who are not deriving proper livelihoods from farming and such people, one cannot deny, require assistance.  However, the resources of committees of agriculture and AnCOT will always be fully taken up within their own spheres of operations, that is among people who work on the land, whether as farmers or farmer workers.  I would therefore view with concern the extension of that service in the way Deputy Bruton spoke of&mdash;the extension of these forms of assistance to urban people who have no relation with agriculture.  If you did that the service would cease to be a farm home guidance scheme.</P>

      <P>Every Deputy knows, after a weekend working in his constituency, that a certain fraction of old people, who because of some personal deficiency or personal misfortune, are living in undesirable circumstances and it would be well if a helping hand could be given to such people, but it is not within the ambit of AnCOT to provide this assistance.  I am sure we would all like to see such assistance given, and there is nothing to stop us, as private persons, from providing that assistance from the means available to us.  Frankly I do not think we could do it in the way suggested because it would become a huge service with little or no connection with farming.</P>

      <P>I raised a point about farms whose economic performances <Col N="1785" /> have not been good from the point of view of the resources available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been a matter of concern to some of the more active committees of agriculture.  The advisers themselves have gone to such places as creameries, where farmers can be met in large numbers, to find out about farmers whom the advisers have never met before but whom they could help, and frequently do.  There are quite a substantial number of farmers who do not make any worth-while use of the advisory services or have continued resort to our advisory services.  There is no contention about this.  However, the overall purpose of the Bill is to deal with the parcel of problems concerned with farm advice and instruction, to put these problems into the hands of the comhairle and to give the comhairle the maximum amount of freedom of action.</P>
      <P>The comhairle will have it within their power to decide how important these problems are and how much effort they should put into solving them.  For instance, there are the special needs of the western area which will have to be dealt with.  I do not believe that at this juncture legislation should contain any special references to particular farmers. It will be for the comhairle to determine these things in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture of the day.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment which deals with a side of agriculture neglected for many years. The county committees of agriculture who are operating the services at the moment have made some attempts to bring veterinary advice to farmers but they have been finding quite a lot of difficulties. The Minister mentioned a 10 per cent fatality rate in calves and lambs. I think it is considerably higher in certain cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is higher in lambs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must accept that the days of the big price increases have nearly gone and that we now must get down to efficiency and good husbandry. The amendment deals with matters which have not been looked after for <Col N="1786" /> years.  It is my belief that the veterinary profession can play a very important role here.  It will be in everybody's interest to have professional advice made available.  It is hard to believe that practitioners will provide such a service and I suggest seriously that the new authority should provide such advice.  Fatalities in calves and lambs can be brought down quite easily.  It is not the time of calving or lambing that is important but the time immediately preceding that period. Housing is important, medicines are important. As this is an area in which effective and worth-while advances can be made, I would ask the Minister to consider the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the role of farm home management advisors.  In Wexford we have never told the advisors that they should only deal with farm homes.  We have broadened the service and I think it is right that we should.  We may be breaking the rules but farmhouse holidays are important in Wexford with our 130-mile coastline.  The people who come from all over the world to our resorts are important to us.  We have always believed that the advice should be given to all those who require it.  I know that the Minister comes from a different county with different needs.  The need is there and it is a good development in a county.  We run courses of lectures and everybody is entitled to attend them.</P>
      <P>This amendment is very important. People are learning the hard way that they must keep receipts of their losses.  I appeal to the Minister to make some provision to allow the authority to use qualified personnel in order to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases farm workers may become involved in these courses, but the committees are not doing enough to design courses to attract farm workers.  I am sure the Minister will agree that farm workers are not as freely available to attend courses as farmers.  A farmer may be able to attend a course which involves an absence of two or three days a week but a farm worker may not, particularly if he is hoping to move to more lucrative employment.  His employer will not <Col N="1787" /> facilitate him if he thinks he will lose him.  There is a need to make special provision for farm workers and the amendment would be a valuable move in this direction.  It does not require the provision of courses for farm workers everywhere, only where adequate provision is not being made.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the Minister's answer in relation to preventive veternary advice.  I know it is possible for the county committees to give preventive veterinary advice but they have not got the staff to do it.  There is not a single veterinarian employed by the advisory service anywhere in the country.  The only way they can give advice is by getting members of the district veterinary office to attend a course on a particular night.  People may well need advice in the middle of the day.  The only way in which they can get preventive advice is by ringing their veterinarian.  If he calls he will have to be paid a substantial fee for his advice.  Why should farmers have to pay for advice when it could be provided by an agricultural advisory service.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's predecessor knew that the man had to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If their mandate were extended AnCOT could pay him.  It would be mainly for advice in relation to preventive matters.  As AnCOT will have specialist advisors, why not have veterinary surgeons amongst them.</P>
      <P>I am also unhappy with the Minister's attitude to farm home management advisers. The need for home management advice is greater amongst deprived non-farm families than it is amongst farm families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It ceases to be a farm problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm home management service is the only group of people who are specifically qualified in home management.  The health boards have social workers but they are not concerned with home management.  Many deprived families need the type of advice which the farm home management service <Col N="1788" /> provide.  The provision of advice to deprived families would eliminate many problems such as malnutrition.  We have been told that there is malnutrition amongst children in many schools because their mothers do not know how to prepare proper breakfasts for them. Many children go to school without a proper breakfast.  Their parents can afford to buy food but they give it to them at the wrong time of day or spend it on alcoholic beverages.  When food is provided for these children it is usually the wrong type of food.  The farm home management service is the only State service that is competent to give advice on nutrition.  It is a pity that this service is confined to giving advice where it is least needed.  I agree with the Minister that it would not be a farm home management service if it was extended in this way but that is no reason for not extending it.  The staff members are there; but are being paid by the State and are not being used in the most effective way.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will consider the amendment.  I should also like the Minister to assure the House that there will be movement of staff under AnCOT to those parts of the country where economic performance is falling short of its potential.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
