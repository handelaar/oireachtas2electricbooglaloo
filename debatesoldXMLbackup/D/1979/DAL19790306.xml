      <P>and <b>Mr. P. Barry</b> asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on the meeting he, and the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture, had with members of the farmers' organisations on Tuesday, 27 February 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Following confirmation by the farming organisations of their agreement to the arrangements worked out at the meeting on 27 February, I have had the statement issued after that meeting laid before both Houses by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach not going to have a discussion on the matter in this House?  Does not the Taoiseach think that discussing the budget in view of what happened last week is a fairly pointless exercise on the part of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements made but which are not finalised yet and which are subject to ultimate acceptance by the farming organisations are now the property of the House and, therefore, <Col N="690" /> they are open for debate in the continuing budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach say, &ldquo;final to the acceptance by the farming organisations&rdquo;?  Are they the words he used just now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy finished his question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I wanted to find out if that was correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not answered it yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to check that the Taoiseach used those words.  Does not the Taoiseach think it at least undesirable that any section of the community should be allowed discussion on a budgetary matter which this House has not had the opportunity of discussing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Budgetary matters are discussed in advance with various organisations.  Consultations on tax and budgetary matters are normal and I can quote several organisations&mdash;the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions among others&mdash;who have made submissions on public expenditure, on income, welfare and taxation and, in turn, they have been consulted about their views.  On this occasion we have agreed to have consultations with the farmers and then devise a taxation system to which they must publicly subscribe.  Otherwise the levy will be put on as from 1 May, as proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Taoiseach agree that the other organisations he named, and probably including the farmers' organisations, made submissions in advance of the budget?  These discussions are taking place subsequent to the budget being introduced in this House.  Does the Taoiseach consider that the Government are giving this House the status it deserves by coming to an arrangement outside the House and which is not subject to this House?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having a debate on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an argument.  I suppose the Deputy is entitled to make the argument at another time but it is valid enough in the context of the question. However, I do not want to interfere with the ruling of the Chair.  In January last I called for discussion and consultation of this nature between the so-called social partners, between all the interests involved including trade unions, manufacturers, employer organisations and including the farmers.  I think that kind of consultation is necessary.  I said that such consultations should refer to tax, social welfare, price increases and matters of that nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Were not these discussions with a view to getting an agreement on wages in the current year and not on the budget, after the budget had been brought before the House and while it was under discussion?  That is the difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the difference because that is not true.  I invited these consultations and negotiations with a view to getting an understanding on all the matters to which I have referred, namely, on price increases, wage increases, taxation, and social welfare payments. The Deputy may remember I said that if we could come to an agreement over the next year or the next three or five years it would be a desirable way of getting the forward move in the economy for which we were hoping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the privileged status given to the farming organisations to draft their own ideas on taxation and how it should affect them, does the Taoiseach envisage granting a like privilege to the PAYE sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  All of this is appropriate to the budget debate that is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair that I should get an opportunity of replying to what the Deputy has wrongly alleged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> The farmers have not got the privilege of drafting their own tax proposals.  The farmers have been given the opportunity of consulting with us and with the Revenue Commissioners and the Government will devise a taxation system&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Decision-making has passed from here to Portlaoise or wherever the farming organisations choose to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When the truth is told the Deputies do not want to listen.  I said when that system is devised the farmers will have publicly to subscribe to it. Otherwise the arrangements made in connection with the levy will proceed and that is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Taoiseach consider it wrong that when a budget is introduced in this House, the Parliament of the country, that one section of the community can disagree with part of it and make the entire discussion of the budget, as well as the budget itself quite meaningless?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an argument.  We cannot have a debate on this, particularly since it is appropriate to the budget debate which is continuing at the moment.  There have been enough questions on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Taoiseach agree that the refusal of the Government to allow discussion inside this House not only on a change in a budgetary matter but on the question of the removal of food subsidies and other matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why the strength of the RTE 2 signal to the Castlebar Transmitter, County Mayo, has been reduced by approximately 12DB-14DB thereby denying many viewers the full option of RTE 2 programmes; and if he will rectify this unsatisfactory situation immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central) Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin South-Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): The RTE 2 transposer at Castlebar uses the same frequency as the RTE 1 transposer at Achill.  RTE say that in order to avoid interference with RTE 1 reception in Achill, the RTE 2 transposer at Castlebar began operating at less than its authorised power.  Following some technical adjustments it was possible to quadruple the power thus giving a very significant improvement in the RTE 2 signal in the service area of the Castlebar transposer. The transposer will be brought up to full power when arrangements aimed at eliminating the problems of mutual interference with the RTE 1 transposer at Achill have been implemented.  RTE hope that the work necessary to effect the required changes will be completed by the end of this year.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
      <P>The number of applicants for telephone service at the exchanges in County Kilkenny is 1,240.  These include some 200 business applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from two residence applications received in 1973 and 1974, which were deferred for attention because of the abnormal construction work required to provide service, the earliest applications date from 1975.  It is expected that about 400 applicants mostly in the Kilkenny city area, will be given service this year. Because of congestion in Kilkenny trunk exchange on which most of the exchanges in County Kilkenny depend for <Col N="703" /> switching of trunk calls, it is necessary to restrict connections for most areas of County Kilkenny to high priority applications until a new trunk exchange at Kilkenny, the building work for which is in progress, will be installed in about two years time.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he is aware that because of a delay of two hours in telephone calls from County Donegal to Dublin on Friday 16 February 1979 subscribers were forced to pay double charges on calls which because of the importance had to be dealt with as a matter of urgency and furthermore that in telephoning Dáil Éireann on parliamentary business the cost of the telephone call was also a double charge and can he explain why subscribers in Donegal not on the automatic system are compelled to pay overcharge amounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central</i>): Ordinary telephone calls made by subscribers in County Donegal are in common with calls made by subscribers in the rest of the county, charged for at normal rates.  Where there are delays in making calls over a particular route in any part of the country and a caller requests preferential treatment&mdash;in other words to be put in front of the queue&mdash;on grounds of particular urgency, the normal operating procedure is to offer to book the call as an &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; one at twice the normal rate.  The double rate is not applied to distress or to emergency services calls.  This procedure is similar to that which applies in telephone services generally.  Its purpose is not to secure extra revenue but to relieve operating staff of the impossible task of trying to decide the relative urgency of business or private calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of a sharp increase in traffic in County Donegal on 16 February, 1979, there were unavoidable delays to calls.  Callers, including the Deputy, seeking preferential treatment, were <Col N="705" /> therefore offered the urgent call facilities on the standard basis in such cases.</P>

      <P>The marketing of agricultural produce is kept under continuous review by my Department.  As already announced, I have set up an Agricultural Exports Co-Ordinating Group comprising representatives of the major agricultural export agencies and Córas Tráchtála under the chairmanship of my Department.

      <P>It is also my intention to introduce legislation shortly to give Córas Beostoic agus Feola a wider promotional role and to make it functionally more effective.

      <P>The Fourth FAO World Food Survey shows that in the period 1970 to 1976 food production per head in Western Europe rose at a somewhat slower rate than in some other regions of the developed world.  The value of this comparison must, of course, be viewed against such factors as the effective demand for food products, the differing ratios of population to land and the varying degrees of basic agricultural development of the regions concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to food production in the EEC, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Community is already self-sufficient or close to self-sufficiency, for many of the main agricultural products.  Indeed the emergence in recent years of surpluses of some of these products, coupled with the high cost to the Community of their disposal, is an issue of concern and controversy in the Community at the present time.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that the World Food and Agriculture Organisation has stated that up to ten times the area of the world which is already desert is now at significant risk of becoming desert because of climatic and cultivation changes; and the assistance Ireland is giving to the countries concerned to halt this process in the interest of alleviating world hunger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem was discussed at an International Conference on Desertification which was held in Nairobi in 1977.  Arising out of the conference a plan of action at international, regional and national level was prepared. In the International sector the main assistance given is the provision through the appropriate United Nations agencies of funds, fertilisers, technical assistance, training and so on.</P>
      <P>Through our membership of FAO we support and contribute to various activities which include projects to counter desertification.  We also contribute to the World Food Programme which provides certain funds to alleviate this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, first of all, that the most acute problem of desertification is occuring in countries which already have an acute starvation problem?  Secondly, would the Minister state what aid, in terms of money, Ireland is giving to alleviate this problem?</P>

      <P>I cannot specify what assistance our Government are giving to <Col N="720" /> the plan of action.  But I can outline for the Deputy the plan of action which stressed three levels of action&mdash;national, regional and international approaches on combating desertification.  The request urged Governments to identify specific projects to alleviate situations and quantify, in terms of finance and personnel, the requirements for the implementation of these projects.  That is the plan of action.  I have no information as regards our contribution towards alleviating the problem.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that FAO figures show that between 1969-1971 and 1972-1974 the number of under-nourished persons in the world grew by 54 million to 455 million altogether, or by twice the rate of overall growth in population, although it is estimated that world food production was 107 per cent of requirements in 1972-1974 as against 106 per cent in 1969-1971; if this divergent trend has in his opinion continued since 1974, and the changes in EEC policy which in his opinion as a member of the Council of Ministers would contribute to an alleviation of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentages which the Deputy quotes for world food production in fact relate to <i>per capul</i> daily food supply in terms of calories. These show that for the world as a whole there was a marginal increase in the daily surplus over daily requirements. The corresponding percentages for developing countries also showed a marginal increase&mdash;in this case a narrowing of the shortfall between requirements and supply.  I would hope that this convergent trend is continuing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The Community is fully alert to the problem of undernourishment in the world and is in the forefront as regards providing aid to alleviate hunger.  In 1978 the Community's food aid programme cost over 220 million units of account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

Would the Minister of State agree to ask his Minister to look into this problem to ascertain what can be done at European level to solve the problem, because Ireland alone can do very little?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture his position on farmers who turn out stock on undivided commonages due to there not being sufficient fodder to maintain them on land where such farmers are awaiting a second 30 day pre-movement test as a result of some of their stock having been confirmed as TB cases; and if he considers such action would lead to the spread of TB among cattle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a clear risk of disease spread if disease-free stock come in contact, on commonages, with animals from a herd where TB is confirmed. All stock from a TB infected herd must therefore be kept out of contact with other animals until the herd is declared to be free of the disease as a result of further testing.</P>

Would he agree that farmers in western areas are being forced in some cases to put cattle out on undivided commonages?

    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a problem in the west where commonages are a common feature of the land structure. The ultimate solution would be the <Col N="723" /> division of those commonages.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair would allow me 30 seconds to ask a question.  I appreciate entirely that your rulings on matters of questions cannot be challenged in the House and it is not my intention to challenge those rulings. However, regarding the question I put down to the Taoiseach asking him what figure the Government, as a collective authority, accepted as the correct figure for economic growth achieved in 1978 and which I tabled in view of the substantial discrepancy between the figure issued by the Department of Economic Planning and Development and the figure issued by the Central Bank&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps your reply&mdash;to the effect that you were disallowing the question because it contained argument&mdash;would form the subject of one of your short explanations to the House in regard to your rulings.  I should like such an explanation for future reference because I have had this experience with you on several occasions.  I cannot find any argument in my question to the Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That it is expedient that a tribunal be established for&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  inquiring into the following definite matters of urgent public importance:</P>
      <P>(1) the immediate and other causes of, and the circumstances of and leading to, the explosions and fires on and in the vicinity of the ship <i>Betelgeuse</i> and the jetty of the terminal of Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Limited at Whiddy Island, Bantry, in the County of Cork on the 8th January, 1979,</P>
      <P>(2)  the circumstances of and leading to the loss of life on and in the vicinity of the ship and jetty on the 8th January, 1979,</P>
      <P>(3) the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 8th January, 1979, on, in the vicinity of and in relation to the ship and at, in the vicinity of and in relation to the terminal to prevent, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) fires and explosions of the kinds aforesaid, and</P>
      <P>(b)  the occurrence of circumstances of the kinds that led to the loss of life aforesaid;</P>
      <P>and</P>
      <P>2.  making such recommendations (if any) as the Tribunal, having regard to its findings, thinks proper.</P>
      <P>We were all, Government and people alike, extremely shocked by the appalling disaster to the French registered tanker <i>Betelgeuse</i> at Bantry Bay early in the morning of 8 January last when 51 people lost their lives.</P>
      <P>We owe it to the victims of the disaster and to their relatives to make every possible effort to establish the circumstances and causes of the disaster; we also owe it to them to ascertain in the fullest possible way the lessons to be learnt from this terrible event so as to prevent such a disaster occuring again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="774" /> In addition to our obligations to the relatives of the victims and those others directly affected, we have a wider obligation to all those who go to sea in ships, be they tankers or otherwise, or who work at oil terminals.  If there are lessons to be learnt from the <i>Betelgeuse</i> experience which contribute to making the seas and ports of the world safer, we have a duty to seek out those lessons and benefit from them.</P>
    <P>It is for these reasons that the Government decided that the widest possible investigation into the disaster must be held.  The Government determined also that the body appointed to hold the inquiry should have the highest status in law.  They considered the provisions of a number of enactments which provide statutory authority for the holding of public inquiries into incidents of this kind and concluded that a Tribunal of Inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921 would be most appropriate for the purpose.</P>
    <P>An eminent Judge of the High Court, Mr. Justice Declan Costello, has agreed to hold the inquiry.  He will be assisted by a number of assessors who will be chosen on the basis of high calibre, experience and expertise.  The tribunal is being given very wide terms of reference. It will investigate the cause and circumstances of the disaster and the resultant loss of life as well as the adequacy of the measures taken to prevent and deal with accidents at the terminal.  Furthermore, the tribunal may make such recommendations as, having regard to its findings, it may think proper.  The terms of reference have been deliberately drawn up to provide the tribunal with full scope in its conduct of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Government's determination to conduct the most searching and exhaustive inquiry has been evident from the outset.  The Taoiseach announced on 8 January&mdash;the day of the disaster&mdash;that the fullest possible inquiry would be held and on the following day I announced that this would take the form of a public sworn inquiry.  An immediate examination of existing legislative provisions was undertaken and this indicated the need to draft and enact amending legislation in order to ensure the effectiveness <Col N="775" /> of the inquiry.  It was in these circumstances that the Minister for Justice promoted the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 1979, which has since been enacted and which contains provisions which <i>inter alia</i> require the attendance of witnesses, the giving of evidence and the production of documents.</P>
    <P>The most immediate task after the explosion and fire was of course to remove the remaining oil, to eliminate the risk of further pollution and to ensure against danger of further fire or explosion.  This priority task was accomplished with efficiency and expedition.  It was also essential to make immediate arrangements to ensure the assembly and preservation of evidence necessary for the conduct of the inquiry.  The initial step in this regard was the appointment on the day following the disaster of an officer of my Department to undertake a preliminary inquiry under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.</P>
    <P>When the bow section of the vessel had been rendered safe for examination after the completion of gas inerting, the work of investigation and assembly of evidence was carried out under the close supervision of my Department.  This has involved the assembly of a team of experts comprising martime technical experts from my own Department assisted by expertise from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and Irish Shipping Ltd. and augmented, as necessary, by technical experts from abroad.  My aim has been to ensure that nothing which could possibly have contributed to the cause of the disaster is overlooked and that the tribunal will have the assistance of the best available expertise.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course, representatives of the other parties with a direct interest in the hearings before the tribunal have had access to the wreck and the jetty with my consent and under my supervision. These facilities have been granted subject to appropriate safeguards and in an atmosphere of agreement and co-operation between all concerned.  I have no doubt there is a real desire on the part of everybody concerned to get as close <Col N="776" /> as possible to the truth of what happended to cause the disaster of 8 January. All realise that it is essential to safer operations in the future that this be done.  When the examination of the bow section of the vessel was completed, that portion was towed to a selected sinking site about 100 miles WSW of Fastnet and was scuttled on 23 February.  Work on the salvage of the after section is proceeding and will take some time.  This is also being examined by experts to establish whether it can yield any possible evidence as to the cause of the disaster.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position at this stage to say when the inquiry will commence but I can tell the House that Bantry has been chosen as the location.</P>
    <P>It would clearly be inappropriate for me at this time to comment on any matter which will arise for consideration by the tribunal of inquiry and I do not propose to do so.  I should not, however, let the opportunity pass without paying tribute to the herculean efforts of many people in the aftermath of the disaster.</P>
    <P>The Garda, Army and Navy personnel have done a tremendous job.  The shipowners, terminal operators, salvors and their employees have worked in very difficult and dangerous conditions to make the wreck safe and contain the risk of oil spillage.  In this latter area particularly, they have been very successful having regard to the immensity of the damage to the vessel and the potential pollution hazard.  The damage caused by pollution and the use of dispersants has been kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Officials of Government Departments, including my own Departments of Tourism and Transport and Posts and Telegraphs, the Departments of Defence, Environment, Fisheries, and Labour, the Attorney General's Office and local authorities have undertaken their various duties with efficiency and dedication.</P>
    <P>One of the tragic aspects of this disaster was of course the fact that there were no survivors among those aboard the vessel or present on the jetty at the time of the explosion and fire.  This obviously makes the task of the tribunal particularly difficult.  Neverthless, it is my sincere hope that it will be possible <Col N="777" /> to establish the cause of the disaster.  The amending legislation already enacted and the motion now before the House are designed to ensure that the tribunal will have all the powers necessary for the purpose and will suffer from no constrains which might hinder its work.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the House fully shares the Government's objectives in this matter and will lend its full support to the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary for me to say that we all deeply regret the tragic circumstances which have made this inquiry necessary.  I agree, as the Minister stated, that we owe it to the victims of the disaster, and their relatives, to make every effort to establish the cause of the tragedy and I accept that everything possible will be done to ensure that such a disaster will not occur again.  Fine Gael endorse the decision of the Government to set up the inquiry.  Within a short time of the tragedy, in the course of a statement, we called for the holding of a public sworn inquiry into the causes, consequences and implications of the appalling disaster. I welcome the decision of the Government to select Bantry as the venue for the inquiry.  There are many arguments in favour of having the inquiry conducted near the scene of the disaster.</P>
      <P>News of the disaster shocked and horrified everybody.  We were all amazed that such a catastrophe could occur in this era of high technology, sophisticated systems and modern techniques.  They are all being applied to marine engineering, the building of ships and tankers and the loading and discharging of oil at various ports.  There followed a demand for the fullest possible inquiry into the disaster.  We all believed that the inquiry should ascertain all the facts and that those with evidence to give in relation to the disaster should be permitted to do so and have the right to be legally represented at the hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the inquiry is to ascertain how the disaster occurred.  We must also be prepared to ensure that whatever lessons emerge from it will be heeded and that recommendations will <Col N="778" /> be implemented.  It is against the sense of public shock and horror and the demand for a public inquiry that we must judge the terms of reference for the inquiry which are contained in the motion.  As a result of the amending legislation enacted here recently it will be possible for the chairman of the tribunal to carry out his task in an effective manner.  I accept that because the tribunal has been set up it is not appropriate for me to pre-judge any of the issues raised or preempt any of the findings of that tribunal. It is the duty of the tribunal to answer the hundreds of questions that have been posed since the disaster.</P>
    <P>From my discussions with people in Bantry who represent various interests I learned that they are reasonably satisfied with the terms of reference outlined in the motion.  I am satisfied that those terms of reference are designed to enable the fullest possible investigation to be carried out.  It is important that those with evidence must be allowed to give it and have the right of legal representation. All the facts must be brought to light because the cause must be identified and responsibility pinpointed. Blame must be apportioned.  The recommendations of the inquiry will have great implications nationally and internationally. They will have implications in relation to national and international maritime laws Unfortunately, the tragedy at Bantry is one of a series of serious accidents involving oil tankers in recent years.  We all remember the incident of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> in 1968 or 1969 when tons of oil spoiled the coast of Devon and Cornwall and a number of serious accidents occurred last year. Such disasters can mean loss of life&mdash;like Bantry&mdash;and can mean immense pollution problems causing serious environment damage, damage to the tourist industry and marine life. Fishing and tourism are very important in the Bantry Bay region.  A disaster like this one, as well as the appalling loss of life, has immense economic and social implications.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope&mdash;and this is the desire of everybody&mdash;that from this tribunal will come forth positive, realistic and appropriate recommendations <Col N="779" /> which will probably give rise to the need for new legislation, the implementation of new regulations covering the handling, docking and discharging of oil tankers and covering the security and safety measures on ships at sea and at the oil terminal.  In recent years&mdash;and from what I can gather the same criticism can be made of most European countries&mdash;Minister of Transport have overlooked, or have not been as conscious of, the need to keep a careful watch on the transportation of oil. Tankers have got bigger and more sophisticated and equipment is being updated almost every year.  Despite all the advantages of modern technology this poses the question whether the international regulations governing in particular the operation of oil tankers are strict enough.  Yet an accident of this size has happened.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make a long speech.  I realise that the causes of the tragedy will be examined by the tribunal.  However, I feel it necessary to refer to what appears to be one of the significant facts emerging from this disaster, that is, a need for greater vigilance by national Governments through their various Transport Ministers.  I believe the time is ripe for the Minister for Tourism and Transport and his colleagues in the EEC Council of Transport Ministers to look at this question of oil spillage from tankers, accidents on tankers and so on.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael fully support the measures taken by the Minister to set up this inquiry and endorse the selection of Bantry as the venue.  I was taken aback when I heard the Minister say &ldquo;I am not in a position at this stage to say when the inquiry will commence.&rdquo;  Two months have elapsed since that unfortunate disaster.  I accept that there was need for amending legislation under the Tribunals Act which had to be enacted by the Oireachtas.  However, I am not a little perturbed that at this stage the Minister is unable to give the House some idea of the possible date for the commencement of the inquiry.  I urge that every step be taken to get this inquiry under way as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Col N="780" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that there should be a need for such an inquiry. Some good for the future might come out of the lawful disaster which occurred on 8 January on Whiddy Island.  Of course, that will not be any consolation to the relatives of the unfortunate people who died there.  We have no objection to the terms of reference announced by the Minister.  We applaud him for securing Mr. Justice Declan Costello to hold the inquiry, an excellent man who will do a conscientious job.  There has been a delay in bringing this motion before the Dáil and appointing Justice Costello to conduct the inquiry.  It has taken two months to have the terms of reference debated in this House.  We appear to be only now getting down to formally instituting the inquiry.  I join with Deputy O'Donnell in pressing the Minister to give the approximate date on which the inquiry will begin.  I acknowledge that a preliminary investigation into the cause of the disaster was carried out very quickly, but that does not provide a satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay in tabling the motion and having it debated here.  While the terms of reference appear to be adequate, questions of resources and staff to be made available to the members of the tribunal remain to be settled.</P>
      <P>The Minister said many experts, or people deemed to be experts, from his and other Departments would be joined by technical experts from abroad.  I cannot make any comment about these people because I do not know who they are or what their qualifications are.  All we can do is trust that the Minister got the best experts available, whether from this country or abroad.  I am sure there must be experts in this field who would be able to assist at the inquiry.  It is essential that the highest expertise be available to enable the members of the tribunal to come to grips with the cause of the problem and make appropriate recommendations, which I trust the Minister will act upon as quickly as possible.  It is appropriate that the Minister designated Bantry to be the venue for this inquiry.  I am sure he will have the support of the majority of the Members of this House in making that selection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the particulars involved in <Col N="781" /> the inquiry, there is a wider issue.  Like Deputy O'Donnell I do not want to prejudge or anticipate the findings or recommendations, but it appeared for a considerable time after the disaster on 8 January that Gulf Oil were calling the shots in relation to post-disaster activities on Whiddy Island.  This disaster appears to point to the fact that Government control over the operation of the company in the area is very much needed.  I trust that aspect will be considered by the tribunal.  We recall that Gulf Oil were brought to Whiddy Island a few years ago by a Fianna Fáil Government and it appears there were not sufficient safeguards in relation to public scrutiny&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to keep away from anything which might impinge in the slightest on the investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the tribunal will make recommendations as to the appropriate form of public scrutiny and control which should exist in relation to this company and the two other oil terminals, bearing in mind the national interest. If the tribunal feel they cannot make such recommendations, it is incumbent on the Government to do so. How and by whom this should be done is a matter for the consideration of the Minister.</P>
      <P>We must also remember that there was an oil spillage in Bantry in 1974. Fortunately there was no loss of life. After that spillage the Government issued a severe warning to Gulf Oil to improve their precautionary measures.  I am sure the Minister will be able to tell us whether, in fact, these measures were improved.  He might also tell us whether Gulf Oil monitor standards of safety of vessels arriving at the terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering this tribunal we must bear in mind the other sizeable oil installations at Whitegate and Dublin.  The consequences of a disaster of the magnitude of that which accurred at Whiddy would be much worse in either of these two places.  To avoid the danger of such a disaster, should there not be a <Col N="782" /> similar investigation into Whitegate and Dublin?  The installations at these two places are not included among the subjects being discussed by the tribunal, but the Minister should comment on the precautions and monitoring systems at Whitegate and Dublin.  The terms of the motion are wide enough to include all the matters which Deputies would wish to be considered by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>We must also consider what has happended at Whiddy since the explosions. As Deputy O'Donnell said, pollution has affected the lovely coastline of west Cork and has had an effect on the fishing industry.  Whilst I know the area fairly well, I am not a native of it.  It appears that the tourist industry may be affected if the pollution is not dealt with. The plight of the fisherman is such that, according to their spokesman, they have lost a considerable amount of money. The tribunal may not take that into consideration because they are concerned only with the cause of the explosions and fire.  However, the problems of the fisherman should be considered by the Minister.  Perhaps it is a matter between the fishermen and Gulf Oil, but the Minister should take an interest in the fishing and tourist industries.  The big question concerns the payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to know which member of the Government has the responsibility for dealing with pollution. It appears that the Minister for the Environment has responsibility for pollution which reaches the coastline, while the Minister for Tourism and Transport has responsibility for pollution at sea.  I am informed that Gulf Oil have control of the oil tankers at the Whiddy terminal. There should be some body to co-ordinate activities in preventing or dealing with pollution.  My party approve the terms of reference of the tribunal and are satisfied that Bantry is the best venue. We hope that the work of the tribunal will commence as quickly as possible and that they will speedily produce a report.  I would also hope that they would consider control by the Government or some central authority over the oil terminals at Whitegate and Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment <Col N="783" /> the Minister on his speech.  In the relatively short time since 8 January a preliminary inquiry has taken place and it was necessary to enact amending legislation in the Dáil.  Any fair-minded person would have to agree that much progress has been made since the disaster.</P>
      <P>I am glad the tribunal will investigate not only the cause and circumstances of the disaster but also the measures taken subsequently and whether they were adequate.  It is important that there is to be a public sworn inquiry so that everyone will be satisfied that nothing will be overlooked which may have contributed to the cause of the disaster.  I am glad that the tribunal will have at their disposal expertise from at home and abroad.  Such a disaster must not occur again.  The findings of the tribunal will be of benefit not only in this country but internationally. I am satisfied with the decision to hold the inquiry at Bantry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In common with my colleagues I wish to extend sympathy to the bereaved and to all those who have suffered loss because of this tragedy.  I welcome the selection of Bantry as the site for the hearings.  However, in studying the terms of reference and the Minister's speech I am worried that the scope of the inquiry may not be sufficiently wide.  I would point out that the people of Bantry and the surrounding areas are apprehensive lest there remains the possibility of a repetition.  They want to be assured that every step will be taken to investigate the cause of the explosions and any factors which might lead to a similar tragedy in the future.  I am anxious that their minds be put at rest in regard to the future.</P>
      <P>Prevention is better than cure and therefore all will agree that the widest possible inquiry is necessary.  I am afraid the wording of the motion may not ensure this fully.  Paragraph (3) states:</P>
      <P>the measures, and their adequacy, taken on and before the 8th January 1979, on, in the vicinity of and in relation to the ship and at, in the vicinity of and in relation to the terminal to prevent, and to minimise and otherwise to deal with&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> Obviously &ldquo;the ship&rdquo; is the <i>Betelgeuse</i>, but I suggest the terms of reference should permit an investigation of the circumstances pertaining to any ship coming to this terminal.  The Minister made it clear that we owe it to those who suffered loss to ascertain in the fullest possible way the causes of the tragedy and to discover the lessons to be learned so as to prevent such a disaster recurring.</P>
    <P>My anxiety is whether there is a possibility that factors exist other than those which caused the 8 January explosion which might lead to similar type explosions. Are there other factors involved, for instance in the operating of the terminal, which could lead to similar explosions? I accept that the main function of the tribunal must be to try to ascertain as exactly as possible what happened on the night in question, but could the inquiry be broadened to have a more complete investigation, to try to ascertain are there any other factors which in the future might lead to that type of tragedy?</P>
    <P>For instance, there is the question of whether the tribunal, in the context of the motion, can examine the position in regard to escape routes from the jetty, the evacuation of Whiddy Island in the event of further explosions and so forth. As the purpose of the inquiry will be also to ensure that such explosions will not occur again and that all safety measures will be taken in the future, surely recommendations should be made in regard to such safety measures.  The <i>modus operandi</i> of the tribunal arises.  I suggest that the tribunal chairman should be accessible to all interested parties prior to the formal sittings so that applications could be made for the production of documents and the submission of factual information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is of the opinion that the Deputy is getting into matters that would be appropriate to to the tribunal itself.  We cannot do that on a motion like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but without going into the question of the evidence that will be given, I suggest that the manner in which the tribunal will operate is proper for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="785" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>No. What we are dealing with is the establishment of a tribunal and its terms of reference.  The tribunal itself will have power to deal with the matters to which the Deputy is now referring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am raising with the Minister is the extent of these powers and whether in the context of the motion the tribunal will have power to order the production of planning permission documents, the operations manual of the terminal and so on prior to the hearings and make them available to interested parties.  I will not develop the point other than to put it on the record of the House that it is important that such documents would be available to interested parties on application to the tribunal to enable them properly to present their cases and submissions to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Another matter concerns witnesses. Will every possible effort be made to procure every witness of the happenings of 8 January and other matters in relation to the terms of reference?  Will the tribunal have sufficient resources to see that this is done?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the immediate task after the explosion, the removal of oil and the elimination of the risk of further pollution.  He said that this priority task had been accomplished efficiently and with expedition and that the pollution had been cleared up totally.  I am now informing the Minister that further major pollution occurred in the bay as late as last Saturday and spread as far as Castletownbere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have other worries arising from discussions with Bantry people.  One is whether the tribunal will have power to inquire into the losses which occurred as a result of the explosions.  Should the terms of reference not be wider to permit the tribunal to have such powers?  The Minister has said this will not be part of the tribunal's functions.  Obviously the tribunal will be inquiring into the circumstances leading to loss of life, and I suggest there will be other matters in this regard which the tribunal could investigate. We all know the loss the community suffered as a result of this tragedy, the loss from the tourism and <Col N="786" /> fishing industries, and questions naturally arise in relation to compensation, reparation and so forth.  Will this tribunal have any function in these matters? If not, will the Minister consider whether the terms of reference should be broadened to give it such a function?</P>
    <P>The other aspect at which the tribunal should be looking is the broader context of the international agreements regulating the transport of oil and the need in this country for the ratification of certain of these agreements.  Should the tribunal, as part of its terms of reference, have power to make recommendations in regard to further legislation in this country?  Should it have powers to examine the situation of the harbour board in Bantry and the powers or lack of such powers of that board?</P>
    <P>I raise these points because of my desire to ensure that this tribunal will have the widest possible powers so that the maximum benefit to the community can result from the investigation which it will conduct.  Finally, I am somewhat disturbed by the fact that the Minister was not in a position to say when the inquiry would commence.  It is important to get the work of the tribunal under way at once, and I ask the Minister to make arrangements accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak on the Bill to indicate the sympathy of everyone of us with the relatives of the many who died on Whiddy.  The disaster hit the whole country, and we were very conscious that these men were serving us by bringing oil into the country.  Every day of the year we went on in our selfish way, running cars and having our houses heated on the products of oil, and not thinking of the men who work all the time at this dangerous task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the way he has handled this matter from the moment the bad news came through.  People have complained about the delay. But it is not quite two months since the disaster occurred and the Minister is to be complimented on the way he has handled this at every step.  He could have left it until we found out at the inquiry the shortcomings of legislation in this regard.  He has acted in the best possible <Col N="787" /> way by perfecting and extending the legislation, by giving the tribunal more powers and by selecting Mr. Justice Costello as chairman of the tribunal.  We have great faith in Mr. Costello's efficiency and we know he will do a good job as head of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The nation has now recovered somewhat from the shock of the disaster, and the Minister has acted in the best possible way.  The inquiry will be held in Bantry very soon and we hope that from it we will find out exactly what happened.  It has been said that accidents do not just happen, and somebody caused this frightful accident.  The task before us is to find out what caused it, not in any spirit of vengence but so that we can take measures to prevent a recurrence. I do not say that good may come out of the Whiddy tragedy, but because of it we may learn something.  There will be repercussions far from Whiddy, and countries in the business of exporting or importing oil will look forward to the findings of this tribunal so that they can take measures to prevent such a thing happening in future.  Men of different nationalities were working at the scene of this disaster.  The poet John Donne said: &ldquo;Never ask to know for whom the bell tolls.  It tolls for thee.&rdquo;  It tolled for Irishmen and Frenchmen on that day. There is an onus on the nations of the world who are in the oil business to pool their resources of experience and to ensure that we do not become careless in handling oil.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the tribunal will hear a great amount of evidence which will be used by countries all over the world.  Preservations speak of prevention of destruction of our coastline.  No doubt the coastline suffered because of this disaster, but that is a secondary matter.  That type of damage can be repaired, thanks to advancement in science.  Unfortunately, we cannot bring back the 51 people who died, but we can ensure that the relatives of the victims will be compensated as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I have some fears.  Multinational oil companies have been very tough indeed, and they are powerful.  I must not anticipate what will happen at sittings of <Col N="788" /> the tribunal, but the Irish representatives on it will have to be the very best that we can get, people who will sift meticulously every item of evidence.  We must not allow financial considerations to inhibit in any way the probing by the tribunal into the cause of the accident.  Nobody in this House or anywhere else would wish this to be merely a face-saving exercise or, to use the popular phrase, cosmetic treatment. We are going to hold the inquiry and we will make sure that it is effective.</P>
    <P>In this tribunal the Minister is giving us an instrument which can be effective, provided it has the necessary back-up. The Bill setting up the tribunal provides for penalties, which are spelled out by the Minister, to be imposed on people who will not co-operate in various ways. As I have said, we are not going into this with a sense of vengence.  We are looking for the cause of this terrible accident. From the result of the inquiry we will draft the necessary legislation or institute precautions to ensure that never again will this happen.  We may well have a repetition of such a disaster; we cannot say we will not, but we will try to get the tribunal to ensure that it will not recur.  We are all very conscious of the dangers which oil may bring about, leakage and so forth.  We sometimes hear of tankers leaking off the coasts of other countries and we are all aware that if a tanker leaks off the coast of the UK or France we will be affected by it.  We hope that this tribunal will lead to an international recognition of the need to curb the possible damage caused by oil leakage.  We only own some very small tankers so it is unlikely that a disaster like the Whiddy Island one will be caused by our fleet.</P>
    <P>There could be a disaster in one of our larger ports where large quantities of oil are stored.  While the tribunal is examining the cause of the disaster at Whiddy Island it should examine what steps can be taken to ensure safety in the storage of oil.  We all feel we have a duty to the people who died in this disaster and their relatives to ensure that such a disaster will not happen again.  It is important to make sure that the tribunal is an instrument which will prevent a recurrence of this disaster and will put the blame where it rightly belongs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> I do not know if we will be able to find the real cause of the disaster.  I believe this tribunal which the Minister is setting up will be as efficient as it possibly can be.  I congratulate the Minister on the way he has handled this matter.  There is a temptation to rush into things to show the public what we are doing.  It might gain some popular plaudits but it would not be the right thing to do in this case. This is such a serious matter that it is necessary to consider every step in setting up the tribunal.  I believe that in the future the methods adopted by the Minister will be taken as a model on how to set up an inquiry into a very serious disaster.  I want again to extend sympathy to the relatives of those who died and to state our determination to find the cause of the accident at Whiddy so that we can prevent a recurrence.  It is now up to the people who form the tribunal to make sure that it is used to the fullest extent possible in searching out the cause of the disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M. P. Murphy Mr. M. P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discussed the Tribunals of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill I had an opportunity to express my sympathy with the relatives of the Bantry disaster victims, Irish and French, and also with Gulf Oil Corporation and the owners of the French tanker.  I am very pleased that the Minister has acceded to the unanimous request of the Deputies who spoke on that Bill to have the inquiry held in Bantry.  There will be general welcome that it is now to be held there.  Our debate here today is to make sure that the terms of the inquiry are such that the tribunal will be an all-embracing one. We know that it has been set up specifically to inquiry into a particular matter.  It is reasonable to assume that the eyes of the world will be on Bantry when the inquiry is being held and that many experts from here and abroad will be looking forward to the recommendations of the tribunal chairman.  I hope when the chairman makes the findings available that the Government will not delay in publishing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the terms set down in this motion quite adequate?  A layman reading through the Minister's brief would come to the conclusion that they are and that <Col N="790" /> the chairman of the tribunal is being given adequate powers to inquire into all aspects of this disaster.  Is it necessary to put any section or subsection into the terms of reference?  Some person during the course of the inquiry might be indicted. That is a reasonable assumption. If that should happen will that person be entitled to have legal representation during the remainder of the inquiry?  If he is entitled to have legal representation will he be entitled to have that at public expense? We know that it will be impossible for some people around the Bantry area to meet the legal costs of representation at an inquiry which is likely to last over a long period.  The Minister's reply may possibly be that such matters will be at the direction of the tribunal chairman.  Is it necessary for the House to add anything to the clauses set out in the motion we are discussing?</P>
    <P>During the discussion on the Inquiry Bill I raised the question of evidence by non-nationals.  If people from outside Ireland are asked to give evidence, for example, Gulf Oil, or the owners of the tanker, does the jurisdiction of the chairman of the tribunal extend to ensuring that such people attend?  I doubt if this is so unless special arrangements are made with the Governments of those people.  Was such a situation envisaged by the Minister or his advisers when drawing up this motion?  If it did arise and if somebody refused to attend, have we any compelling authority to ensure their attendance?  I should like the Minister to state in his reply whether, in such an eventuality, he would contact the Governments of the people concerned to ensure their attendance.</P>
    <P>Two months have now passed since the disaster occured.  We must take into account matters directly arising from the disaster which will not be within the terms of reference of the tribunal.  It is not the job of the tribunal to ascertain the extent of the damage caused by the disaster to tourism and to fishing.  Many people have played a prominent part in helping the relatives of the victims, particularly relatives of the French victims, and facilitating them in every way. Nothing more could have been done than what was done by the people of <Col N="791" /> Bantry and the surrounding districts. The Minister mentioned this and also the help given by officials of Government Departments, the Attorney General's Office, local authorities, the Garda, fire brigade and all the local associations.</P>
    <P>The Cork County Council have more than 100 men employed in trying to clear up Bantry Bay.  It is a difficult task as the oil spillage extended for miles beyond Whiddy.  The fishermen in the area are not satisfied with the way the Minister for Fisheries is handling his side of the question.  I wish to avail of this opportunity to make that statement publicly. We were told by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry that the damage caused by pollution to Bantry Bay was minimal.  If that is so, why is it necessary to engage more than 100 men in trying to clear up the bay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  We should have another tribunal of a minor nature to inquire into this question. Bantry Bay should be closed to fishing having regard to the manner in which it is affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions made here today should not try to anticipate what happened or what caused the disaster.  That is a major question.  There have been rumours and counter-rumours but it is hoped that the findings of the tribunal will dispel all of these and that we will get a clear picture of what happened on that unfortunate night in Bantry Bay. The Minister for Tourism has done everything one would expect a person in his office to do.  He has been to Bantry and the Government have brought in a measure to establish an inquiry into the disaster.  The statements he has made are quite acceptable.  While the Minister for Tourism has done all this, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is sadly lacking <Col N="792" /> in his duties as far as his side of the question is concerned.  I accept that it is difficult for the Minister for Tourism to give to the House the starting date for the inquiry.  Many preliminary matters must be dealt with but I am sure that once that work is completed, there will be no undue delay and the inquiry will get under way smoothly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>While the disaster was due to the terminal being at Bantry Bay, as one who lives not too far from Bantry I want to say that the Gulf Oil Corporation were welcomed in Bantry.  Despite the disaster, the majority of people in Bantry and in west Cork sympathise with Gulf and are anxious for them to continue their operations.  Those who say that Gulf should move their operations from Bantry are in the minority.</P>
    <P>Let us hope that the work of the tribunal will start soon and that the terms laid down in the motion will be adequate for the chairman and his advisers. I hope that the report of the tribunal will be able to throw some light on the cause of the disaster and that it will be of help to us, to other Governments and to those who work in oil terminals and on tankers.  There is no doubt that many people are looking forward to the results of the inquiry, which is of world-wide importance.  I have no doubt that the inquiry will be efficiently conducted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the terms of reference laid down by the Minister.  As a layman, I think they are sufficiently wide to cover all aspects of the tragic disaster which occurred in January last. I am not sure of the point raised by Deputy O'Keeffe and perhaps the Minister might comment on it.  The Minister may think that the point needs amending if the inquiry is to make recommendations in regard to future operations at the terminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disaster was tragic for everybody involved in it.  The Government deserve sympathy for having to handle a disaster of this magnitude in a remote part of the country.  It was also a disaster for Gulf, for the shipowners and particularly for the relatives of those who lost their lives. The primary task of the inquiry is to discover <Col N="793" /> the cause of the accident&mdash;to establish whether it was a mechanical fault or human error that caused the loss of 51 lives.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government decided to appoint Mr. Justice Costello to chair the tribunal.  It may not be realised that Mr. Justice Costello has experience in maritime matters through his attendance at the Law of the Sea Conferences in Caracas, in Rome and in Geneva.  His experience in this area probably resulted in his being chosen to chair the inquiry.  He will be assisted by a number of assessors who will be chosen on the basis of their high calibre, experience and expertise.  I do not know whether the assessors will be from the Minister's Department or whether they will be from outside the country.  I am sure that nobody would quibble if assessors were brought in from anywhere in the world as long as they were people of high calibre, experience and expertise.</P>
    <P>Unlike other speakers, I am not unduly concerned with the delay in establishing the tribunal.  We are naturally impatient to discover the cause of the accident in order to prevent further accidents of a similar nature.  The evidence brought before the tribunal should be as detailed and as comprehensive as possible. In that regard the action of the Minister's Department and of many other people should be commended.  I should like to pay tribute to the gardaí, the county council workers and many others who helped at the time of the disaster. The fact that there were no survivors makes the task of the tribunal difficult. Therefore, it is important that the officials of the Department, the shipowners and the operators at the terminal should finecomb every shred of evidence to ensure that it is as complete as possible before being presented to the tribunal.  In that regard, the Minister said, &ldquo;When the bow section of the vessel had been rendered safe for examination after the completion of gas interting, the work of investigation and assembly of evidence was carried out under the close supervision of my Department.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was on the other side of the world at the time of the disaster.  It was recognised as a disaster of such immense <Col N="794" /> proportions that it made front page news in a paper published 12,000 miles away. Even that distance away it was regarded as an enormous disaster.  I was in Bantry two days later and I was glad to discover that the machinery in the Minister's Department had been set in motion immediately and that the supervision by the Department since then has been of a nature that has ensured co-operation from all concerned.  I am glad to be able to pay tribute to the Minister for that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have no doubt there is a real desire on the part of everybody concerned to get as close as possible to the truth of what happened to cause the disaster of 8 January.</P>
    <P>I can accept that.  There may be a temptation on the part of some people, without waiting for the tribunal to complete its investigations, to blame either the shipowners or the owners of the oil.  This should be resisted for a number of reasons.  It should be resisted because a tribunal is being set up to investigate the cause of the disaster and until it presents its findings we will not be able to assess exactly who is to blame&mdash;that is, if it can ever be assessed. That is also a possibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore made the point that multinationals with their clout, influence and wealth could be accused of attempting to cover up in this regard.  It would be unwise for anybody inside or outside this House wildly to accuse the Gulf Oil Corporation, because they are a multinational, of attempting a cover-up. I believe it is as much in their interests and that they are as concerned to see that the truth is established.</P>
    <P>As a result of this inquiry I hope we will establish matters to our own satisfaction, that the internal safety standards are sufficient to eliminate the possibility of a disaster in the future and that they are as detailed and as strictly enforced as possible.  I hope also that there will be some international implications in that other countries and international institutions will take some of the recommendations if they are made or accept on the basis of evidence, even without recommendations being made, <Col N="795" /> the fact that the carriage of oil can be made safer so that the possibility of a similar disaster elsewhere may be avoided.</P>
    <P>Looking at the terms of reference from a layman's point of view, I am satisfied that they are as wide as possible and that the inquiry will be as open and comprehensive as possible.  I hope that the findings will be heeded not just in this country but by everyone who has responsibility for ensuring the safety of the carriage of oil at sea in future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said on this motion and I do not want to bore the House by going over ground that has been covered already.  Unfortunately I was not able to be present for all the contributions.  At the outset I should like to put briefly but formally on the record of the House my sympathy with the relatives of the people who unfortunately lost their lives in this disaster.</P>
      <P>It is now nearly two months since this disaster took place.  Today we are in a position in this House when all we know of the inquiry are the terms of reference, the person who will head the inquiry, Mr. Justice Costello, and the venue which is Bantry.  I suppose we should be grateful for that amount of information. I am not unaware that the Minister has had considerable difficulty in handling this matter and it would be unfair for anyone in this House not to recognise that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With other Deputies I was anxious that the details of the inquiry, the location and the terms of reference would be published as soon as possible because once those details were known the actual holding of the inquiry and the date could take second place.  At least people would be aware that a responsible, democratic Government were responding to an unfortunate disaster, that a responsible, democratic Government with an experienced senior Minister were moving quickly, knowing what they were doing and in control of the situation.  I regret that at times unfortunately that impression was not conveyed to the public at large.  I regret that today we are still missing certain items of information that <Col N="796" /> would remove such a charge that I make reluctantly.</P>
    <P>First, I shall turn to the terms of reference with which basically I am in full agreement.  However, there is one addition&mdash;it could be argued as being a marginal addition&mdash;but it is a matter of concern to many in the area and it is one that could be inserted as (c) of paragraph (3).  It deals with pollution measures.  Some reference to such measures before 8 January should be considered.  The inquiry should have the right to look at whatever anti-pollution measures were taken in so far as they may relate to operations on the jetty and on Whiddy Island.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Murphy, and others have voiced the concern of people in the area with regard to the fishing industry. In view of the fact that the tourist industry is directly involved and the Minister present is correctly titled Minister for Tourism first and secondly Minister for Transport, and that pollution is something that affects our tourist industry, to say the least it is strange that some reference to pollution is not included in this motion.  I should like to hear the Minister indicate that such anti-pollution measures that would normally operate on the jetty and related facilities would fall within the competence of the terms of reference and, therefore, would be capable of being discussed and examined at the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The second point I wish to make relates to the assessors.  We know that the chairperson will be Mr. Justice Costello, a person who is genuinely respected by all sides of this House and whose authority is well established. However, his role will be that of chairing the meetings and heading the tribunal and his experience will be simply of a legal nature.  For an inquiry to produce the kind of results that will be of benefit to future generations of Irish people, the right questions must be asked.  According to the information the Minister gave in his opening speech, we do not know who the rest of these assessors will be, other than that they will be of the highest calibre and quality.  I would take it, from the fact that the Minister has not yet announced the names of such personnel, <Col N="797" /> that they have not been finally selected.  If that is the case, I would like the Minister to indicate to the House now, two months after the disaster, why the final selection has not yet been made.</P>
    <P>Obviously the date of the commencement of the inquiry hinges on a number of other factors not least of which will be the finalising of the selection of the members of the inquiry board.  The Minister in his speech said in reference to Bantry that he could tell the House that Bantry had been chosen as the location. I am pleased that Bantry is to be the venue.  From the outset I supported Bantry as the proper venue for such an inquiry.  In view of the absolute necessity for the media to have full access to the inquiry and for the public at large to have up-to-date information, will the Minister who also has responsibility for telecommunications, tell us if it is proposed to install an automatic exchange in Bantry?  Six times the number of French people were killed in this disaster as the number of Irish people. What facilities will be made available to ensure rapid communications from Bantry Bay to the rest of Ireland and to the world?  Will telex facilities be installed to complement an automatic telephone exchange?  It was up to the Minister to give this information in the introduction of this resolution.  On numerous occasions we on this side of the House were told that we would have a full opportunity to discuss all these matters when the terms of the inquiry were brought by way of resolution to this House.  It is therefore appropriate in speaking to the resolution to raise these questions, since the Minister saw fit to announce officially for the first time that Bantry is to be the venue.  The delay in making that decision was presumably because of the need to assess the resources needed for such an inquiry. Consequently, will the Minister tell me the outcome of the assessment and say what specific proposals there are for the improvement of communications between Bantry and the rest of the country?  The Minister said in the last part of the terms of reference:</P>
    <P>. . . . may make such recommendations as, having regard to its findings, it may think proper.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> In this aspect of the terms of reference lies a much bigger issue than the Minister is aware of or is prepared to bring forward to the House.  This inquiry should not be a witchhunt; it will not bring back the dead and it will do little to comfort those who have lost relatives.  If it is simply seen as that it will serve no useful purpose.  We should be capable of learning from our mistakes.  All reasonable people will agree that that is the benefit which should derive from this inquiry.  The inquiry will cost a considerable sum of money, if the cost of similar type inquiries are to be taken as normal, plus the real cost of locating the inquiry in Bantry which will add to the cost rather than reduce it.  I presume that the assessors and the Chairperson, Mr. Justice Costello, and whatever secretarial staff they have will have the job of drafting and publishing recommendations. Is the Minister satisfied that the personnel he has yet to select or to publicly announce, will have the capacity and the resources to make specific recommendations which will above all else enable us to learn from the mistakes and the disaster in Whiddy. That question obviously relates to who the assessors will be.  Will they be officials from the Department or will they be, as the Minister indicated in his speech, experts, drawn from Irish Shipping and the IIRS?</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that any recommendations of a positive nature involving preventative measures for marine safety either on land or at sea or in relation to oil installations, will involve legislation. Has the Minister the resources and the capacity to take the recommendations that may come from the inquiry and convert them without undue delay into domestic legislation?  My reason for asking that is that when the Minister of State, Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick, has on previous occasions been asked about the Government's intention to introduce domestic legislation to ratify two international marine convention pieces of legislation, the MARPOL Convention and the SOLAS Convention, we were given to understand that there were certain difficulties and delays in that area.  I can fully appreciate that the Minister cannot accept responsibility for the unfortunate <Col N="799" /> neglect of our marine resources by numerous Governments, but in view of the existing backlog of required legislation and the probability that recommendations for domestic legislation will emanate from this inquiry would the Minister indicate what steps he is taking to increase his resources in the marine section of the Department of Tourism and Transport so that there will not be an undue delay in the implementation of the recommendations of the tribunal?</P>
    <P>While I have questions to ask and criticisms to make of the speed with which the response was made, I say formally that the Labour Party certainly welcome the publication of these terms of reference and will support the resolution in the Dáil and would wish by way of question to offer constructive support to the Minister in this regard.  If there are any matters slowing up this process which requires the consent of the Dáil in order to speed them up, I publicly ask the Minister to come forward and seek our support which I can assure him will be forthcoming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion.  Some weeks ago when we debated the Bill to set up the tribunal of inquiry, my contribution was curtailed by the Chair who repeatedly told me that I was out of order but that I would have every opportunity to discuss the specific points I had raised when this motion was being discussed. I hope that will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's speech we are told that the tribunal is being set up to establish the reasons and the circumstances for the disaster in the hope that the same will not happen again.  Of course accidents will happen no matter how vigilant people are, whether on the road or at sea.  There is always an element of human error.  We cannot safely forecast or ensure that such an occurrence, a lesser occurrence or a far greater catastrophe will not take place again in the future.  Did we need to be warned?  Did we need to have a disaster such as this happen before we realised that our vigilance is not what it should <Col N="800" /> be?  We have had a whole series of similar-type accidents or disasters&mdash;one could say&mdash;on the west coast of Europe. Initially we had the <i>Torrey Canyan</i> disaster off Land's End, followed last year by the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> off the Brittany coast which did an enormous amount of damage.  More recently we had the <i>Cristos Bitas</i> which got into trouble off the Welsh coast and for some peculiar reason ended up off the Irish coast and which eventually, to the anger of our fishermen, was towed into the Atlantic off the coast of Ireland and sunk.</P>
    <P>This latest disaster gives rise to many questions.  I hope the tribunal will deal with all the allegations and suspicions that have arisen in the past two months. Have we, as in so many other spheres, neglected the standard of safety in the interests of economic gain?  This is a very common reason for accidents or disasters&mdash;that people who should be spending money on safety precautions skimp and the end result is an occasional disaster.  I presume that the tribunal will not only establish the reason for the disaster but will also apportion the blame and I should like the Minister to tell us if that is the case so that people who have suffered and the families of those who died and other interests in the general area who have suffered losses can be compensated.</P>
    <P>At Question Time some weeks ago I got an entirely unsatisfactory answer from the Minister for Fisheries in regard to the livelihood of fishermen who have been affected since 8 January.  I did not get an answer when I spoke on the Bill which was brought in to set up this tribunal when I asked about some allegations which were made in <i>The Irish Skipper</i> which, if true, could have very serious consequences for the people in the Bantry Bay area.  I hope this is brought to the notice of the tribunal.  The question I asked then and to which I got no answer is the same as the one I ask today.  Is it true that the Irish Government have not ratified the International Convention on Civil Liberty for Oil Pollution Damage, 1969?  We are told in this article that if we had signed that convention we could claim against shipowners in our courts.  When the shipowners <Col N="801" /> are found negligent and we have not signed the convention it is most likely that we cannot claim.  If that is correct it puts our fishermen and anybody else affected by the damage caused in a very difficult position.  If this is the case I should like to know what the Government are doing to fill the void that will thus be created.</P>
    <P>We are also told in that article that there is an International Fund for Oil Pollution Damage which Ireland could have joined in 1971 or any time since. That seems the obvious place for people to make their claims.  Apparently, we have not joined that fund.  The allegation is made that we did not join it because the oil companies do not like it&mdash;they have to pay levies to it.  I should like an answer to those allegations, that many people who should be entitled to compensation may not be because of the negligence of successive Governments in that regard.</P>
    <P>I was in Bantry four weeks ago, four weeks precisely since the disaster.  I was inundated with requests from local fishing interests to ask the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to ensure that the harbour was closed so that they could have a basis for claiming compensation as at that time and for the four weeks since the disaster they had not been able to earn a shilling.  As late as yesterday I read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> that fishermen in the Bantry Bay area are destitute because it is impossible to fish and any consignments of shell fish that were caught in the outer regions of the harbour were rejected on the British and French markets.  What provision has been made to see that these people are adequately compensated because at present the majority of them are living on the breadline?  Nobody seems willing to admit responsibility, which I imagine in big business is the normal procedure, until the court, or in this case the tribunal, apportions blame.</P>

      <P>The Chair is of opinion that the Deputy is now getting into matters that are for investigation by the tribunal which it is proposed to establish.  We cannot do that; it is completely out of order.  I accept <Col N="802" /> it is a rather delicate matter but if we get into that field we are in trouble. We are doing something which we are establishing the tribunal to do.  We cannot carry out the investigation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am confining myself to the terms of reference and to the Minister's statement today.  Surely some provision should be made in the interim for people who have suffered grievous loss.  Could the Minister tell us what the Government intend to do until the blame has been apportioned by the tribunal?  As the Chair rightly said it is not for us here to apportion blame but I want people to be looked after until such time as the findings are issued and until compensation is paid.  I hope it can be paid in view of the allegations made in this month's edition of <i>The Irish Skipper.</i></P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The most immediate task after the explosion and fire was of course to remove the remaining oil, to eliminate the risk of further pollution and to ensure against danger of further fire or explosion.</P>
      <P>We all accept that is and should be a primary consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>This priority task was accomplished with efficiency and expedition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to contradict the Minister on that.  My evidence at first hand&mdash;as I stated I visited the Bantry Bay area and toured it by boat on 5 February&mdash;was that pollution was widespread and that, <Col N="803" /> in the inner bay area, no attempt had been made to clear it up.  The most scenic part of Ireland, Glengariff Bay, which includes Garnish Island, was seriously polluted at that time and the local people were extremely unhappy that no effort&mdash;not even a minimum effort&mdash;had been made to clear up the extensive pollution which existed.  The Minister's statement is quite incorrect in that respect.</P>
    <P>My latest evidence is that the pollution is continuing.  Last Saturday, 3 March, there was a fairly substantial oil spillage from the remaining sector of the tanker which is submerged near the demolished jetty.  We all know the bow was towed out to sea and scuttled 100 miles south-west of Fastnet Rock.  The stern section, however, still remains and obviously contains quantities of oil, to what extent I do not know, which are still seeping out and causing pollution. The tourist season is now imminent and I trust the Minister will see to it that all necessary work will be done immediately to clear up this pollution.</P>
    <P>In his reply to this debate I should like the Minister to tell us the latest position with regard to the extensive pollution in Glengariff Bay and Garnish Island.  The Minister was very unfair to the local people in not ordering the closure of the harbour to fishing two months ago. Because there was no closure, fishermen could not justify claims for compensation. In 1974, after a lesser spill of oil, the harbour was immediately closed and claims by fishermen for compensation were allowed on a very sound legal basis, the closure of the harbour.</P>
    <P>Last autumn there was a disease called red tide or brown tide which endangered fish life in the outer regions of this harbour.  The whole harbour area was closed and fishermen had to be compensated.  Now that a greater catastrophe has occurred, not only in terms of losses of life but also losses of livelihood, nothing has been done as regards compensation.  The Minister should regularise that unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this inquiry is <Col N="804" /> being held to establish the cause of this disaster and to ensure, if possible, that such a disaster cannot happen again. For several years we have had the means at our disposal to provide the necessary safeguards.  I was a member of the Seanad three or fours years ago when the then Minister for Transport and Power introduced a Bill to set up a Bantry Bay Harbour Board which would regulate shipping in the bay.  That Bill was passed but, unfortunately, the Government have not seen fit to give any financial aid to that board, thereby rendering them totally ineffective.  I am told in no other harbour in the world would shipping of such intensity, such size and such potential danger be allowed to use the harbour without being supervised by a harbour board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to an omission in the Minister's speech.  I want to refer also to a matter which arose at Question Time two or three weeks ago. In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Garda, Army and Navy personnel have done a tremendous job. The shipowners, terminal operators, salvors and their employees have worked in very difficult and dangerous conditions to make the wreck safe and contain the risk of oil spillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all join in those sentiments and wish to thank the people concerned.  A lot of them were up day and night for weeks in the hope of finding survivors or looking for bodies.  But there is no mention of the fact that the British Navy provided a number of helicopters, that they worked exceedingly hard for several days, and in particular for several nights, because the Irish rescue services did not have the same facilities.  I thought it a particularly nasty type of attitude that was adopted the day that Deputy White questioned the Minister for Defence on this matter&mdash;that he could not express gratitude to the British Naval personnel concerned. Everybody, English, Irish, French, or whoever took part in the attempt to find bodies is entitled to the same treatment when it comes to handing out thanks.  I would make reference also to the fact that officials of various Departments are thanked in the Minister's speech for all the work they did.  I have no doubt that the bulk of them did a very efficient job.  However I should like to place on record that on my visit to the Bantry Bay area I found a lot of people disenchanted with the high-handed attitude adopted by a number of officials, especially in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  I should like to bring those points to the attention of the Minister.  We might express <Col N="807" /> gratitude to everybody concerned&mdash;and I am sure the bulk of them deserve our thanks&mdash;but there was great dissatisfaction with the attitude of a minority, particularly people from the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, who gave no co-operation at all to local fishing interests.</P>
    <P>We are told also in the Minister's speech:</P>
    <P>The damage caused by pollution and the use of dispersants has been kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>In that regard I am told that pollution was fairly extensive but that, in many cases, the amount of dispersant used was such that it killed every type of fish life in the immediate area, that it was not kept to a minimum but was grossly over-used.  I wonder what technical knowledge is available to our various Government Departments on occasions like that.  Are we conversant with the methods of dealing with such pollution, or is it a case of merely swamping the place in the hope that one will eliminate the traces of oil and tar?  I am told that the amount of dispersants distributed on the surface, which sank to the bottom, did more damage than the pollution itself.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the tribunal and the opportunity to discuss the motion.  I regret that the chair has curtailed my efforts to go into the matter in greater detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputies for the very constructive way they approached this motion.  I have no doubt that the House is united in its desire to ensure that every effort is made to find out the truth of what happened to <Col N="808" /> cause the dreadful disaster at Bantry Bay on 8 January last.  For our part the Government are satisfied that the brief which is being given to the tribunal of inquiry has the necessary wide-ranging scope to enable the tribunal to make the best possible effort to do this.  As I have said in my opening speech, there are tragic aspects of this disaster which made the task of the tribunal difficult in the extreme&mdash;those who were most intimately involved in the events into which the tribunal will inquire did not survive.  Nevertheless we just all hope that the work of examination and investigation which has to be carried out in a most through way by the experts to whom I have assigned the task will be well done, will enable the tribunal to establish the causes and circumstances of the disaster and, if necessary, to recommend measures which will contribute to the avoidance of such terrible events in the future.</P>
      <P>I may not have sufficiently emphasised in my speech the very high degree of co-operation which existed amongst all the parties in Bantry in the aftermath of the disaster.  I cannot praise too highly the dedication with which the many difficult tasks were undertaken and the efficiency with which they were handled.  As I have said, the oil pollution was kept to a minimum.  The job of cleaning up the pollution that occurred was undertaken in an efficient manner.  The dispersants were used as prudently and as effectively as possible to ensure that the damage was kept to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The gas-freeing of the vessel in order to make it safe was completed by the salvors in most difficult and highly dangerous circumstances.  I do not think the public realise how very difficult and dangerous that particular operation was. Having regard to the scale of the disaster, the hazards to life and to the environment which remained in the aftermath of the disaster, all concerned deserve our thanks for the way in which the situation was handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said he was somewhat perturbed about my statement relating to the commencement of the inquiry.  At this stage it is not possible for me to give the date of commencement. <Col N="809" /> I would hope to be in a position shortly to name the assessors who will assist the tribunal.  It must be recognised that the various interested parties, their experts, and the legal representatives require time to assemble the evidence, to carry out the necessary research, experiments and so on, to prepare reports and brief counsel.  It is appreciated that the vessel was in a highly dangerous state for quite a considerable time after the disaster and the first priority was to remove the remaining oil from the bow section and to eliminate the danger of further fires or explosions.  It was only when these very difficult tasks had been successfully accomplished that the bow section of the vessel was available for examination. As the House is aware, the mid section and the after section of the vessel are still in the sea bed adjacent to the jetty and it remains to be decided how those sections will be dealt with. Investigations are, of necessity, of a very highly complex scientific and technical nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us how much oil is left?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Please allow me to continue. I did not interrupt anybody.</P>
      <P>In the particular circumstances of this accident, where there were no survivors among those directly involved&mdash;the investigation and examination of the wreck are of vital importance to the inquiry and it is therefore essential to ensure that the investigations are carried out by highly qualified experts and under strict control and supervision and that the evidence is carefully assembled for the inquiry.  This work is continuing and it could have some bearing on the timing of the opening of the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Corish and a number of other Deputies about the assessors. I would hope shortly to be able to announce the names of the assessors who will assist the tribunal.  I know that Deputies realise the importance of the inquiry and the need to have assessors of the requisite expertise and experience. Because of the scale of the disaster and in view of the fact that we do not have any large tankers in our merchant fleet, I <Col N="810" /> have approached several other countries asking for their assistance in nominating possible appointees.  I have obtained considerable assistance but the matter is not yet sufficiently advanced to enable me to announce the names of the assessors. Deputies will appreciate that those persons equipped to undertake the work of assessors are likely to be in positions of responsibility and importance and arrangements must be made to obtain their consent to act as assessors and to facilitate their absence from their present jobs for the duration of what could be a fairly lengthy inquiry.  I can assure the House that assessors of the highest calibre will be appointed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish referred to what he termed our slowness in getting this inquiry off the ground.  The same thing was mentioned by Deputy Quinn.  I might add that the only sour note in the whole course of our discussions here came from Deputy Quinn.  I can appreciate that, because in the past two months he has extracted the last ounce of publicity from this unfortunate disaster by publicly claiming, in season and out of season, that we were tardy in setting up this tribunal, and he now finds himself here today in a minority of one.  I am referring not simply to his remarks here today but to his remarks on the previous Bill and on other occasions.  In this connection I must admit that I am not the most avid reader of Dáil reports, but Deputy Quinn's remarks were brought to my attention.  The only thing I can say to Deputy Quinn is that personal abuse is no substitute for constructive criticism.</P>
    <P>Because this matter was raised it is necessary for me to relate in some detail what we have done in relation to the setting up of the inquiry and what has been going on since the disaster took place. On 8 January, the day of the disaster, I chaired a meeting of representatives of all the interested Government Departments&mdash;my own Departments of Tourism and Transport and Posts and Telegraphs; the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy; the Department of the Environment; the Department of Defence, including the Army and Naval Services; the Department of Fisheries <Col N="811" /> and Forestry and the Department of Labour&mdash;to review the entire situation, to identify the responsibilities of the various Departments and to plan the action which needed to be taken.  This group continued to meet, very often under my chairmanship, for several weeks while the emergency at Bantry continued.</P>
    <P>At that first meeting arrangements were made to establish co-ordination and control centres at the Department of Defence in Dublin and at the Court House in Bantry.  These were manned on a continuous basis by officials of interested Departments.  Emergency communications facilities were established to provide for ease of communication.  The Bantry control centre had responsibilities both in relation to the pollution and to the salvage operations.  Two senior officials of my Department were assigned full time to Bantry to supervise the salvage operations, the protection of evidence and the assembly of evidence to place before the tribunal of inquiry.  Any actions in any of these areas were subject to my supervision and approval.  On 9 January, the day after the disaster, I appointed a surveyor from my Department to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the disaster under section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  On the same day I announced that there would be a sworn inquiry into the disaster.  I might add that the Taoiseach had already indicated on the previous day that a full public inquiry would be held into the disaster.</P>
    <P>All possible measures were taken to ensure that the necessary resources and manpower would be available to cope with any pollution arising.  These resources included ships of the Naval Service equipped with detergent and disposal equipment.  The Department of Fisheries dispatched to Bantry their research vessel, <i>Lough Beltra</i>, which was equipped with special water sampling equipment.  Cork County Council co-operated very fully in the anti-pollution measures.  Meetings were held by me and by officials of my Department with representatives of Gulf Oil, the salvers and the insurers to review the <Col N="812" /> progress of the salvage operations, the anti-pollution measures and the protection and assembly of evidence for the tribunal of inquiry.  The task of the supervision of the salvage operations and the protection and assembly of evidence for the tribunal of inquiry were such that I decided to augment the professional expertise of the marine section of my Department by the engagement of additional experts.</P>
    <P>I obtained very substantial assistance in this regard from the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  They provided experts in quite a variety of areas&mdash;chemists, photographers, naval architects, civil engineers, metallurgists and diving expertise.  The institute also provided the services of the head of their Marine Resources Division.  They helped to advise and co-ordinate on various aspects of research, analysis and so on and they provided laboratory facilities as they became necessary.  Specialist firms were employed to assist with diving and other work.  I decided also to obtain expert advice from abroad.</P>
    <P>It is worth while giving this information because it shows how carefully we operated in relation to this whole matter. We obtained expertise from abroad in certain areas.  A naval architect and two metallurgists were engaged from Lloyds Register of Shipping, the world-wide classification society.  I have also asked Lloyds Register to carry out an examination of a sister ship of the <i>Betelgeuse</i> which is at present in Taiwan.  We also obtained the services of a former Engineer Surveyor-in-Chief of the British Department of Trade, who is an ex-chairman of the subcommittee on fire protection of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, to carry out an investigation into the cause and effects of the fire and explosion. Four officers of Irish Shipping Limited, two master mariners and two engineers have been assisting the team in Bantry. Representatives of other interested parties with a direct interest in the hearings before the tribunal of inquiry have been afforded facilities to examine the wreck with my consent and under my supervision. A press notice notifying interested parties of the availability of such <Col N="813" /> facilities was published in the daily newspapers of 5 February 1979.  From all this it will be clear that this whole matter was handled efficiently and as rapidly as one could expect.</P>
    <P>I must say I appreciate very much the expressions of a number of Deputies in regard to the fact that we have moved as rapidly as possible in relation to this matter.  I have also had comments of foreign observers.  There was a very favourable comment on a German radio programme about the manner in which we had dealt with this matter and most Deputies will have read the comments of the Permanent Adviser to the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions of the EEC, Mr. Despicht, who led a ten-man working group to Bantry. He is quoted as saying that they were particularly impressed by the serious, efficient and non-hysterical manner in which the problem at Bantry was tackled.  He is quoted as saying also that if everybody reacted like this we might be on the way to solving major pollution problems caused by oil tanker accidents in Europe.  I mention these matters because it had been suggested by some Deputies, but not by many, that we were tardy in our efforts to set up this tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the terms of the motion but I assure him that these terms are as wide as are necessary and I think he will find that the problems he mentioned are overcome by section 2 and partly by section 3 of the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy asked whether somebody having a direct interest in the inquiry would have the right to be represented legally.  Any person with a direct interest will be entitled to be represented legally.  The Deputy asked also about the making available of public funds for such a person.  The position in that regard is that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979 gives power to the tribunal to direct that the costs of any person appearing before the tribunal shall be paid by any person named by the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn asked whether we had improved the telecommunications <Col N="814" /> system at Bantry.  The fact is that the telecommunications system there worked very well during the period after the tragedy occurred but we will be supplementing the system considerably for the tribunal.  The Deputy can rest assured that the additional facilities will be provided in good time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy raised the question of compensation.  In this regard I should like to make it clear that there are arrangements for compensation for damage caused by oil pollution.  Funds have been established by tanker owners and oil companies which provide for payment of up to 36 million dollars for a single pollution incident.  That is under the TOVALOP and CRISTAL schemes.  I think I have answered most of the questions raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is concerned with an amendment to the Truck Acts of 1831 to 1896, which were designed to protect the manual workers to whom they apply from abuses in connection with the payment of wages; towards that end, they provide three basic forms of protection, <Col N="815" /> against payment in kind; against interference with the worker's freedom to dispose of his wages as he thinks fit; and, against unreasonable or unfair deductions from wages.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have heard of the &ldquo;Tommy-shop&rdquo;, often owned by the employer, which was a well-known feature of truck practice in the 19th century. It frequently happened that the worker had to buy goods there at a higher price than he would have paid elsewhere&mdash;the effect being much the same as if he had been underpaid by the employer.</P>
    <P>While any return to the conditions in which it became necessary to enact the Truck Acts is not foreseen, it could be premature to abandon all the statutory protection which they afford workers. As regards enforcement in the field of truck legislation, the work of the factory inspectorate&mdash;here as in Britain&mdash;has in practice been limited to the investigation of cases which came to the notice of inspectors during their visits to factories, or to which their attention is called by way of complaint.</P>
    <P>Most complaints have been concerned with illegal deductions from wages.  Approximately ten such complaints have been received since the Department of Labour was set up.  No prosecutions were necessary, as the employers concerned rectified the situation once their legal obligations were pointed out to them by the inspectors.  Deputies might be tempted to think that ten complaints in slightly over as many years is a comparatively small number.  Nevertheless, the fact that in this day and age valid complaints are made goes to show that one should be slow to contend that the Truck Acts are no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>This Bill, then, does not set out to repeal the Truck Acts.  Its central purpose is to amend that legislation in order to legalise the payment of manual workers' wages by cheque or other payment instrument, where both employers and workers concerned are agreeable. The present prohibition on the payment of wages by cheque to certain categories of workers arose unintentionally: while section 1 of the Truck Act, 1831, required <Col N="816" /> manual workers' wages to be paid in the current coin of the realm, section 8 of that Act made it lawful to pay wages, with the worker's consent, in legal tender notes or by bearer cheque drawn on a bank which was within 15 miles of the place of employment and which was licensed to issue bank notes.  The latter restriction has had the accidental effect of making payment by cheque illegal, since section 60 of the Currency Act, 1927, removed the banks' powers to issue bank notes.</P>
    <P>The payment of wages otherwise than in cash is provided for in Article 3.2 of the ILO Protection of Wages Convention (No. 95), 1949, which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>The competent authority may permit or prescribe the payment of wages by cheque or postal order or money order, in cases in which payment in this manner is customary or necessary because of special circumstances, or where collective agreements or arbitration awards so provide, or where not so provided with the consent of the worker concerned.</P>
    <P>This provision was supported by the employers' and workers' delegates at the 1949 ILO Conference.  From the time the principle was enunciated in the convention to the present initiative to have the legal position regularised here, there has been, one must admit, a long period of gestation.  Indeed, before ever the Department of Labour was established some Deputies may be aware that the question of an appropriate amendment to the Truck Acts received preliminary consideration by a committee representative of the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which was set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in 1959.</P>
    <P>When the committee was reconstituted in 1964, it made recommendations&mdash;along the lines of the provisions of the present Bill&mdash;which were accepted by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce.  However, in the intervening years preparation and enactment of the body of other protective legislation, now on the Statute Book, <Col N="817" /> took precedence over amending the Truck Acts.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Under section 2, the provisions of the Bill&mdash;with the exception of sections 5 and 8 (4), to which I shall be referring later&mdash;are applied to employees covered by the Truck Acts or by the Hosiery Manufacture (Wages) Act, 1874.  As was the case with the workers encompassed by the Truck Acts, the Hosiery Manufacture (Wages) Act was aimed at protecting hosiery workers, by curbing abuses in connection with the payment of wages in kind and with deductions from wages.  It is, therefore, considered as legislation related to those Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 3 enables the employer and employee&mdash;or some other person acting on the employee's behalf&mdash;to sign an agreement specifying the method by which wages are to be paid.  The method will be chosen from among the list of payment instruments contained in the section.  This list, which follows generally on the provisions of section 26 (6) of the Central Bank Act, 1971, includes: cheques; bank drafts; promissory notes or other documents or, for example, a credit transfer issued by a customer for the purpose of enabling a person to obtain payment from the customer's bank account; payable orders and other documents issued by a public officer for the purpose of enabling a person to obtain payment from a Government Minister; as well as cheques and other documents drawn on Trustee Savings Banks.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Labour may, by regulations, make additions to the list.  In this way provision is made for flexibility with regard to the possible future establishment of new kinds of financial institutions or instruments. From the point of view of individual employers and employees involved, local circumstances will probably be the most important factor in determining the appropriate method of payment.</P>
    <P>There is no unique formula, capable of being applied to all firms&mdash;hence the wide variety of payment instruments from which a choice can be made.  But, <Col N="818" /> whatever the choice, I cannot stress too highly the importance of adequate prior preparation and consultation.</P>
    <P>Obviously, it would be desirable to cater in the Bill for circumstances where either the employer or employee, for whatever reason, wished to end an agreement about the type of payment instrument used.  Section 3, therefore, provides that an agreement can be revoked in either of two ways: first, by mutual consent; and, secondly, by either party, once the specified period of written notice, which must be not less than four weeks, is given to the other party concerned.</P>
    <P>I might also mention that existing arrangements between the employer and employee, involving any of the payment instruments referred to in this section, will if necessary, be deemed to be an agreement signed in accordance with the section and can be terminated in the same way as such an agreement.  This provision will regularise the use of any payment instrument which may have been used in the past in contravention of the Truck Acts arising from the operation of the Currency Act, 1927.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is a protective measure designed to ensure the employee's freedom from pressure or coercion where the method of payment of his wages is concerned.  Towards this end, any term or condition of an agreement will be null and void if it requires a person either to sign a document agreeing to the use of a payment instrument listed in section 3, or not to terminate the use of any such instrument where it is already being used to pay wages to the employee involved.</P>
    <P>Section 4 acknowledges the fact that, where an employee is required to work at a place other than his usual place of employment, or is absent from work by reason of illness, on leave or with the consent of his employer, he may prefer to be paid in cash.  If so, he has to notify his employer in writing to that effect; otherwise, the employer will be entitled to pay him his wages by way of any of the payment instruments mentioned in section 3.  The written notification to the employer about the requirement to be paid in cash will supersede any agreement <Col N="819" /> that may have been signed in accordance with section 3.</P>
    <P>Deductions are treated in the Bill in three places: first, under section 6, if the employer and employee sign an agreement about the payment of wages otherwise than in cash, the employer will be prohibited from making any deduction from any wages of the employee by reason only of the fact the wages are no longer being paid in cash but by one of the payment instruments referred to in section 3.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the main provision about deductions, which is to be found in section 5: it is the only section in the Bill which embraces all employees, both manual and non-manual.  It obliges the employer, where he makes a deduction from the employee's pay, to give the employee a written statement indicating the gross amount of the salary of wages payable and the nature and amount of the deduction or deductions.  As this amounts to what will be, in effect the preparation of itemised pay statements for all employees, it is only fair that employers should be given some time in which to prepare themselves for it.  The intention is, therefore, that section 5 be brought into operation by ministerial order in about a year's time.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 8 (4) will permit the employer to make deductions from wages, to which the employee in question gives his consent, notwithstanding the terms of any statute referred to in the Bill.  The purpose of this provision, which will have retrospective as well as future effect, is to resolve a certain difficulty which arose in relation to the Truck Acts and related legislation.  I could elaborate further on it on Committee Stage if Deputies wished, but for the moment I will outline it briefly as follows.</P>
    <P>The general effect of the Truck Acts is that no deductions, other than those required or permitted by statute, can lawfully be made from the wages of any worker to whom the Acts apply.  Thus, many deductions, such as, for example, the recovery of overpayments of wages, or contributions to pension schemes, which might appear desirable both to <Col N="820" /> employers and workers cannot lawfully be made even on a consensual basis because of the Acts.  However, once this Bill has been enacted, section 8 (4) will ensure that that situation no longer obtains.</P>
    <P>The Payment of Wages Bill, 1979, is an enabling measure.  It is designed to suit people's convenience on both sides of industry.  There is no element of compulsion contained in it; indeed, quite the reverse, as I have shown.  It would be neither practicable nor desirable to make non-cash payment compulsory.  Movement away from payment in cash will be essentially an evolutionary process, which can best be effected with the goodwill and co-operation of all concerned&mdash;employers, employees, trade unions and the various financial institutions.</P>
    <P>The removal of the restriction on cheque payment is not a radical alteration of the law.  It merely brings the present situation into line with the original intention of the Legislature and restores the pre-1927 position.  However, it does end the differential in law in this matter between manual and non-manual employees, and should help to bring the payment of wages more into conformity with modern conditions.</P>
    <P>It would be my hope that the Bill could have certain beneficial consequences from the point of view of security of payroll moneys.  The House will be well aware of the spate of armed robberies which we have been experiencing, a number of which involved payrolls.  Payroll cash is a tempting target for criminals.  If employers and employees were to avail themselves of the right, under the Bill, to have wages paid otherwise than in cash, that should help to make it possible to narrow the range of targets for prospective armed robberies.</P>
    <P>The legal situation at present, which I outlined earlier, has required the dispersal of considerable sums of money to various firms throughout the country for the purpose of paying wages.  The necessity to do this has meant that those intent on armed robbery have been able, on a significant number of occasions, to pick and choose their target from a wide <Col N="821" /> selection of large payrolls.  You will appreciate the difficulty in providing security for all such targets.</P>
    <P>I trust that this Bill could be a step in the right direction towards reducing the incidence of large cash consignments.  It will provide the framework for employers and employees, if they wish, to move away from the system of payment in cash, thereby easing the security problems involved in the transport of large sums of money.</P>
    <P>I now commend the Bill to the House and urge Deputies to give it a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Payment of Wages Bill, 1979, has been long awaited especially in view of the risk to life, limb and cash that now haunts our society.  It is a measure that I have been hoping for for the past 12 months.  Given the threat to life and limb it would not be out of place for either the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Justice to introduce a measure to reduce such risk.  It is a matter of deep regret that this Bill does nothing to protect either life or payroll. It is therefore a grave disappointment. Worse, it is an empty Bill devoid of any real positive aspects.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a failure on two counts.  It more than fails&mdash;it almost totally ignores the safety and security aspects. Moreover, the provisions it does make seek to express in law what has already been achieved through voluntary agreement between management and labour throughout industry, with one extraordinary and negative exception, that is, the provision that any term or condition of an agreement requiring employees to accept wages by cheque is null and void. Apart from that very negative position this Bill, in my view, is as meaningless as the day is long, even though I understand it has the approval of ICTU.</P>
      <P>I sincerely believe that, unless it is substantially amended, it should be withdrawn in order that it will not waste the time of Parliament.  As it stands, it only serves to worsen the present situation.  It perpetuates the existing state of affairs, which can only be called a pay robbers' charter.  In the last part of his speech the Minister referred to this state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="822" /> The negative provision to which I have already referred not only prohibits any future employer-employee agreement from having a condition making payment of wages by cheque or other non-cash mode compulsory, but renders all such previously agreed terms or conditions null and void, even where they formed part of a productivity deal.  That provision is negative.  Not only does it subvert agreements reached but leaves employers open to the necessity of running two concurrent types of wage payment and one individual or a small group can subvert the established or agreed practice.  Payroll robberies are commonplace and sometimes lead even to murder and this provision is the height of folly, yet it is the only meaningful provision in the Bill. Therefore, better it die a quick death than be enacted unamended by Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Bill appears to seek to meet the workers' rights by making it easier for them to insist on payment by cash.  The House will know of my very strong support for workers' rights in all aspects of their employment.  The aspiration to meet the rights of workers is good but the diagnosis of the problem, if there is such, is bad.  It would not be a major problem to pay most workers by cheque or by some means other than cash.</P>
    <P>There are four main problems in the area of the payment of wages.  The problem which is uppermost in the minds of most people is the safety of the personnel handling the cash.  This Bill makes no reference to this serious problem, though I presume it was the main reason for the introduction of this amending legislation.  The problem is ignored and will remain unaffected by the Bill.  It does not contain any proposals to increase the safety of personnel handling cash, though the Minister admitted that this is a major problem.</P>
    <P>The second problem is the security of the payroll.  This problem will not be in any way affected by the provisions of the Bill, yet millions are stolen every year and thousands every week.  For what purpose?  Some of this money is stolen in the course of ordinary crime and some of it used for violent purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> One of the tragic spill-over effects of the violence in Northern Ireland is that robberies are now everyday occurrences, often involving personal injury.  The Bill does nothing to remedy that dreadful situation.</P>
    <P>The third problem is quite different. Some workers could have difficulty in cashing cheques, especially where banking or cashing facilities are not reasonably adjacent to places of employment. I have already drafted a substantial amendment on this point to make changes in the Bill to cover, protect and convenience workers who accept payment by cheque, so that the Minister may by regulation provide that cashing facilities are available within a reasonable distance.  The Bill does not even refer to this problem.</P>
    <P>The fourth problem relates to bank charges which may be involuntarily incurred by employees who are paid by cheque.  I propose to table amendments to provide that expenses involuntarily incurred by workers should be recoupable from the employers.  If the wages of the employees are paid directly into banks, they could have to pay bank charges.</P>
    <P>Not one of the four problems I have mentioned is tackled by the Bill.  The Minister must have started out with good intentions but for some reason he has been diverted from his task.  As it stands, the Bill is really without purpose. It will not affect in any way, except in the one negative way I have mentioned, the situation in relation to payment of workers by cheque or other non-cash mode.  Accordingly, I intend to introduce several substantial amendments which, I hope, will improve the Bill, diminish risks to persons and payrolls, compensate workers in an alternative way for any cost involved and protect them against unreasonable inconvenience in cashing cheques, even if there is a bank strike.  Even these provisions would go only some way towards improving the situation.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that the way will soon be paved for an acceptance that all wages and salaries should be paid by cheque or similar mode, except in very special circumstances.  It is my view that <Col N="824" /> the dictates of safety, security and commonsense overrule almost all considerations. This Bill pussyfoots with life.  That is a regrettable and intolerable state of affairs and we on this side of the House have no choice but to oppose the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite apparent that this enabling Bill is long overdue.  At this stage I support the Bill.  I am not entirely happy that the provisions in the Bill are adequate to cover all aspects of the problems in relation to payment of wages, and on Committee Stage I will have substantial amendments to try to ensure that we will get a Bill in keeping with modern social problems.</P>
      <P>The overriding factor which necessitates legislation of this kind is the increasing continuing spate of robberies of banks and post offices.  It has become necessary to safeguard the movement of cash throughout the country and as far as possible to eliminate the need for such cash movements.  We must try to protect the interests not only of workers but of employers.  We are talking about matters which are extremely personal to shop floor workers as well as to employers and I am afraid that the Bill does not meet the requirements of that situation fully.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Minister must try to ensure that not only in the larger centres but throughout the country there will be adequate facilities to cater for workers who in future will be paid by instruments other than cash.  The Minister will have to see to it that there will be adequate banking facilities to cater for the industrial workers so that their weekly cheques can be cashed with the minimum of hardship.</P>
      <P>Coming from a rural area where everybody knows everybody else's business, I appreciate that we must see to it that there is discretion so that the worker will have the maximum amount of confidentiality.  The Bill has been necessitated by the deteriorating situation in the country and we therefore support it, but on Committee Stage, as I have said, I will table some amendments to ensure that the Bill will leave the House an instrument worthy of its name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> I hope the Minister will see fit to accept those amendments which will be for the benefit of the workers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. L. Lawlor Mr. L. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I suggest that the House should commend the Minister for introducing it.  It will streamline the method of payment of wages.  The amounts of cash handled by some of the larger employers are considerable and are quite cumbersome to move.  It has become unfair to persons in wages sections to have the onus and responsibility of handling such large amounts of cash, which in the recent past led to serious situations.</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes to update legislation of this kind from 1831 to 1896.  Among the Acts referred to is the Hosiery Manufacture (Wages) Act of 1874 when workers could be paid in materials instead of currency.  That is obviously out of date.  This Bill is workable, but what the Labour Party are asking for might not be practicable or possible to implement. Ideally one would like to have a situation in which all circumstances could be catered for, and the Minister has introduced a Bill which we think will be practicable and workable.</P>
      <P>I would urge workers and employers to make common use of the instruments of payment which the Minister proposes to introduce to this Bill and I should like to think that through negotiation and discussion there will be a clear understanding as to the working of the legislation so that we will not have situations arising, as happened in the case of a meat processing plant after a major robbery, when workers will seek time off to go to the banks, thus causing other problems.  It will be necessary for the banks to support this legislation fully although it will throw on them responsibility to meet large scale demands in short periods of time.  In future they will have to co-operate with large numbers of people who will be paid by cheque.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be side benefits for workers through the re-arrangement of their financial systems.  It may encourage saving. It will bring a lot of people into contact with banking institutions which could mean participation in a number of financial benefits.  They could turn this <Col N="826" /> new situation of involvement with banking organisations to their advantage.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with the use of instruments of payment other than cash while making sure that there will not be exploitation of workers.  The removal of the necessity to pay in cash will minimise the amount of cash exposed to the risk of theft.</P>
    <P>We hope the number of robberies, particularly armed robberies, which are currently a major cause of concern will recede.  It would allow the Garda to put their full resources into other important matters.  Far too many members of the force are occupied in guarding the movement of funds.  Our Defence Forces have had to be brought into this area, and it is hoped that the demands on these forces and services will be reduced.  We would like to have our gardai involved in the everyday activities of law and order and the other necessary functions which the force have to carry out.  The chaperoning of large quantities of money is something that this Bill will help to eliminate.  It should also reduce armed robberies.  Certain very small numbers within the community have been prepared to go to great lengths to carry out armed robberies and the consequences in injuries and even death have been serious.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in recognising the need for action in this area, has put before the House a Bill which can be put into practice in a short time.  It should achieve the desired results without placing workers in the position of exposing themselves to dangers.  Many people working in industrial estates have to travel quite a distance to their places of residence and consequently large sums of money are being carried long distances and the people are put at risk.  A number of my constituents have asked me why we could not move in this area.  There are a number of large firms in my constituency with very large wage bills.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said at the outset, the object of the Truck Acts is to require the payment of wages in full in ready money without conditions as to how or where <Col N="827" /> the money may be spent.  The legislation before the House is amending the Truck Acts; it is not repealing them and it would be unwise to do so.  Some of the points made by Opposition speakers seem to disregard the central purpose of this Bill.  The Bill is not concerned with some of the matters raised by Deputy Mitchell.  He referred to the personnel handling cash and the security of payrolls.  That is, of course, a serious matter also, and I remind the House that I said at the opening that this legislation could have a consequential and beneficial effect in this regard.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable manual workers to be paid by cheque, which has not been legal since the Currency Act, 1927, was passed.  I added that I hoped that beneficial results would accrue to the personnel and I referred to the safety precautions that we all desire.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the problems that workers have in cashing cheques when there is no bank near their place of work or in the event of a bank strike.  Regarding a possible bank strike, there is adequate coverage of that eventuality in section 3 of the Bill, which provides that the agreement about being paid by cheque may be revoked in order that the worker may be able to obtain his money through whatever temporary arrangements are made.  The extension of banking facilities has been substantial in recent years, and it would be unwise not to give the option to both sides of industry, especially to the worker, who in many cases may be inconvenienced or have an impossible situation created for him by the compulsion to pay in cheque. I would hope that payment by cheque would evolve as an agreement rather than by compulsion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mitchell referred also to the possibility of bank charges being borne by workers.  I refer him to section 6 of the Bill, which makes adequate provision for catering for any deductions, including bank charges.  The employer is prohibited from making any deductions from any wages of the employee by reason only of the fact that the wages are not being paid in cash, and this prohibition extends to any bank charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="828" /> Deputy Ryan referred to the difficulties of facilities being available in small areas.  The enabling measure before the House takes cognisance of that.  Despite the revolution that has taken place in the legal, social and economic strata of society for even unskilled workers since the legislation we have been talking about was enacted, some form of protection is still needed, and for that reason it is imperative that options be available under this Bill. Although designed for worker protection, provisions in the existing law are now sometimes against the interests of workers, and if they have not caused much difficulty up to the present this is partly due to their having being ignored.</P>
    <P>All in all, this legislation, with the enabling provisions that it introduces and the very useful introduction of reductions that were not legal up to now, is to the advantage of both employers and employees.  I commend the Bill to the House for urgent passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;noting the fact that the present capitation grant for pupils in primary schools is grossly inadequate;</P>
      <P>&mdash;noting that the Government, in spite of their manifesto commitment immediately to increase the capitation grant, has still not paid any increase in the grant beyond the level determined prior to the 1977 general election;</P>
      <P>&mdash;conscious of the rapidly escalating cost of heating and cleaning national schools, and the increasing burden being put on local communities in this regard;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" />&mdash;alarmed at the deterioration in many school premises because of lack of proper maintenance; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;critical of the failure of the Minister for Education to ensure continued and adequate teacher representation on school management boards;</P>
    <P>calls on the Government immediately to increase the capitation grant for pupils in primary schools to an interim minimum of £15.00 per pupil, together with an appropriate rate of local contribution, in order to ensure that heating and cleaning of national schools reaches an acceptable standard, and in order to ensure that the already marked deterioration in the condition of many schools is halted; calls on the Government to make a positive response to proposals by teachers and others for more appropriate structures for representation and accountability within the school management system.</P>
    <P>There are two things of importance about this motion.  The first, naturally enough, is the wording, and the second is the timing.  In all fairness it could be said that now, approximately 20 months after the Government assumed office, is an appropriate time to measure their performance and the performance of individual Departments in a number of key areas.  The area this motion in the name of the Labour Party chooses to measure relates to the all-important one of primary education, not indeed all aspects of primary education but those which were the particular concern of the Minister when he was in Opposition and which formed a major element in the Fianna Fáil manifesto in the 1977 general election.</P>
    <P>This motion says in couple of phrases that this Government and the Minister have not matched up in the areas identified in the motion to the expectations they aroused in the publication of the manifesto and in particular the section on education.  It is a way of saying that this House, having seen the performance of the Government in these areas over <Col N="830" /> the past 20 months, has no confidence in their ability to do any better in the 20 months or however longer that remains to them.  It is probably fair to say that an average man reading the Government manifesto in 1977 could have been forgiven for thinking that everybody was being promised more for everything. Nowhere is this truer than in education. The electorate were encouraged to believe that all they had to do was to return a Fianna Fáil Government to office and things would automatically get better.  We are already seeing the cracks in the facade.</P>
    <P>One of the simplest ways in which I can give an example of that is that when unpopular decisions come to be announced they tend to be announced as Government decisions, such as raising the fees in universities, and when popular decisions are announced, such as the raising of grant level for third level students, they are announced by the Minister.  This is no doubt true of all Ministers in all Governments at all times.  It is important to identify it now because it shows precisely what is happening not just inside the Department of Education but between the Department and the Minister for Education and the Minister's Cabinet colleagues.  This party believe that the inevitable squeeze on education and on the other social services is inevitable precisely because of the budgetary and fiscal policies adopted and followed by the Government since the election.  That is a wider economic debate and I will not go into it here. There are fundamental ground rules for the assertions that I will be making.</P>
    <P>The motion refers to a number of specific matters in relation to primary education.  It notes in particular the fact that the present capitation grant for pupils in primary schools is grossly inadequate and that the Government, in spite of their manifesto commitment immediately to increase the capitation grant have still not paid any increase in the grant beyond the level determined prior to the 1977 general election.  It is important to realise exactly what this motion says.  In order to do that we have to turn back to the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  In the section dealing with <Col N="831" /> education it says on page 41, paragraph 6:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will immediately increase the capitation grant for primary school pupils.</P>
    <P>That manifesto was published a short time after an announcement by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Peter Barry, in relation to the level of capitation grants for primary schools.  The relevant quotation from his statement, dated 19 May 1977 was:</P>
    <P>I have decided that provision should be made in the Estimates for 1978 that the payment of the grant in respect of the school year 1977-78, that is in January 1978 and in June 1978, should be at the rate of £80 per annum per pupil.  This increased grant of £80 from the Department will attract a contribution of at least £2 from local sources, and the school authorities, accordingly, will have a minimum of £10 per pupil as against a minimum of £7.50 at present, i.e. an increase of 33? per cent.  This increase in the capitation grants from the Department of Education is estimated to cost about £1.2 million in 1978.</P>
    <P>When the Minister sitting on the other side of the House this evening assumed office one of the earliest things I asked him about was when he proposed to fulfil the Fianna Fáil commitment immediately to increase the capitalisation grants.  All these attempts to elicit necessary information were met by a considerable degree of evasion and eventually by a <i>de facto</i> admission that the Minister's generosity in paying the increased amounts, which had been determined prior to the general election, was a fulfilment of the Fianna Fáil election manifesto.  The Minister has never to my knowledge said this in so many words but he has certainly implied it.  If he implies it he must logically stand over it.  If he does not stand over it, then it is plainly clear that Fianna Fáil have not fulfilled that part of the manifesto.  If he stands over it he is in the awkward position of having to maintain that the payment made by the Government on a <Col N="832" /> commitment of a proceding Government amounts to an increase such as was specified in the Opposition manifesto of the day.</P>
    <P>The increase specified by the then Minister for Education was paid in due course.  Any level-headed, same, average person who looks at the commitment by the Fianna Fáil Government in their manifesto would have expected that if that commitment were to be honoured a grant would have been increased beyond the £80 level specified by Deputy Peter Barry.  There is no simple way in which the Minister can evade that reading of plain English.  It is not as if it would have cost that much.  The Minister could have put an extra £1 per pupil on top of the £8 decreed by Deputy Barry.  It would have cost the Government and the tax-payers about £½ million.  Instead of giving £½ million to the primary sector of education in fulfilment of an unambiguous pre-election commitment, they gave £5 million back to the wealthiest sector of our community by abolishing the wealth tax, a matter which was not in their pre-election manifesto at all.  It would have taken 10 per cent of what they gave to the richest people honestly and seriously to fulfil their election commitment of raising immediately the primary school capitation grants. Anybody who does the political mathematics of that equation will realise that, by not honouring that part of their manifesto when compared with the other budgetary and fiscal policies they adopted immediately after coming into office, this must be seen as failure.</P>
    <P>We are given to understand that in the coming school year there will be a further increase in the capitation grants for primary school pupils.  We are not told, for very good reasons, whether or not this is the Minister's implementation of the manifesto's commitment to raise grants immediately.  I do not think that even somebody with the Minister's elasticity of the concept of language would accept that 20 months or more constitutes &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;.  We are to have an increase but when I questioned the Minister recently about this he as much as said that I could do my sums like anybody else and if I looked at what <Col N="833" /> was provided last year and what is provided for this year, I would see there is an increase.  Not being one to duck an invitation such as the Minister offered, I did my sums.  On the basis that an extra £1.2 million is being allocated for increased capitation grants in national schools in the next school year, we must look at it in terms of whether or not it relates in any real sense to the Fianna Fáil manifesto and whether it is adequate to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Fianna Fáil manifesto, even if one were to stretch language beyond its breaking point and accept that this increase is what they promised in 1977, it is fair to add that anybody reading the manifesto and seeing their commitment to increase the primary school capitation grant would expect that whatever increase was negotiated would result in an increase in real terms to the primary schools of the value of that grant.  The Minister has been unduly modest and I suspect he may not be proud of what he has to offer. If the Minister can claim that the grant at the beginning of the winter term this year will match the value, after inflation, that it had when it was first introduced, it is the most he can do.  I doubt if he can even do that.</P>
    <P>As regards the increase in all items in the consumer price index, if one takes the figure in November 1975 as 100, the figure in November 1978 was 144.2. The date in 1975 is the nearest date to that on which the first payment was made under the previous administration. The grants will not really become operative in their increased form until the autumn of this year.  We have to take a national figure for inflation between November 1978 and November 1979.  It is reasonable to assume an inflation figure of 10 per cent for that period.  If one adds 10 per cent to 144.2 one gets a figure of 158.4, rounded up to 160.</P>
    <P>If we do our sums on the basis that for every £1 that the primary school got for each of its pupils in 1975 it should get at least £1.60 by the autumn of this year to compensate for inflation, we will see that the appropriate grant would be of the order of £9.60.  The Minister, if I am right in assuming this, is indicating <Col N="834" /> that the grant from his Department for the coming year will be of the order of £10.  It would appear as if he had if not exactly generously kept the value of the grant in line with the inflation over that period.</P>
    <P>However, two things need to be said. Firstly, over the period we are talking about the proportion of the cost of maintaining national schools which is accounted for by heating by oil and electricity will have gone up far more dramatically than the average we are talking about.  We read in today's papers that the ESB have applied for a price increase of the order of 20 per cent.  The question is not only what will that do to the CPI and to inflation but what will it do to the budget of primary schools which are, in some cases, enormously dependent on electricity for heating?  In other cases they are dependent on oil the price of which the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy has also assured us, with some sadness, will go up.  If we accept&mdash;I do not, because of the oil price increases and other factors&mdash;that the increase in the grant will keep pace with inflation, it is not enough in terms of the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  What people were entitled to expect was an increase in real terms in the capitation grants of national schools.  That did not happen.  It is possible to argue that the value in real terms might have decreased.</P>
    <P>Secondly, how many of our primary school management boards are in silent and hopeless breach of the Department of Education regulations not to run overdrafts?  What does the Department of Education propose to do about it if they are?  The story from all areas is that the level of grants is not enough, that because it is not enough the condition of schools is deteriorating.  Basic exterior maintenance, painting and so on, has had to be neglected in favour of the basic primary consideration of keeping the children warm.  Not even that consideration has been capable of being fulfilled in all instances.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this problem is the ratio of expenditure on these items between this country and Northern Ireland.  The Minister, as somebody who <Col N="835" /> sits for a constituency in a Border county, must be as conscious as anybody else, if not more so, of the implications for national unity of any widening of the gap in social services in both parts of this island.  In some regards that gap has been narrowed but I would argue that, if anything, it has been widened in relation to education.  The National Economic and Social Council, in a report in 1975, talking about expenditure on non-teacher items such as heating and cleaning in primary schools in Northern Ireland and the Republic, argued:</P>
    <P>Expenditure in Northern Ireland is over seventeen times greater on a perpupil basis for these items.  Even if one includes our earlier maximum estimate of £3.50 locally financed expenditure per pupil in the Republic, and excludes all private expenditure elsewhere, non-teacher expenditure is still almost six times as great in Northern Ireland and England and Wales.  These are extremely large differences and must reflect significant differences in resources available to teachers and children in schools, and it would be unlikely if they did not have some effect on educational attainment in the long run.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same report the author's note reads:</P>
    <P>Taken overall, the provision of educational and non-educational services to primary school pupils may be aggregated as follows.  (The figures once again refer to 1971-72, but they may be taken as a reliable guide to more recent years because policy developments have not been significant since that date).  In the Republic, expenditure per pupil in primary schools from public funds was £64.90 of which £59.97 went on teachers' salaries, £1.70 on other &ldquo;in-school&rdquo; expenditure and £3.43 on &ldquo;non-educational&rdquo; items (meals, transport etc.).</P>
    <P>In Northern Ireland public expenditure was £121.76 per primary pupil, of which £69.94 went on teachers' salaries, £30.60 on other &ldquo;in-school&rdquo;<Col N="836" /> items and £21.22 on &ldquo;non-educational&rdquo; items.</P>
    <P>The difference that we are talking about are enormous in scale.</P>

      <P>NESC Report No. 12 of 1975.  The Minister cannot take refuge in the excuse that, given the choice between spending money on teachers and on facilities, he spends money on teachers. Granted he has been given more money to spend on teachers but over the period that we are talking about the pupil/teacher ratio, on average, has changed both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.  At the time this report was written the teacher/pupil ratio in the South was about 32 point something to 1 and in the North it was about 28 point something to 1.  In the Republic it is now 29 point something to 1 and in the North it has gone down to 22 point something to 1.  I apologise to the House for not having the exact decimal points.</P>
      <P>The sad effect of this and the necessary conclusion to be drawn from it is that not only in terms of expenditure on heating and cleaning and the sort of things we are talking about here but also in basic pupil/teacher ratios the gap between the provisions in Northern Ireland and in the Republic has, if anything, widened over the period in question.  I do not know whether the Minister would take the advantage of the speech he will make when moving his amendment to explain the apparent discrepancy, in relation to the number of extra teachers that primary schools in the Republic are to have this year, between his statement to press correspondents and his statement in response to a Parliamentary Question, but I will leave that up to him.</P>
      <P>In general terms, one thing must be said: that is, that the amount is not enough.  The gap between us and Northern Ireland in terms of maintenance, heating and cleaning is probably widening.  The very least that the Minister must now be asked to implement is an annual review of the amount of such payments with all the interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> I was interested to note in relation to the Minister's post-budget press conference that he has also announced&mdash;this is of particular relevance to the heating, cleaning and maintenance capitation grants&mdash;that apparently 200 caretakers are to be provided for primary schools.  This raises some very interesting questions.  As the rules and regulations for primary schools make clear, the payment of the heating, cleaning and maintenance grant to a school is dependent on the lodgment in the school account of an amount related to the <i>per capita</i> amount that has to be collected locally.  Are we now going to have two different types of schools&mdash;smaller poorer schools where lodgment of the required amount only releases £X from the Department of Education and larger better off schools where the lodgment of a proportionate amount of money releases not only £X from the Department of Education but also a caretaker? The Minister may well be in a contractual relationship with the schools in terms of the payment of this money.  If so, he would be advised to consider carefully anything which increases the already big gap between large schools and small schools in relation to the provisions of essential facilities and the maintenance of basic standards.</P>
    <P>In relation to small schools, there are a number of other points which might be made.  The motion to which the Labour Party have subscribed urges a minimum floor of some £750 for such schools.  It is widely acknowledged by this Government, and was by the previous Government, that the problems of scale means that small schools need to be proportionately better financed than large schools.  The Minister for Education realised this in Opposition when he said on 9 February 1977, according to <i>The Irish Times</i>, &ldquo;Many people involved in primary school management who could neither get a central school nor get money for the provision of water and sanitary services will be glad if the Minister delivers on his promise of money.&rdquo;  I suspect they would still be glad if this Minister also delivered on his promise of money.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the latter part <Col N="838" /> of the motion which is critical of the failure of the Minister for Education to assure continued and adequate teacher representation on school management boards and calls on the Government to make a positive response to proposals by teachers and others for more appropriate structures for representation and accountability within the school management system.  The history of this part of the motion is quite clear.  When the present scheme for shared management in primary schools was introduced by the previous Government it was accepted with some reluctance by the INTO and only on the basis that a through-going review of the scheme would be carried out three years after it had been instituted.  The three years fell due and there seemed for quite sometime to be little likelihood of the review which the previous Government had promised.  Eventually, after substantial prodding in this House and by the INTO, the Minister agreed to a review. The review was of a situation which has developed considerably over the past three years.  To some extent there has been a lack of public comment on the working of the boards of management to date, but this should not be taken as evidence that they are all working satisfactorily; indeed, the rules under which they work forbid any board member from making public anything that goes on, so it is not surprising that public comment has been at a minimum. Privately, however, some teachers, some parents and even some patrons' representatives have been known to complain about undemocratic procedures in the election of parent representatives and about the refusal of the chairman of management boards to conduct meetings in a democratic manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already publicly admitted that the specimen rules for the election of parent representatives, which contained many valuable safeguards for democratic rights, are not mandatory and can be ignored at will if anybody chooses to do so.  Even today many parents do not know the names and addresses of the parents who are their representatives on the management boards of primary schools and as these <Col N="839" /> elected partners are not allowed to report back to their electorates the whole idea of an election board is a farce.  One can imagine the outery if meetings of Dáil Eireann were held in private and if at every general election TDs went back to the voters and told them they were sorry they could not let them know what had been happening in the past four years but they were standing for re-election and hoped the electorate would understand. This is what is happening in the name of participation in our primary schools.</P>
    <P>The Irish National Teachers' Organisation in a press release dated 8 September last noted that:</P>
    <P>The INTO had asked the Department to advise the other parties involved in management about the INTO position and to postpone the election of all board representatives.</P>
    <P>It went on to add:</P>
    <P>Provided a measures of goodwill and co-operation is shown by all parties, a speedy review can be carried out.  If acceptable amendments are made to the present guidelines, delay in the reconstitution of boards can be kept to a minimum.  The INTO will expect the Minister to take the necessary initiative.</P>
    <P>The review finally took place and a statement was issued after the review by the Minister for Education on 23 January 1979.  It stated:</P>
    <P>There are a number of outstanding matters of principle on which complete agreement has not been reached, namely, structure of boards, method and level of financing and arrangements for the appointment of teachers.  However, a substantial measure of agreement was reached on practical and procedural matters which should greatly facilitate the operation of the boards.</P>
    <P>This statement blandly glosses over the major problem in relation to the review body, namely, that the INTO have decided in their wisdom to continue not to participate in these boards.  I doubt <Col N="840" /> very much that even the practical and procedural matters to which the Minister and the Department drew such attention in their statement will be of any practical significance whatever for as long as the teacher representation on the boards is not secured.  I doubt that the working of the boards themselves can be said in any sense to be realistic without full and adequate teacher representation.  At their recent special conference on this matter, the INTO passed the following motion:</P>
    <P>Having considered the amendments to the constitution of boards of management of national schools and rules of procedure which were agreed by the parties who participated in the review, Congress</P>
    <P>(1) authorises members of the organisation to serve on boards of management when organisation policy in relation to:</P>
    <P>(a) structure of boards of management,</P>
    <P>(b)  appointment of teachers,</P>
    <P>(c) financing of schools,</P>
    <P>(d) other relevant matters</P>
    <P>be agreed on by all interested parties.</P>
    <P>(2) calls on the CEC to initiate a course of action to secure such agreement.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of the failure to reach agreement on the vital matters connected with this review means that a number of very valuable advances are being held up.  In particular, I refer to the grievance procedure set out in an appendix to the agenda for the INTO Special Congress and also to the innovation which I believe to be a salutary one which entitles a teacher or a school in certain circumstances to suspend a pupil subject to an equally important right of appeal by the parents to the board of management. This latter aspect of the review has immense positive potential for the whole problem of discipline in the schools and ultimately for the problem of corporal punishment, in which the Minister has expressed an interest.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take the necessary steps to secure real agreement on the basis of which this kind of development can take place.  The motion in my name and in the names of other <Col N="841" /> members of the Labour Party refers to the payment of an appropriate rate of local contribution.  I shall specify precisely what we mean by this.  We do not believe that the device of a local contribution is one that should remain for all time and in all circumstances or at the level at which it is currently placed.  We believe that any responsible publicly financed system of education will gradually phase out this 19th century relic of the system but we believe also that such a phasing out of the local contribution will inevitably have to be accompanied first by a restructuring of the boards of management to ensure a better and fairer balance of the various interests represented on them at present and, secondly, to a new development that will allow the direct representation on such boards of management of the public interest.</P>
    <P>The public interest is a vital and real one.  It represents £148 million of tax-payers' money for primary education alone in the Book of Estimates.  The problem is that the whole question of management and the representation of the interests on boards of management, including the public interest, cannot be readily resolved at the level of the individual school and that is why the Labour Party and a number of other people have called for the establishement of local education authorities that will ensure representation of the local interest on boards of management in primary schools and in other schools also.  This kind of development, which is foreshadowed in the motion, is essential if we are to have any real public accountability in our educational system and if we are to cease the interminable and unwinable battle of trying to solve all management problems at the level of the individual school.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the amendment in the Minister's name which states:</P>
    <P>approves of the policy of the Minister for Education in providing increased financial aid for national schools and notes with satisfaction the efforts made by the Minister to secure agreement from all the parties involved. . . .</P>
    <P>The amendment is pathetic.  I believe I <Col N="842" /> could have drafted a better one myself.  I do not propose to do so because that is the Minister's job but I find it incredible that the Dáil should be asked to note &ldquo;with satisfaction&rdquo; what the Minister is doing in this regard.  A better word would be &ldquo;despondence&rdquo; or perhaps even &ldquo;indifference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We are asked to note with whatever emotion the Minister deems appropriate the efforts being made by him.  All that we have been told to date is that the proposals for changes in the system of boards of management of national schools has been sent out to all the interests involved and the Minister hopes to secure their agreement on the proposals. If he did not get their agreement around the table at which the review body was constituted, how does he hope to get their agreement outside it?  It is plain that on the two basic matters we are talking about in this motion, the financing and the structure of primary education, the review body have failed to come to an agreement.  They have failed because the Minister has not been able to guarantee the schools any real substantial increase in the level of financing and because he has been unwilling, in the name of the public and the taxpayer, to intervene to any extent in the general, ongoing discussion about the structure of management boards of the schools.  It is unmistakable that without a real, positive change in the financial allocation for these schools and without substantial, meaningful alterations in the structure of boards of management, teacher participation will not be on for the immediate and perhaps even the intermediate future.  For both of those failures and for the paralysis of the boards of management the Minister must stand indicted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;approves of the policy of the Minister for Education in providing increased financial aid for national schools and notes with satisfaction the efforts being made by the Minister to <Col N="843" /> secure agreement from all the parties involved in regard to the revision of the Constitution and Rules of Procedure for Boards of Management of National Schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to give an account of my stewardship with regard to primary education in the terms of the amendment before the House.  Deputy Horgan and the Labour Party put down the motion and reminded me of two things: the old saying about the person who promises all the hares on the mountain, but of course one had to catch the hares himself, and also the story of McDarney, who seems to be the patron saint of the Labour Party.  McDarney made his will and distributed huge sums of money in largesse in it.  He published his will long before he died and, when asked where the millions were to come from, he said &ldquo;I have not got that money at all.  The fact is that is what I would do with it if I had it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan in moving his motion, talked about the increase in the capitation grants which were announced on 19 May 1977.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto was published on 26 May 1977, just one week later.  Deputy Horgan is a naïve man&mdash;and it was this kind of naïvete which caused the Labour Party to do so badly in the general election&mdash;if he thinks that we could put our education programme together in one week.  The people knew ours was a well-considered manifesto and supported it.</P>
    <P>We must give the credit to Deputy Barry, then Minister for Education, for promising the increase when 1978 came around.  But it was a Fine Gael Act, because there was no pressure from the Labour Party, no <i>cri de coeur</i> from the Seanad where the then Senator Horgan was asking for increased finance for primary or other schools.  The silence was deafening.  Any motion I put down calling for increased expenditure at that time failed to get the support of the Labour Party and failed in one instance to attract the presence of any Member of the Labour Party except the then Deputy Coughlan from Limerick, who came in at the end of the debate.  The <Col N="844" /> Deputy never called for any increase and the increase promised by Deputy Barry, then Minister for Education, was paid for by me as Minister and by the present Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan is very selection in his figures.  I would point out that, from mid-November 1975 to mid-November 1977, fuel and light increased according to the consumer price index, from 100 base in 1975 to 136.1 in 1977.  What increase was given in capitation grants in that period?  Absolutely none, not a red halfpenny.  Deputy Horgan very carefully concealed that in his speech by starting in 1975 and coming forward to the present day.  I have stitched that into the record&mdash;from 1975 base 100 to 1977 the increase was 36.1 per cent and there was not one single halfpenny of an increase in the capitation grant at that time.  What efforts did Deputy Horgan make to increase the grant?  Nothing could be heard from him in the rarified atmosphere of the Seanad.  There is an Irish proverb which says &ldquo;Is fial thú le stiall leathair duine eile&rdquo;.  That is what happened.  There was a promise, like the promise of McDarney; but there was no delivery.  This Government had to deliver in 1978.</P>
    <P>I will take the House through what has been achieved with regard to the financing of primary education since this Government took office one year and eight months ago.  The election manifesto committed us to increasing the capitation grants for the operating costs of national schools, allowing special grants for the all-Irish schools in the Galltacht, reducing the pupil/teacher ratio and embarking on a building programme to replace outdated schools. Progress to date on all these matters has been considerable.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal firstly with the scheme of capitation grants towards the operating costs of national schools. There is no doubt but that the introduction of this scheme in 1975 by the then Minister resulted in a marked improvement in the aid made available towards the cost of heating, cleaning and maintaining national schools.  Unfortunately, however, no steps were taken to ensure that the value of the grant was maintained. <Col N="845" /> The rate of £6 remained unaltered in the financial years through 1975, 1976 and 1977.</P>
    <P>As I have just told the House the increase at that time in the CPI for heating, cleaning and lighting was 36.1 per cent.  Those plugging for extra expenditure in education at the primary level at that time in the Labour Party were very thin on the ground; in fact, they were not there at all.  My predecessor announced in advance that there would be an increase in the rate from £6 to £8 per pupil in 1978.  This announcement was made immediately prior to the last election. It took a long time to come, but it came at that time.  However, it was not to be paid until 1978.  It was left to the incoming Government to ensure that the necessary additional funds to enable such an increased rate to be paid should be provided.  This was done in the 1978 Estimates.  The House will be aware from my replies to recent parliamentary questions of a further increase in the general rate of capitation from £8 to £10.</P>
    <P>That is over one year and eight months, not over several years.  This increase will be effective during the current school-year.  The amount of the State grant will be supplemented by a contribution from local sources of at least 25 per cent of the State grant.  The funds available for the operating costs of national schools has been increased from £7.50 per pupil in 1976-77 to a <i>per capita</i> figure of £12.50 in the current school year&mdash;that is an increase of 66 per cent over a two-year period.  The additional cost to the State is £2.4 million. This contrasts starkly with the previous two year period when under the Coalition no increase at all was granted.</P>
    <P>The all-Irish schools in the Galltacht I consider to be in special need of assistance, in particular as they have no distinct community to generate the local contribution.  For that reason I have arranged that an additional amount of 50 per cent of the normal rate of grant would be payable to the boards of management of these schools.</P>
    <P>Because the grant is calculated on a <i>per capita</i> basis, which indeed was the method desired by the managerial <Col N="846" /> bodies, there are certain defects inherent in such a system of payment for some schools.  The special schools for the handicapped are an obvious case.  Every effort is made to adjust the rate of payment to the various categories of such schools so as to reflect the pupil/teacher ratio in them.  I have decided that schools with low enrolments should receive special attention this year and the minimum grant payable to these schools has been increased from £330 in 1977-78 to £600 in 1978-79.  If Deputy Horgan does that sum he will find that that is 80 per cent plus in the period and no doubt this will please him.</P>
    <P>Our election manifesto promised to reduce maximum class size to 40 as quickly as possible, and to 32 eventually. Since taking up office I have given clear evidence of my commitment to the achievement of that aim and in keeping with this commitment substantial revisions have been made in the schedule of figures of pupil enrolments required for the appointment and retention of teachers in larger national schools. These revisions became effective from 1 July 1978 for schools having a staff of 15 teachers or more.  Schools in the 9-14 teacher range are benefiting from the revisions since January 1979 when those who were accepted under the special trainee teacher scheme graduated from the colleges of education.  These revisions together with the appointment of extra remedial teachers in schools catering mainly for socially deprived pupils entitled the creation of 600 new teaching posts.  All of this was in addition to the 300 extra posts necessary to cope with natural increases in enrolments.  In summary, then, an additional 900 teaching posts have been created in national schools in the current school year.  The objective of this increase in the number of teachers and the consequential reduction in the pupil/teacher ratio is the easement of the position in schools where unduly large numbers of pupils are enrolled in some classes.  In schools which were to benefit from the application of this new pupil/teacher ratio, special attention was to be given to the elimination of large classes throughout the entire school.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> It is a great satisfaction to me that the pupil/teacher ratio has been substantially improved since I took up office and further improvements will be made in the next school year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that, in the budget speech, the Minister for Finance was able to announce the creation of 1,250 additional teaching posts; of these 650 will be in the primary sector.  The precise revisions to be made in the pupil/teacher ratio in the forthcoming school-year are currently being considered, and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the matter shortly.</P>
    <P>An obvious lacuna in the staffing of national schools has been the complete absence of any non-teaching staff.  The new curriculum makes great demands on principal teachers and, in fact, the success or failure in implementing the curriculum depends to a very large extent on the personal efforts of the principals. Their responsibilities include (i) the holding of regular conferences with their staff in order to discuss problems, to pool opinions and to evaluate progress; (ii) the outlining of a plan of work for the school as a whole; (iii) the co-ordination of the work of the various classes so as to ensure continuity; (iv) assisting younger teachers and encouraging any teacher with a specialised knowledge or aptitude in a particular area of the curriculum to give advice and guidance to other staff members.  In view of the important role envisaged for principal teachers, it seemed wasteful that much of their time was spent on work of a clerical or administrative nature.  This was especially so in the case of principals of the larger schools who would not normally be required to undertake class responsibility.  It was for this reason that the scheme for the appointment of clerical assistants was devised last year.  The intention was to create 600 of these posts in primary and post-primary schools.  It is a matter of some disappointment to me that not even half of the posts have as yet been filled and I would urge management authorities of the eligible schools to proceed with the <Col N="848" /> making of the appointments at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The expenditure of the school building programme in 1978 amounted to £15.4 million and was the highest ever.  As a result, the provision of new schools and replacement of unsuitable schools and the enlargement and improvement of existing schools took place on a scale never before achieved in this country.</P>
    <P>An additional £1.1 million has been allocated in the current year, making a total of £16.5 million.  This provision will enable a greatly accelerated building programme to be continued, ensuring improved standards of accommodation and facilities to meet modern educational needs.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word about boards of management and I should like to correct something Deputy Horgan said.  He referred to a statement which he implied was a Department of Education statement.  This was an agreed statement, agreed between the managers, the INTO and the Department of Education. I should like to put that on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>The establishment in 1975 of boards of management for national schools meant that for the first time parents and teachers were given a significant voice in the management of these schools.  The general consensus is that these boards have worked well and have added a new dimension to the primary education scene.  A review of the rules of procedure under which the boards function was undertaken with all the interested parties following the first three-year period of operation of the boards.  The House will already be aware of the substantial amendments suggested in the rules of procedure as a result of the review.  The House will no doubt also be aware of the result of the special delegate congress held on 23 and 24 February 1979 by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation on the boards of management.</P>
    <P>As I have stated, there are three parties to these discussions about boards of management, the managerial authorities, the Department of Education and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, each with their own point of view.  I am hopeful that a solution to the problems <Col N="849" /> that have arisen will be worked out and, as Minister, I will willingly assist in every way possible in seeking to have the matters resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties involved so that teachers may again fully participate in the workings of the boards in the interests of the pupils and the schools.</P>
    <P>Despite all the forebodings about a reduction in expenditure on the education services, expenditure on primary education has been increased from £131,579,000 in 1978 to £148,765,000 in 1979.  I should like just to refer to something Deputy Horgan mentioned about Northern Ireland and the comparative costings and about pupil teacher ratios.  First, if it were a matter of choice of spending money on teachers or spending money or artifacts I would make no apology in any place for spending it first on teachers.  The quality of the teacher in the school is the most important single thing.  I have stated in the House before that the quality of our teachers generally is very high and for that reason I think it is better to spend money&mdash;even more money than our neighbour&mdash;on salaries rather than on something else.</P>
    <P>Just about a year ago I happened to be at a social function and sitting beside the wife of the head of the Northern Ireland Office who is involved in primary teaching with one of the education colleges. She pointed out to me that some of our women teachers with corresponding qualifications were getting up to £1,000 per annum more than the corresponding teachers in Northern Ireland.  I said I was very pleased to hear that and that, if money were to go anyplace, that it the place it should go.  Golden teachers and wooden forms are better than golden forms and wooden teachers.</P>

      <P>It goes much farther back in Irish literature.  It is one of the little gems known to those of us who had the privilege of studying Irish literature.  I do not claim and I am sure Deputy James Matthew Dillon would not claim <Col N="850" /> any copyright.  The provision of £5,700,000 for capitation grants for national schools in the current year is an increase of £1,300,000 over the previous year.  This increased provision enabled the increase in the capitation grant by 25 per cent from £8 per pupil to £10 per pupil.  An additional £1,100,000 has been provided for the building, equipping and furnishing of national schools and, as I have already mentioned, this brings the provision under this head to £16,500,000 in the current year.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance in his budget speech announced an additional £3,900,000 for the educational services.  Of the additional £3,900,000, £2 million is for the educational services generally and £1,900,000 is for job creation in the educational sector generally.  On the primary side, almost £500,000 has been set aside for the employment of caretakers in national schools.  I can assure Deputy Horgan that there is no need for him to be sorry about how we will run this scheme.  If he is alarmed at the deterioration in primary school buildings, he should welcome this development and be pleased with it.  I am sure the caretakers who will be sanctioned in large schools in cities and towns will add to the convenience of pupils and teachers and ensure the preservation of the buildings for which they will be caring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sum of £250,000 will go to increasing the minimum level of capitation grant payable in small schools.  I have referred to this already.  This is the floor grant.  Deputy Horgan rightly said there was a need for it.  The previous Government realised there was a need for it.  It has been my privilege to increase that floor by 80 per cent plus in the current year.  The additional money made available in the budget has allowed me to increase the minimum grant to £600 from £330 based on a school of 60 pupils.  In addition to the increased provision in the estimates for grants for free books for necessitous pupils in primary schools, an additional £81,000 is now being provided from the money made available in the budget.  I submit that the provision of books for necessitous <Col N="851" /> pupils is very important.  The Book of Estimates shows an increase, and this additional money will be well spent on the provision of books.</P>
    <P>An additional £70,000 is being provided which will enable a substantial increase to be made in the grant payable to pupils attending Irish colleges.  This will help them to develop both their love of and knowledge of the Irish language by attending courses in the Gaeltacht.  I am also providing money to the colleges of education for the recruitment of extra staff to reinforce instruction in Irish. This is particularly welcome to the Irish staffs in the colleges of education and will, in a very brief period, show results in the primary schools.</P>
    <P>One of the areas catered for by the Minister of State, who will have an opportunity to talk about it, is the area of special schools.  An extra £50,000 for equipment in special schools has been made available this year for the physically and mentally handicapped, especially in schools for the deaf where equipment is very important.  The provision has been doubled this year compared to last year.</P>
    <P>We are also making extra money available for the youth encounter scheme.  Social workers and people who are concerned about certain areas in our cities have welcomed this extra provision for the youth encounter scheme.  In the schools for the physically handicapped there are serious problems in regard to aiding pupils into classrooms and out of classrooms, helping them to the toilet, helping them to dress, and so on.  This year £175,000 is being provided for the recruitment for the first time of 70 child care assistants in such schools which cater for the physically and the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me I think I have said enough to show that over the years there was neglect and that the years selected by Deputy Horgan were an exercise in selecting clever statistics.  I have pointed out that the Government have given a priority to the primary education sector which it did not have before, and backed it with money.  This priority has taken a very practical form <Col N="852" /> in the shape of a substantially increased provision for the primary sector, a very substantial reduction in pupil-teacher ratios, with further reductions to come this year, the employment of a greatly increased number of remedial teachers, the provision of ancillary services such as clerical assistants and caretakers who were not available before, and a greatly expanded programme of building and improvement works.  Pity it is that the Labour Party were not as exercised about primary education when they participated in Government as apparently they have become since going into Opposition.  Pity it is 'tis true, but it is true.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael Party fully support the motion before the House in the name of Deputy Horgan and his colleagues.  The Minister has a very short memory when he makes any reference to the previous Government.  I was in this House from 1969 to 1973 and I experienced the arrogance of the Fianna Fáil Government and a large amount of frustration at their inactivity in the field of education.  It is no harm to remind the House of the gross neglect of education in the 17 years Fianna Fáil enjoyed in Government until 1973.  Since the Minister was interested in statistics it is interesting to note that the National Coalition Government had the courage to introduce the capitation scheme for the maintenance of national schools in 1975.  That was not done by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to challenge the Minister on his statistics which he seems to have got wrong.  The initial £6 and £1.50 allowance was increased to £8 and £2 by the National Coalition Government for the school year 1977-78, by 33? per cent.  That was a commitment.  That amounted to an increase of 33? per cent in two years.  Now the increase amounts to 25 per cent for the following two years.  Those are the facts.  I do not like statistics being distorted&mdash;it goes against the grain&mdash;I like things to be ac-curate for the record.  I am pleased to note the increase that the Minister says will take place in this current school year to £10 per capita and £2.50 local contribution, with an increase of the low enrolment base from £330 to £600.  That <Col N="853" /> is very necessary.  I should have preferred to see a figure of £750 as the base as stated in the motion.  One must say that this maintenance grant basically is inadequate. The scheme needs to be looked at from a radical point of view rather than just being tampered with and being increased by a small amount.</P>
    <P>It is not so long ago since we in this House read in the papers of a school in Dublin which had to be closed because of lack of funds.  The school had used the funds on insurance, which was not allowed under the scheme.  The scheme needs to be completely re-negotiated. Indeed, the attitude taken by the INTO last year in respect of substandard schools, of which there were between 700 and 800, indicates quite clearly that the sums available for maintenance are basically and inherently inadequate. Therefore, to increase them by a percentage is not sufficient.  It does not meet the case for a complete re-negotiation of the scheme as between the Department and the patrons of the schools.  One would hope that the boards of management might be brought into such discussions also.  The scheme itself warrants investigation in depth.  Its scope needs to be broadened and the flexibility allowed to schools in relation to expenditure needs to be examined and broadened.</P>
    <P>I should have commenced by referring to the commitment of the Government to education.  In reply to my Parliamentary Question, No. 475 to the Minister for Education on 18 April last, the Minister supplied a tabular statement showing that the percentage of current budget spent on education in 1973-74 was 18.2 per cent; for the nine months to December 1974 it was 16.9 per cent; for 1975, 17 per cent; 1976, 17.3 per cent and for 1977 it was 17.1 per cent.  Those are fairly good figures because in 1978, under the present administration and in the context of their manifesto, that figure fell from 17.1 per cent to 16.8 per cent. In reply to my Question No. 219 to the Minister on 27 February the outturn for 1978 was 16.53 per cent, and the budget estimate for 1979 is 16.62 per cent, representing a reduction in the Government's commitment to education for their two years in office over any one year of the National Coalition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  I am fighting&mdash;as is the Minister within his Cabinet but apparently without much success&mdash;for a much larger portion of the cake for education.  It is not forthcoming and it is seen from these figures not to be forthcoming.  I noted that the Vote on Primary Education increased by approximately 9 per cent, from £136 million plus to £148 million plus.  That does not constitute an adequate increase in the context of inflation. Far be it from me to come between the Minister for Finance and Deputy FitzGerald on the rate of inflation but I would submit to the House that the rate of inflation for 1979 will turn out to be 10 per cent or thereabouts, and not 5 per cent as indicated in the budget speech.  I would put my reputation as an economist on that figure.  Taking that figure into account, all that is seen in the budget is that the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained in real terms.  Seeing that salaries and so on form such a major part of the Primary Education Vote it seems to me that we will suffer on some fronts.  Where we will suffer I am not sure and I have not had an opportunity of examining the Estimates in depth yet. The fact is that the increase is only barely in line with the rate of inflation and that is not good.  The increase in primary education barely keeps in line with inflation and the percentage of the overall cake devoted to education as a whole has fallen in the two years in which the Government have been in office.  I do not like dealing too much in statistics but those are important because the battle the Minister is waging for education within the Cabinet seems to be a losing one.  That is to be regretted because all of us in this House would like to see a <Col N="855" /> greater slice of the cake going to education and most certainly going towards primary education.</P>
      <P>One matter which I should like to have seen mentioned in the motion is that relating to site acquisition.  Here I feel the primary schools sector is being discriminated against in so far as the acquisition of school sites is not done by the State; it must be undertaken by the promoter or patron.  That is not so in other sectors of education.  For instance, it is not the case in relation to the cost of sites for vocational schools where, in effect, the Department meet the total cost of the school through the vocational education committee.  Neither is it so in relation to community and comprehensive schools where no local contribution is sought towards the cost of sites.  This is a serious matter and one which may be holding back primary education in this country where the cost of a school site is acknowledged and accepted to be a serious burden and perhaps more so in urban than in rural areas.  I plead with the Minister to change the system of financing primary schools and certainly to change the system in relation to the financing of the purchase of school sites. It is very important that the cost of school sites be borne by central government rather than by local interests.  The question has not been tackled and it has not been argued in this House at least, in recent times.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Substandard schools exist and I was in one very recently.  It is a pity that we are neglecting things in this area.  In 1977 the average allocation per pupil from public funds for primary education was the very low figure of £196 compared to that for secondary education at £359 and for vocational schools at £470. Sufficient consideration has not been given by any Government in the past decade or so to this question of commitment to primary education.  The various reports make it clear that the increased pressures on the primary sector in the immediate years ahead, and indeed in the intermediate years ahead will pose quite a problem for the Government.  I do not see as great a commitment to the <Col N="856" /> primary sector in the Votes of the last two years.  I see no great burst of enthusiasm to meet the projected increases in school population at the first level.  Nothing that the Minister has said today indicates that an exceptional effort is being made to meet the expected increase in school population.</P>
    <P>The Minister started by mentioning clerical assistants and porters and matters like that.  The appointment of clerical staff was apparently a secret of Fianna Fáil.  I was very annoyed to hear that the details of these appointments were circulated only to members of Fianna Fáil.  That is cheap abuse of privilege and beneath the dignity of a Minister.</P>

      <P>The criteria for the appointment of clerical staff have not met with complete approval.  I am aware of one school where a mature lady is secretary.  There is no question of money being granted from funds because the scheme is so pitched as to exclude mature ladies from taking up appointments.  It was put to me by a certain manager and patron of a school that there is no question of this lady's services being dispensed with because of the confidential nature of the correspondence with which she deals. Anyone here would quite understand the confidential nature of the work of a secretary in relation to the children's conduct, in relation to school affairs and in relation to staff.  It is confidential by definition.  Any failure on the part of the Department to understand that is wrong. It will create friction and it will be the cause of the scheme not working.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this whole question of the appointment of clerical assistants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> I should like to refer to another matter which the Minister spoke of, and that is the extra £81,000 for the school book scheme.  This school book scheme is not really a scheme one can be proud of.  It is not working or having any effect.  If we are to be committed to a free book scheme as I certainly am, I should like to see a proper library-type system established in primary schools where stocks of books could be built up and preserved for the use of people who want them and where there would not be any stigma attached to their allocation.  This is what we should be aiming at.  An extra £81,000 divided between 26 counties is obviously not going to go very far.  It is only tinkering with a potentially beneficial scheme.  This amount of money will not make any impression.  I would support any moves the Minister would make in relation to the establishment of a proper library-type scheme.</P>
    <P>Relating directly to the motion, I think there is substance in it.  The capitation grants are grossly inadequate and should have been increased in accordance with the manifesto immediately the Government came into office.  It is a pity this was not done because there are so many substandard schools.  It is a pity because there is a need for a radical review.  I would have preferred it if the Minister had said here today that he was reviewing the operation of the scheme and the areas which the scheme covers.  I would have preferred that type of approach rather than just the increase of money <i>per se</i>, although that is of course welcome.  The manifesto commitment was not adhered to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> The question of a local contribution is a very interesting one in the context of the Constitution, under which the State is supposed to provide primary education free.  The local contribution question is one which may be unconstitutional.  I do not know.  I do not pretend to be a constitutional lawyer.  Neither am I anxious that the local community be uninvolved in local schools.  It is a good thing that parents are involved in the running of schools and I will leave the question of the structure of the boards of management to the ten minutes which I will have tomorrow night.  I feel that, if the State undertook fully the maintenance costs of the national schools, the parents would then be in a position to make a contribution, topping up the maintenance fund and allowing for extra-curricular activities&mdash;something very important to young children in primary schools.  The present scheme needs to be amended radically.  £15 per pupil may be more realistic, in the context of the inflationary figures which Deputy Horgan referred to, than the moneys which the Minister has come up with.  When the present Minister was in opposition he was looking for £750 under the higher education grants scheme and this did not quite materialise immediately the Minister got into Government.  But, in fairness, he did have a crack at it so, I can see that it is easy to spend money when one is in opposition and does not have to find the money.</P>

    <P Just="Center">
      <i>Scheme announced by the Minister of State at the Department of Education, for the relief of unemployment among youth</i>
    </P>
    <P>1.  Grants will be made mainly, though not solely, through the national governing bodies of youth and sport organisations for the employment of youth on desirable community works.</P>
    <P>2.  <i>Eligibility of Projects.</i></P>
    <P>To qualify for a grant projects must have a high labour content which will result immediately in the direct employment of youth.  Selection of projects will be on the basis of probable completion within a reasonable period of time or in the case of projects of a productive nature, the possibility of their becoming self-perpetuating.</P>
    <P>3.  <i>Eligibility of Young Persons to qualify for a grant.</i></P>
    <P>To qualify for a grant employees should (a) as a rule, be not more than 23 years of age, (b) be unemployed for at least four weeks prior to employment on the project and (c) register with the National Manpower Service.</P>
    <P>4.  <i>Employment of girls.</i></P>
    <P>Special consideration will be given to projects which would be suitable for the employment of girls.</P>
    <P>5.  <i>Rate of Grant</i></P>
    <P>Grants to be paid to the organisation concerned will be determined mainly in relation to the number of eligible young persons employed on the approved project and to the wages appropriate to the employment, subject to a maximum grant of £50 per week in respect of each eligible person.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>Costs</i></P>
    <P>Where a project is to cost more than the maximum grant available, it will be necessary for the applicant body to indicate how the balance of the cost will be met.  A grant will not be approved in any case where such additional funds are not available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> 7.  <i>Commencement Date</i></P>
    <P>In the event of a grant being sanctioned it is important that the Scheme be commenced at the earliest possible date.  Priority will be given to projects which can begin without delay.</P>
    <P>8.  <i>Supervision</i></P>
    <P>Projects will not be considered for grant aid unless the Department is satisfied with arrangements made by the applicant organisation for supervision.  Normally supervision on a full time basis by a mature and preferably skilled person will be required.</P>
    <P>9.  <i>Application Forms</i></P>
    <P>Application forms for completion by eligible organisations are available from the Department of Education, Youth and Sport Section, Hawkins House, Dublin 2.</P>
    <P>10.  <i>Payment of Grant</i></P>
    <P>An initial instalment of the grant will issue as soon as possible after the approval of the project and further instalments will be paid as deemed appropriate in the light of evidence as to the progress of the work.</P>
    <P>11.  <i>Inspection of projects and Accountability for grant</i></P>
    <P>The projects and accounting procedures will be open to inspection by officers of the Department of Education.  Grants paid by the Department under the Scheme should be lodged by the Grantee to a separate bank account and the Grantee should submit certified audited returns of the expenditure of the grant sanctioned for the project not later than two months after the termination of the project.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 179 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>The disruption of postal services caused by the strike of certain post office employees has seriously upset the arrangements for making social welfare payments.  The emergency arrangements made by my Department to meet this situation are designed to ensure the least possible inconvenience to persons entitled to social welfare payment.  Details of these arrangements were announced in all the daily newspapers within the last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In areas where post offices are closed persons who normally receive payment <Col N="752" /> of pension or allowance, including children's allowance, at these offices may have their orders cashed by local traders, shopkeepers or other persons willing to cash them.  The banks have agreed to accept the orders as part of the lodgments of the persons who cashed them.</P>
    <P>As sub-post offices are still operating persons whose designated office for the cashing of any pension or allowance is a sub-post office, will continue to receive payment at such office.</P>
    <P>Unemployment benefit and assistance are normally paid in cash at my Department's local offices but persons who receive payment otherwise may attend for payment in cash at the appropriate local office.</P>
    <P>Cheques in payment of disability, injury, disablement and maternity benefits were being distributed at employment exchanges throughout the country and at convenient local centres in areas which are not served by these offices. For persons residing in the Dublin area the benefit cheques were available for collection at my Department's public office, 157-164 Townsend Street, Dublin 2.  The Post Office Workers' Union, however, regarded this work as appropriate to their members and contended that it should not be done by other staffs.  The Civil and Public Services Staff Association accordingly notified their members in my Department that they must discontinue the arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am now informed that the Post Office Workers' Union have lifted the embargo on these payments, and the arrangements I have outlined will accordingly continue to operate for the duration of the dispute.</P>
