    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper report (details supplied) concerning statements purported to have been made by the Government Press Secretary on behalf of Fianna Fáil; if the Press Secretary made the statements referred to; and if the rules governing civil servants which permit action in the political field have been changed since his reply to a similar question on 22 May 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the newspaper report referred to by the Deputy.  The Government Press Secretary was replying to a query from a reporter as to why no Government Minister was available for a Frontline (RTE) programme on Friday, 16 November 1979.  The rules governing civil servants and political activity have not changed since my last reply on 22 May 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying <Col N="498" /> effectively that the Government Press Secretary told him the reporters made it all up?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>What possible interpretation can we put on the Taoiseach's answer other than that the Government Press Secretary has effectively accused the reporters concerned of misrepresenting his remarks and putting them in quotation marks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that is the case.  I can give one example of the kind of question which was asked and the answer given.  The Government Press Secretary was asked was it true that Fianna Fáil did not want to do something and he said, &ldquo;That is not true&rdquo;.  He did not answer in the exact terms in which the report was put in the paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not agree that the report concerned quoted the Government Press Secretary as saying Fianna Fáil would gladly participate in another programme on another occasion, and the report in question also quoted the Government Press Secretary, in quotation marks although I may not use the exact quotation, as making a direct political attack on a member of a former Administration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen those remarks certainly.  I can only say that questions were put in a certain form and monosyllabic or perhaps duosyllabic answers were given, but the full text of the answer was given in quotes in the answer as quoted in the newspaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach give an undertaking to the House that this kind of event will not occur again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope not, but I do not see any serious problem in it.  If the Government Press Secretary says Fianna Fáil would do this or would not do it, I do not see that he is abrogating any great principles.</P>

      <P>The Government's manifestos for the 1979 local elections outlined certain proposals to deal with the problems of unfinished estates including proposals to provide funds to enable planning authorities to take in charge and complete estates which are irretrievably bogged down in litigation.  My Department has recently requested from planning authorities information on the extent <Col N="504" /> of the problem in their areas, the type of works outstanding and the likely cost of the remedial action which would be necessary to enable the authorities to take the estates in charge.  When this information is received, I hope to formulate proposals to deal with estates where insuperable problems have arisen in achieving their completion.  I would point out, however, that it is not my intention to facilitate developers to avoid their obligations to comply with the terms of planning permissions and I have urged planning authorities to make full use of the powers available to them in enforcing planning control, in particular, to require developers before the development commences to give adequate security for its satisfactory completion, the amount of such security to be sufficient to enable the authority to complete the outstanding works in the event of the developer defaulting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has made a final decision on the location of the new headquarters for An Foras Forbartha and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, in furtherance of their policy of decentralisation, have authorised me to pursue, as a matter of urgency, with the Board of An Foras Forbartha the feasibility of obtaining an adequate site and providing suitable accommodation for An Foras on Fota Island, County Cork.  I have already initiated an examination by my Department in connection with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he regards An Foras Forbartha as a preserved species or a species which requires preservation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Preservation, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On what logic does he suggest that An Foras Forbartha should be relocated on Fota Island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>For one very good <Col N="508" /> reason.  This is the type of operation in which An Foras Forbartha are involved. They would, I should think, need to be adjacent to a university or a NIHE or similar type of building.  It so happens that the owners of Fota Island are UCC. They indicated that they would be prepared to make a site available there for the decentralisation of An Foras Forbartha. Furthermore, at present An Foras Forbartha cannot continue to operate with their present accommodation, at laboratory level or otherwise. They will have to get new accommodation if they are to do their work properly, either in Dublin or outside Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, could I ask the Minister, since he has expressed, and demonstrated, a concern for decentralisation, would he not consider that perhaps an institution that is concerned with physical planning and construction might be more adequately and reasonably decentralised by being placed in the central city area of either Cork city or Dublin city rather than in the unattainable suburbs of either?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider, in view of the terrible scarcity of money for local authority housing, that this sort of thing, like the Taoiseach's new house and other proposals, is a lot of nonsense at the present time?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the proposals, if any, to introduce a motor vehicle testing system in this country, if so, when an announcement in this regard will be made, who may apply for a licence to carry out such inspections, and if any preliminary work in this regard has already been undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Member states of the EEC are obliged, in consultation with the Commission, to introduce a harmonised system of annual vehicle testing not later than 1 January 1983 for specified categories of vehicles, such as large public service and commercial vehicles, taxis and ambulances.  Arrangements are being made accordingly and when these have been completed, I will have a public announcement issued in the matter.  I <Col N="510" /> have already expressed my intention to have testing extended to private cars as soon as may be practicable, but priority has to be given to the testing of the classes of vehicles covered by the EEC directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to any regulation the Minister will in due course announce, particularly as regards private motor vehicle testing, can I be assured that the criteria laid down will be such as to allow a very wide range of interests to apply for a testing licence, or whatever will be then appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A testing centre, yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to be sure that the testers will not be restricted to a very small catchment area or a very short list of possible testers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they will not be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if any contacts have been made at this stage, with any particular garages, for example, with a view to ascertaining whether or not they would meet the criteria the Minister might seek?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister what criteria the local authorities, acting on behalf of the Minister, would use in approaching these garages for the purpose of being involved in this testing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>They would want to be garages that could be depended upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>For what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>For the testing.  At the moment I am not in a position to announce any details.  I will do so but naturally inquiries have to be made of the motor industry because they will have a direct involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not somewhat extraordinary that a system has commenced <Col N="511" /> already in so far as preliminary investigations are concerned, through the local authorities&mdash;thereby making it virtually public knowledge&mdash;but that nevertheless the Minister finds himself unable to amplify, for example, the criteria the local authorities have been asked to apply to the garages?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal one would be to assess their capability to carry out the tests which would be involved with regard to personnel and equipment.  That would be a very important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should appreciate that because it has been indicated to me that there is some reason for concern about the degree of selectivity involved.  I shall not say any more than that until I see what the Minister has to communicate to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The present delays in carrying out inspections in County Kilkenny and elsewhere derive from the unprecedented volume of housing grant applications reaching my Department.  In the three months ended 31 October 1979, 23,796 applications were received compared with 10,278 for the same period last year.  Additional staff is being recruited to deal with the increased volume of housing grant applications and I am also reviewing housing grant procedures with a view to improving the service to the public.  It would require a considerable amount of staff time to extract the information requested in relation to outstanding applications and since many are outstanding for reasons outside the control of my Department, such as work not proceeding or no planning permission, the diversion of staff time would not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, may I protest at a question relating to a national matter being lumped in with a <Col N="514" /> question by Deputy Crotty about County Kilkenny, which I consider to be highly inappropriate?  Having said that, the Minister mentioned a figure&mdash;I was trying to read Deputy Crotty's question at the time to ascertain the linkage between it and mine&mdash;which I did not catch.  What was the figure for the number of applications outstanding and did it relate to Kilkenny or to the country as a whole?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I will repeat the appropriate portion of the answer:</P>
      <P>The present delays in carrying out inspection in County Kilkenny and elsewhere derive from the unprecedented volume of housing grant applications reaching my Department.</P>
      <P>That is, nationally.  To continue:</P>
      <P>In the three months ended 31 October 1979, 23,796 applications were received compared with 10,278 for the same period last year.</P>

For God's sake&mdash;this is the Minister for the Environment&mdash;what kind of an answer is that, to say in the three months preceding October?  What kind of trick artistry is this?  The place was closed down for six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are prepared on a quarterly basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the House but that is a disgraceful answer to give to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are grants not paid, or files not returned by inspectors, if the buildings have been inspected and passed?  Why are the inspectors taking such a long period to return the files?  It appears that files are being withheld so <Col N="515" /> that grants cannot be paid to waiting applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel sure that is not correct, Deputy.  The delay at inspection level is because of the number of inspections an inspector has to carry out resulting from increased applications. The Deputy is saying that inspectors are withholding the files.  I have no knowledge of that and if the Deputy has any details of such I should like to have them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly in the Kilkenny area I have a feeling that files are not being returned.  Could the Minister investigate that possibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I will, and if the Deputy has details of any specific instance I shall be glad to have them.  I should like to point out that in that area normally there are four inspectors.  At present there are three additional inspectors in that area in an effort to have inspections carried out more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KiearanCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister investigate a case&mdash;details of which I shall give him&mdash;in which reconstruction was passed in September 1978 and in which two further inspections have since been called for?  In other words, the file concerned has been sent back twice and&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>Seemingly there is bedlam in that section.  That is why I put down this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is a <Col N="516" /> delay at present and I have given the reasons therefor more than once in this House.  It is because of the volume of applications and the delay in recruiting more people, which we have done, and will continue to do, even for the purpose of carrying out inspections in addition to work in the administrative section.  I might add also that at present they are working overtime at both administrative and inspectorate level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The second part of what I said would account for some delay&mdash;the volume of work at administration level.  We are recruiting and have recruited more staff there.  Practically all of the staff in that area, as far as I am aware, are working overtime in an effort to keep up with the volume of work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I can see the Minister does not have any information in reply to a very legitimate question <Col N="517" /> which is causing a lot of concern.  I protest at the effort to avoid my question by lumping it in with a question from Kilkenny and at the Minister not replying to my supplementary questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Housing authorities are empowered, and it is their practice, to pay SDA or low-rise mortgage loans in instalments as the building of a house progresses providing, of course, that the loan applicant has clear title.  In cases of loans in respect of previously-occupied houses, such loans are paid in one instalment on clearance of title.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's reply.  Is he aware that not <Col N="525" /> every local authority is complying with the practice he referred to?  May I ask him, on behalf of such applicants who are in those local authorities, to issue a housing circular to all local authorities clarifying the position?  With regard to the purchase of second-hand houses, where local authority loan applicants must by definition go on bridging finance to clear the title, would he look at this situation to get over the problem of bridging finance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to second-hand houses, on completion of sale the money must be paid.  That is a legal matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that much of the problem in getting the title from the local authority solicitor arises because there is a hold-up in the Revenue Commissioners, Valuation Office, Land Registry or Land Commission, or some other place?  Would he not consider that there is a case to be looked into in regard to having the local authority advance the money to the purchaser on an undertaking from the solicitor to furnish the title when it is cleared by the various Government offices? Would this not solve a lot of problems and save the buyer the bridging interest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, but the local authority must be satisfied that a clear title will be made available.  If the solicitor could convince the local authority of that, it would be a matter to be decided between them.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is a suggestion. This is very complex and very important. If the solicitor were able to give a certificate of title, possibly to the effect that the title would be cleared once it had been registered in the Land Registry, and if at the same time he was prepared to give an undertaking to the local authority, would the Minister not see that that could be an arrangement whereby at that stage a local authority <Col N="527" /> could release the funds and so avoid the necessity of bridging finance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A house improvement grant of £600 or two-thirds of the approved cost, whichever is the lesser, is available towards the cost of replacing windows which, in the opinion of my Department's inspector are defective and need replacement.  Where replacement work has been started or completed in advance of inspection, the old windows must be retained to enable the inspector to arrive at a decision on the need for replacement.  I have no intention of extending that arrangement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is under pressure, as any spending Minister is in these circumstances. Instead of introducing a new conservation grant would he not agree, in relation to windows which in this day and age of high energy costs are draughty and cannot be made draughtproof, as is the case with many metal windows which are still structurally sound, and without getting into trouble with the Department of Finance, that he could rule that such windows are unfit for use?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The latest figures made available to my Department by Dublin Corporation show that the total number of approved and unprocessed applications for housing accommodation by that local authority fell by 740, from 8,035 at 1 November 1978 to 7,295 at 1 May 1979.  While the number of houses completed by the corporation in 1978, and to date in 1979, is somewhat disappointing due to causes outside the control of the corporation their programme generally is satisfactory.  The number of dwellings completed to 31 October is slightly higher this year at 1,077 compared to 1,064 at 31 October 1978; 2,229 houses were under construction by the corporation at 31 October 1979 compared with 2,071 at the same date last year.  There was a substantial increase in the number of men employed on the corporation's programme from 1,559 at 31 October 1978 to 1,854 at 31 October 1979.</P>
      <P>The total number of dwellings becoming available for letting by Dublin Corporation through new construction casual vacancies in existing houses was 2,811 in 1978 compared with 3,061 in 1977, 2,670 in 1976 and 2,603 in 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the corporation are getting as much capital for local authority housing construction as they can use this year.  Last year they did not spend the full amount of their authorisation. The amount of capital made <Col N="535" /> available to the corporation this year and in 1978 represented about one-third of all the available capital resources for the local authority housing construction programme, although their approved housing needs were only about one-quarter of the national total of approved needs.</P>
    <P>There has been an improvement in recent years in the local authority housing situation in Dublin county and in Dún Laoghaire Borough.  I understand from the county council that the number of approved applications on their housing list at 30 September 1979 was 1,271 of which 392 were families of four or more persons; 319 newly-weds had also applied for rehousing.</P>
    <P>At 30 September 1978 the county council had 1,304 approved applications on their housing list of which 436 were families of four or more persons.  In addition there were 365 applications from newly-weds.</P>
    <P>Between 1 January 1979 and 31 October 1979, the council completed 483 dwellings compared with 291 in the same period last year.  They had 1,294 dwellings under construction or at tender stage at 31 October 1979 compared with a corresponding figure of 1,204 at 31 October 1978.</P>
    <P>The total number of applicants on Dún Laoghaire Corporation's approved waiting list was 356 at 30 September 1979 compared with 307 at 30 September 1978.  The corporation completed 121 dwellings this year in the period up to 31 October compared with 162 in the same period last year.  At 31 October 1979 they had 175 dwellings at tender stage with another 175 at the planning stage and had sites available for 520 dwellings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's admission that the performance in terms of construction output of the corporation has been disappointing&mdash;indeed it is so to all sides of the House&mdash;would he agree that, first, this is because of labour shortages in the private construction industry? Would he therefore recognise that there is a growing need for a direct labour construction unit within a local authority to ensure that it meets the construction programme that he as Minister sets?  Finally, in view of the Government's commitment to increase employment in the economy generally, would he consider in conjunction with Dublin Corporation the possibility of setting up a direct labour construction unit to meet the targets which he considers have not been achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There are reasons for the disappointment.  Two of these are lack of interest by contractors and a labour shortage which prevailed until recent months and which now seems to be easing a lot.  In regard to the other part of the Deputy's question, I have no plans concerning the introduction of direct labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that those who are unfortunate enough to be on the housing waiting list must ride out the tide in accordance with the demand and supply of labour in the private construction sector?  Is that what the Minister is saying, that because there is now a slackening of demand on the construction side there is no necessity to build houses by a direct labour unit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I said that the problem in regard to skilled labour which prevailed for most of this year has eased considerably in recent months and the trend would seem to be in that direction. From now on it should be possible, if the trend is correct, that the corporation would at least be able to spend the amount of money made available to them each year by allocation from my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement for the information of the House on the European Council held in Dublin on 29 and 30 November.</P>
      <P>By virtue of Ireland's Presidency for the six months ending 31 December, it was my privilege to chair the meeting at which I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The subjects for discussion included:</P>
      <P>First Day</P>
      <P>1.  Economic and Social Situation.</P>
      <P>2.  Convergence and the Budget.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Second Day</i>
      </P>
      <P>3.  Energy.</P>
      <P>4.  Agriculture.</P>
      <P>5.  Telematics/Europe 1990.</P>
      <P>6.  Report of the Three Wise Men.</P>
      <P>7.  European Union.</P>
      <P>8.  Other Business.</P>
      <P>On Thursday night, the Heads of State and of Government and the Foreign Ministers dined separately.  At these meetings a number of political co-operation items were discussed, including, in particular, East-West relations and the situation in Iran and in Cambodia.  I arranged yesterday for a copy of the Presidency Conclusions to be laid before the House.  These texts summarise the work of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" />
      <i>Economic and Social Situation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Commission forecasts show economic growth in the Community declining from an average of about 3 per cent in 1979 to 2 per cent in 1980, price inflation rising to 9 per cent on average, with a swing in the balance of payments on current account from surplus in 1978 to deficits both in 1979 and 1980 and a renewed rise in unemployment in 1980.</P>
    <P>The debate on the economic and social situation took these forecasts into account.  It was dominated by the uncertainties caused by the very real threat of energy shortages in the short and medium term, political uncertainties of the type with which the world is now becoming only too familiar, and the resurgence of inflation.</P>
    <P>The necessity for Community solidarity in dealing with these problems was emphasised, together with the importance of avoiding decisions to deal with immediate problems which run counter to longer-term trends.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed that the solution of the current difficulties demands the implementation of effective counter inflationary measures, the maintenance of investment for industrial adaptation and modernisation and finally, an improved co-ordination of economic and monetary policies.  The Council agreed as to the need for a recognition that income increases cannot be sought to offset the transfer of purchasing power to the oil producing countries resulting from increases in oil prices.</P>
    <P>To underline the importance of improved co-ordination of economic and monetary policies the Council confirmed the decision taken at their Bremen meeting to set up the European Monetary Fund, as part of the European Monetary System.  The Council requested the Commission to submit proposals on specific measures to promote more incisive Community action on unemployment, which was the principal concern of the European Trade Union Confederation when they met me on 27 November, and also to continue their consultations with the social partners on the re-organisation of working <Col N="621" /> time.  In relation to telematics, the Council asked the Council of Ministers to study proposals from the Commission. The follow-up action in these fields is thus for the Commission in the first place and I do not envisage any further meeting with the European Trade Union Confederation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Energy</i>
    </P>
    <P>It was said that consumption of oil this year is down in comparison with last year and supply is higher.  Yet contrary to what one would expect if the ordinary economic rules applied, price increases continue.  The fragility of the market was emphasised strongly as was the extent of Europe's dependence on external sources for energy which is vital not only for economic growth but for survival.  There was repeated and emphatic reference to the extent to which the whole energy market is in disorder and is dominated by uncertainty&mdash;and to the serious implications this has for economic growth, employment and inflation.</P>
    <P>As a tangible contribution towards introducing an element of greater stability by consuming countries in general and by the member states of the Community in particular, the European Council have requested energy Ministers to take a final decision on the breakdown of oil import objectives for 1980 for each member state.  The Council also emphasised the need for a common energy policy in the Community based on: (1) conservation; (2) the use of indigenous resources particularly coal and nuclear power, paying particular attention to safety factors.  This need had been the main point emphasised by the Union of European Industries when I received them before the meeting.</P>
    <P>The Council re-affirmed the Community's wish to promote discussion with oil producing countries so as to develop policies in both consuming and producing countries which would allow transition to better equilibrium in the market.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Three Wise Men</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Council warmly thanked the Three Wise Men for their report and <Col N="622" /> asked the Foreign Ministers to examine it so as to prepare its discussion at the next meeting of the Council.  Copies of the report have been laid before both Houses.</P>
    <P>
      <i>European Union</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under this heading, the establishment of the European Monetary System, the preparations for the accession of Greece to the Community and the direct elections to the European Parliament were noted.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture, I should make it clear that the recent proposals of the Commission were not formally before the meeting.  However, the Commission had presented us with a report on the need for a better equilibrium on the CAP.  The Council had a brief exchange of views in the context of this paper and decided to refer it for examination to the Councils for Agriculture and Finance.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Convergence and the Budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>The discussions under this head were by far the most difficult and protracted I have experienced at a European Council. They continued, with intermissions during which we dealt with the other matters I have mentioned, over the full two days of the Council.  The essential position is clear.</P>
    <P>The Treaties establishing the Community speak of the necessity to reduce economic imbalances as between the different regions.  This aim is reiterated in the Accession Treaties and again formed a prominent part of the EMS arrangements. There can, I think, be no doubt as to the fundamental nature of this aim of Community policy.  It is under this head that the question of the size of the British contribution to the Community budget was taken.</P>
    <P>On this issue, the Presidency spared no effort to reach an accord at ministerial and official level.  In addition, over the past two or three months, I have had discussions, devoted significantly or exclusively to the problems, with the <Col N="623" /> British Prime Minister, the German Chancellor and the Prime Ministers of Italy, the Netherlands and Belgium and the President of the Commission.  I think many persons at the Council were disappointed that these efforts and those made by the Commission and other states did not enable the meeting to come up with a definitive answer which satisfies all members of the Community.</P>
    <P>An essential part of the difficulty lies in the way in which Community &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; are regarded.  These are taxes or levies collected by the different member states on behalf of the Community. They are not national taxes or revenues but belong wholly to the Community for which the national government simply act as collecting agent.  That is a fundamental Community principle.</P>
    <P>The United Kingdom, however, take another view.  They regard the money paid over to the Community as a British contribution, which imposes certain disabilities on the British economy.  While there was some sympathy with this argument and a certain willingness to go along with arrangements to give more time for adjustment, it proved impossible in the two days to reconcile the different approaches.  In fact, on a number of occasions, complete breakdown was only narrowly averted.  The Council decided that the Commission should be asked to make proposals which will enable the Council of Ministers to pursue the search for appropriate solutions to be reached at the next meeting of the European Council which will be convened by the Italian Presidency as soon as the conditions for such a meeting have been fulfilled.  The Dublin Council recognised the need to reach rapid Community solutions for the problems in relation to fisheries, energy and sheepmeat within the framework of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>There was more or less agreement on certain essential principles.  These were that in any solution:</P>
    <P>(1)  the principle of Community own resources must be maintained;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> (2)  there must be no question of <i>juste retour</i>;</P>
    <P>(3)  any solution must be financed from the Community budget;</P>
    <P>(4)  the VAT ceiling of 1 per cent must not be breached.</P>
    <P>There was also considerable support for the view that any solution must be for a limited period and must preserve existing Community policies intact.  A solution must not operate against the objective of convergence.  It is against this background that I expect the discussions over the next few months to continue. The Irish Presidency will be making necessary initial contacts, at whatever levels seem suitable, in conjunction with the incoming Italian Presidency, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>It will be our objective in these discussions to try to achieve a solution which will not damage the Community or seriously affect the vital interests of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The House and the country have sympathised with the Taoiseach in the difficult task he has had in presiding over this European meeting at which there has been such a direct confrontation of attitudes between one member state and the rest of the Community. We all recognise that the success of such a meeting, or of any meeting or series of meetings of the Council of Ministers of the Community, is not necessarily within the control of the country holding the Presidency or the person presiding at the meeting.  Success requires good luck and goodwill from all our partners as well as good judgment on the part of the person presiding.  I have noticed that no-one in other countries, at least so far as reports indicate, even the most jingoistic of publications in the country most directly involved, has sought to put any blame on us for the failure of this meeting.  At the same time, I was a little concerned at the tone of some press comments abroad, in particular one comment in the UK press suggesting that there have been contradictions in Irish briefings.  This may, of course, have affected national pride, <Col N="625" /> although the tone of that comment did not indicate this, but I do not recall similar criticisms on previous occasions and I hope that we were not at fault in that respect.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's role in this Council was an especially delicate one.  As guardian of the Community's interests the Presidency must be concerned to ensure that no solution of problems of this kind is arrived at which weakens the <i>acquis Communitaire</i> including the CAP structure, or which damages the Community's system of receipts and payments. As Taoiseach of this country he has also responsibility to maintain a constructive relationship with the UK and in our national interest to ensure the maintenance of the CAP structure.  I will develop that last point in a minute or two because it is crucial to the way we approach the solution to this British problem and the Taoiseach has continuing responsibility in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this country we have paid the price of membership of the Community on the industrial side with the replacement of 75,000 of the 200,000 jobs in manufacturing during the transitional period. This, together with the world economic crisis from 1973 to 1976, prevented us during this period of additional industrial investment from reaping the benefits in terms of a net increase in industrial employment. We are now entitled to secure the benefits of our comparative advantage in the agricultural sphere, having paid the price of other countries' comparative advantage in the industrial sphere.  We paid that price in terms of free trade with Britain from 1965 onwards.  Britain was the main beneficiary of 1972 and our other Continental partners have been the main beneficiaries since then.  These benefits of free trade in agriculture in the CAP area can be secured by this country only in the long term, unlike the industrial losses which are essentially short-term.  It will take a full generation or more to build up the potential of our land after centuries of direct and indirect exploitation and British colonial or post-colonial cheap food policies.  The output of our <Col N="626" /> agriculture can be doubled or even trebled over a time when we see the productivity from the land achieved long since by other countries which did not experience colonisation and its consequences. We are permitted to achieve this in return for opening our markets to manufactured goods and any attempt to pre-empt our agricultural advance by freezing the existing uneconomic production patterns within the Community which are the result of an historic anomaly of different past experiences of market considerations would be totally contrary to the basic free trade principles upon which this Community is built. This must be our message, standing firm on the principles on which this Community is founded.  We must not adopt a defensive stance seeking particular privileges but rather the right to trade freely in farm products within the CAP area, a right which, if maintained, will over time lead to a vast expansion of our output and our share of the market at the expense of the uneconomic or inefficient farmers in other countries or of farmers who may be efficient but who face adverse soil or climatic conditions for pastural agriculture, such as in Germany and France.  On the basis of the most fundamental principles of the Community we have a right to resist any proposals to introduce quota restrictions on the output of products such as dairy produce and beef or any equivalent measures using financial mechanisms to choke off production increases in this country and to preserve less economic production elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This legitimate objective is threatened currently partly by the cost of financing the surplus by the inefficient producers in other countries who must in time be squeezed out.  It is now being threatened also by fresh pressure from the British Government.  In their somewhat desperate effort to pursue a line popular in Britain of seeking to reduce the UK's net payments to the Community, the British Government are now putting fresh pressure on the CAP.  If fresh resources have to be found for a new range of Community expenditure schemes such as coal, transport infrastructure <Col N="627" /> and so on designed to benefit Britain, these schemes must, on Community principles, be available on an equitable basis to all countries.  The additional pressures from that on the Community budget could be very great, and this at a time when, as the Taoiseach said, we are already approaching the limit of EEC taxation under existing arrangements through levies, duties and 1 per cent VAT.  My party and I agree strongly with the Community's view on own resources.  There can be no question of Britain or any other country getting its own money back.  That concept has to be resisted and if we have to mount an eight-country educational campaign in the UK, which somebody should have mounted long ago, we ought to do that to try to get that message across.  Is it correct, as has been reported, that the Taoiseach in these discussions gave the example of the port of Rotterdam and suggested that the Netherlands could scarcely get away with claiming that the levies and duties paid on arrivals at that port are part of their money and they want that money back when these goods are coming in, in many cases in transit to another part of the Community?  If so, I congratulate him because that point needs to be made frequently in order to get this message across to the people of Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we, and by we I mean the Eight, not just Ireland, have not really succeeded in penetrating the paper wall in Britain in this respect. There is a real difficulty in communicating with British public opinion, given that the British press show such an extraordinary patriotic loyalty to their <Col N="628" /> country's own prejudices, with some notable and honourable exceptions. That, on this and other occasions, has prevented the British people from understanding why what seems to them reasonable is unreasonable.  It is a pity that the media cannot fulfil their most basic function of communicating to each country the feelings and ideas of other countries instead of adopting a somewhat jingoistic view.</P>
      <P>From our point of view it would be preferable if a solution were found which would be most specifically helpful to the UK and, therefore, less expensive than solutions which would have to be generalised throughout the Community as a whole.  If such a solution could be found, pressure on the CAP arising from the impending approach of the 1 per cent VAT limit could be reduced.  This consideration prompts me to ask the Taoiseach whether, in his discussions with the Commission and with other governments before this European Council, he raised the possibility of a deal which would assist the UK finances through participation by the UK in the EMS, bringing in its train subsidised loans to the UK on the lines of the loans that Italy and ourselves receive with significant net subsidies in terms of the interest payments, in return for a UK agreement to accept the removal of the 1 per cent VAT ceiling and to end her campaign against the CAP.  Incidentally, I am very disturbed at the reference in the Taoiseach's statement to an agreement to maintain the 1 per cent VAT limit.  I take that to be a very short-term agreement and that we have not agreed to this being anything other than an element in the equation now being arrived at with Britain for the year ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just one aspect of budgeting for most of our partners in respect of this issue in the year ahead. That is the reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If we do not budget in this regard in 1981, the 1981 budget will present serious difficulties as will the CAP.  It is important that we should be pressing the need to move past that limit <Col N="629" /> because otherwise the whole development of the Community will be constricted and the CAP could be very rapidly undermined.  If we cannot secure agreement in that regard, those who are resisting such a change could be endangering the survival of the Community and that is the point we must make, not only in our own interest but in the interest of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am wondering whether this idea of British participation in the EMS and of Britain securing financial benefts as has been the case in respect of ourselves&mdash;subsidies which the Italians are also enjoying and which by agreement with the Community go to the less privileged countries&mdash;would be much less costly than inventing new schemes to spend money which is needed but money which we have not got because of the 1 per cent VAT limit on transport, on coal and things of that kind but which necessarily being Community expenditure schemes would have to be available also to other countries and not merely to Britain.  I wonder if this question of EMS membership and of its being a way out of the British difficulty has been raised and, if not, would the Taoiseach consider putting forward a proposal on these lines.  Such a proposal would have a number of advantages. First, it could resolve the UK problem and avoid the danger of confrontation next year, a danger which remains real despite the softening in tone of the British Prime Minister since her return home.  Secondly, it would put Britain into the EMS thereby giving us currency stability again with sterling and, perhaps, the rather remote possibility of parity. However, even stability with sterling would be something.  Thirdly, it would be less expensive to the Community budget thereby taking pressure off in terms of expenditure that is needed for the CAP and, lastly, it could remove the threat to the CAP and the general threat to the continuing development of Community activities arising from the approaching 1 per cent VAT limit about which the Taoiseach has just expressed such alarming pessimism.  I should be interested in <Col N="630" /> the Taoiseach finding an opportunity to indicate his reaction to this proposal which is offered in a constructive spirit.</P>
    <P>I note that the assessment by the Heads of Government of the European economic situation is a depressing one. There is a fall in growth in the Community from 3 per cent to 2 per cent, a situation that could be very serious for us in view of our very grave balance of payments situation and our external reserves situation about which I was speaking last night.  These are the problems which render it essential for us to get back on to the growth path of 1977 as soon as possible, that growth path of almost 6 per cent which the Taoiseach described in this House in December 1977 as the kind of foundation on which we could build but a foundation which has been undermined since as growth has declined to an estimated 2½ per cent for the current year.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed also at the prospect of higher unemployment in the Community, a situation which seems to be accepted almost fatalistically by the Heads of Government.  I find unconvincing the reference to the need for more incisive Community action on unemployment. Every communiqué from every Heads of Government meeting during the past five years has contained some words on this subject but this is the first time that the word &ldquo;incisive&rdquo; has been used.  A different cliche is used each time but no action follows.  It would be difficult for us to avoid being involved in any increase in unemployment, A situation that could reverse the favourable trend in unemployment that we have been experiencing since mid-1976 and a trend which the Government have succeeded up to now in maintaining but which could be threatened if unemployment increases generally in the Community.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that a real will exists to co-ordinate economic policies on the scale of intensity necessary to secure a return to a growth path by the Community as a whole.  The weakness of Community economic co-ordination and the unwillingness of the Commission to be tough enough in the line they take <Col N="631" /> with member countries and of member countries to accept any common discipline have been major factors in preventing the Community from coming successfully through the crisis of the past five years.</P>
    <P>The references in the Taoiseach's statement to energy conservation highlight the weakness of our Government in this area, an area in which there has been extraordinary failure to take adequate measures.  I do not know offhand of any country whose attempts at energy conservation have been as feeble as those of this country under this Government.  In addition there is the deplorable inadequacy of the government's so-called <i>White Paper on Energy</i> which the Taoiseach must be aware is regarded as a joke not only here but in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether I am right in thinking from the words the Taoiseach used that there was less pressure at this European Council on the nuclear front than apparently was the case on the last occasion. Is it the case, perhaps, that even those hard line countries which make a large part of their living from the sale of nuclear reactors and which have spare ones to sell after the Iranian debacle, may be rethinking some of their attitudes in the light of more recent developments? It is evident that the full dimensions of the Three Mile Island disaster which are only now emerging&mdash;it was only yesterday we read that those responsible do not know how to cope with the result of that disaster, that they cannot get inside the reactor to deal with what remains and that what is going on inside may destroy the seals and release massive radio activity in the period ahead&mdash;that countries producing nuclear reactors would need to produce a blueprint showing, first, how to prevent disasters and, secondly, what to do after a disaster has occurred before they try to sell them to unsuspecting customers such as ourselves.  If there has been some reduction in the pressure on this front pending a rethink of the approach to nuclear energy, I should be glad but, <Col N="632" /> perhaps, I am reading too much into the words used by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I find the report of the Three Wise Men somewhat disappointing, though it seems to have helped to head off a formalisation of the directives of the larger powers which have emerged as a <i>de facto</i> feature of European Councils since their establishment.  I should like the Taoiseach to allow time to debate this report in the House early in the new year.  I shall not add to the ludicrous situation in which we find ourselves by suggesting that the matter be debated before Christmas having regard to the amount of business which the Government have discovered suddenly must be dealt with in the next couple of weeks. However, we ought to have an opportunity early in the new year to debate that report, a report in which the future of the Community is considered.</P>
    <P>Early in the new year, too, we must put through urgently the legislation concerning Greek accession to the Community. I trust this matter is receiving some priority from the Government because we should not be in default in relation to our obligation in this regard.</P>
    <P>I note that there was discussion, though I wonder how much time was given to such discussion, at the European Council of the problems in Iran and Cambodia.  I am glad that we in the Presidency have been able to make some attempt to ease the situation in Iran, though I do not think anybody can hope to resolve the present situation there. However, we have been playing our role in that regard as best we can.  We must be concerned for Irish people in that country where there seems to be an almost total breakdown of order.</P>
    <P>The European Council and the Council of Ministers should be giving a very high priority to this.  I know how difficult it is to find a solution but the dangers the whole world faces as a result of that situation are such that it should be having a very high priority.  However, the Taoiseach's remarks do not suggest it received that at the European Council nor do the press reports, and this is somewhat disturbing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="633" /> The same situation appears to apply with regard to Cambodia, the references to which are somewhat cursory.  I do not fault the Government on this.  I know they have increased the amount of aid originally granted to Cambodia, and from discussions in the House I know they would give more if it were possible to ensure that the aid could get through to those who need it.  This has immense support from Irish people.  One of the very heartening features of the past few months is that in the midst of our own difficulties&mdash;we face domestic difficulties that are worrying people&mdash;has been the immense fund of concern and goodwill for the people of Cambodia.  There has been a great desire to help coupled with a sense of frustration at the fact that it is so difficult to help.  The Government will have the full support of the political parties and the Irish people in anything they can do during the remaining weeks of the Presidency to overcome the problems that seem to stand in the way of relieving the plight of the people of Cambodia.  I hope this will be given some priority in the closing weeks of the Presidency, even if the problem does not seem to have secured the priority it might have secured at the European Council meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Taoiseach for his report and for giving the House this opportunity of commenting on it today.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate, at the outset, to offer to the Taoiseach, to his colleagues in the Government and to the officials of all Departments concerned, a word of appreciation for the technical efficiency with which the meetings have been conducted.  This appreciation must also extend to the technical work associated with the Irish Presidency in general which has brought considerable credit to our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The periodic exercise of the Presidency is, perhaps, the most obvious public expression of the political responsibility involved in membership of the European Community.  It is a responsibility which should be recognised and understood by everyone.  If there is to be <Col N="634" /> a real future for the Community, the balance between responsibility and self-interest must be achieved and supported in all the member states.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the European Council was a non-event and, as such, it was a dangerous and disturbing affair.  I make that statement deliberately.  I have on a number of occasions stated the view of the Labour Party that the convening of regular meetings of Heads of Government is undesirable.  The more recent introduction of a yearly programme of such meetings is producing nothing more or less than a series of costly public relations exercises of little real substance.  In the past few years the only meeting that produced anything was the Bremen meeting, which for good or ill produced the EMS agreement.  Little worthwhile has been achieved.  I do not think these meetings do the Community any good. They do little to advance the Community and indeed may be casting a dark shadow over its future.</P>
    <P>The Heads of Government should meet only to consider long-term political orientation and they should do this occasionally and informally.  They should not be a court of final appeal for decisions shirked by their own Ministers, nor should they become a post-box for miscellaneous reports.  Certainly they should not be used as Commissioner Gundelach attempted to use them last week.  The credibility of the highest level of political leadership in the Nine is called into question by the futility of so many of these over-publicised summits.</P>
    <P>Looking at the communique and statements emerging from Dublin Castle the results are meagre in the extreme. Apart from the worthy statements on Iran and Cambodia, which unfortunately say nothing original, what do we have?</P>
    <P>Policy on energy is repeated in general terms and decisions passed on elsewhere. The discussions of the report of the so-called Three Wise Men is deferred.  The unemployment crisis is yet again reduced to a passing reference to work-sharing and a pathetic request to the Commission &ldquo;to submit proposals on <Col N="635" /> specific measures for more incisive Community action&rdquo;.  Not a single specific guideline is suggested except for the ritual call for cuts in workers' living standards and for increased reliance on monetary policy.  Everything else&mdash;fish, sheepmeat and so on&mdash;got a single sentence at the end.</P>
    <P>There did not appear to be a word about the deep-seated social problems of the people of the Community.  Yet, on the day before the opening of the Dublin Castle Summit, a Commission report was published in Dublin which very clearly underlined these problems.  I refer to the Second Report of the European Programme of Pilot Schemes and Studies to Combat Poverty.  This report states that poverty &ldquo;is a continuing reality for substantial sectors of the population&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the problem of poverty is a problem of inequality and social injustice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Commission makes it clear that solutions to the problem of poverty must be sought by the Community as a mattere of urgency.  The failure to make any reference to this vital area of human concern is yet another indication of the fact that the Community has lost its social momentum and turned its back on the most needy of its citizens.</P>
    <P>We all know the British budgetary contribution dominated the European Council.  Mrs. Thatcher's approach to this complex issue was entirely unhelpful and typical of the attitude of the United Kingdom to the Community.  Britain has still to make the fundamental decision that it is committed to membership and to all that such a commitment will entail. While it is obvious that the budgetary situation must be settled in an equitable manner at some future date, there can be no settlement on the basis of the current British demands.  What is necessary is a complete review of the Community's financing, which has got out of hand and which fails utterly to meet the overall needs of the people and of the member states.</P>
    <P>I believe that we need to debate the future budgetary development of the <Col N="636" /> Community on the basis of a political orientation which faces up to the facts. Unless there is a realistic balance between the main elements of Community policy&mdash;giving adequate financial resources to the regional, social and energy areas, as well as to agriculture&mdash;there will be no solution to the present difficulties.  The present adverse trends, which are now heading towards financial stalemate and crisis, will continue unless there is a definite new approach.  This will come about either through the enlightened action of the nine member governments acting together as they should, or&mdash;as I now feel to be the truth&mdash;through the action of the directly&mdash;elected Parliament relying on the strength of its popular mandate. Change there must be in the very near future, or the Community will reach a serious crisis point and will be forced in the direction of a loose free trade area in which the weaker regions will go to the wall.</P>
    <P>After more than 20 years of existence the Community must advance towards a new phase of development in which the emphasis&mdash;in policy and in action&mdash;will be changed from the dictates of competitive interest to the pursuit of cooperative goals.  Only in this way can the concrete priorities for policies be defined. With massive unemployment, especially among the younger and older members of the workforce, and with such far-reaching structural economic difficulties, it is obvious that lasting solutions cannot lie in the traditional areas of fiscal and monetary policy.</P>
    <P>These have been tried again and again and they had very little, if any, impact. Meaningful proposals must relate directly to the eradication of the fundamental causes of the problems, including the maldistribution of resources and undemocratic control of the key centres of the economic system.</P>
    <P>Above all, there must be a practical recognition of the failure of the Community to provide adequate policies and resource-transfers in the areas of regional and social development.  In this connection we in the Labour Party can <Col N="637" /> only deplore the performance of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development in failing to stand firmly behind the Commission's proposals for the financing of the regional fund in 1980.  The principled stand of the Parliament merited the full support of the Irish Government, but unfortunately did not get it.</P>
    <P>Central to all discussion of the future of the Community is the question of the common agricultural policy.  It is the only comprehensive Community policy and it has brought significant benefits to sections of the Irish farming population and the economy in general.  But it has also contributed to price inflation, to the production of scandalous food surpluses an to the relative impoverishment of small farmers.  It has created a serious imbalance in the financing of the Community and this has led inevitably to negative public attitudes which are now widespread and growing.</P>
    <P>No one can doubt that a fundamental review of the common agricultural policy has begun within the institutions of the Community.  In the context of that review, the Irish Government's approach must be skilful and creative.  A totally negative attitude to reform could prove exceptionally disadvantageous to this country.  Rather what we must seek to ensure is that any measures adopted to deal with the question of surplus food are balanced by increased aid to smaller farmers and employment creation.</P>
    <P>Our approach must be to seek to ensure that the net advantage of the CAP to this country is maintained in any new arrangements which follow from the present budgetary crisis.  For this reason it was right that the Government should have rejected Mr. Gundelach's recent discriminatory and arbitrary package, because it does not tackle the real problems, and because it deliberately sets out to penalise those&mdash;like Irish sugar producers&mdash;who did not cause the Community's problems in the first place.</P>
    <P>The Government will face an extremely difficult test of their diplomatic and negotiating skills in the period ahead on the question of the CAP.  There are <Col N="638" /> many in the Community who are prepared to throw out the baby with the bath water.  The Government's task is to see to it that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the fact that the Heads of Government spoke on the political issues of Iran and Cambodia, even if only in general terms.  This is a reflection of the Community's growing element of political co-operation.  We should be very careful about our activity in this area.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that political co-operation can lead this country into a situation of quasi-alliance with other member states in areas where our stance should reflect a totally independent line. I am thinking, for example, of Community relations with South Africa to which the Heads of Government made no reference at all.  We should be advocating a total boycottt of South Africa, and enforcing such a boycott for ourselves, and not allowing this country to be even marginally allied to interests which regard profit made through collaboration with apartheid as acceptable. This House should keep a very close watch over our involvement in political co-operation.</P>
    <P>This Summit was of no positive value. It did nothing to secure the course of a Community committed to the interests of the ordinary men and women of Europe.  It showed no social concern.  It called even further into question the value of such publicised meetings.  I do not for a moment suggest that these negative results reflect upon the competence of the Irish Presidency.  They arise from the nature of these Summit events which have been grafted uneasily onto the Community framework.  There is a need for serious re-examination here if further damage to the Community's image among the European electorate is to be avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost concluded on the last occasion.  As will have been apparent from the drift of the comments from this side of the House, we find this Bill unacceptable for a number of reasons.  The essential reasons were well spelled out by our spokesman, Deputy Deasy.  Section 3 seeks to place a monopoly of broadcasting, both national and local, in the hands of the RTE Authority.  Despite our admiration for the fine work carried out by that august body, we feel there is no justification, political or otherwise, for such a provision. The Minister may point out that section 3 (1) does not necessarily exclude the possibility of enabling measures being introduced subsequently which would allow others into that area.  In the absence of any visible evidence of such a proposal we may conclude that the Government intend to deal with the matter in this way.  That is unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect this is local broadcasting brought in by the back door, and it is doing a disservice.  It would be far more useful and practical if we had one Broadcasting Authority Bill in front of us&mdash;whatever the draftsmanship delays&mdash;which dealt with local broadcasting and the Government's attitude and the attitude of the House to those <Col N="640" /> who are broadcasting without a licence. This Bill is unacceptable accordingly. The more I thought about it over the weekend the more disturbed I became, because what appears to be a relatively innocuous Bill, designed ostensibly to give extra money to RTE to carry on their good work, could be interpreted much more subtly.</P>
    <P>Section 3 flies in the face of the policy to which this party are committed.  We believe section 3 is not in the public interest. The difference between local and national broadcasting does not need to be teased out any further.  I dealt with it fairly extensively last week.  I want to quote one comment from an article in an issue of the Broadcasting Review last year by Jean Darcy, the president of the International Institute of Communications. He said in reference to local broadcasting and what our response should be:</P>
    <P>Questions concerning opportunities for self expression at the local community level should be decided not in terms of mass media but in terms of communication.  The concept of group media, in contra-distinction to mass media has been proposed to cover those media operating on a human scale.</P>
    <P>This thinking is backed up and supported by an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23 February 1978.  It is by Howard Kinlay, who wrote:</P>
    <P>A national radio network, with its generalised approach to the issues of the day is, perforce difficult to interrupt with the localised experiences which are probably the primary preoccupation of most of the listeners most of the time.  It is not the role of a national radio service to respond to these preoccupations in other than a generalised way.  Indeed, in a mass communications situation, even the perception of them is extremely difficult and, to some extent, a distraction.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we do not seek to exclude RTE from local broadcasting.  What we seek is to introduce a situation in which <Col N="641" /> local broadcasting is an area in which certain qualifications recognisable in law and acceptable to the community are in the possession of such groups.</P>
    <P>We are saying that we should not seek to exclude people because of the nature of local broadcasting, and this clause undoubtedly will be used without any prevarication or any suggestion of a doubt to try to justify inaction and inertia later on when it comes to a commitment by the Taoiseach to introduce local broadcasting policy.  It will then be pointed out to us that we already have an embryonic local broadcasting policy in the hands&mdash;God bless those good hands&mdash;of the national television network, and anyone daring to raise a finger against that will be accused of lack of confidence in the national network, which would be far from true. I am reminded, incidentally, of a reference by Norbert Frye when he said:</P>
    <P>It is significant that our symbolic term for &ldquo;tyrant&rdquo; is the word &ldquo;dictator&rdquo;, that is, an uninterrupted speaker.</P>
    <P>If we seek to enshrine in the hands of any small group the main organs of communication, the main media, all of us will do a disservice.  I will not go into it in any greater detail.  However, I ask the Minister to reconsider section 3.  If the main aim of the Bill is to give money to RTE to enable them to carry on, the Minister will not lose anything by considering withdrawing this section and its possible inclusion later in the broadcasting legislation he has promised.  If section 3 does not do anything more than spell out what is implicitly understood in section 16 (1) of the 1960 Act, which gives RTE power to engage in local broadcasting anyhow, the Minister cannot say that the withdrawal of this section would delay RTE activity in this area.  Accordingly he would not have anything to lose and would probably be responsible for a much more satisfactory Bill, a much more rounded debate and a more acceptable response to his promised measures when they are introduced eventually.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I am afraid that the <Col N="642" /> insertion of this clause is not, as far as I and my party are concerned, acceptable. I have referred to section 4 which I would also ask the Minister to reconsider. It seems to us to be unconstitutional. It seeks to do something we are very prone to in this country whenever a new technological challenge arises: we run to try to introduce some cobweb of bureaucratic regulation or legislation to limit the freedom of people. We should not try to do that except in the most extreme circumstances, and I am far from convinced that we need to limit the activities or the freedom of people in RTE in the manner proposed in the Bill.  I think that a constitutional action taken in the proper jurisdiction might very well be successful.</P>
    <P>I shall deal for a few minutes with section 1, which seeks to grant funds to RTE.  As I have said, sections 3 and 4 are most unhelpful from the point of view of prompting a sympathetic response and I hope the Minister will consider our objections which are based on an honest concern about the possible dangers which a Government less benign than I presume this one are might operate in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 1 proposes to give money and section 2 says such moneys shall not exceed £25 million in the aggregate.  Last week I expressed the view that I would prefer to have the power in the hands of the Government to give the necessary moneys without having to come back to the House when an increase would be needed.  It seems to me to be an unnecessary waste of public time.  In so far as we are now asked to vote money towards the national television network, it is not outside the bounds of reasonable response to ask to what extent we are satisfied with the manner in which present moneys are being spent, how it is felt those moneys would be spent in the future when allocated, and what the general attitude is in this House as to the present financial accountability of the network.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, it is not at all unhelpful to have a debate of this kind now and again.  It might help the people <Col N="643" /> in RTE, the planners there, people watching broadcasting generally, and it would also be helpful to us to communicate our areas of interest and concern. I wish to join with previous speakers who have paid tribute to the manner in which RTE have been carrying out their functions.  In a very short time they have become a fine professional organisation, they have attained a very high standard of network service, and in terms of comparable analysis with other countries, particularly in Europe, they have come out very well.</P>
    <P>Of course, it is popular for people to say, &ldquo;There is never anything on television&rdquo;. We are all very hard on our own station&mdash;presumably, far way hills being greener than ours&mdash;but as far as I am concerned we have a number of producers and other personnel in RTE who do a fine job considering the resources available to them.  However, I should like to ventilate one or two causes of concern to me, not in any sense of wishing to restrict the freedom which RTE people have but as an honest expression of concern about the way some of the moneys which we might vote might be used.  I ask those concerned to consider my remarks as respectful suggestions rather than as anything stronger.</P>
    <P>Despite the general level of satisfaction expressed in the House about the operations of RTE, there is occasionally the major pornography of violence on the media.  In a matter of two or three minutes I should like to say to RTE that when they get these moneys they might consider the impact of some of the programmes which come to the network on the minds of young people.</P>

      <P>The Chair does not like to interrupt the Deputy, but we are not discussing programmes on this measure.  We may discuss them later on the Estimates.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into it in detail.  I just want to say in one or two sentences that there is room for concern about some of the imported material RTE get.  I have written to every member of the Authority in the last 12 months naming a programme or two which I consider to be repugnant.  I will have an opportunity to deal more fully with this on the Estimates and I shall be content now to say that there are some imported programmes which are harmful to the minds of young people.  We would be better off without them, even though they might come under the definition of &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo;.  They are relatively attractive from the point of view of listener statistics.  If money is seen to be a problem for RTE, and if they have to ask us for more money, it may mean they are being forced to entertain by putting on the kind of programmes they would not normally wish to be involved with.  I am not suggesting for a moment that it is not the job of the national television network to broadcast to the maximum number of people.  I am suggesting that there are some types of programmes which are widely accepted as being in the common good but which might not have the kind of listenership which others might have.  I would not like to see the national television network, under some kind of pressure, put on some of the drivel we have to tolerate occasionally from networks generally in the interests of trying to cope with the pressure of advertisers.  Some people will argue that what is propagated through the network does not have this impact on people on a Saturday evening.  Nobody denies that advertising on a network pays and it follows logically that any broadcasting will have an impact.  There are programmes which are a matter of concern.</P>

      <P>I thought it was an interesting debate.  I did not name a programme.  We would be better off without some types of imported material which we have.  I would be worried in case RTE had to put them on to keep the TAM figures up.  The Minister might also take a look at advertising standards. As far as I am concerned the voluntary codes in operation at the moment do not operate as satisfactorily as they should. At the beginning of this season, which we hope will be one of goodwill and peace, RTE might consider a ban on advertising which is of a violent nature and propagates the sale of guns, toy soldiers and anything else which might be seen to be detrimental to the interests of young people.</P>
      <P>The television network is no longer a means of distribution.  It is now a means of communication and it has a very positive social role.  I am expressing concern in that area.  When it comes to voting money for any aspect of RTE we are entitled to make some remarks on the impact of advertising.  I would like the Minister to reconsider section 3.  On reflection he may find some substance in the remarks I made last Thursday.  If so, I know that he will, as he has done in the past, be gracious enough to admit that second thoughts may be better thoughts, particularly when he will have an opportunity, according to the Taoiseach, of introducing a comprehensive Bill, when the section he wishes to insert now would not be so repugnant because it would come along with a very important enabling section for anybody else qualified to get involved in local broadcasting. I do not believe that any of us want to eliminate from local broadcasting the people at local level who have any new thinking or new technology to bring into this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I regard our broadcasting service as a huge success, particularly over the last few years.  This service needs money. Capital is urgently needed to maintain the continuity of service.  This is precisely what the Bill is about.  The allocation of £10 million to RTE is minimal sum when compared with overseas television networks and the standards against which RTE have to compete.</P>
      <P>I have not got any fears or doubts about section 3.  It merely regularises the present position.  It makes it possible for RTE to continue to expand into local services.  Any funds necessary should be allocated by the House.  An additional studio is being constructed at Montrose and money is urgently needed for this work.  There is a demand for home produced programmes.  Any money we can give to RTE for that purpose is money well spent.</P>
      <P>I do not think people are giving enough attention to the fact that reception of RTE 1, never mind RTE 2, is not all it should be in many areas.  RTE 1, our primary channel, is unfortunately not being received very clearly in many areas.  Any expenditure in improving reception of RTE 1 is money well spent. I would like the Minister, now that we have RTE 2, to give serious consideration to establishing an open university on this network.  There is a great public demand for such an innovation.  This project in England has been an overwhelming success.  We would all welcome the allocation of money to establish studios suitable for an open university.  Our higher level educational programmes are well geared towards young people.  There are many adults&mdash;and not alone housewives&mdash;who feel they have not enough time or sufficient qualifications to avail of extra mural studies or extra curricula activities to improve their overall standard of education.  I would like to see RTE using the second channel to establish an open university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to local radio and local television, any money invested in this area will give great opportunities for employment. <Col N="647" /> We are all well aware from the Taoiseach's remarks earlier this year, when he presented the Jacob's awards, that there is legislation in the pipeline which will allow for the establishment of an independent radio authority, which will give an opportunity to many existing stations, which I consider are quite wrongfully called pirate stations.  Such stations will be able to apply for licences under this new radio authority.  There will also be a broadcasting Bill to regularise the pirate stations.  I would like to see both Bills giving the opportunity to the people engaged in broadcasting to apply themselves to new job opportunities in the expanding local authority. It is a new concept for us to spend money in developing a television service at local level.  This works very well in other countries.</P>
    <P>Local radios can work perhaps one hour per day for each district.  Rather than giving an evening's viewing time to, say, Dublin, it would be better to give one hour to each area.  Local radio and television have been very successful in other countries.  Let us look to the future as being a great opportunity for an expanding Authority.  It is most unreasonable to expect RTE to continue their capital programme without financial assistance.  Over the past two years RTE's track record has been very good. When the pirate stations started broadcasting they shocked RTE and increased their efficiency.  The establishment of the second radio channel has been a success.  Competition is good and it is the Minister's intention that there will be competition to produce the best possible service.  It is not the Government's intention to stifle broadcasting.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to an expansion in the service in the not too distant future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very short Bill but it contains two important sections&mdash;sections 3 and 4.  Section 4 enables the employees of RTE to be seconded from their employment to stand for election to the Dáil and Seanad and, if elected, to maintain their secondment <Col N="648" /> for the period of membership of either the Dáil or Seanad.  The present position is that a person so nominated must resign.  If he is not elected he would not be able to resume his employment. Section 4 puts RTE employees in the same position as national teachers and local government officials.  However, there is still an anomaly in relation to post office workers.  I know the Minister would need different legislation to regularise the position of post office workers.  A member of the Labour Party who wanted to stand for the recent by-election in Cork city was forced to resign from his employment.  As Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, I hope the Minister will include in legislation the same facilities for post office workers.</P>
      <P>Section 3 deals with the uncertainty contained in the Broadcasting Act of 1960.  Under the 1960 Act it was not clear whether RTE could establish and maintain local broadcasting services.  Up to now, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been able to use the 1960 Act to prevent RTE from developing the local broadcasting service.  Section 3 provides for the establishment and maintenance by RTE of a local broadcasting service.  RTE want local broadcasting on a permanent basis.  In a submission to the Minister they sought the establishment of Radio Dublin and Radio Shannonside.  This request has not yet been acceeded to and I hope the Minister will indicate when the request will be granted.  We need a range of regional channels, including one for each of our larger urban areas, and the continuation of Radio na Gaeltachta.  Local transmitters should be provided for smaller geographical areas.  Such a wide range of potential transmissions would extend programme choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party have always been in favour of broadcasting the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This matter has been discussed for a long time and it appears that agreement has not yet been reached. I know that Question Time in the House of Commons is broadcast.  If we were to behave as the British MPs appear to do <Col N="649" /> during Question Time, we could throw our hats at the idea.  However, it is my experience that we do not act like a mob in a film although we can be unruly at times.  Perhaps the Minister would give us his opinion about broadcasting part of the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of broadcasting is the concern of cultural and economic organisations at the failure of RTE to represent their interests.  I believe that additional national and local channels would obviate this problem to a great degree.  Apart from the provision of extra channels at national and local level, there should be efforts to develop what is described as access broadcasting.  The Minister will probably say that access broadcasting would cost a great deal of money.  I believe that access broadcasting would meet the demands of many of the minority sections of the community.  In terms of local broadcasting access broadcasting means providing facilities and encouragement for representative groups to make a serious contribution to programme content. It would be expected in such broadcasting that RTE personnel and facilities would be available to majority interest groups, including, of course, young people, to help them make their own programmes and propagate their own ideas on a regular basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not mean that RTE will be responsible for all future local broadcasting. Under the proposed legislation the question of who will be responsible for local broadcasting will be settled.  The Government have already announced, although a Bill has not been introduced to deal with this&mdash;this was referred to by Deputy Brady&mdash;that they will set up an independent local radio Authority which will have the power to grant licences to private interest groups. I expect these groups will undertake local broadcasting in certain areas.  I should like to know the Minister's thinking on this suggestion.  He should clarify his position about the future control of local broadcasting.  The Bill does not <Col N="650" /> give us any hint as to what will happen in that respect but it makes it clear that RTE may operate local broadcasting. Whether they do so in the future depends on the Minister's view or decision as to who should control local broadcasting.</P>
    <P>In general terms, I support the Bill but I am anxious to hear the Minister's view on that crucial point, the control of local broadcasting services.  Does the Minister intend to parcel out large sections of such broadcasting to private enterprise? There is a Bill on the stocks&mdash;it appears on the Order Paper and has been circulated&mdash;which seeks to prohibit broadcasting except by licence.  It provides penalties for such offences also.  There has been a debate as to whether or not broadcasting should be under State control. I am sure all Members remember the Broadcasting Review Committee established in 1974.  One of the recommendations of that committee was that broadcasting should continue to be a public service.  That recommendation was issued five years ago and I should like to know whether Members on either side of the House support that view now.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have reaffirmed their fundamental commitment to public service broadcasting.  That has been the attitude of successive Governments and is still the attitude of the Labour Party. Our commitment to public service broadcasting arrives from our understanding of the nature and purpose of broadcasting.  By its nature broadcasting can never be neutral.  It will reflect ownership and control systems.  The essential purpose of broadcasting is to inform, educate and entertain.  The quality of its achievement in those areas will depend on the ownership and control.  In essence, public service broadcasting has as its central objective the servicing of the public interest.  Commercially owned broadcasting is concerned with returns on private investment.  Therefore, we find we must take sides.  Some questions must be asked in relation to this.  The first question is: are the scarce national airwaves to be used in a way that attempts to meet public interest requirements or are some or all of those limited resources <Col N="651" /> to be used by interests whose fundamental purpose is different?</P>
    <P>I am not saying that commercial radio from time to time would not serve the public interest but public interest is not its central purpose.  We believe that our limited airwaves should be used exclusively in the public interest.  The present debate about broadcasting has raised the question as to whether the democratic ideal can be served where there is sole control by Radio Telefís Éireann.  There have been complaints about Radio Telefís Éireann and their special position.  They have been described as a monopoly and I suppose they are.  Questions have been raised as to whether this monopoly position is, in fact, constitutional.  There is a suggestion by various groups, commercial and otherwise, that it is unconstitutional. Those questions usually derive from the conservative end of the political spectrum. I do not believe there is anything undemocratic about a single public service broadcasting Authority, a broadcasting Authority who have been instituted by Act of parliament and with a specific legislative mandate to reflect the various views and aspirations of society as a whole.  There can be, and there is, a debate as to how good or bad Radio Telefís Éireann are but that, essentially, is an argument not about control but about programming.</P>
    <P>It can be reasonably expected that democratic content of broadcasting would be diminished rather than enhanced in a situation of competition for audiences and advertising revenue between two or more owners.  Such competition for mass audiences would lessen the possibility of adequate coverage for minority interests.  The minority interest is one of the central functions of radio. The need to divide advertising revenue between competing owners would diminish quality of programming in general.  As far as minority interests are concerned we should all note and applaud the positive way in which RTE have, despite competition and competitive pressures from other media, consistently <Col N="652" /> and generously extended patronage to a whole generation of Irish writers, musicians, actors and composers, Public service broadcasting is not inconsistent with the need for high quality and democratic programming&mdash;by democratic I mean reflecting the full range of interests and aspirations in society within the law.  In a country like ours with limited airwaves it is difficult to see quality and democratic objectives being met in any other way.</P>
    <P>There are many questions with regard to programming, as to whether we need better pop music, greater use of the Irish language and music, more access for minority groups and local communities and, indeed, local radio.  Those questions deal with the use we make of our airwaves and not with who owns them.  A single national broadcasting Authority are in a strong position to meet public need in those and other areas.  Competitive ownership structures would reduce the possibility of them being catered for.  There are now wider possibilities for radio to open up.  There have been experiments by RTE in regional and local radio and, of course, by illegal operators.</P>
    <P>We have the second national channel which has proved very satisfactory, catering to a very large extent, for the young people who want pop music.  A wide range of transmissions is available to Radio Telefís Éireann.  We have at present two national stations and one VHF channel; there is room for two VHF channels.  As far as my information goes, only 31 per cent of the population receive VHF programmes.  We could have a range of regional channels for the different urban areas and a continuation of Radio na Gaeltachta.  We could also have local radio transmitters, including mobile ones for small geographical areas.  This has been done very successfully over the past two or three years and we should congratulate RTE on their initiative in this respect.  The Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill to which I referred provides for the issue of licences and for penalties for the operation of unlicensed stations.  Possibly all <Col N="653" /> that has been said here should, or will, be said on the next Bill which is to come before the House.</P>
    <P>I conclude by congratulating the Minister on the introduction of that section which allows employees to stand for the Dáil and not suffer any loss.  Perhaps he would be a little more specific as far as section 3 is concerned.  I have given my party's view on it.  We believe control of broadcasting by RTE to be for the good of the country because it would look after minority interests.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on some of these matters, not to be decided on in this debate but just to allow his mind to be known as far as the issue of licences for local broadcasting are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill which gives RTE the opportunity of updating their equipment and providing new equipment where it is needed.  In my part of the country it is difficult in many areas to get RTE at all.  This is a single channel or no channel area, though in some areas we have two channels.  There is an opportunity under this Bill for RTE to rectify this situation.  The present picture which is being televised from Mullaghanish to the Cork area is nothing short of disgraceful.  I understand that a certain amount of equipment is there and it should be put into operation to rectify this.  All the transposers in that area are also affected.  If this equipment is not put into operation immediately it will be out of date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More transposers are needed in the southern part of the country and in Cork city, in places, for instance, like Glanmire, where they have only RTE 1, Passage West, where they never had RTE 1 to any great extent, and places like Kinsale and many other black spots. There are altogether 800 to 900 black spots in the country.  Television started here in 1961 and while great strides have been made many people&mdash;you could call them the silent minority&mdash;have to put up with very poor reception or none at all. These people cannot strike or raise their voices to any great extent by way of protest.  The Minister said that some of <Col N="654" /> these moneys are for the improvement of those situations and I welcome that.  It can be said of RTE that they do a very good job with the resources at their disposal.</P>
    <P>The situation with regard to radio is equally critical in some areas which I represent.  RTE 1 is not available during the day in many areas, as these people cannot get RTE 1 on the medium wave. This shows the need for a second VHF channel.  RTE can be very proud of what they have done and are doing with their present equipment.  The coverage of the recent visit of the Pope was of the highest standard and a credit to RTE.  It proves that they have the personnel, the technicians, the techniques and the equipment.  They have the will to produce the best.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity this Bill provides for further moneys for capital investment in RTE and for old broadcasting systems to be up-dated regularly, in this age of fast advancing technology. This will enable us to move into the eighties with confidence to plan ahead and to use these resources efficiently so that they will be of the greatest benefit to all the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of my intervention is to request, even demand, proper receiption on radio and television for those living in rural areas along our south and west coasts.  There has been an over-concentration of resources by RTE in endeavouring to compete with the pirates on radio and with the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland channels on television, with the result that the peripheral parts of our country have been neglected and left to make do with hopeless, or, in some cases, no reception at all.  This is typified by the situation which obtains in regard to Radio 1.  We have had here a radio service for over 50 years; the radio broadcasting service began in 1926.  The main radio programme, which caused many problems in regard to reception in the past, is now back in the same old situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> Past problems were remedied in 1966 when Radio Éireann was broadcast on VHF frequency.  This solved once and for all the reception problems in remote areas.</P>
    <P>Then there was the bright idea of establishing Radio 2, which meant that the VHF frequency formerly available to Radio 1 was transferred to Radio 2, meaning, in turn, that Radio 1, the staple diet of many people in remote parts where there is no television reception, is no longer received.  There seems to me to be absolutely no justification for this decision.  It has never been justified in this House.  I have raised the matter on a number of occasions.  There have been vague assurances given of a second VHF frequency being available in the future, with the prospect of Radio 1 reception being restored to VHF.  That is not the basic point.  The real issue here is that there was radio reception of Radio Éireann, now Radio 1, available to people all over the country.  That is no longer available.</P>
    <P>In my book, that is not progress.  Why was it done?  As far as I can ascertain, there was an effort made to establish Radio 2, to encourage people to listen to Radio 2, but we have now a situation in which people are being coerced to listen to Radio 2 because they cannot get Radio 1.  I want to impress on the Minister that this is a situation that should not have arisen and one which should be remedied now.  There is considerable strength of feeling in many of the remoter parts about this iniquitous situation.  If the Minister is prepared, by way of direction or otherwise to RTE&mdash;he being the Minister responsible for that Authority&mdash;to arrange that this step be taken, certainly he will receive the gratitude of those people.  The Minister should not underestimate the strength of feeling in this respect.  It is an issue in respect of which I have had a huge volume of correspondence, not alone from my own area of west Cork but from other parts along the western seaboard.  More money is being provided to RTE under this Bill.  If they are not <Col N="656" /> prepared to switch Radio 1 back to VHF, they should use that money to provide a further VHF frequency but, one way or the other, the problem must be resolved immediately.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I compliment RTE on having established a second radio programme.  It shows they have developed their expertise.  It provides an outlet for further Irish artists and, in turn, a choice and variety for those people able to receive Radios 1 and 2.  I say: &ldquo;Good luck to Radio 2 but not at the expense of Radio 1.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are problems in regard to television also.  I compliment RTE on the developments that have taken place in television.  But, again, there has been neglect in those parts of the country that can receive one RTE channel only and in a number of others where there is no television reception at all.  We have heard of black spots and of efforts being made to remedy them.  If there is big money being voted for our broadcasting services, let me make a plea on behalf of those people in those black spot areas that their needs be looked after now once and for all.  It is not fair that extra services are being provided in some areas where there is a variety of channels on offer while there is continuous and total neglect of other parts where people are left without television reception at all. Surely that is not justifiable.  While RTE suffer from competitive pressure from other channels they have a fundamental duty to provide the minimum, basic service for all.  That is a duty that should be discharged now.  This is not a problem obtaining only in my area of south-west Cork.  I am aware also that there are vast areas of Kerry, particularly the Dingle area, where there is a virtual total blackout as far as television reception is concerned.  I am aware that there are other areas along the west coast similarly affected.  Why are these problems not tackled?  I would ask the Minister, when replying, to give a reasoned response and provide some assurance to the people living in those areas that they will not have to suffer any longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> A further point occurs to me on this Bill.  It is fashionable for politicians to be fulsome in their praise of RTE.  I suppose politicians are thankful enough for the bit of publicity they get from time to time.  But that does not relieve us of the obligation and duty to inquire whether we are getting value for money.  We are today debating a Bill which will provide an extra £10 million by way of repayable advances for the capital purposes of RTE.  I should have expected from the Minister a broader resumé of the situation in RTE from the point of view of convincing this House that we are getting value for the money already advanced, which I understand to be of the order of £50 million, and also from the point of view of convincing ourselves that further money should be advanced. I know the Minister made a few vague references to capital expenditure in his opening statement, but these were merely general projections of what might be spent by RTE in the future.</P>
    <P>This is a major body employing over 2,000 people and it is no harm that such questions be raised.  It has been suggested to me from time to time that there is considerable feather-bedding and over-manning at different levels in RTE. If that is so, it is only right that it should be brought to the attention of the public. For instance, is the Minister fully satisfied with the financial affairs of RTE?  Is he fully satisfied with their production levels?  Is he fully satisfied that the body fully justifies its existence, gives full value for money, is and should be entitled to call on the State for a further substantial sum of the order of £10 million?  I am not an expert in this area.  Yet, as a public representative, I feel these questions need to be asked. There is the duty on the Minister to give a full resumé to this House of what exactly is the situation in RTE and whether or not he is fully satisfied with it.  For example, are we getting full value for money there?  In that context this House could then reach a reasoned decision as to whether further moneys should be voted to RTE.</P>
    <P>A further major point arises on this <Col N="658" /> Bill, that is, what the Minister referred to as a small technical amendment of the Broadcasting Acts.  I refer in particular to the section which provides that RTE may establish and maintain local broadcasting services.  On reading the Bill one has the clear impression that there is some doubt about the legality of present local broadcasting services being operated by RTE.  Otherwise what is the justification for this section?  Perhaps &ldquo;illegality&rdquo; is too strong a word to use but there seems to be at least a suggestion that the present operations are <i>ultra vires</i> their existing powers.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, that is not the main point I want to make.  I am concerned that sufficient power should be given in this Bill in regard to the establishment and maintenance of local broadcasting services.  The Government's intentions should be clearly expressed either in this Bill or in a Bill to run concurrently with it in regard to the whole field of local broadcasting.  This applies now in regard to radio but may in the future apply to television.  What we are doing in this Bill is confirming the monopoly of RTE in local broadcasting and I do not agree with that.  On that basis I cannot accept this Bill.</P>
    <P>I fully appreciate that RTE have a role to play in local broadcasting but I do not in any circumstances accept that they are entitled to a monopoly in that area.  The Minister may in his reply indicate that he has a further Bill in mind. If my memory serves me correctly a Bill is mentioned on the Order Paper but it has not been circulated.  I even recall a promise made by the Taoiseach that a Bill in regard to local radio would be circulated in the autumn of this year.  In December 1979 we are discussing a Bill in which there is a provision which gives or confirms the monopoly to RTE in local broadcasting and we do not have any other provision or enactment before us dealing with this question.  In that situation we are confirming the monopoly of RTE in local broadcasting. That is neither in the interests of the country nor in the interests of RTE. RTE have a role to play in conjunction <Col N="659" /> with local communities and the provincial press, and I would envisage that the expertise and technical resources of RTE could be used for local broadcasting in conjunction with other bodies.  Yet, the thinking of the Government in this area seems to have stopped short of producing a Bill in regard to an independent broadcasting authority, in regard to dealing with the question of licences and so on.  The whole area will have to be discussed before final decisions are made on how local broadcasting should operate.</P>
    <P>This is the small technical amendment that the Minister referred to in his opening speech.  It is not a small technical amendment but a very serious matter which should not come into a Bill of this nature.  If the Government have a number of broadcasting Bills in mind, surely the question of RTE's situation in regard to local broadcasting should have been covered in those Bills and not in a money Bill which is to provide extra funds for capital purposes for RTE.  It seems that by this subterfuge it was hoped to confirm the RTE monopoly without any great fuss.  That is a wrong way of doing it and if there is to be full-scale local broadcasting, let us have the position and role of RTE fully discussed in an open manner and not with our hands tied, going into such a discussion on the basis of RTE starting not at the starting gate but at the finishing gate with a monopoly already in their hands.  We would be in the position of trying to chip away at something which had already been given to RTE.  A lot could be done by RTE along the lines I have suggested and I hope they will tackle the problems I have outlined in the immediate future, but at the same time I cannot accept the basis on which this Bill is presented to the House.</P>

      <P>Is Bille suimiúil é seo, ach níl mórán eolais ann i dtaobh polasaí an Rialtais faoi chraolachán.  Tá imní ormsa nár ghlac an tAire leis an leis atá sa Bhille chun polasaí an Rialtais a leagadh amach i dtaobh cúrsai craolacháin go ginearálta, ach go <Col N="660" /> háirthe maidir le craolachán áitiúil.  Ní thuigim cén fáth gur thug an tAire ráiteas chomh ghairid, nach bhfuil mórán céille ná eolais ann.  Maidir leis an airgead atá ag teastáil ó RTE, níl mise nó éinne eile sa Teach i gcoinne na suime sin, ach mar sin fhéin, is cúis imní dúinn go léir nach bhfuil deis againn polasaí an Rialtais a chloisint agus a phlé i nDáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>Because I had a personal interest in this over two years as spokesman on communications for the Fine Gael Party, I could not let the opportunity pass without making a brief contribution to this discussion.  I was flabbergasted at the brevity of the Minister's introductory speech.  While we do not oppose the money being sought, it is a substantial amount and we are entitled to expect the Minister at this stage, after two-and-a-half years in office, to be in a position to outline at length his ideas in relation to the whole question of national broadcasting and in relation to the very controversial issue of local broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister made brief reference to local radio in relation to amending the terms of reference of RTE. Our national broadcasting system is no better or worse than broadcasting systems in other countries.  One's opinion in relation to broadcasting services, whether television or radio, is coloured very much by one's attitude to life, one's interests and so on.  By and large RTE are doing a good job as the national broadcasting authority, given their restricted terms of reference.  Before I criticise RTE I must give credit where credit is due.  We certainly appreciate the tremendously successful manner in which RTE faced up to the unprecedented challenge of the recent historical Papal visit.  This situation presented our broadcasting authority with a job, the magnitude of which they never had to contend with before.  Great credit is due to them for the manner in which they handled it.  Irish people in the United Kingdom were loud in their praise of the manner in which the BBC dealt with the Pope's visit to Ireland.  It is only fair that we place on record our appreciation of the dignified and realistic <Col N="661" /> manner in which the BBC covered that visit.  That in no way detracts from the significent coverage by RTE on that historic occasion.</P>
    <P>I am interested in local radio.  Last March at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis I submitted a comprehensive policy document dealing with local broadcasting.  At the Jacob's Annual Awards the Taoiseach committed the Government to the concept of local broadcasting.  The expectations then raised by the Taoiseach should see a practical expression by the introduction of appropriate legislation.  We are now at the end of another year and there does not appear to have been any progress made in that direction.  The greatest defect in the Minister's speech is that he made no effort, good, bad or indifferent, to give us the slightest hint of his attitude or thinking on local broadcasting or when we might expect to see the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>In this Bill the Minister proposes an amendment in phraseology for the express purpose of enabling RTE to have a more flexible approach to local radio.  It was a pity he did not avail of this opportunity to expand that further and let us know what he has in mind in relation to local broadcasting.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of controversy about the pirate stations. Looking at today's paper I saw a heading that another pirate station had been hammered.  The Minister should face up to this situation.  So far the controversy has been black and white. Some people say local radio should be totally independent of RTE and others say it should be exclusively controlled by RTE.  There is a huge grey area between these two views.</P>
    <P>Over the last year and a half I prepared a policy document for this party and looked at these two issues. The facts are that we have unlicensed local radio stations.  They have pirate radio stations.  They have remained in business for the simple reason that there is a demand for this type of local broadcasting.  I am convinced that the type of local service they <Col N="662" /> provide is one for which there is a great demand.  It is enjoyed by many and is being well supported.  There is an urgent need to rationalise and regularise this chaotic situation.</P>
    <P>There must be some control over broadcasting.  I believe there should be an independent broadcasting authority, totally distinct from RTE but in which RTE should have participation.  In my home town, Limerick, there is an RTE studio with very good facilities and down the street there is an unlicensed radio station.  There should be some flexibility, and logic should dictate that there must be some way to combine the two.  The combinations possible are enormous.  I would be totally opposed to the Minister bringing in a Bill for the express purpose of banning and penalising the pirates. That is no solution.  Pirate stations are a fact of life and will not go away.  At the same time if we were to ban them, we would be depriving the people of a service they feel they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to bring in a comprehensive, logical, practical and realistic Bill which should take into account the existing situation and try to rationalise and regularise it with the ultimate objective of providing the people in all parts of Ireland with a local broadcasting service which would be enjoyable, educational, entertaining and which would have a local slant.</P>
    <P>This is the most important aspect of broadcasting and this problem will have to be tackled sooner or later.  As the Minister does not have a brief prepared to introduce a Bill, I cannot expect him to give a comprehensive reply on the Government's thinking on this matter, but it is not merely Government thinking we want; we want to know what action it is proposed to take to set up a local broadcasting system here.</P>
    <P>I rith mo thréimhse mar Aire na Gaeltachta, ó 1973 go 1977, bhí anbhaint agam le Radio na Gaeltachta.  Is minic a bhí agallamh agam le iriseóirí as Radio na Gaeltachta.  Ó am go ham nuair a bhíonn an deis agam éistím fós le Radio na Gaeltachta.  Níl aon amhras ar chor ar bith ach gur chabhraigh <Col N="663" /> Radio na Gaeltachta go mór le muintir na Gaeltachta, go háirithe chun leas mhuintir na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn agus chun leas na Gaeilge agus leas na teanga a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Radio na Gaeltachta agus an craolachán áitiúil, is féidir liom féachaint ar Radio na Gaeltachta mar saghas model local broadcasting system. Tugann sé seirbhís an-mhaith, ansuimiúil agus an-taitneamhach do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Is breá an rud do mhuintir na Gaeltachta bheith ag éisteacht gach oíche le nuacht as Dún na nGall, Gailleamh nó ceanntracha eile sa Ghaeltacht.  Sin é an saghas seirbhíse atá ag teastáil ó mhuintir na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Radio na Gaeltachta, tá súil agam go bhfuil Udarás na Gaeltachta le bunadh go luath.  Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an tAire le ócáid bunú Údarás nua na Gaeltachta chun féachaint isteach i gceist chraolachán Ghaelachta agus b'fhéidir an Ghaeilge a leathnú trí theilifís.</P>
    <P>You, Sir, will be interested in the point I am making as much of your county is in the Gaeltacht.  I am referring to the role Radio na Gaeltachta have played in the social, cultural and linguistic development of the Gaeltacht.  With the establishment of a new Gaeltacht authority I am posing the question that perhaps now might be a good time to look at the possibility, which has been the dream of all involved in the language and the development of the Gaeltacht, of establishing a Gaeltacht television service. There would be widespread support for this.  This may sound far-fetched but the basic structure is there through the radio station.  I would envisage that the establishment of a Gaeltacht television service would have a beneficial effect on the morale of the people and would make a practical contribution towards preserving the Gaeltacht, which is the tobar agus foinse, the source and fountain, of our language and culture. Side by side with Bord na Gaeltachta and Udarás na Gaeltachta the Government should look at the possibility of having a television service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> I should like to refer to the role of broadcasting in relation to education and the proceedings of Parliament.  I had the privilege of being involved in an organisation founded by a wonderful Irish priest, Muintir na Tíre.  Among the objectives of that organisation was the promotion of community development. There are practical examples of the successful application of this principle in many parts of the country.  One of the most fundamental pre-requisites for successful community development is adult education.  I should like to see our national broadcasting system playing a major and positive role in the field of adult education.  Some people will go further and say that we should have an open university concept.  This would be desirable but I am a realist in most things.  All over the civilised world there is a tremendous emphasis on adult or continuing education.  It is also called education for life but the Minister will know what I mean.  I had the privilege of officially opening the annual conference some years ago of Aontas, the national adult education movement and the then director general of RTE delivered an interesting address on this question.  The Minister should bear in mind the possibility of utilising the broadcasting service to promote adult education.</P>
    <P>I have spoken many times before in various debates on the question of broadcasting parliamentary proceedings. Many Deputies are interested in this and it leads to interesting debate.  I know that the possibility of live broadcast of the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad have been discussed by various parties but no progress has been made.  I know that there is mixed reaction in the UK to the experiment they are trying in the House of Commons.  In this age of high-powered communication live broadcasts of proceedings on special occasions such as Question Time, budget day and adjournment debates should be looked at in a more serious way than it has been in the past.</P>
    <P>On any debate dealing with broadcasting one programme that is always referred to is &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  This <Col N="665" /> programme, when the Dáil and Seanad are in session, gives a report of the proceedings.  It is an excellent programme; it is straightforward and concise.  I have never heard any Deputy finding fault with the presentation.  That is the type of serious, realistic, responsible approach I should like to see developed and expanded.  I remember that Deputy Briscoe and many others advocated the possibility of transmitting &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; on television or allocating it more time.  I hope that before long we will have an opportunity for a comprehensive debate on the evolution and development of our broadcasting services and a more in-depth debate on the important topic of local radio.</P>

      <P>In regard to community radio stations we are all aware of the uproar there has been as far as pirate stations are concerned.  I am disappointed that no direct mention has been made in the Bill of legalising these proposed new community radios.  The Minister is coming to the stage where he will have to make a decision on whether we will have different county radio stations.</P>
      <P>Radio 2 has been a tremendous success.  It is catering mainly for the younger generation and we have a very big young generation at present.  No matter what house one goes into where the radio is turned on, Radio 2 seems to be catching on in tremendous strides.  They are putting on a first-class show and most of their programmes are worth listening to.  For that reason the Minister should consider diversifying even further into community stations, county stations or whatever.  If we are serious about banning pirate radio stations we must legalise some alternative. If we are going to legalise the county type station the community must certainly have a say in it.  So should the local press and RTE.  At this point the Minister must decide what share RTE will have in the local station.  I take it he has given serious thought to this matter but that no decision has been taken yet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> We shall be introducing a Bill very shortly dealing with local radio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to hear that.  What the Minister says is that they intend to make local radio a proper legal service probably on a county basis.  I am delighted to hear the Minister make that commitment and I welcome it.  The three elements must be taken into consideration, the local people, the local press and RTE.  The only source of finance to run the station that I see for them is, first, if they get a grant from the Department or through RTE and, second, from advertising. Much advertising could be got on a local basis, perhaps from supermarkets, dancehalls, fairs and marts.  In his new Bill the Minister should also provide that the local radio station may collect revenue from such sources.  I mention the local press because I think that if the radio is effective and properly run the local press may lose revenue and it is only right that they should have a say.</P>
      <P>At present in Northern Ireland there are Radio Ulster and Radio Derry and in some areas around the Border, particularly if I may speak for Donegal, it is feared that some of the advertising that could be secured on this side by, say, a local Donegal station will, if we do not hurry up with our own station go into places like Derry.  The quicker the project is proceeded with and the sooner the community have a voice in running these stations the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have three Gaeltacht radio stations at present, one in Kerry, one in Galway and one in Donegal.  I understand the Mayo Gaeltacht also want a Gaeltacht radio station.  I welcome this. Where Irish is the native tongue the people should have their own radio station. Certainly Radio na Gaeltachta is listened to in Donegal by the Gaeltacht population in the area.  In travelling through the constituency it is amazing how many people tell me that they have heard certain items on Radio na <Col N="667" /> Gaeltachta.  Their success is probably limited because the Gaeltacht areas are limited.  Even in Connemara probably not everybody speaks Irish but my point is that those who do speak Irish should be entitled to have their own radio station in the area.  In mentioning Mayo I wonder if it is possible that the Galway Gaeltacht radio station would have a sufficiently high frequency to enable the people in Mayo to listen to it.  If so, that could be considered in the short term. Serious consideration should be given to the Mayo Gaeltacht having its own Gaeltacht station.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the part radio plays in regard to the national language I also have some criticism as regards Radio 1 and Radio 2&mdash;thought not so much in the latter case.  I know that there is much pressure on the RTE Authority to have more Irish spoken on Radio I and to an extent on Radio 2.  I think we may go too far in that way.  After all, leaving out the Gaeltacht areas, the greater percentage of people who do not speak Irish feel that the national station should have 90 per cent of their programmes in English. Some people complain of a little too much Irish on the national programmes that they cannot follow.  The RTE Authority have to walk a tightrope; they have a very difficult task here.  They want to please a small minority and at the same time they want the majority of the community to listen to their programmes.  One of the reasons why Radio 2 is doing so well is that Radio 1 has reverted to many of the Irish and programmes and people hear Irish and turn off to Radio 2.  That is not the main reason, which I think is that Radio 2 is playing more music in the younger style and have caught on with the younger community.  Also Radio 2 seems to provide fewer Gaeltacht programmes but it is inclined to have a little Irish and also bring in an English version of it which is a good thing.  If the whole conversation is not in Irish, that is fine; people will accept something spoken in Irish with a follow through in English.  That is doing a lot of good.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="668" /> I know that the Gaeltacht authorities are advertising for more people to speak on our national heritage.  In this regard we have some very good programmes both on RTE 1 and RTE 2 and also on the radio on traditional music.  Perhaps RTE 1 could do more outside programmes taking in different areas and bringing home to people the value of our traditional music particularly in the west of Ireland, Clare, Galway and parts of Donegal where such music is very popular.</P>
    <P>I doubt if Radio 1 and Radio 2 are heard all over Northern Ireland and the same applies to television.  If so I think that even in the farthest parts of the country the Northern Ireland people should be able to receive all our national programmes just as we in Donegal&mdash;and probably in Cavan and Monaghan&mdash;are able to receive five stations RTE 1, RTE 2, BBC 1, BBC 2 and UTV.  Even in County Antrim and in the most distant areas the people should be able to receive all the Irish programmes we have to offer.  Probably the greatest fault in our divided communities today is lack of education.  Probably the Northern Ireland people do not understand the southern Ireland people because of the way in which they have been educated.  I think the Minister in charge of communications has a responsibility to see that we try to educate these people through our own media.  I believe that if they see a good deal of our programmes they will not be as embittered as they have been.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the news that the Minister is introducing a Bill to deal with community radio stations and I hope he will see that the local people and the local press have a big voice in this matter. It is also important that the knowhow should be supplied by RTE.  I trust the Minister will make it legal for these local stations to raise revenue in whatever way they can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Bill before the House there are a number of points that concern me.  I will deal with those in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> One of the main criticisms I have of our national television and radio service is that there is a serious lack of good investigative journalism at present.  The limited number of programmes on television at the moment lack teeth and strength and guts.  I say this without in any way detracting from some of the excellent journalists presently employed in RTE.  I do not wish to detract from their honesty, their integrity and their professionalism.  But it causes me some concern and worry that nowadays there is not the same type of programme that we witnessed in the past.</P>
    <P>There were a number of programmes that I, as an independent person watching television, consider had spirit and got results.  There was the programme on money lenders.  The people involved in that programme went out and researched that and subsequently there was an inquiry into it.  Our national television service should be involved in matters of that nature.  Another example is a programme on housing many years ago.  It was a thorough in-depth study.  It was excellent journalism.  I could give more examples but I do not want to labour the point.  That type of programme is necessary.</P>
    <P>Our national papers are making a reasonable effort to get underneath stories, to find out what is happening.  It appears that they have the blessing and the goodwill of their editors and the people in charge, the board of directors and so on.  This is as it should be, and the Minister would be the first to agree with me on that.  One must have good investigative teams who do not just accept at face value any items presented to them.</P>
    <P>Our television network was providing such a service.  I wonder why that has stopped?  Has there been, if not a direct order, a curtailment?  We lack that type of in-depth study, that going behind the scenes necessary to lead up to these stories.  It is necessary that the people involved in these programmes have the authority and the full backing of the RTE Authority and the Director General and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="670" /> Let us make no mistake about it: television is a mighty, important media. It is a mighty way of getting across facts, figures and stories and it is absolutely essential to have a return to this type of journalism in our national television stations. Programmes should be researched irrespective of who is going to be affected. The people involved should have their sleeves rolled up and be out there looking for the reasons behind particular events, because that is what television is about.  I am sure the Minister will tell me his views on this statement of mine here this afternoon, because it is important to have a return to the type of investigative journalism that we had in the past on our national television station.</P>
    <P>Like my colleagues on this side of the House, I am anxious to ensure that we have a proper broadcasting service to include local radio stations and whatever else follows from that.  RTE have done an excellent job in most respects.  They have acquitted themselves admirably, working in many instances with limited finances and against pressures from many sides.  They have worked well.  But we should have more local broadcasting services throughout the country.  I accept that there are difficulties.  I have heard the Director General and many senior people involved in broadcasting pointing out a lot of the difficulties.  There are areas with large populations, which is very convenient for advertisers who put in revenue so that a good service and excellent programmes can be provided in those areas; whereas, in smaller areas which are less densely populated, there is less incentive to advertise and therefore less revenue.  Advertisers are not going to spend money because such a station would not encompass a wide area or reach as many people, so that it is impossible for such stations to provide an adequate service.</P>
    <P>I accept that, but local radio stations should be set up wherever possible. Many of our local newspapers throughout the country are run by small companies, and a large number of these local radio stations could prove a success.  It is essential that these radio <Col N="671" /> stations be set up in local areas which have the network to provide such services. The Minister must agree that the staff and amenities to assimilate and distribute news are available and also the wherewithal, the capacity and the capability to organise such a broadcasting service which would be welcomed by everybody.  We need a positive statement from the Minister setting out his attitude in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>With some minor exceptions, our television network is providing an excellent service.  I have mentioned these exceptions already.  I would like to see the return of some of the types of programmes that I have referred to. Another point I wish to make is that at present there is not sufficient political discussion on our national television service. Over the years the number of programmes of a political nature has diminished considerably, particularly on television.  The radio does very frequently broadcast political programmes which in the main are excellent but we need more television programmes dealing with political affairs in this country. The Minister should discuss this with the three party Whips in conjunction with the Director General of RTE and members of the Authority.  The only time that we see anything of a political nature on television is prior to an election, be it a general election, a by-election, a European election or a local election and perhaps at a time of a major event such as a summit meeting or when the Taoiseach is returning from abroad. Other events which are of lesser importance should also be discussed and debated on radio and on television.  A number of programmes which are no longer broadcast should be restored. They gave people an insight into the policies of the various political parties and an indication of the ideas of Opposition parties and so on.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months too few programmes relating to agriculture have appeared on our national television network.  I have always had the height of <Col N="672" /> respect for the various television programmes relating to agriculture.  I have been in communication with members of the agricultural community who have expressed pleasure and satisfaction with these programmes.  They found them informative, educational and stimulating, and so did I.  The reduction in the number of such programmes is too great and I am very concerned about the difficulties that the programme <i>Landmark</i> has had to face over the last few months.  That programme should be restored and the number of programmes dealing with agriculture should be increased. I remember in particular programmes which dealt with farming trends in Continental countries which were most educational.  We must keep our agricultural community in touch with current events in Europe and throughout the world.  If we provide this type of educational programme under our national television broadcasting service we will be doing a good job for this country and one of vast importance in regard to employment, job financing and the whole structure of our economy. Because of this we in this House in conjunction with the RTE Authority have an obligation to provide agricultural programmes of the calibre of <i>Landmark</i> and of an even wider scope.  In every way possible we must encourage one of the most important industries of this country, that of agriculture.  I feel it is necessary to put the reservations that I have in regard to the Bill on the record of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad of the opportunity to discuss this Bill and to make a few short comments on my own views and those of my party on what ought to be contained in the Bill.  The Bill itself is very short.  The first thing that must be said is that it provides for an increase of £10 million to RTE for further capital development.  The section which provides for that is to be welcomed, not least by RTE themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Bill has an inherent flaw.  Possibly the Minister will be in a position to correct any misinterpretation or any misreading on my part of section <Col N="673" /> 3.  The Bill itself together with the provision of an increase in capital funds sets out to regularise an ambiguity which has arisen and has been there for some time with regard to RTE.  Under the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, there is no reference to local radio.</P>
    <P>To many people this omission suggests that the national broadcasting body should not become involved in local radio or do not have the right under the broadcasting Act of 1960 to become involved in that area, whereas the Authority have been involved in local radio.  The establishment of local radio in Cork and the establishment of Radio na Gaeltachta and of community radio, all under the aegis of the Authority, are examples of the involvement of the Authority in local radio, though this is something not provided for specifically in the 1960 Act.  Let me hasten to add that this particular type of operation is not excluded specifically either.</P>
    <P>Section 3 which to us embodies part of the problem concerning this Bill outlines the provision which gives the right to the existing Authority to seek the franchise to establish local radio.  The wording used is, &ldquo;may establish and maintain local broadcasting services&rdquo;. This subsection is likely to occasion dismay in the minds of many people who earlier this year interpreted the Taoiseach's reference to the establishment of local radio as a service that would be independent, free of any constraint and open to any individual or group to engage in on foot of having applied for and being granted a licence. The Minister may say that any such person is not excluded by reason of section 3 here but the fact is that the licensing authority will be the existing Authority. This legislation concerns the national character of RTE, an organisation which down through the years, perhaps by virtue of their nature, have expressed a high degree of centralisation which is tightly controlled and urban-centred.  One can read &ldquo;Dublin&rdquo; for urban in that case. This charge has been made in the past against RTE and the physical aspect of it can be upheld without any difficulty <Col N="674" /> whatever.  In Dublin there is the concentration of technology and skilled personnel. There is the centralisation of the service in Dublin.  Therefore, the whole area of broadcasting activity is centralised in the one spot and it is not possible to have that degree of centralisation without also having the price being paid by somebody and in this case that centralisation is at the expense of the regions within the country.</P>
    <P>The new service provided on the second radio channel is located in Dublin and there is no reason to believe but that the bulk of the current increase of £10 million will not be extended in the same fashion, thus consolidating and extending the Dublin ethos in broadcasting. In saying this I am not in any way criticising RTE who up to now have been providing a national service with a national character, a service that is excellent, expressing a degree of professionalism which I am sure is the envy of many other stations.  There are 2,000 employees based in one centre where the position with regard to anybody intending to contribute to broadcasting was to go physically to that centre except for the limited availability of studios in Cork, Waterford and Limerick.</P>
    <P>Let us consider this aspect of priorities which arises from the charge of centralised, Dublin-based broadcasting.  In the recent past we had an example of the kind of thinking that is prevalent within the Broadcasting Authority.  A programme which proved to be very vulnerable and which had been running for a number of years was taken off.  I refer to &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  The reasons given for this decision were justifiable but the input and the advice which was forthcoming from that section of the community which perhaps enjoyed the programme most&mdash;the farming community&mdash;was taken into consideration in regard to discontinuing the series.  At any rate, the hullabaloo created would seem to indicate that that advice had not been taken into account.  However, that is just one example of the kind of thinking that develops when a system is centralised <Col N="675" /> but operating on a national scale though not providing the kind of service which a very large sector of the community seem to look for and want.</P>
    <P>I may be accused of painting a very black-and-white kind of picture in relation to the situation.  Admittedly, there are many conflicting factors in this whole question.  The role of national broadcasting must be considered.  The problem here is, taking RTE as a whole, that we have a situation in which we are competing for listeners and viewers with outside agencies with much more powerful resources than we have, who can get our attention with high-powered productions. That complicates our approach because RTE must be seen to compete with that kind of competition.  The end result is that there is a dilution of the national character of presentations by RTE.  It is an issue that must be considered. I suppose it could be called &ldquo;the east coast syndrome&rdquo; so far as RTE television is concerned.  It is an issue that dictates to some degree&mdash;I maintain to a large degree&mdash;the kind of productions we are forced to present to the viewing and listening public.</P>
    <P>For a long time the charge has been made that in RTE there is a cultural elitism that propounds a theory that the community does not get what it wants but that it gets what an elite thinks it should get.  I do not go along with that theory.  If I were an employee of RTE I would not worry about that kind of charge.  In the personnel of any broadcasting system there are very creative people and, because of their high degree of creativity, they are of a volatile character and they will stand by their point of view.  Of course, they are in a very strong controlling position because they can put their finger on the switch and the public have to sit back and take what they get.</P>
    <P>I am not anti-culture but the fact is that such a charge has been made.  I do not think RTE have to refute it.  I think they should ignore it and go about their business in the same professional way that they have done in the past.  RTE <Col N="676" /> have chalked up some major achievements in their time.  We have come a long way since the establishment of our television station some years ago.  Now we have a second television station and a second national radio network.  One of the things that made me proud to be Irish was the comment I heard on other radio and television stations about the handling by RTE of the recent Papal visit.  RTE covered themselves in glory on that occasion and we owe them a great debt of gratitude for their presentation of events then.  RTE have nothing to be ashamed of; they can shrug off any charges made against them because they have shown their ability to do a major job, as evidenced during the Papal visit.</P>
    <P>However, the question of local radio must be looked at in a different context. The question should be asked: what is local radio and what should it provide? The logical answer is that local radio should be a reflection of the local community, warts and all&mdash;its problems, aims and aspirations.  It should also ensure a standard of professionalism worthy of the community and of the people involved in the local radio system&mdash;professionalism in technical matters and in the production, presentation and content of programmes.</P>
    <P>If local radio is to do that, the one factor that is of the utmost importance is freedom.  Freedom can take on many shades.  The freedom to which I refer could be said to be the freedom of expression which the local community has and which it would fight for if it were threatened.  Although I am not saying it will be the case, because of the provisions of section 3 of this Bill there could be constraints on local radio by an Authority who are far removed from the local community.  The late Seán Lemass said at one stage with regard to broadcasting that the system should be &ldquo;an arm of government&rdquo;.  Nothing in the recent history of RTE convinces me that that is the case.  Indeed, there have been fine examples where RTE proved to be anything but an arm of government.  I do not think the organisation should be an arm of government.  On many occasions <Col N="677" /> they have shown themselves to be a very independent institution.  They can stand on their own feet.</P>
    <P>They are also a very powerful institution and that power raises questions as to its use in the area of local radio.  Local radio itself could be, and hopefully will be, a powerful weapon, provided it has the confidence and the trust of the community. The only way it can establish that confidence and trust is through its freedom of expression, and by convincing the community that it is free and not constrained in any way in the content of its programmes or the presentation thereof.</P>
    <P>We have seen that same power expressed through the provincial newspapers which can be referred to justly as community papers.  That is what they really are.  I wish to refer briefly to this area of activity of local newspapers because it impinges very much on what I will have to say later concerning their involvement in local radio.  We were told in recent figures that outside Dublin 85 per cent of the people read the provincial press and 42 per cent read nothing else.  In other words, they do not read the daily morning papers. The local newspaper is the only source of knowledge which they avail of.  With roughly two million people picking up their provincial papers every week to read them, one can imagine the impact the provincial press has on the community at large.</P>
    <P>That degree of loyalty by a readership to a particular source of information did not just happen overnight.  It has come about through confidence being built up in the public mind in those publications. There is also reciprocity.  On the one hand there is a free flow of information and, in return, there is revenue to the papers in the form of advertising.  There is a mutually rewarding service which is free of any restrictions, and doing a very fine job.</P>
    <P>Having said all that about the provincial press, due to this Bill a fear arises that there may be a distinct possibility that we are sounding the death knell not of all of these papers&mdash;that would be an <Col N="678" /> exaggerated statement&mdash;but of some of them.  At the moment we are aware of the economic recession.  Many of these papers are facing economic problems because of a lack of advertising revenue. I do not think this Bill will allay the fears of many of them concerning their survival.</P>
    <P>The life blood of a newspaper, provincial or national, is its advertising revenue.  Am I to understand that RTE may now encroach upon this source of revenue?  Am I to understand that RTE may be fishing in the same over-fished pool on which the local papers are totally dependent for their survival?  To make things worse, are they fishing with a very preferential bait because of the preferential treatment which they will get over the ordinary local newspapers in relation to VAT?</P>
    <P>These are matters which may never arise, but this Bill may provide the atmosphere and the framework in which these circumstances could arise.  Members of this House have a vested interest in ensuring that anything that threatens the survival of the provincial press is considered very carefully and discarded in the end.  As politicians, and particularly in rural Ireland, we are very conscious of the service the local press provides day in, day out, week in, week out.</P>
    <P>The idea that the national Broadcasting Authority may be given&mdash;and I emphasise the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;&mdash;the right to move into this source of revenue, which up to now was the preserve of provincial publications, should be taken seriously by the Minister.  The sudden obliteration of that source of revenue obviously would have disastrous effects on them.</P>
    <P>Have RTE a role to play in local radio?  Emphatically it must be stated that they have a very definite role to play, a very constructive role, an essential role, but that role ought to be in partnership with the private bodies in the information business, the local newspapers.  They have the personnel trained to collect news items.  They have not got the personnel to present radio news or features.  They have not got the technological expertise to do so.  In <Col N="679" /> partnership with this pool of resources which we have at the moment, RTE could provide a very fine local radio service.</P>
    <P>Let RTE be there to advise, to provide the technology, to provide the technical expertise, the presentation, the editing and the studio.  Even that short list would be a very large input on their part. Would that justify them in having control? I do not think it would, and I do not think RTE would demand that they should have absolute control over what went out on the airwaves on local radio.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned very specialised fields of activity and technology. Definitely they have an input there and without them I do not think the system could work.  I want to refer to an extreme case of what could happen.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, conscious of the special needs of the physically disabled in Ireland and the present discrimination practised against them especially in relation to employment, social services, housing and other facilities for their welfare, calls on the Government to take immediate steps to improve the quality of life for disabled persons in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The purpose of tabling this motion is to highlight the present discrimination practised against the physically disabled and to propose measures and policies which would establish the rights of the disabled in Irish society and to demand that the Government improve the quality of life for those people by taking immediate action on the proposals which will be made tonight on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will not be enough to highlight the problems, propose solutions and make promises.  We must use the opportunity presented by this debate to commit the Dáil to the introduction of a Disabled <Col N="680" /> Persons Bill, which will enshrine the rights of the physically handicapped in law, their rights of access to the environment, their right to employment, housing and other social services, their right to proper treatment in homes and institutions. We will be seeking those things. We feel they should be enshrined in law.</P>
    <P>The physically disabled in this country have been fobbed off with promises of action from successive Governments. They now want a charter of rights enshrined in law so that they will no longer have to rely, as in the past, on the goodwill of central government and local authorities to implement changes as they see fit.  I envisage a Disabled Persons Bill as the only logical outcome of this debate.  It is the only initiative which will put an end to the procrastination which has masqueraded as policy for the disabled over the years.</P>
    <P>In the debate this evening, on behalf of the Labour Party I hope to highlight the discrimination faced by disabled people in terms of accessibility to the environment, employment, housing, health welfare and education.  It can be seen from this list that the rights of the disabled directly affect four Government Departments.  I am sorry that the four Ministers representing those Departments are not present tonight to listen to this debate.</P>
    <P>Before I review the discrimination practised against the disabled in those areas, I would like to make a few general points.  Although I will be critical of the Government in a number of areas and will be demanding action on behalf of my party on a number of points, I accept that the failure to establish the rights of the physically handicapped in Ireland is shared by a number of successive Governments.  We all share the guilt.  We have all failed to muster the political will which would enable the financial resources and the policies to be brought forward.  I remember tabling a Disabled Persons Bill in 1972, the purpose of which was to outline the points I am discussing here tonight.  It remained on the Order Paper for more than four years without even being given the courtesy of <Col N="681" /> a First Reading.  The policy of procastination is a long-standing one.</P>
    <P>Another general point I wish to make is that it has often been said that implementing a charter of rights for the disabled is in some sense impractical, given their supposedly small numbers when compared with the population as a whole.  This section was reflected in the Seanad Debate on the disabled last November when the Minister of State, in Volume 90, column 155, said:</P>
    <P>To put the whole issue into perspective one must consider first the scale of the problem&mdash;only about one in 2,000 of our population is confined to a wheelchair.</P>
    <P>He also referred to the costs involved and other urgent demands on State resources.</P>
    <P>The first point to be made here is that human rights is not a numbers game.  It is a prescription for the oppression of any minority in our society to maintain that the rights of our disabled citizens will be respected only in proportion to the percentage of our total population they comprise.  Every disabled person in Ireland has human rights as an individual not as a group.  Every disabled person would not have to be a member of a majority group in our society to claim them.</P>
    <P>Even leaving aside this argument, one must realise that tens of thousands of people other than those confined to wheelchairs are in some sense handicapped by an environment which is hostile to human needs.  The elderly are impeded by high kerbs, steep stairways and inaccessible public transport.  More than 345,000 people are over the age of 65 years.  All of those people are handicapped by inaccessible environments.  There are 6,000 blind, more than 2,000 have multiple sclerosis, 3,000 people have cerebral palsy, 3,500 people suffer from the after-effects of polio and 14,000 have epilepsy.  I could go on and on with the figures.  The people with heart and respiratory diseases are also handicapped by a hostile environment.  We cannot talk in terms of numbers alone.  It is no <Col N="682" /> exaggeration to say that a quarter of our population are adversely affected by the present inaccessible state of our environment. When we talk about taking measures to help the handicapped we are talking about taking measures to help ourselves.  We will all get old, become more and more dependent on the environment and we will want to ensure that it is sympathetic to our needs when they arise.</P>
    <P>Another point I wish to make is in regard to the United Nations declaration on the rights of the handicapped person passed in 1975.  This declaration sets out the rights of disabled people to dignity and basic human rights, proper social services, employment and accessible environment. Article 13 of this declaration states that disabled persons, their families and communities shall be fully informed by all appropriate means of the rights contained in this declaration.  In reply to a question of mine, No. 388, on what steps the Government are taking to publicise this declaration the Minister for Foreign Affairs replied as follows:</P>
    <P>The terms of this declaration have been brought to the attention of the main public bodies concerned with the provision of health services in Ireland. As the Deputy may be aware, 1981 has been designated the International Year of Disabled Persons and I understand that preliminary consideration is being given in the Department of Health to the measures which it will be appropriate to take on behalf of the disabled in that year.  The sentiments and aims of the declaration will be borne in mind in determining these measures.</P>
    <P>The terms of the declaration are made known to Government agencies but not to handicapped people.  We can always hope that in 1981 the Government will take appropriate measures with regard to the declaration.  This is a ludicrous answer and is an indication of the total lack of information provided to the disabled in regard to their rights.</P>
    <P>A booklet entitled Aid for the Disabled was produced in 1973.  It has yet to be updated.  When my office contacted <Col N="683" /> the Department of the Environment and asked for a copy, the answer was that nobody had ever heard of it.  This is it, and it was produced by the Department of Local Government in 1973. They said that it must have something to do with the Department of Health.  As it took them three days to locate a copy of the booklet, one can only imagine the difficulties faced by the handicapped in trying to get information on their entitlements. The most basic right of the disabled is the right to information.  The State must institute a policy of actively informing the disabled of their rights. The disabled should not have to seek the information.</P>
    <P>How can the Minister inform the disabled of the services for which they are eligible and how can he plan their social, medical and emotional needs when he does not know how many disabled persons there are in each local authority and health board area?  At a time when we can accurately enumerate the number of sheep and cattle in the country as well as the number of what we call illegitimate births, it is outrageous that no one can say with certainty how many handicapped citizens we have.  There should be a statutory obligation on local authorities and health boards to maintain a register of disabled persons so that their needs can be planned.</P>
    <P>In this motion we refer to discrimination. What we mean is that the lack of initiative and concern has resulted in a situation whereby the handicapped are isolated from society, unable to participate in normal activities due to our hostile physical environment, an inflexible educational system, the refusal of public and private employers to adapt their working environments and an inadequate range of State support services. If our political leaders treated a religious or political minority in the same way in which the handicapped are treated there would be an international outcry and Ireland would be pilloried in the eyes of the world.</P>
    <P>A policy of apartheid is practised against the disabled, a policy which <Col N="684" /> isolates them from so-called normal citizens.  This policy relegates them to the status of second-class citizens and is most apparent in the inaccessibility of our environment.  Can one imagine what it must be like to be unable to enter the majority of cinemas, shops and public buildings and to be unable to find a public toilet that has been adapted for use by the disabled?  Can one imagine what it must be like to be unable to use public transport, to be unable to travel through the streets in a wheelchair? Whatever the frustration, pain and anguish that is caused, the end result is that there are so many obstacles to handicapped persons in our environment that our cities have become no-go areas for them.</P>
    <P>Even the Minister for the Environment has been unable to estimate the number of buildings owned by the Government and local authorities which are presently accessible to the disabled. He fails to see the value of naming a date by which all such buildings will be accessible to the disabled.  He says he lacks the necessary power to implement such a policy.  On 31 October I asked the Minister for the Environment the percentage of all buildings occupied by Government Departments, local authorities and other State bodies which are fully accessible to the physically handicapped and if he would declare a date by which all such buildings would be made so.  His answer was that the information requested in the first part of the question was not available and that a declaration on the lines suggested in the second part of the question would serve no useful purpose in the absence of powers to give practical effect to it. Where is the political will to cope with the problem?  If the Government are unwilling to act, how can we expect action from the private sector?  All we can expect from the private sector is apathy and procrastination.</P>
    <P>In regard to public buildings owned by private individuals, the Minister points to proposed building regulations which will make all future buildings accessible to the physically handicapped. <Col N="685" /> These building regulations have been in the planning stages for years.  In November 1976 it was announced that submissions would be received up to May of that year.  It is now three years later and the regulations are still being prepared. Local authorities have failed miserably to enforce a policy of access for the disabled at the planning stage of new buildings which are open to the public. The Minister for the Environment keeps saying that he is encouraging local authorities to use their powers and their influence.  Encouragement is no substitute for a statutory obligation.  Until new building regulations are introduced and proven to be effective there should be an obligation spelled out in law which would force local authorities to make accessible all public buildings under their control and to do everything in their power to make accessible existing shops, cinemas, theatres and churches.</P>
    <P>Public transport is no better.  We have purchased an executive jet to facilitate the travel to Europe of Government Ministers and at the same time deny full free travel facilities on public transport to many handicapped persons.  Many of those who enjoy the privilege cannot avail of it because our buses and trains are inaccessible to them.  CIE have no plan to make public transport accessible to the handicapped.  I wrote to them in relation to this matter but did not receive a reply.  In the US and in most European countries arrangements have been made to make public transport accessible to the disabled.  The scheme for disabled drivers is encountering bureaucratic delays on the qualification that the car must be necessary for work.  This qualification creates a serious Catch 22 situation for the disabled.  As one disabled group said: &ldquo;No job, no car; no car, no job&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What must we do to make our environment accessible?  The Government must name a date by which all existing public buildings owned by the State will be adapted for access by the disabled. With 90,000 unemployed, a massive public works programme could be undertaken to achieve this.  It has taken 11 <Col N="686" /> years to get a ramp built at Leinster House, which is an indication of the kind of procrastination which must be brought to a halt if the disabled are to have access to post offices, social welfare Departments, employment exchanges and so on.  The Government should make grants available for the adaptation of existing buildings owned by private individuals.  They should set a deadline after which no grants will be given and on which all State support will be cut off from the company that owns a public premises which is not accessible to the disabled.</P>
    <P>CIE must produce a plan to make public transport accessible.  In reply to a question of mine the Minister for Transport and Power said that he had no official function in the matter.  That is not good enough.  His Department should provide the lead by adapting public transport for use by the disabled. The job qualification under the scheme for disabled drivers should be immediately dropped and the red tape blocking its implementation must be removed.</P>
    <P>With regard to employment of the disabled, a survey undertaken by the Irish Wheelchair Association some years ago proved very interesting.  That survey, by Pauline Faughnan, showed that more than 90 per cent of the members of that association were unable to obtain a job in open employment and only 10 per cent were able to find employment in sheltered workshops.  That position is particularly alarming with the younger members of that association with more than half classified as nearly or fully independent. However, two-thirds of them remained unemployed.  This scandal of chronic unemployment among the handicapped is another depressing instance of how they are being denied their basic rights as citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>Most depressing of all is the failure of the State to take a lead in employing the handicapped.  The 3 per cent quota system introduced in May 1977 appears to be in a shambles.  The Minister is unable to say how many have been hired under the scheme, the percentage of <Col N="687" /> workers in the public service who are handicapped or whether deadlines set up for the programme will definitely be met. The Minister for Labour, in his reply given to me on 31 October in answer to Question No. 405 stated:</P>
    <P>(b)  It is not possible to give the percentage of handicapped people now employed in the public sector as separate statistics of such persons are not compiled.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent quota should mean at least 6,000 jobs, excluding the Defence Forces.  Yet all the Minister can report is that surveys have taken place of the people who might be employed.  The National Rehabilitation Board, who were commissioned by the interdepartmental committee to produce this report, presented it on 30 October. When will this be made public?  The Minister should come forward with this information.  The report was presented to him on 30 October and, as far as I know, the scheme is not working.  We have a right to know why.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, this Minister is not the one involved.  We should have four Ministers here tonight because this matter concerns all of them. On 31 October I asked the Minister for Labour the progress to date in implementing the employment quota for handicapped persons in the public sector including (a) the number of people employed under this scheme since May 1977, (b) the percentage of handicapped people now employed in the public sector and (c) whether the deadlines originally set for the programme will be met.  The Minister for Labour, in his reply, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  The National Rehabilitation Board, at the request of the interdepartmental committee which was set up to implement the scheme have carried out a survey of a number of Government Departments and State <Col N="688" /> bodies to obtain a clear overall picture of the types of jobs into which eligible handicapped persons could be placed. The NRB is also arranging to provide a register of handicapped persons considered suitable and most likely to be placed successfully.</P>
    <P>The NRB survey report was received in my Department on 30 October and will be presented to the inter-departmental commitee in the next week or two.  I have made additional staff resources available to the committee to speed up the advancement of the quota scheme when they have considered the report.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is not possible to give the percentage of handicapped people now employed in the public sector as separate statistics of such persons are not compiled.</P>
    <P>(c)  Due to the complexities in the implementation of employment quotas of this nature which came to be realised only in the course of the committee's deliberations it may well be necessary to revise target dates, but I am hopeful that existing deadlines can be met.</P>
    <P>I would like to see that report.  The indications are that the scheme is not working and that the Government are not complying with their own regulations on this matter.  I do not wish to underestimate the problems faced by the administrators, but I believe the lack of a commitment given to the scheme is apparent and a very poor example for employers in the private sector.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of a policy of apartheid, of isolating physically handicapped people instead of adapting society to meet their needs.  AnCO training services are a good example.  Handicapped people should, wherever possible, train in an open environment.  Yet, in 1978 AnCO trained 16,268 people and only 224 of these were handicapped.  I obtained that information in the AnCO annual report. The Robins Report from the Department of Health stated that as many as 15,000 adult handicapped people could benefit from preparation and training for work.  The Minister for Labour said that <Col N="689" /> all new AnCO training centres will be constructed to accommodate the handicapped. Why can the existing structures not be adapted in a likewise fashion?  The sheltered workshops have made a great contribution to the disabled, but the rates of pay within these workshops should be increased.  The average wage is £5 to £12 per week.  In reply to a question of mine on 31 October the Minister for Health stated:</P>
    <P>They receive a weekly allowance ranging from £5 to £12, in addition to a weekly payment of £1.75 for each dependent child up to a maximum of three children.</P>
    <P>Taking that rate of pay with a social welfare benefit of £14.20, in some cases, a single person gets a weekly income of less than £27 to live on.  That is farcical. It simply is not enough and wages in workshops should be pegged to AnCO training rates at the very minimum.</P>
    <P>Strong incentives must be given to private employers to employ the disabled. This should involve the use of the stick as well as the carrot.  Tax concessions and remissions of social insurance contributions should be used as carrots but some form of stick should also be employed.  If a quota system in the private sector is unworkable, why not make all State aid conditional, or at the very least proportional, to the number of handicapped people employed by a firm and the efforts made to make the work place accessible?  Give the firms concerned the concessions I mentioned but also, if they do not co-operate, discontinue their grants.  The whole point is to create a society where the handicapped are treated like every other citizen.  Why not transfer the responsibility for the employment needs of the disabled from the Department of Health to the Department of Labour?  I am aware that that is contrary to the Robins Report from the Minister's Department, but it appears a more logical approach.  Those people are not sick; they just need work like thousands of others.  They should be helped by the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the <Col N="690" /> question of housing.  This is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and I regret that the Minister for Health has to listen to this part of my contribution. The housing needs of the disabled are subject to the willingness of local authorities to provide accommodation or grants for adaptations.  As far as adaptations are concerned, some local authorities are conscientious but many are not.  There were a total of 692 house adaptation grants, averaging £960 each, approved in 1978.  As far as I am aware, approval for grants is being delayed and adaptations can take up to two years to be completed, though the Minister for the Environment admits to having no available information.  On 20 November I asked the Minister for the Environment the average length of time taken by local authorities for house adaptations for the physically handicapped and if he was satisfied with the working of the grants scheme for the disabled.  The Minister told me that the information requested was not available in his Department. There should be a statutory obligation on local authorities to ascertain the housing needs of the disabled in their area.  Only by finding out the housing needs can one do anything about them. The Minister for the Environment has promised action but it will be more a request than an obligation.  That is not good enough because many local authorities are not anxious to co-operate.</P>
    <P>A certain percentage of local authority houses should be constructed for the disabled from the start.  In this way each new housing estate will have some provision for the disabled.  In Britain 15 per cent of all new public housing is constructed for wheelchair use and an even higher percentage is built to facilitate the general mobility of the disabled within the home environment. We have a long way to go, but we must do something positive about it.</P>
    <P>Surely our local authorities might show a bit of foresight in adopting a similar policy of building accessible housing from the start?  Not only would this benefit the physically handicapped, but other groups in our society, such as <Col N="691" /> the elderly, whose needs are not met by present house designs.  There was a recent conference in Dublin on Design for the Disabled.  I am not 100 per cent sure, but it may have been hosted by the National Rehabilitation Board.  This conference was a tremendous success and demonstrated how easily and inexpensively buildings can be designed or adapted to meet the needs of the disabled.  Expense is no longer an excuse.  What is needed is imagination and political will.</P>
    <P>A special housing list for the disabled should be created in each local authority area.  At present, some physically handicapped people are housed in totally unsuitable accommodation.  I know of one handicapped person living on the seventh floor in Ballymun, totally immobilised&mdash;imprisoned you might say, because there is no access outside that place.  That is the attitude which is adopted towards them.  A separate housing list is necessary, so that vacancies can be matched to these people's needs.  Housing aids for the disabled should not be confined to housing grants for adaptations. They should be eligible for special grants for purchasing their own homes from the design stage, so that builders can incorporate from the start the necessary features.  This would avoid many costly alterations in the future.</P>
    <P>Many disabled people spend their lives in homes and institutions.  Perhaps, one of the most vivid and scandalous examples of the second-class standards of disabled people is that they have no right to the disabled person's maintenance allowance while in institutions.  When I mentioned a case of a woman living in an institution, who had not one penny and no one to visit her, I was called a liar in this House for mentioning this fact. However, when I asked the Minister and the Deputy to look into the case, they conceded to me, in private, that I was right.  That disabled person had not one penny to her name; she could not buy a bottle of minerals at the end of the week. Living in institutions, they have no right to disabled person's allowance; it is purely an arbitrary thing.  This allowance <Col N="692" /> is paid directly to the institution and disabled persons in residence have no entitlement to pocket money, which is wrong.  In the Eastern Health Board area, the policy is to contact relatives of inmates to see if they can provide money before consideration is given to giving residents a weekly sum for purchasing small comforts such as minerals, newspapers and so on.  Such a policy amounts to an attack on the dignity of disabled people in institutional care. Also, such people are ineligible for the new mobility allowance of £3 a week to facilitate travel for those who cannot use public transport.  This is another example of discrimination practised against disabled persons living in homes and institutions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has agreed to run a pilot programme for some disabled people in institutions whereby they will be eligible for some form of mobility allowance.  I must congratulate him on this welcome development.  What he envisages is a block grant.  Again, the operating list would be arbitrary and not available as of right.  I would caution the Minister to be more flexible, rather than having it as a block grant.  These people should have a right to a weekly income as well as the mobility allowance, and also be represented on the boards of management of these institutions, so that their voices can be heard in how these homes are run.</P>
    <P>On the health and welfare front, there is a dire need to increase benefits, particularly in the light of soaring fuel costs. Disabled person's maintenance allowance, invalidity pension, and the allowance under the free electricity scheme should all be increased substantially in the next budget, so that disabled persons are able to survive the winter with some modicum of comfort.  Special attention should be paid to the delivery of fuel to the elderly and the disabled and those unable to fend for themselves in a panic situation, where those who wish to grab the most the quickest come out the best.</P>
    <P>Physically handicapped people should qualify for the medical card in their own <Col N="693" /> right, as well as for the telephone.  The limit imposed on their bus passes, preventing their use at peak hours by those disabled who are able to use public transport should be removed.  This is discriminating against them, because of the fact that many of them have to attend hospitals at early hours and the fact that the bus passes are not available to them as of right all the time is a discrimination against them.</P>
    <P>One other point I wish to mention, because it was a recommendation of the Central Remedial Clinic, Clontarf, is the question of day centres, for which there is an acute shortage for physically handicapped people.  Every community care director should be charged with ascertaining the number of physically handicapped in his area who could benefit from day care.  This is yet another instance where the registrar of disabled people would serve to facilitate planning. Once the demand for day care is quantified, facilities should be provided as a matter of urgency, including full transport facilities to and from the centre. By proposing an emergency programme for the provision of day care facilities, I am not attempting to burden the State with extra expenditure.  The State will actually save money by keeping people out of institutions, where the costs are highest.  Long stage residential care is also a priority.  Waiting lists for homes are lengthy.  Some physically handicapped people are being placed in psychiatric hospitals and homes for the aged because there is no other place to put them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  The short stay beds in residential institutions are also needed to care for handicapped children in the event of a family crisis, or to provide parents with a break from what is a very demanding responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In education every effort must be made to provide for physically handicapped children of normal intelligence in a normal school environment.  The present policy of isolating these children in <Col N="694" /> special schools is discriminating and is another instance of the apartheid mentality controlling our whole approach to the needs of the disabled.  On the question of educational establishments which are not making full facilities accessible to the physically handicapped, unless they decide to do this within a specified time the State should seek to withhold payment of grants.  Education for the handicapped means more than the provision of equal rights to quality education for handicapped children.  It means that architects, designers and builders and urban planners must all be educated in how to meet the needs of the physically disabled in society.  Those who build our environment must be shown how easy it is to build an open environment, accessible to all the population.  The planning needs of the disabled could constitute a required subject in the degree course for architects and planners.</P>
    <P>As I said, all the rights outlined in this debate should be enshrined in a Disabled Persons Bill.  Britain has a Disabled Persons Act dating back many years.  There should be statutory rights regarding information, housing, access to public buildings, and welfare services, and this could be incorporated in this Bill.  Such a proposal is by no means unrealistic.  The British have a Bill dating back to 1970. It is almost 1980 and we have done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The whole point is that debate and discussion about the needs of the handicapped are helpful, but promises of action are even more so.  The Government say they will establish a register of physically handicapped people.  They say new building regulations will be introduced to create proper access for disabled. They say full information will be made available to the disabled.  But a statutory obligation must be created to ensure that this and all future Governments will honour and protect the disabled in Irish society.</P>
    <P>We have depended very much on voluntary groups.  We have seen the great role they have played and are inclined to pat them on the back.  The danger is that this excuses the State from <Col N="695" /> its obligations.  If you say this, the Government condemn you, saying you are belittling the effort being made by these voluntary organisations, that they are doing a wonderful job.  Of course, they are; but we have to help them.  We cannot say: &ldquo;It is your job; it is your obligation&rdquo;.  We must say: &ldquo;We are here to help you more&rdquo;.  We must ensure that we do not let them bear the burdens themselves.  It is up to us as legislators to do so.  There is no reason why we cannot bring in a Disabled Persons Bill which would incorporate my proposal which will not burden the State with too much expenditure but would give them, as of right, the opportunity to serve in our community as equal citizens with the rest of us.  This is an obligation on us.  I hope that the Minister, on behalf of his colleagues, will make a declaration to this effect in this debate.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to say that I appreciate the fact that Deputy O'Connell, in moving the motion in the name of the Labour Party Members, has not approached the matter in any political way.  I intend to follow that line because I am sure he will agree with me that this is really not a matter for party politics.  It is something we should all attempt to discuss here in a calm and reasonable manner.  Indeed, it is <Col N="696" /> something on which we would all be agreed in so far as the objectives are concerned and the targets which should be achieved.  We might disagree on the emphasis placed in different areas or on the adequacy or otherwise of the resources being made available from time to time.  I do not intend to deal with this motion in any defensive way.  I shall talk about various things going on.  I hope to do so in a constructive manner.  I will not attempt to suggest that everything is as it should be.  But, when I talk about what is happening, I merely do so to inform the House as fully as possible and perhaps in the hope that we can, between us, agree on where the emphasis should be placed in the future.</P>
      <P>The first matter to which the motion draws our attention is responsibility for the disabled and the handicapped in our society.  At present that responsibility is divided among a number of Ministers.  I believe that co-operation and co-ordination between those Departments is the way to deal with the matter.  Suggestions have been made from time to time of a Minister for the Disabled.  On reflection it will be seen that that would not really be the best way to deal with the matter because such a Minister would be relying largely on going to other Departments trying to get things done.  It is better to place specific responsibility for a specific section of activity on a particular Minister and in that way ensure an overall satisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the point made by Deputy O'Connell about a Disabled Persons' Bill.  I would not be impressed with the efficacy of such a Bill.  I do not think it would really contribute greatly to the situation.  It might be a nice thing to have on the Statute Book.  But it is effort, activity, commitment and programmes that matter, not enshrining principles in legislation.  We have plenty of examples of things enshrined in legislation, when indeed the practice does not always measure up to the objectives or the principles laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell quoted with approval the British Act of 1970.  I do not think that Act, in itself, made any contribution <Col N="697" /> to the situation obtaining there. If one looks through that Act one finds the continuous usage of the phrase: &ldquo;make provision in so far as it is in the circumstances both practical and reasonable&rdquo;.  That fatal phrase recurs throughout the British Act.  Somebody some day might feel it desirable to have a Bill which would declare the rights of the disabled in statutory form but I would not afford it very high priority. Rather I would concentrate on getting on with the things we are trying to do.</P>
    <P>The principle I would put before the House is that the disabled person has a right to the full benefits of citizenship, to participate in the life of the community as fully as any other citizen to the extent that his or her disability permits&mdash;that the disabled person should be fully integrated into the community where possible.  This leads us immediately to a number of requirements, the first being to reassure the disabled person that he or she has this recognition in our community and providing them with a means of earning their livelihood to the greatest extent their physical circumstances permit.</P>
    <P>That is why I place very great importance on vocational rehabilitation, the provision of sheltered workshops and the training of the disabled to enable them take their place in the employment market.  I have made many speeches over the last two years pointing out that many disabled persons can do a job in the open community as effectively, and indeed in many cases more effectively, than their more fortunate brothers and sisters.  It is very important to realise that throughout the open employment market there is scope for suitably trained disabled persons.  I have appealed again and again to employers to consider employing disabled persons because they find that these people give as efficient, and very often more dedicated, service than others.</P>
    <P>We have been making some progress in providing new places for training and sheltered employment for the handicapped. The total number of places in community workshops catering for the <Col N="698" /> physically handicapped is now about 1,450.  In the last year or so ten new workshops have been established.  It is very encouraging to go and look at one of these workshops and see the level of efficiency being achieved there.  In most the atmosphere is congenial and encouraging. Such workshops as are being provided are doing a wonderful job.  The trouble is that we have not got more but we are proceeding with them.  One of my most constantly recurring tasks is the opening of one of these workshops in different parts of the country.  Fourteen additional placement officers and 16 additional youth employment officers have been sanctioned by the National Rehabilitation Board.  The NRB and their organisation are under review.  We have a consultative report under consideration and we are endeavouring to see that the NRB are expanded and developed to ensure that they meet their serious obligations to the disabled.</P>
    <P>Allowances and conditions for trainees in the special training centres and for sheltered workers were mentioned by Deputy O'Connell.  I recognise that the situation there is not satisfactory, but I allocated additional funds and as a result the NRB have been able to increase the allowances payable.  With the disabled allowance plus the amount being paid in the form of remuneration, a married man with three children can now take home between £51 and £56 per week and a single person can take home £26 or £27 per week.  I know it is not adequate, but at least it is an improvement.</P>
    <P>Allied to that is the question of the allowances paid to persons in residential institutions.  This is a matter of fairly general application.  I have initiated a survey of what is paid throughout these institutions and when I get the information I will see that the allowance is rationalised and that the same amount is paid in the different institutions.  It varies greatly at the moment; in some places it is reasonably adequate and in others it is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to information about the disabled and mentioned, <Col N="699" /> for instance, day centres.  There is no doubt that we need them and there is talk about a day centre in Clontarf by the Irish Wheelchair Association.  It is quite clear that in heavily populated urban areas day centres are necessary, but whether they are needed outside those areas is a question which must be looked into.  We cannot take firm decisions on the structure of day centres throughout the community until we know more about how many disabled people there are.  Deputies will know that a survey on that is also under way.  The health boards, the NRB and the Medico-Social Research Board are combining to produce a register of the physically disabled, giving the numbers and telling the extent of the disability, the requirements and so on.  That is a very basic thing.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that we cannot have effective planning and cannot proceed with a programme of day centres until we know the extent of the disabled population, not just the numbers but the form of their disability.  I am anxious that the compiling of that register be completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The situation in residential care needs to be looked at and I have promised the representatives of the disabled that this will be done.  Nobody is satisfied with the situation in the residential care institutions. A group of disabled people suggested that we should set up a working party to look into the whole situation of residential care, but we decided in the end that a much more informal type of review would be quicker and more effective. We are getting on with that.  Allied to that is the question of personal allowances paid to persons in residential care, the type of institution it should be, the openness of the institution and indeed the extent to which the disabled residents should participate in the running and management of the institution.  I have no objection to bringing the disabled into the management of their institutions. The more the disabled persons fully participate in the running of the institution the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> On the question of day centres, other factors arise.  Deputy O'Connell touched on the question of where we should direct our resources, because resources will always be scarce and must be allocated to the best advantage.  More support in the home of the disabled person is a priority; and it is necessary to keep a balance between building up support services for the disabled in their own homes and allocating funds for day centres.  They are not necessarily mutually contradictory, but it is something which has to be planned with some care.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell mentioned the question of cars for the disabled.  We recently increased the grant from £500 to £1,000.  But the disabled, with some justification, pointed out that, whereas £500 some years ago was a fairly substantial grant for a car, £1,000 is not a great deal today.  However, we doubled the amount of the grant.  I came across the dilemma referred to by Deputy O'Connell, namely, where a person would only get a grant for a car if he had a job but could not get a job unless he had a car.  We should have broken through that knot, because although some health boards may not yet be fully alert to the situation, the situation is that a person who has a job is entitled to a grant&mdash;or a person who has the prospect of getting a job.  If that is not clear to the health boards I will make it clear to them, because the primary purpose of the grant for the motor car is to get a disabled person to work.  It can be a bit more flexible than that and I hope that the health boards will be more flexible in their administration of the scheme.  The grant can also be made available to a disabled person who, for instance, lives in a very isolated place, and health boards should sympathetically consider giving such people grants for an adapted type of car.</P>
    <P>My concern is primarily with the health aspects of the disabled.  Apart from the specific matters I have mentioned, like sheltered workshops and day care centres, the general community services are as important to the disabled as <Col N="701" /> they are to anybody else.  In that regard we have been improving the situation. The number of social workers employed directly by the health boards has been doubled over the past two years and public health nursing staffs have also been steadily increased and will increase until we get to the level of one per 2,616 of the population, which was recommended by the Working Party on Nurses Workload in 1975.  That ratio has already been reached in some areas. These are two very important general community services which are of importance to the disabled.</P>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board, on the question of buildings, recently brought out an excellent publication called <i>Access for the Disabled, Minimum Design Criteria.</i> That was for the information of architects, developers and others concerned with the planning of buildings.  It is a very good publication and I hope it will have a very beneficial effect.</P>
    <P>I am told that most of the training centres for architects, engineers, designers and planners have the needs of the disabled in their curricula.  I have a list here of the various regional colleges and schools of one sort or another and most of their curricula have that provision.  For instance, the Cork Regional Technical College have inserted the following requirements in the relevant syllabi for special facilities for disabled persons that in treating this syllabus, consideration should be given to the provision of special facilities for disabled persons.  This type of provision is included in most of the institutes training the planners and architects of the future.</P>
    <P>The assurance of employment of some sort is probably the greatest single demonstration we can make to the disabled person.  So far as the public service is concerned, that responsibility lies with the Minister for Labour.  Deputy O'Connell and other Deputies are familiar with the present situation.  The interdepartmental committee were set up to give effect to reaching the target of 3 per <Col N="702" /> cent in the public sector. They asked the rehabilitation board to carry out a survey for them in the light of their expert knowledge of the situation and to give them a report.  They got that report back and it is now up to the interdepartmental committee to proceed with the implementation of that objective of 3 per cent guided by the report of the National Rehabilitation Board.  I know I will be reflecting the views of everybody in this House when I convey to my colleague, the Minister for Labour, the fact that we would all like to see that target actively pursued and realised as quickly as possible. Special studies are being made in the Department of Labour and AnCO arising from that report.</P>
    <P>When we come to housing and buildings the situation is far from satisfactory.  The Office of Public Works accept their responsibility in this area. They say a great number of public buildings are unsuitable and no matter what they do they cannot adapt them, but they are doing what they can.  In future&mdash;and this is what is important&mdash;all new buildings will be suitably designed, providing ramps, making doors sufficiently wide, lowering door handles, special positioning of electricity sockets, domestic and sanitary fittings at lower levels, insulation measures and so on.  It is the intention that all new buildings will comply with the minimum needs for the disabled in their design and construction.</P>
    <P>On the question of housing, this is a matter for the local authorities.  The Minister for the Environment has constantly impressed on local authorities, the need for action in this area.  This is something which we should all undertake, particularly Deputies who are members of local authorities.  If there are local authorities in any area not measuring up to their responsibilities, the Deputy/councillor should take the lead and insist that his or her local authority do their part.  So far as I know, county councils or county borough corporations can pay up to two-thirds of the cost of adaptation and these grants are regarded as reasonably satisfactory.  It is really a <Col N="703" /> matter of all of us endeavouring to see that the local authorities meet their obligations so far as housing is concerned. Some of them are quite progressive and set aside in their housing schemes a proportion of accommodation for the disabled.  But the pressure has to be kept up by the Minister and by every one of us in our own spheres.</P>
    <P>Nineteen eighty-one will be the Year of the Disabled.  We are already preparing for it.  We will have a national programme for that year.  I will be consulting public and voluntary agencies about objectives and commitments so that we will be ready to make a good, substantial contribution.  Perhaps we need a national steering committee to co-ordinate the arrangements for the Year of the Disabled, but it will give us all an opportunity to look at progress and rededicate ourselves to the work that needs to be done to ensure that we discharge the responsibility which we have as a community and as a State to the disabled in our midst.</P>
    <P>I cannot follow Deputy O'Connell in all the points he made, because he succeeded in packing a good deal into 40 minutes.  One point which struck me and which we have in hands is the little booklet <i>Aids for the Disabled.</i> The Department have taken that over and are updating it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell raised another point and I will take note of it: it is very important that more information be given to the disabled.  Members of the community who are fortunate enough to be members of the Irish Wheelchair Association or any of the other groups get as much information, guidance and help as they need; but there is a case to be made for disseminating more information to the disabled members of our community.  I fully accept the United Nations principle that the disabled should be made aware of their rights.  We may, in view of the suggestion by Deputy O'Connell, expand the booklet and make it much more an information booklet than it was in the past.</P>
    <P>This is a non-political motion.  It is serving <Col N="704" /> to direct our attention to the different problems and to what still remains to be done.  Deputy O'Connell packed a great deal into his opening contribution and I am sure Deputy Boland will also be contributing.  The contributions made to this debate will be carefully considered and studied by me and my advisers. We are in touch with the organisations with special responsibility for the disabled.  We are aware of the needs and of where the gaps exist.  In so far as it is within our power and administrative capacity and within the financial resources available to us, we will continue to endeavour to improve the situation for the disabled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Article 3 of the United Nations Resolution 3447, Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons, sums up the debate adequately.  It states:</P>
      <P>Disabled persons have the inherent right to respect for their human dignity.  Disabled persons, whatever the origin, nature and seriousness of their handicaps and disabilities, have the same fundamental rights as their fellow-citizens of the same age, which implies first and foremost the right to enjoy a decent life, as normal and full as possible.</P>
      <P>That surely is what all of us in the legislature and in public life should be aiming towards.  There are other worthwhile objectives contained in the same declaration.</P>
      <P>Article 8 states:</P>
      <P>Disabled persons are entitled to have their special needs taken into consideration at all stages of economic and social planning.</P>
      <P>We need to examine our collective consciences as to whether or not that article is or has been respected in this country. Article 13, which the Minister might take specially into account, states:</P>
      <P>Disabled persons, their families and communities shall be fully informed, by all appropriate means, of the rights contained in this Declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="705" /> We have not been entirely successful in the implementation of that article.  Next year, as the Minister said, has been designated by the UN as the International Year of the Disabled.  Let us hope if we come to talk about the disabled at the end of 1980&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we will not have to reflect on the performance of the country in relation to that aim as an international year in the same way as we would have to speak about the sorry state of Ireland's performance in relation to the International Year of the Child. As regards the steering committee the Minister referred to, I could not help thinking that, if one were to reflect on the similar committee charged with implementing the success in this country of the International Year of the Child, one could only make the suggestion that it was a steering committee with square wheels.  The legislation promised during the year has not emerged.  When we look back on debates such as this, where everyone agrees that it is of a non-political nature and that something needs to be done and where everyone expresses the right sentiment, no real progress is made despite the passage of time.</P>
      <P>In the United States in 1973 a rehabilitation Act was passed and it was stated that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by reason of his handicap, be precluded from participating in, be denied benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any programme or activity receiving financial assistance.  It was not until 1977 that that was put into effect in the US, but when it was it was with a real sense of purpose with time limits being laid down in the public and private sector after which bodies would not receive any federal assistance if they had not complied with the strict guidelines in relation to the provision of services for the handicapped.  That kind of thing needs to be done here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the Minister's suggestion that there is not need for legislation.  There is <Col N="706" /> need for a commitment and for something to be done.  There is need for public bodies to be told that by a certain date they must achieve certain things and, if they do not, that they will suffer financially.  The private sector who are grant aided and provide facilities to which the public have a right of access must be told something similar.  Certain dates must be set down.  It is only by that kind of activity that there will be an improvement in trying to provide proper facilities for the disabled.  We can introduce whatever legislation we like, but if it is aspiration rather than direction and if there is not the threat of withdrawal of financial aid, it will not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>There are 3,500 to 4,000 people confined to wheelchairs.  They are the people we would normally regard as disabled. However, the disabled are a much wider category.  There are people suffering through disability at birth, illness, disease or through accident.  In the interesting and detailed submission made in 1977 by Mr. Liam Maguire, chairman of the Irish Wheelchair Association, it was stated that, apart from the people we think of as disabled, one in five in the community at some stage during his life will suffer some form of temporary disablement, whether it is through an accident, the breaking of a limb&mdash;from which he will recover but will have a temporary disablement, through temporary illness that can be controlled through medication&mdash;or old age.  He made the point that in research carried out in the Athens Centre of Ekistics it has been suggested that approximately 50 per cent of our population is handicapped by the environment of our human settlements.  That is no credit to our architects, planners or those in public life who accept the plans and submissions put forward.  It is not an outrageous suggestion that half the population suffer through the planning of the physical infrastructure which is provided for use in their day to day life.</P>
    <P>The survey which Deputy O'Connell referred to, carried out by the Irish Wheelchair Association, revealed some <Col N="707" /> interesting statistics.  Of the members surveyed 64.7 per cent wanted more social contact, social participation, holidays and the younger members wanted integration into youth activities.  Surely there is a need for those involved in providing facilities for youth clubs to encourage those running them and developing youth organisations to ensure that those permanently disabled within their community have facilities provided for them.  There is an obligation on those who provide grants for youth clubs and so on to see to it that the facilities are there and that clubs and organisations are encouraged to ensure that there is participation on the part of the physically disabled.  Approximately 18.4 per cent wanted work and only 10 per cent were employed in open employment, with 9.3 per cent in sheltered employment. This survey was carried out two years ago.  Some 15.5 per cent wanted assistance towards personal independence. That is an interesting figure because so many disabled people just want help to make themselves independent so that they will not need help.  That is an important and admirable aspiration on the part of so many of them, seeing that 8.4 per cent put home adaptation as their first priority.</P>
    <P>Another interesting aspect of the figures produced was that 18.6 per cent of the members of the Irish Wheelchair Association at the time were in institutional or residential homes, a very high proportion, higher, I suggest, than it need be if the awareness of the community generally were higher than it actually is.  If the facilities provided were better and if in a more positive way we assisted the physically permanently disabled to live a full life in the community, there is no need for almost one in five of the membership of that large organisation to be confined to institutions or residential homes.  But if they are to be so confined the point being made is valid: surely we are insulting their dignity and our own as fellow men if we deny so many of them a reasonable amount of money as pocket money.  To my shame <Col N="708" /> and amazement I discovered in the last few years that so many of these people who are being well cared for physically in permanent residential institutions receive no financial aid.  While being cared for as regards their bodily needs they are financially destitute.</P>
    <P>There is not much point in bringing such people on an outing or day trips and feeling that we have fulfilled our commitment to society when we have not an awareness of the fact that these people have no money to buy something either for themselves or their companions. The Minister's suggestion that this survey which is being carried out might bring about a rationalisation is an overdue and perhaps inadequate suggestion. We should ensure from the beginning of the next financial year, next month, that everybody confined to an institution gets enough money on a weekly basis to enjoy a decent standard of comfort.  That applies not only to physically disabled but to many other people who are confined in long term institutions and who are financially destitute.</P>
    <P>There is need for the Department of Education to ensure that much better facilities are provided in the normal school so that many of those who are partially physically disabled and virtually forced to go to special schools at present could be integrated with school children of a similar age and encouraged to participate in ordinary education in ordinary schools through such schools being properly designed and proper facilities provided in them from the outset. That is not being done at present.  As regards the special schools provided, we are not yet providing adequate facilities. Only yesterday I wrote to the Minister for Education about a constituent, a deaf child who is collected and brought to school for the day.  This five-year-old child is collected by bus at 7.30 in the morning and returned at 5.00 in the evening all through the winter.  We may think we are providing a great State service with a special school&mdash;and an excellent school in providing for the educational needs of that child&mdash;but a <Col N="709" /> very great burden is placed on him at that age and on his family.  This need not happen if we had more special buses and transport for that school.</P>
    <P>The time is overdue for the provision in public buildings, not by exhortation but by direction, of ramps and other special facilities to allow the permanently physically handicapped to use them without embarrassment and trouble for themselves, sanitary facilities, elimination of doors which are too narrow and light switches which are too high and so on.  We always give the example of the ramp we have provided here after 11 years.  What would one do in a wheelchair after getting into this House? If one wanted to get into this Chamber, one could avoid the front stairs but to get in by the doors here you would go down one flight of steps, up a flight of steps, along a corridor, through a door and up another flight of steps and you would get into the Chamber.  Unless you were lucky enough to become a Minister you would have to go up a flight of steps again to get into your seat.  And this is the House of Parliament.  Congratulations&mdash;after 11 years we provided one ramp beside the front door and we are talking of it ever since.  We have heard much about the aims and aspirations of the Office of Public Works but I would hate to be permanently physically disabled trying to get into that office in St. Stephen's Green which has as great a flight of steps as any public building in Dublin at its front entrance.</P>
    <P>I accept that many local authorities have been remiss in providing properly adapted local authority houses from the outset.  I believe part of the reason is that they have not done a survey of those on their housing waiting list who are confined to wheelchairs or permanently physically disabled.  Also many local authorities are far too slow in carrying out modifications of dwellings they allocate to physically disabled people whom they discover to be in need of rehousing.  Far too many local authorities are much too slow in processing special grants for the adaptation of <Col N="710" /> private houses.  There is a relatively generous special grant available now but because it is of an unusual nature, local authorities take an unusually long time to process such applications.  There is no need tor exhortation or legislation in that case but there is need for a direction from the Minister for the Environment telling them to send him a register of the permanently physically disabled on their housing waiting lists, giving details of the housing stock provided <i>ab initio</i> for such persons and details of the housing stock being converted for them, together with details of the grant applications received for adaptations from the physically disabled and how long it took to process those grants and to pay them.</P>
    <P>There is need for a Minister to direct local authorities to have street furniture redesigned, to have kerbing dished or ramped at corners, audio signals attached to traffic signals and special hearing facilities made available in public buildings for those whose hearing is impaired. Let us not suggest such things cannot be done on an immediate basis. In 1975 the Dutch Government allocated the equivalent at that time of £5 million for the conversion of public buildings in the manner I have suggested but it directed that all the money was to be spent and the facilities <i>in toto</i> provided by the end of 1976, less than two years.  If there is a will and a financial commitment and direction, it can be done.  Let us not have a debate on it at the end of 1981.  The point needs to be made that conversion of existing buildings is relatively costly while the redesign of buildings at planning stage is relatively a negligible cost.  Consequen tly, there is an obligation on all the schools of planning and architecture as from now to turn their minds in this direction.  I welcome the production of the publication by the National Rehabilitation Board on access for the disabled and minimum design criteria. This should help greatly.</P>
    <P>For years past I have been unsuccessfully chasing both the Minister for Health and the Minister for Tourism and Transport to find which, if either of <Col N="711" /> them, would accept the responsibility of the relatively simple conversion of public transport so as to make it easy of access for both permanently physically disabled and also those temporarily disabled, the elderly, the arthritic, the rheumatic and so on.  Neither Minister seemed able to bear the responsibility beyond suggesting that the question might better be directed to the other Minister.  Is it not time to have this relatively simple conversion done?  The Minister has other ways of getting here from Malahide but if he were to go to the railway station there&mdash;and he claims to be relatively fit&mdash;he would find difficulty in climbing into the train there with all his facilities. Perhaps he would stop to think for a moment how very difficult it must be for those in wheelchairs or on crutches to board an ordinary train at present.  The need for the conversion and adaptation of public transport generally become very much apparent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to thank the Minister for acceding to my request to defer this debate from last week to this week.  As the Minister is aware it was not possible for me to be here last week and, consequently, I appreciate his patience in allowing me to discuss the Estimates this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech was factual and detailed in so far as the additional moneys required are concerned but it lacked primarily any indication of educational policy.  There was not an indication of the direction of Government policy in the context of any of the subheads that have been put before us.  This is most unfortunate especially since the Minister has a sympathetic audience so <Col N="719" /> far as we on the Opposition benches are concerned.  We are anxious to support the Minister in terms of the additional moneys that may be required for education. However, we would question the direction and the quality, as it were, of the expenditure in this area.  Therefore, in discussing the various subheads I shall confine myself to questions of policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that the debate was confined to the theme of the Estimates and that, consequently, the question of policy was excluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that we cannot go outside the theme of the subheads before us but that does not preclude me from discussing the direction of the expenditure and the policy behind that direction.</P>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House.  I know there are other Estimates to be considered before the Christmas recess and, therefore, it would be unfair if other spokesmen were denied the opportunity of discussing the Estimates in which they have a particular interest.  I shall choose subheads from the various Supplementary Estimates and discuss within them certain points which must be discussed if we are to have a proper and on-going debate on education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Vote 30 I wish to discuss first the transport services under heading D.3 the little yellow buses that go up and down our country roads and which have become part of school life.  In this context I wish to discuss the Hyland Report which was initiated by the last Government and which reported in June last.  The Hyland Report on the school bus system suggested two basic changes.  One was the introduction of a flat charge of £21 per annum or 40p per week per pupil. That suggestion has caused considerable public discussion.  Indeed, the Minister for Education on 21 June last was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying that he could more or less make a commitment that the Government would not introduce <Col N="720" /> a levy on the users of the school transport system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Horgan is well capable of speaking on behalf of his party.  I am quite happy to confine myself to speak on behalf of my party.  I accept that commitment of the Minister for Education as genuine, as one which we can assume has some meaning.  I take it that there was consideration of the matter at Government level, that the question of charging for the little yellow bus does not arise in the foreseeable future and that it can be accepted that the recommendation of the Hyland Report in this matter has been rejected by all parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Hyland Report referred also to the anomaly concerning approximately 8,300 pupils who, because of the rationalisation scheme in respect of some schools, were allowed to use the school bus scheme to travel to other schools.  In other words, the principle of the nearest school has been disregarded where schools have been closed.  A question has been raised about the constitutionality of the practice.  I am not aware that the Minister has made any decision in regard to this matter nor am I aware that anyone intends to challenge it in the courts.  I suggest that the present situation where when a school closes the pupils are allowed the choice of another school is a reasonable and rational position and I do not think the constitutionality of it will be challenged. However, I should like the Minister to <Col N="721" /> make it clear that pupils will not be challenged with regard to their right to attend a school of their choice.</P>
    <P>Another aspect has arisen in relation to the school transport scheme which is perhaps of more significance to parliamentarians.  It relates to the rights of children whose parents are members of the minority religions to attend the schools of the parents' choice.  Obviously this is a difficult area but I think all governments have been generous in their attitude in wishing to abide by the wishes of such parents.  Therefore, I was sad to note that there has been a change in policy in respect of such children and that their choice of schools has been severely curtailed or eliminated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>I will refer to a letter from the CEO of the Dún Laoghaire VEC to a certain person.  It is dated 7 March.  The letter states: &ldquo;I will be unable as from 1 September next to grant free transport to any new entrant or transferee whose home is within three miles of either the Cabinteely Community School or the Ballinteer Comprehensive School&rdquo;.  This is a change of policy in respect of new entrants to the school system.  I think it is an attempt by <Col N="722" /> the administration&mdash;I am inclined to exclude the Minister; I think it was done behind his back and without his knowledge&mdash;to be niggardly in respect of the school bus service.</P>

      <P>I have had this position confirmed in the meantime and I am satisfied I can stand over the case.  The position now is that apparently where there is a community or comprehensive school within the acceptable radius which is available to the children they must attend such a school under the free transport system or not have the facility at all.  That is deplorable.</P>

      <P>Two weeks ago I had the position confirmed to me.  Severe reservations were expressed by the secondary education committees of the four minority religions about the multi-denominational concept of the community schools.  I was saddened to read that they were not consulted and were not invited to make submissions about the new structures of the deeds of trust of community schools.  That is serious.</P>

In view of the traditional attitude to the minority religions in respect of participation in our educational system, and the way in which they were treated in the development of community schools and the school transport service, there is a yawning gap between what they would wish to be the case and what is developing. What is now developing is not bigoted.  I could not call it bigoted.  It is penny pinching and narrow minded.  Those are the best descriptions of the attitude of the Department of Education to the parents of children belonging to minority religions.   They had been treated generously having regard to their minority position within the whole system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have two statutory bodies established by law dealing with higher education.  We have the Higher Education Authority established in 1971 to formulate policy in relation to the third level sector.  We have established quite separately and quite positively the National Council for Educational Awards.  The council deal with overall policy in relation to the non-university sector.  They deal with the regional colleges and the technological colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not particularly happy about the way in which some of our third level colleges are funded by the HEA and others are funded by the Department of Education, in particular the regional technical colleges and the Dublin technological colleges.  An overall structure is lacking and that is unfortunate. The difference in approach to financing these third level colleges, unofficially based on a kind of capitation system and half based on a block grant system, is wrong.  I would prefer to have a system under the one umbrella.  I would prefer all the funding for our third level institutions to come from the HEA.  That seems on balance to be the most logical approach to the third level sector.  It is not the present approach and the Minister has shied away from introducing a unified approach at least in respect of funding the third level sector of education. That is unfortunate.  The Minister had an opportunity to unify the system and to make it more sensible, but did not take it.  The present position where the regional and technical colleges do not get <Col N="726" /> their allocation until August, September or October and are not aware of their teacher allocation until September, October or November is very much against proper planning for any third level college.  Another example is the absolutely ridiculous letter which emanated from the Department either on 1 August or 31 August, seeking an increase&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>31 July possibly?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of 25 per cent in fees for new entrants to RTC's.  This direction from the Minister was considered by most boards of management of regional colleges some time in September. We considered it the day before the registration of students to the Waterford Regional Technical College.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On what date did they register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time in the middle of September, but that is not the real point.  The Minister may or may not be aware that boards of management of regional technical colleges generally set the fees for the following year in February.  They then proceed, as any rational board of management or educational authority would, to print their syllabus, circulate it and seek to attract students within the catchment area who would be suitable to the college. This all happens in the first quarter of the year.  Is it not rather ridiculous that the Department should come along at the commencement of the academic year and direct colleges to increase their fees by 25 per cent when already the syllabi are in circulation, the pupils interviewed, assessed, accepted or rejected?  Of course, colleges could not accede to the request.  They had more sense than to try to implement the ridiculous direction from the Department at the beginning of the academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the Department doing? What are the officials thinking of?  Their whole attitude to the non-university sector is pathetic.  They are looking at the third level sector as part of the second level sector.  I have a high regard, as the <Col N="727" /> Minister knows, for the non-university sector.  In 1978-79 the full-time student population of the Dublin technological colleges was 3,168 and in other RTC's throughout the country it was 4,828.</P>

    <P>I am worried about the attitude of the <Col N="728" /> Department to announcing the teacher allocation every year and to announcing the financial budget for each of the third level non-university institutes under whose umbrella these colleges come.  A new system will have to be adopted in relation to these non-university colleges. A three or five year budget system will have to be implemented where the colleges know exactly how much money they will have in five years time and in what direction they wish to go.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to say on behalf of my party that there is a direction at the third level but the Minister is not prepared to admit it because he was cowardly when he introduced the NCEA in respect of the rationalisation of the whole third level sector.  That is very unfortunate.  The Minister shirked from his opportunity to rationalise the system, the flow of funds and the flow of teachers to the non-university sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer back to Vote 35, subhead A.5, dealing with the general grant for a secular education in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.  The position in relation to Maynooth College is causing concern among many people involved in education.  There is nothing but goodwill <Col N="729" /> on the part of all politicians towards the involvement of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth in our education system and in relation to its role in the community. The recent Supreme Court decision confirming the dismissal of two lecturers from the college established that St. Patrick's is essentially a seminarian university. The HEA have not designated Maynooth College as an institute.  We have all defended university independence and autonomy.  Third level institutions and colleges should ensure freedom of thought and independence of expression.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that Cardinal Ó Fiaich has called for the establishment of St. Patrick's College as an independent university.  I support the Cardinal's request. Maynooth College should be as free and open in its appointments as our other universities and colleges.  I concede that there were peculiar circumstances surrounding the position of the two dismissed lecturers.  They had signed contracts and the court ruled that they were dismissed in accordance with the terms of their contracts.  Their dismissal raises a question whether Maynooth College is to remain a constituent college or should become an independent university.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's White Paper.  I recall him stating that the White Paper would be published on the last day of December 1979, but I do not think that we will see it then.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us the date on which we can expect publication of the White Paper.  We need the White Paper to indicate the direction in which the Government intend to go.</P>
    <P>The new fishery science course which it is proposed to establish in UCG in October 1980 was mentioned by Dr. Colm Ó Eocha, Uachtarán, Ollscoil na Gaillimhe.  The Minister has not confirmed that finance will be available for this course.  The Minister should take this opportunity to state that the establishment of the new course will become a reality next October.  I mention this matter because the future of the fishery industry is a controversial issue.  The Government's policy in relation to fisheries has <Col N="730" /> been severely criticised on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority stated that they would not recommend any substantial increase in fees for access to higher education. However, we have seen the first phase of a doubling of higher education fees for new entrants this year.  They were faced with a fee increase of 25 per cent, a shocking blow to them.  That increase was not compensated for by the eligibility limits for higher education grants and the grants were not increased to any extent in the current year.  If we look at the future of higher education we will see that the Government are not involved in providing the necessary third level places needed by the middle eighties to ensure that the participation rate within the age group is at a level equivalent to the participation rates achieved in other European countries. Frankly, I do not think we will be providing the 15,000 extra higher education places by 1981.</P>

      <P>We are making an <Col N="733" /> amount of headway in the non-university sector in providing third level places but we are not seriously tackling the problem of third level education to bring us into line with the rest of Europe and the United States.  We are lacking in our effort, appreciation and commitment to third level education.  I reject out of hand the objectives expressed in the White Paper that we should double our fees so as to establish an equitable flow of funds from participants in third level education.  Our participation rate in higher education grants is falling rather than rising.  I should like the Minister to refer to the percentage of students attending regional colleges and other non-university colleges and universities who enjoy a higher education grant.  The percentage in 1977 was 24 per cent in the university sector and 4 per cent in the non-university sector.  That ratio is most unsatisfactory and a cause for concern.</P>

The Minister seems to be shying away from the commitment in his party's manifesto of raising the eligibility limits and the level of grants to a realistic level.

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the Vocational Education Act of 1930&mdash;for the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's benefit this is subhead C&mdash;the vocational sector being one which is dear to all our hearts, I wonder about the efficiency of using the Act to administer the third-level sector. The Act allows for a sub-committee to administer the regional technical colleges.  Is the Minister happy with the structure or with the Dublin County Council's ability to service a number of community schools in the Dublin County Council area?  I doubt very much if there are enough people serving on the Dublin County Council to devote sufficient time to a wide-ranging number of community schools within their council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not county council; it is vocational committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, yes.  They come from the Dublin County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The members on the vocational educational committee can designate so many members from the county council and so many other members. To that extent, the Minister is technically correct.  However, the numbers serving on the county Dublin VEC are limited as to number, I am sure the Minister will agree.  I am asking the Minister if he is happy that this limited number of very enthusiastic and well-meaning people are in a position to serve on a rapidly increasing number of community school boards?  In respect of County Dublin, it raises the question of the efficiency of the system, under the VEC Act, of administering the community school policy as laid down.  This is obviously a non-political comment.  It is a matter of management and of finding the best way forward.  The Minister should address himself to this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise the matter of the appointment to the Dún Laoghaire Vocational Education Institute of a principal in the school of art.  I understand <Col N="736" /> that the interview and the appointment were carried out quite properly under the Department's memorandum V7.  The Minister queried the correctness of the appointment and stated that there would have to be some knowledge of art.  I understand now that the TUI branch in the area wishes the original appointment to be made.  Would the Minister state precedence for his interference with the committee's right to appoint qualified persons to posts within the system?  He may be trying to introduce an element of political bigotry into the appointment. Would he confine himself specifically to memorandum V7 and the rights of the committee in relation to the appointment of principals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be a point on that about which I did not hear the Deputy talking&mdash;in the general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no bones about the fact that the committee is, to a certain extent, dominated by my party.  It is all the worse that the Minister should try to interfere with a proper appointment, as he is a man of decent character, widely respected in teaching circles and educational sectors.  He is all the more open to criticism when he interferes with what is a relatively minor teaching or administrative appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair feels that the Deputy should not mention specific cases.  The grant, I presume, provides for the appointment of teachers but it is not correct, on a debate on supplementary estimates, to discuss the appointment of one particular teacher, or if a specific case is brought out.  It is not fair either to the teacher or anyone else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong this agony, beyond saying that, from my examination of that appointment, I am disappointed at the Minister's attitude to it.</P>
      <P>Finally, in relation to the vocational education heading, I refer to the community schools and, specifically, to the deeds of trust.  We all gave a large sigh of relief when there was general agreement on the deeds of trust.  It has been a long drawn out saga.  While I may have reservations about the deeds of trust and certainly feel that members of the minority religions are not getting a fair deal, nevertheless, I am, on balance, satisfied that this question has been resolved.  I have severe reservations about the multi-denominational aspect of community schools.  Recent statements by secondary education committees of four minority religions, among other educationalists of the minority persuasion, have come out quite severely in criticism of the position of the community schools.  Quite clearly, a shadow must be cast over this concept of the community school serving as a multi-denominational school.  This is a very serious matter for this House and for the Minister for Education.  I always thought that we listened fairly closely to the voice of minority people.  It appears now that the secondary education committee was not invited to give submissions on the community schools, which is serious and a matter of neglect, I presume, more than bigotry, on the part of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that my opinion is a balanced one and am happy that the episode is settled.  But I am most unhappy about the lack of consultation with the minority religions; I am most unhappy that they now clearly consider that community schools cannot be viewed as multi-denominational.  That is unfortunate and is something the Minister may well regret in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to see the continuance of secondary schools and I regret their closures. Not sufficient effort is being made, especially in city centres, to ensure that secondary schools whose pupil population is falling will be encouraged financially to remain in existence.  We have a special responsibility to inner-city areas, to deprived areas, very difficult to define but the Minister knows what I mean.  A special scheme should be introduced for a specific pupil-teacher ratio to ensure the implementation of an extra special capitation grant scheme to encourage those schools with a declining population to continue in existence.</P>

      <P>At the risk of being told I am something or other this evening, I must point out that the Deputy is discussing in depth policy matters.  We cannot discuss or go into policy matters completely on Supplementary Estimates.  That is all right on the major Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter to which I wished to refer is the lack of boards of management of secondary schools and the nonparticipation <Col N="739" /> of teachers on boards of management of primary schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has some responsibility for encouraging an equitable system of boards of management at both levels.</P>
      <P>In relation to Vote 31&mdash;Primary Education&mdash;I wish to refer to the question of aid towards the cost of school books, the subject of a Private Members' Motion in the House two weeks ago proposed by the Labour Party, and to reiterate the need for the establishment of a library system within schools to reduce the cost of school textbooks to parents.</P>
      <P>I wish also to refer to the matter of heating grants being made available to primary schools under the Vote for Primary Education.  I welcome the extra £1 million announced by the Minister.  I should like him to state quite categorically in this House that, if the winter becomes severe, if there is cause for the provision of extra moneys for the heating of schools, especially primary schools, he will not hesitate to provide the extra money, that he will give the House an assurance that there will be no question of interrupting the school year because of shortage of oil.  If he does allow the school year to be interrupted he will encounter very serious difficulties with the teacher's unions, very undesirable from the educational point of view.</P>
      <P>I should have liked to discuss the questions of apprenticeship and the structure of examinations, but I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who is looking at me with a hawk's eye, would rule me out of order and I shall refrain from so doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few specific remarks before commencing my general approach to these Supplementary Estimates.  Of all the issues at present facing us in connection with these Estimates certainly one of the most glaring <Col N="740" /> is raised by the allocation of another £400,000 to the authorities of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, for secular education.  It is glaring because it is being made in the wake of the controversial sacking of two members of the staff whose salaries were paid out of this fund and, effectively, is adding insult to injury to the taxpayer.  The Supreme Court has held that the Maynooth Trustees were perfectly entitled to do what they did and it is not my purpose here to disagree with them.  But it must be pointed out that the logic of this decision is that the trustees are perfectly entitled to do the same again if they wish, and to do so at our expense.</P>
      <P>Indeed, they can run St. Patrick's College like a rural, two-teacher national school if they so desire.  In the light of this the taxpayer has the right to demand of the Minister for Education whether he is still fully satisfied that there are adequate safeguards for this substantial vote of moneys.  He must be asked whether the concept of academic freedom means anything at all to him, if he is in the slightest way concerned to ensure that this concept is at least reasonably respected in any third level educational institution to which, as here in this Supplementary Estimate, we are being asked to vote finance.  Nobody who has followed this tragic case in any detail will be under any illusion that, while the letter of the law was observed, the spirit and the concept of academic freedom was most flagrantly breached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short-term this £500,000 or so is obviously needed to keep the doors of Maynooth open on a day-to-day basis. Obviously, for this reason we cannot and should not vote against it.  But we do have the right and the duty to ask the Minister to ensure that adequate safeguards for the professional integrity and the personal livelihoods of the members of the staff of this institution who are paid out of this Vote are insisted on by him at the earliest possible date.  I would ask the Minister not to shelter behind any soutanes here.  Let him come out into the open and state that the concept of academic freedom does have a <Col N="741" /> tangible meaning for him and that he is prepared to defend it against arbitrary and discriminatory exercises of power. Frankly, I was somewhat disappointed at the closeness with which the Minister hewed to his brief in introducing this Estimate.</P>

      <P>At one stage the Minister accused Deputy Collins of barking up the wrong tree.  One of the problems about this is that the Minister has planted a fair forest of these trees in the last couple of years.</P>

      <P>In relation to Vote 30, the main subhead here is subhead A1, Salaries, Wages and Allowances.  This is a Vote of over £6 million even before the Supplementary Estimate is added to it.  It is now to go up by £250,000.  We are entitled to ask precisely what is being done with this money.  All the excellent people <Col N="742" /> running around in Marlborough Street and in Hawkins House must be working at something and I have every assurance that they are, but what is preventing the results of this work from reaching us?  I was intrigued to note in relation to a recent answer to a parliamentary question that one of the ways in which this money is being spent is on the doubling of the size of the Minister's private office.  We have the right to ask why the Minister needs twice as many civil servants in his private office as Deputy Peter Barry did when he was Minister for Education.  It is particularly ironic that the money should be devoted to this.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that the size of the Minister's private office has doubled when in two years he was able to provide only slightly more than a third of the 600 jobs for secretarial assistants in primary and secondary schools that he promised.  There seems to be a crazy scheme of priorities and we would like to see it put right.  We would certainly like to know whether the public servants concerned have finished the work on the White Paper.  We were told that we would have it before the end of the year.  I hope we are not in the situation, when we come back and hold the Minister up against this commitment, that he will say that he did not say which year.  We have to ask also whether and when they will produce the university legislation.  Complexities may be involved but they are surely not as substantial as to keep the thing under wraps for so long.  In relation to the transport services, as Deputy Collins pointed out, it is important that the Minister has dispelled any doubts that Deputy Collins had today.</P>

      <P>They were certainly shared.  Under subhead F.3, National Museum, the archaeological excavations involved go up by the substantial amount of £75,000.  When we look at the small print we realise that what is involved is an extra sum for excavations in Wood Quay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>This £75,000, welcome as it is, is in effect probably the last substantial amount that will be spent on the archaeological excavation in this vital area.  It is very sad that the Minister's interest in this and the muscle he was able to muster in relation to this only rose to £75,000 and that he could not persuade his other colleagues of the absolute necessity of providing the money needed to preserve and establish this national monument in the most appropriate way for posterity.  The money that was being paid out for archaeological excavations at Wood Quay was being paid out in the most extraordinary manner, by way of expenses instead of by way of wages to some of the staff concerned.  It was not until this matter was raised in the House by parliamentary question that it was put right.  That should act as a headline for anybody else who is tempted to do the same in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Vote 31, primary education, there are a number of increases. Apart from the salaries of teachers and superannuation which I do not propose to deal with, one of the main increases was in relation to the operation costs of national schools.  Here we have an extra £250,000 being provided for a projected increase in the price of heating oils over the winter.  This is possibly is addition to an earlier Supplementary Estimate which was devoted partly to the same thing.  We would like to know whether the Minister is satisfied that this is enough, whether any further representations have reached him about the level of the heating grant for the coming year, <Col N="744" /> and whether the authorities or the managers and teaching organisations are satisfied that this will be enough to meet reasonable needs.</P>
    <P>In relation to subhead C.6., aid towards the cost of school books, an extra £55,000 is being provided in addition to the £350,000 which was increased from £270,000 by the first Supplementary Estimate.  I would appeal to the Minister to have another look at the administration of this scheme and to ask himself whether a great deal of trouble and the inevitable invidious distinctions might not be avoided by the introduction of a much more generous scheme.  The present scheme puts head teachers in an invidious position as it forces them to make distinctions among their pupils. Many of them administer it as a social service, with whatever degree of willingness I am not sure, but even those who do it willingly would prefer it to be done by somebody else.</P>
    <P>In relation to secondary education grants, a number of fairly substantial issues arise.  In relation to the increase of £400,000 in the capitation grant, including the teachers' salaries grant, has this anything to do with the increased cost of heating oils for the schools, or is it simply an increase in the capitation grant including the teachers' salaries grant?  Perhaps the Minister would deal with this when replying.  I would appeal to the Minister to get the consent of the Minister for Finance and perhaps of the Committee of Public Accounts for the recasting of some of these Votes to make it more immediately clear to people precisely what transfers of funds are involved, to which institutions and for which purposes, because at the moment it is not clear enough to the average reader.</P>
    <P>One particular element which I would like to bring up here, and it is not an unimportant one even though the sums of money involved are comparatively small, is the extraordinary way in which the Minister has increased fees for certificate examinations in our schools.  The original fee of £3.50 has been increased to £7 for the group, intermediate and <Col N="745" /> leaving certificate examinations; the late entry fee is now at the level of £19.  I should like to ask the Minister how he seriously thinks the unemployed father of four or five children can produce that kind of money at short notice.  As far as I know, the average amount of money given to an unemployed person for a dependent child is about £5 a week.  The Department of Education are now asking the parents of these children to pay more for the right to sit a public examination than they are receiving from the State in benefit for that child for a week.  If they cannot raise the money by the deadline, they have to come back with £19, more than an old age pensioner is required to live on for a week, and nearly four times the average weekly grant for a dependent child of an unemployed person.  This examination fee business is one of the most regressive single aspects of educational financing, in that it bears equally on those who can and those who cannot afford to pay, and, I suspect, that the cost of its administration may not even be covered by the money brought in.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is serious about promoting access to education at all levels he must seriously consider whether these now extremely large fees, especially in the case of a disadvantaged household, should not be looked at again.  It is one thing for the Minister to lash out £10,000 here and £10,000 there, but it is effectively coming out of the pockets of the people who have to pay these increased examination fees for the right to sit a public examination for which they might be encouraged to think they paid for already through taxes. Then it is not generosity but simply transferring money within the Department from one Vote to another and giving the Minister the appearance of generosity.</P>
    <P>In relation to community schools, which at present come under the Secondary Education Vote, there are two things that need to be said.  The first is to criticise the Minister's studied refusal to bring the laboriously inactive deed of trust into this House for debate, discussion and approbation or otherwise.  It is a <Col N="746" /> characteristic of the Department he inherited that they seem to want to do as little as possible on the floor of this House and in this they are facilitated by the absence of any major caucus of modern educational legislation.  Thus it is that such a major national issue as the community schools can be dealt with by the Minister to the exclusion of all comment in this House, except that which is allowed at Question Time.  We can only assume he does not bring it in here because he does not want to and we can draw our own conclusions from that.</P>
    <P>There is also a very serious question in relation to his administrative practice in the consultation process he established prior to the finalisation of these deeds.  When I asked him in this House whom he had invited to consult with him on the formulation of the deeds, he gave me a list of people he had invited.  He went on to say that two other bodies&mdash;the Secondary Education Commission, who represent a number of non-Catholic Christian churches in this State, and the Secondary Education Commission of the Church of Ireland&mdash;had been asked whether they would welcome an invitation, or words to that effect.  Why on earth can the Minister not treat these people on the same basis as he treats others whom he invites straightaway to consult with him?  For example, if he asks the Irish Vocational Educational Association or the Conference of Major Religious Superiors to consult with him, why should he not also ask on the same basis the Secondary Education Commission or any other body he feels have an entitlement to be involved in such consultation?</P>
    <P>If the Minister has two different categories of organisations for consultation purposes, we are entitled to ask why one group of organisations are in category A and the other in category B. We are also entitled to ask why it is that even though all the organisations in category A are not Catholic, both of the organisations in category B are Protestant. If that does not smell of sectarianism, nothing does.  We have yet to hear from the Minister, and I have questions down on this so I will not pursue it <Col N="747" /> here, precisely what happened as a result of his extraordinarily general request asking somebody if they would welcome an invitation.</P>
    <P>I heard that at least one of these organisations said they would welcome an invitation and actually met the Minister and gave him a fairly tough time on the deeds of trust.  We have not heard anything about this in public and I hope the Minister will give us the information in due course.  It is true that whatever the murky past of the affair, the equally murky present is that this particular deed of trust, as arrived at by his Department after consultations, is for a number of reasons not acceptable to many people and organisations whose views in this matter cannot be lightly disregarded.</P>
    <P>This is particularly relevant in relation to the point raised by Deputy Collins about school transport.  I, too, had representations of the kind referred to by Deputy Collins but I will be specific about my representations.  If the situation has changed since those representations <Col N="748" /> were made, that is a good thing, but the problem should not have arisen in the first place.  The representations made to me were to the effect that people who lived adjacent to the Cabinteely community school, which is in my constituency, were sending their children to the Newpark comprehensive school which is further away than the Cabinteely community school.  They were told that, in relation to one of the children who is coming up to secondary school age and whom they wanted to send to the Newpark school, because they lived within a certain radius of the Cabinteely school, free transport would not be extended to enable that child to go to the Newpark school.</P>
    <P>The question is whether the policy is as that parent told me it then was or whether it has been revised to allow these parents the right, not to a choice of school, because that is not at issue, but to transport to a school of their choice.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

The provision for 1979 for these grants is £56.184 million, after Supplementary Estimates.

    <P>There are other voted provisions for payments to CIE and the amounts provided for these for 1979 are set out below.  In general, these payments are made to enable CIE either to provide a special service or to provide transport <Col N="576" /> free of charge or at reduced rates and as such are not regarded as subsidies to CIE.</P>

      <P>(a) The information sought in this part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  The statement sets out the expenditure on civil service&mdash;nonindustrial&mdash;salaries and allowances as a percentage of net expenditure on each vote for the years ended 31 March 1970 and 31 December 1977.  The figures for 1979 are based on voted estimates; (b) It is regretted that the information sought by the Deputy in this part of the question is not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost in staff time.</P>

      <P>Persons who were voluntary contributors under the social Welfare Acts on 31 March 1974 and who satisfied certain contribution requirements are entitled to free hospital services, including the services of consultants in public wards and at public clinics, without reference to income.  They are also entitled to free maternity and infant welfare services, including the services of a family doctor during pregnancy, and family doctor services for mother and infant up to six weeks after birth.

      <P>There has been no delay in this case.  The herd owner applied on 12 September 1979 for admission to the scheme of premiums for conversion of dairy herds.  The initial inspection of the herd took place on 25 October 1979.  In accordance with the terms and conditions of the scheme further inquiries which are proceeding are necessary before the application can be approved.</P>
      <P>Reactors under the brucellosis eradication scheme were received in the factory on 26 November 1979.  Payment will be made in respect of these reactors shortly.  The herdowner's position in relation to grants out of the hardship fund for these reactors is currently being examined.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 472 and 473 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Donegal County Council sought £4.634 million for their local authority housing construction programme in 1979.  Their demand was considered by me in conjunction with the claims of other housing authorities on the resources made available this year by the Government for the local authority housing construction programme and I have allocated £2.555 million to them to date.  Authorities generally seek more in the aggregate than could possibly be made available to them or indeed in some cases even more than could be spent by them.  Donegal County Council's claim for £4.634 million should be seen in the context of actual expenditure in 1978 of £2.022 million, in 1977 of <Col N="609" /> £1.637 million, and in 1976 of £1.452 million.</P>
    <P>The council have received a fair share of the available resources, getting the largest allocation of any county, except Dublin County Council.</P>
    <P>I am not in a position as yet to state what the final amount of payments to the council will be this year.  A total of £1.963 million has been issued to the council from the Local Loans Fund to date and they have the authority to spend an additional £0.592 million as a working balance from overdraft, pending recoupment from the Local Loans Fund in 1980.</P>

      <P>In 1977 the Employment Appeals Tribunal sat on 233 days, of which two sittings were held on 34 days, and heard 1,575 appeals.  In 1978 the tribunal sat on 233 days, of which two sittings were held on 48 days and three sittings on 4 days, and heard 980 appeals. In both years there was an average waiting period of 14 weeks for hearings.</P>
      <P>I was concerned about these delays in hearings by the tribunal and I sought, and got, authority from the Oireachtas in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979 for an expansion in the membership.</P>
