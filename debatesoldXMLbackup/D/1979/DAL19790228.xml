    <Title>Health (Family Planning) Bill, 1978: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey) Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:  &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that Deputies recognise the importance of this measure.  It is a Bill designed, after lengthy consideration and wide consultation with interested parties, to deal in a responsible and acceptable way with a problem which has been a matter of political debate for the last six or seven years but which has not so far been resolved.  It is a Bill which <Col N="321" /> follows a Supreme Court decision which involved a fundamental change in the law relating to the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>The Government decided, when introducing the legislation made necessary by the Supreme Court decision, to avail of the opportunity to legislate also for a full family planning service.  As a result, we have here the first real Family Planning Bill to be introduced since this matter first became the subject of controversy in this country.  The Bill introduced by the last Government in 1974 specifically related to the control of the importation, sale and manufacture of contraceptives and the consequential amendment of certain legislation affected by the provisions of that Bill. Other Bills which were introduced in the Seanad were entitled Family Planning Bills, but were primarily designed to control the importation of contraceptives in much the same way as the provisions set out in the Bill introduced by the last Government.  The Bill now before the House genuinely merits the title of Family Planning.  Its emphasis is primarily on the provision of family planning services and it deals with the control of contraceptives as something which, apart altogether from the Supreme Court decision, must be dealt with in the context of a comprehensive family planning service. It is because this Bill is a Family Planning Bill in the full and proper sense of those words that I am commending its provisions to the House.  I hope that when it has been fully considered and discussed, its enactment will bring an end to the controversy about what we should include in our family planning legislation so that we can get on with the task of seeing that appropriate family planning services are available to those who wish to decide in a responsible way on the size of their families and the intervals at which they hope to have children.</P>
    <P>I propose later to deal with the specific provisions of the Bill but before I do so I should like to comment on the unfounded criticism that the Government is unnecessarily introducing legislation legalising the sale of contraceptives and that it is wrong for it to <Col N="322" /> do so and that other courses of action are open to us.</P>
    <P>By way of reply, I feel I should begin by outlining the position that currently obtains in relation to the availability of contraceptives.  As Deputies will know, the importation of contraceptives into this country was governed by the provisions of section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935.  That law made it unlawful for any person to sell contraceptives, or to import them for sale, and it also included contraceptives in the list of items whose importation into this country was prohibited under the Customs Acts.  The net effect of this legislation was that contraceptives could not legally be imported into the country and that the sale of contraceptives in this country was also made unlawful.</P>
    <P>This was the position which obtained from the passing of the 1935 Act until the judgment which was given in the Supreme Court in what has come to be known as the McGee case.  In that judgment it was held that section 17 (3) of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1935 was unconstitutional and, therefore, of no effect.  There was no declaration made in the judgment in relation to subsection (1) of the section which prohibited the sale or import for sale of contraceptives.  The net effect of the decision, therefore, was that there has not been, since the judgment was given, any control over the importation of contraceptives and that it is, at present, legal for any person, irrespective of his or her age or marital status, to import contraceptives provided they are not being imported for subsequent sale.</P>
    <P>That in brief is the current legal position. It should be clearly understood by everybody what the present situation is and that this Bill is not for the first time legalising the availability of contraceptives. At present, contraceptives are legally available to anybody who wishes to import them and I would suggest to those who criticise the provisions of this Bill that they should, in doing so, have regard to the present factual position in relation to the availability of contraceptives. The effect of the Bill, which I am now introducing, is generally to control the availability of contraceptives and <Col N="323" /> restrict effectively their supply to certain authorised channels for family planning purposes.</P>
    <P>Before introducing a major Bill of this nature, dealing with a matter which has been the subject of concern and controversy for so many years, I deemed it prudent to make every effort to inform myself in so far as this could be done, of the views and attitudes of those professional bodies who would be affected by the provisions of family planning legislation, the health boards, Church leaders, and all those community organisations, vocational bodies and individuals who could help to convey to me the range of views held throughout the community on this important issue.</P>
    <P>During the consultative process, over eighteen organisations agreed to come and discuss with me the provisions which might appropriately be included in a family planning Bill.  Those organisations which came to me had clearly spent a great deal of time in considering the question and I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the co-operation which I received, not only from those bodies with whom I met, but also from a number of other organisations which wrote to me to indicate their views on this most important subject.  It would not, I think, be appropriate for me to attribute specific recommendations to specific bodies since the discussions which took place were on a confidential basis and were primarily intended to assist me in arriving at the decisions which had to be made.  Nevertheless, it would, I think, be of assistance to Deputies if I were to indicate broad areas on which there was a general consensus among those organisations which made their views known.  Where such consensus existed among a clear majority of those consulted I have had regard to this in the preparation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>It should first be made clear that there was a general consensus that family planning, in the sense of deciding upon the number and spacing of children, was something which was regarded as being highly desirable.  There was also general agreement that responsible decisions in relation to family planning could only be taken by those who had available to <Col N="324" /> them adequate information about the various methods of family planning. Health boards unanimously were of the opinion that the provision of such advice and information was an appropriate function for the boards, but the majority of the boards did not consider that it would be appropriate for them to be the providers of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>All the bodies consulted by me agreed that there was a need to legislate in relation to family planning and contraceptives. None of them suggested that the existing legal position was desirable or should be allowed to continue; most of them took the view that the present position, which allows any person to import contraceptives for his own use, but in which they cannot be sold, should not be allowed to continue.  It emerged clearly that the majority view of those consulted was that any legislation to be introduced should provide for a more restrictive situation in relation to the availability of contraceptives than that which exists by law at present.  In putting forward this view, most of those who did so recognised the practical difficulties of implementing restrictive legislation but still felt that legislation which was, on the whole, restrictive in relation to the availability of contraceptives should be attempted.  The general view was to the effect that the availability of contraceptives through a large variety of sources and, for example, from slot machines and similar dispensers, should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The discussions in which I engaged were extremely valuable to me in that a number of specific issues were clearly defined as being of fundamental concern to many of the organisations involved in the discussions.  There was, for example, general agreement that advertising of artificial contraceptives should not be permitted in journals or newspapers in general circulation.  The majority view was that information about specific methods of artificial contraception should be made available through their professional journals to doctors and nurses and to other persons who are engaged in providing advice and information about family planning.  Many of the bodies concerned have drawn my attention <Col N="325" /> to the fact that advertising of contraceptives is taking place in magazines in public circulation in this country and, arising out of such representations, I have made appropriate provision in the Bill to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>A major issue, on which there was unanimity among those consulted and to which almost all of them referred, was the question of abortion.  I assured all those with whom I had consultations that it was my intention to include in the Bill a specific provision making it clear that abortion would not be contemplated in any legislation which I would be introducing.</P>
    <P>I also mentioned, during the course of my consultations, the desirability of providing in a family planning Bill a section which would enable those who had conscientious objections to being involved in any legislation relating to contraception and contraceptives to opt out of the operation of such legislation.  In fact, prior to the commencement of discussions with the organisations which I met, I had made it clear in my Department that officers who had a conscientious objection to being involved in the preparation of the legislation would not be required to participate in it.  The fact that I was willing to include such a provision in the legislation was welcomed by the majority of the organisations since they were concerned to ensure that anyone who was unwilling to be involved in legislation which related to contraceptives should not be required to be involved in its implementation.</P>
    <P>There were other matters which were raised during the course of my consultations. Many of the points made are reflected in the provisions of the Bill; some of the points which were raised did not require to be mentioned specifically in this legislation since I already had power, either in earlier Health Acts or in other legislation, to implement recommendations made.  In turning now to the detailed provisions of the Bill, I propose to refer, where appropriate, to the representations which were made to me and to the extent to which they have influenced the manner in which this Bill is now being presented to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="326" /> Section 1 contains definitions which have to be borne in mind in considering the provisions of the Bill as drafted.  It will be noted that there is no definition of &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; in these definitions. Specific provision for such a definition is not needed in this Bill since it will be cited as one with the Health Acts and it is made clear in those Acts that the Minister referred to is the Minister for Health.  I should, however, like to make the point that this legislation is being introduced by me, as Minister for Health and not, as with the previous Government's Bill on this matter, by the Minister for Justice.  The Government decided, in considering the procedure to be followed in introducing family planning legislation, that it was appropriate that such legislation should be introduced by the Minister for Health and that contraceptives should be brought within the ambit of health legislation rather than retained in the context of the criminal law.  The decision is one which makes clear the Government's concern that family planning, in the broad sense of that term, should be seen as part of the general health services.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention specifically to one definition in section 1. It may be necessary to do this in order to avoid the possibility of confusion during discussions on the Bill.  Deputies will note that the definition of &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; means a service for the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to any one or more of the following: (a) family planning; (b) contraception; (c) contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Family planning services, as so defined, relate only to the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation and do not include making contraceptives available.  The sale and supply of contraceptives is dealt with separately and specifically in section 4 of the Bill, which sets out all the circumstances in which contraceptives may be sold or supplied to members of the public.</P>
    <P>Section 2 imposes on the Minister the duty to secure the orderly organisation of family planning services and to provide a comprehensive natural family <Col N="327" /> planning service.  The situation at present is that family planning services are available only on a limited basis.  In some areas, contraceptives are being made available, very often illegally.  In so far as advice and instruction is concerned, these are, to some extent, available through family doctors, maternity hospitals and clinics and through family clinics established under the aegis of the Family Planning Association.  It will be the responsibility of the Minister for Health in the future to arrange that family planning services, as defined in the Bill, are made available on a more general basis throughout the country. This will necessarily involve a review of existing services and I intend to seek the co-operation of the medical and nursing professions in deciding the form and extent and the detailed arrangements for a new comprehensive service.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also requires the Minister for Health to provide a comprehensive natural family planning service.  This provision has been inserted in the Bill because I am convinced of the value and importance of providing such a service and, furthermore, because during the consultations it was made clear to me that there was a general desire that advice and information about all methods of family planning should be generally available.</P>
    <P>There are a number of agencies which are currently providing advice and information about natural methods of family planning.  The National Association for the Ovulation Method in Ireland are in course of providing an extended service throughout the country and, in discussion with me, indicated that, with support, they would be in a position to expand the service which they are currently making available in specific areas.  The Catholic Marriage Advisory Council are concerned also with this problem of providing and extending the availability of information and advice about natural methods of family planning.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the World Health Organisation is currently undertaking a study of the acceptability <Col N="328" /> of natural methods of family planning and of the extent to which they can enable people to regulate the size of their families.  This country is participating in this study but it will be some time before the results are available.</P>
    <P>Later this year, I am arranging to hold, with the assistance of the World Health Organisation, an international seminar on natural family planning in which leading world authorities will participate and during the course of which the latest developments in natural family planning methods will be reviewed and discussed.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been passed, I propose to work closely with NAOMI and with the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council and to obtain their assistance in providing a comprehensive natural family planning service so that in coming to a decision about the manner in which they wish to plan their families, couples have available to them appropriate advice and information on this method of contraception in addition to other methods and that there will be available to them, if they desire to utilise this method, informed guidance and assistance in doing so.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 the Minister for Health is empowered to make regulations relating to the making available by a health board of a family planning service.  Here I would refer again to the point I made on section 1, that is, that a family planning service, as defined in the Act, does not include the provision of contraceptives.  This accords with the view put forward to me by the majority of health board representatives that they wished to provide a wide-ranging and comprehensive service of advice and instruction on all methods of family planning but that they did not feel it appropriate that health boards as such should be involved in the provision of contraceptives.  Those bodies which are providing advice and instruction only in relation to natural methods of family planning are excluded from the provisions of the section.</P>
    <P>The section also empowers the Minister for Health, when satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so, to <Col N="329" /> consent to the provision of a family planning service by other bodies.</P>
    <P>Where instruction or advice in relation to methods of family planning which involve the use of contraceptives is given, this can be done only under the general direction and supervision of a registered medical practitioner.  In such circumstances, advice and information about natural methods of family planning must also be available.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw particular attention to the fact that nothing in the section relates to or is intended to restrict the discretion of a registered medical practitioner in his clinical relations with a patient.  It is a matter entirely for the discretion of the medical practitioner, consulted by his patient, to decide what advice is appropriate in the circumstances, what method or methods of family planning are appropriate in the circumstances of a specific consultation and to act according to his clinical judgment in relation to the provision of advice and guidance in any particular case.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that contraceptives shall be sold only by chemists in their shops and that they shall be sold only to persons named in a prescription or authorisation given by a registered medical practitioner.  The section requires that the medical practitioner be of the opinion, when giving the prescription or authorisation, that the person requires the contraceptives for the purpose, <i>bona fide</i>, of family planning or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances.</P>
    <P>The provision is the outcome of long and earnest consideration of the different ways of providing for the availability of contraceptives.  It is clear to me from my consultations that majority opinion in this country does not favour widespread uncontrolled availability of contraceptives. The view was also expressed frequently that the existing position in relation to the supply of contraceptives is unsatisfactory in that it makes contraceptives available without any form of control to anyone, child or adult, single or married, who wishes to write away and import any form of contraception they wish.</P>
    <P>It becomes increasingly clear to me as the consultations and the discussions <Col N="330" /> went on that I should aim at relating the availability of contraceptives to genuine family planning.  There is, as I have said, a majority opinion that family planning is a necessary and desirable objective of health services and there is also an opinion that, in the attainment of the objectives of family planning, it is desirable that information and advice be available about all forms of contraception.  The Supreme Court also has indicated that families, in arriving at decisions about the methods by which they plan their families, should not have those decisions impeded by the action of the State.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, it seemed to me most appropriate that the responsibility for providing guidance and assistance in relation to decisions on family planning and for authorising the provision of contraceptives, where these were appropriate in the family planning context, should reside with the family doctor.  At present, the family doctor provides a general service for parents and for members of the family.  He is currently, in many cases, asked for advice on appropriate methods of family planning where parents wish to limit or to space the number of their children.  He is the person who most appropriately can give such advice and assistance since he is the professional person who knows most about the physical and psychological characteristics of the couple seeking his advice and who is also aware in a general&mdash;or frequently in a very specific way&mdash;of their social and financial circumstances.  No other single professional person is as well qualified as he to advise on appropriate methods of contraception where such advice is sought by a patient.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, places family planning firmly in the context in which, I believe, it should be placed, that is, in the context of family medical care provided by the general practitioner.  This seems to me to be a wise and sensible way to ensure that the making available of contraceptives will be for family purposes and will be accompanied by advice regarding the merits and the hazards of different forms of contraception.  The provision in this, and the preceding sections, should, in my view, ensure the <Col N="331" /> availability in this country of an adequate family planning service under the general direction and control of those who are in the best position to advise about the manner and extent of the provision of such services in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill provides for controlling the importation of contraceptives into the State.  There is provision for the importation, in personal luggage, of limited quantities of contraceptives required by a traveller for his own use. Apart from this exemption, contraceptives may be imported only under licence to be granted by the Minister.  Licences may be granted to wholesalers who wish to import contraceptives for sale to pharmaceutical chemists or a licence may be granted directly to a pharmaceutical chemist.  The importation of contraceptives otherwise than in personal luggage or in accordance with the licence granted by the Minister is, in effect, prohibited by subsection (6) of the section.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of contraceptives may not take place except under licence granted by the Minister under section 6 of the Bill.  The licence may be granted if the Minister is satisfied that the contraceptives being manufactured will be sold to pharmaceutical chemists or may be granted directly to a pharmaceutical chemist.  I have included this provision not because I think it likely or desirable that Irish industry should become involved in the manufacture of contraceptives but simply as a &ldquo;safeguard&rdquo; measure.</P>
    <P>The effect of sections 4, 5 and 6 together is to create a situation in which the importation of contraceptives and their manufacture in the State will be strictly controlled and the sale of contraceptives will take place only in pharmacies and in accordance with prescriptions or authorisations issued by registered medical practitioners.  It will be necessary for a practitioner to issue a prescription for the pill since the sale of anovulents is governed by the provisions of the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966.</P>
    <P>In so far as other contraceptives are <Col N="332" /> concerned it will be open to the medical practitioner to provide his patient with an authorisation to obtain such supplies of specified contraceptives as he considers are appropriate in the patient's particular circumstances.  Sale by a pharmacist would be restricted to the person named in a prescription or authorisation.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, one of the matters which emerged very clearly and on which there was a general consensus was that there should not be unrestricted advertising of the availability of contraceptives in newspapers and magazines. Section 7 provides that the extent to which advertising in relation to contraception or contraceptives may take place is to be determined in regulations. My intention is that the regulations would restrict the advertisement of contraceptives and techniques of contraception to doctors, nurses, chemists and other persons engaged in the provision of family planning services.  Section 8 makes it an offence to forge a prescription or authorisation or to be unlawfully in possession of such a forged document.</P>
    <P>I have provided, in section 9, power for the Minister to make grants to a person to finance research into methods of family planning that do not relate to the use of contraceptives.  It was represented to me by a number of bodies that research into methods of natural family planning and studies of the outcome of trials of methods of natural family planning were inhibited by an acute shortage of money.  At present, such activities are in this country undertaken by voluntary bodies and these have found that their financial resources were inadequate to permit them not alone to extend their activities but also to evaluate those activities and to report on the efficacy of the methods which they were supporting.  It is, I think, reasonable that such efforts should be given financial assistance to enable them to play their appropriate part in the general context of family planning services.</P>
    <P>I consider it essential to make it clear that this Bill sets its face unquestionably against weakening of the position in regard to abortion.  Section 10 of the Bill specifically states that the Act does not authorise procuring abortion, the use of <Col N="333" /> instruments or drugs to procure abortions, or the sale, importation into the State, manufacture, advertising or display of abortifacients.</P>
    <P>In section 11 I have made it very clear that no person will be required under the provisions of the Bill to take part in the provision of a family planning service, to give a prescription or authorisation for the purposes of the Act, or to be involved in the sale, importation, manufacture, advertising or display of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I know at this stage that there is throughout the country as a whole a wide general acceptance of the desirability of family planning and of the need to have available for families a satisfactory family planning service.  The majority of couples wish to be in a position to take informed and responsible decisions about the size of their families and the spacing of their children.  For this purpose they consider it necessary to have at their disposal up-to-date and comprehensive information about the various methods of family planning and, relying on that information, to decide on the means of family planning which is most appropriate to their circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are many others who, while they accept the desirability of family planning, would not in the determination of the size of their own families wish to avail of any other than natural methods. Similarly there are those employed in the health and ancillary services who would not wish to be associated with either the provision of information or with making available means of family planning other than natural ones.  Under section 11 there will be no compulsion on anybody to use any part of the family planning service to which they have an objection or to be involved in the provision of information or advice about any aspect of family planning to which they have a conscientious objection.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 12 is to amend the Censorship of Publications Acts to take count of the fact that this Bill will authorise the provision under certain circumstances of artificial methods of contraception. The amendments are essentially consequential ones in that it would be unrealistic and illogical to provide in the Bill for the availability under certain <Col N="334" /> circumstances of artificial methods of contraception and to continue to ban books which advocated or referred to such methods.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides for the repeal of section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935.  There are four subsections in that section.  Subsection (1) made it unlawful for any person to sell or expose, offer, advertise or keep for sale or to import or attempt to import for sale, any contraceptive.  That prohibition has effectively been replaced by the provision of section 4 and 5 of this Bill. Subsection (2) provided penalties for breach of the section; subsection (3) was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its judgment on the McGee case; and subsection (4) contained a definition of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Of the remaining sections of the Bill, section 14 provides substantial penalties for persons guilty of offences under the Act, penalties which are considerably heavier for second offences and for continuing offences than they are for first offences.  Section 15 provides for situations in which offences under the Act are committed by incorporated or unincorporated bodies of persons and section 16 empowers the Minister to make regulations in relation to those matters in the Act where regulations are required to spell out detailed implementation of specific sections of the Bill.  Section 17 contains the short title, provision for the citation of the Act with other Health Acts and for their construction, and provision for the Act to be brought into operation by order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope Deputies will accept that this Bill is the result of careful and earnest consideration of a difficult situation and that it is a sincere attempt to meet that situation in a reasonable and acceptable manner.  There is very little support for a situation in which all forms of artificial contraceptives could be widely advertised and made freely available through a variety of sources to anyone seeking them.  We must, on the other hand, following the Supreme Court decision in the McGee case, avoid a situation in which the conscientious and informed decision of parents in relation to their families was interfered with by legislation which denies them access to the <Col N="335" /> modes of contraception which they have decided to adopt.  It is not easy to devise legislation which satisfies both these criteria.  The best method, I believe, is to provide a comprehensive family planning service and to limit the availability of artificial contraceptives to the purposes of such a service.</P>
    <P>I recognise that this legislation will not satisfy everybody.  There is no legislation which would.  There are diametrically opposing views sincerely held on practically every aspect of this issue.  There are powerful lobbies ranged on different sides.  There are many people around who want to impose their views whatever others may think or whatever the consequences may be.  There are commercial interests seeking their own ends.  I think the time has now come when the parliamentary process should prevail.  Everybody has had his say.  It is now a matter for the elected representatives of the people to decide.</P>
    <P>This legislation opens no flood-gates, but it seeks to meet the requirements of those who either have no objection to the use of artificial contraceptives or who, having found other methods unsatisfactory, wish to utilise means other than natural family planning methods.  It invokes the co-operation of the medical profession whose involvement in the provision of family planning services is the best guarantee of their availability and their successful implementation.</P>
    <P>It provides that who find the provisions unacceptable need not involve themselves in any way.  This Bill seeks to provide an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  I have not regarded it as necessary that we should conform to the position obtaining in any other country.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to Deputies on the basis that it will be found acceptable by and meet the wishes of the great majority of sensible responsible citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I start by acknowledging the fact, as the Minister said, that this is a difficult situation and represents a considerable task for any Minister charged with introducing amending legislation.  This legislation does not open any floodgates but it is <Col N="336" /> well at the outset that I should examine the situation that exists and has existed since the Supreme Court decision now a little over five years old which, in my belief, had the effect of partially opening the floodgates.  Since that time especially it has been obvious to anybody who examined this area that there is a need for amending legislation, that the situation which obtained consequent on the court's ruling was unsatisfactory, and it has been a duty on the Oireachtas to mend that situation.  That point of view seems to be so obvious that I do not understand why people even with completely different outlooks and aspirations in the area of family planning and contraception cannot agree that there is a need for legislation of some kind to mend the situation which arose as a result of the court's ruling and which the court seemed to urge in the ruling they handed down that the Oireachtas should attend to as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Some of us felt, even before the verdict of the court, that there was a need for the Oireachtas to examine this entire area as it was controlled by the 1935 Act.  In that respect perhaps we might have hoped for different legislation from legislation merely to mend the situation that arose as a result of the McGee case. In either event, some form of legislation has been necessary, particularly over the past five years.  The situation the Minister outlined is quite correct.  Any person of any age, as long as he or she had sufficient money and the ability to communicate, could arrange to import contraceptives to an unlimited degree in a completely uncontrolled and unrestricted way.  I do not think any of us from any viewpoint could have felt that that was a satisfactory situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a by-product of the ruling on the McGee case the section prohibiting the sale of contraceptives can only be described as being of dubious constitutionality. It was apparent that, if a test case were taken in relation to that subsection, it was highly likely that the courts might have found as they did in relation to section 17 (3).  That being the case, it is particularly unfortunate that the Oireachtas have not managed in the five years since that court ruling to have taken what I would have considered to <Col N="337" /> be the relatively simple step of repairing the law and restoring some sanity to the situation and in the process acknowledging the <i>de facto</i> position which exists and endeavouring to provide some form of realistic legislation to provide for it.</P>
    <P>There is no gainsaying the fact that the everyday decisions of many thousands of Irish men and women have meant that the legislature has been passed by in this important area.  The question we must ask ourselves now, and should have been asking ourselves for the past number of years, is whether we are prepared to continue in this ostrich-like approach by the Oireachtas on matters such as this.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in relation to other debates, we are the country with the youngest population in Europe.  We are the single State within the European Community, perhaps throughout the western world, where democracy is going to stand the stiffest test that any democratic system has ever been put to over the next one or two decades because of the peculiar make-up of our society.  It still appears highly likely that many aspirations, especially job aspirations of our young people, may not be capable of being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>We have a parliamentary system that is essentially slow, cumbersome and Victorian in its make-up and outlook and the manner in which it reacts to changes in society or to the issues of the day.  I wonder for how much longer we can afford to indulge in the charade of assuming that family planning or the use of contraception or contraceptives is not widely practised here.  If we wish to engage in that sort of luxury within the confines of parliament, I am afraid it can only be at the expense of a continuing loss of respect for the effectiveness of this parliament, a loss compounded by many of the other shortcomings we realise exist within the parliamentary system, and a loss of respect which will be identified in the area where it is most to be regretted and feared, that is among the young people.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe that all that would be needed following the McGee judgment was a relatively simple and overdue updating of legislation.  The fact is that that has not taken place.  For five or <Col N="338" /> six years prior to that judgement there had been a continuing debate on this matter, more especially in the other House.  It is regrettable that it should have gone on for so long and that we are today discussing more legislation in this area.  I did not believe it necessary that this issue should have, to a large extent, occupied the centre scene of the Irish political stage over the last ten years.  It has done nothing to raise the stock of the legislature in the minds of the people nor the image of this country in the eyes of the world.</P>
    <P>I should like to place on record my own personal point of view.  Next summer I will be ten years a member of the Oireachtas, and eight of those years were spent in the other House.  On several occasions there I took the opportunity of speaking on various measures to amend the 1935 Act and consistently outlined my view which was that there was a need for parliament to recognise the situation as it existed and the rights of people to order their sexual affairs in private as they saw fit.  I still believe that. It is a little sad that, at the end of ten years and having contributed to that debate at various times, I have to confess that to some extent I have grown weary of the entire debate and I think the nation has grown weary of it, too. We in parliament, despite repeated debates and expressions of good will, good intent and anxiety on the part of almost everybody to appreciate and understand the genuinely held viewpoint of others, still have not been able to enact legislation that is workable and recognises the situation.</P>
    <P>It is time this Parliament endeavoured to catch up with the <i>de facto</i> situation in relation to family planning.  However, I must ask if this Bill as drafted is the only method whereby parliament can mend its hand.  Is this to be the sole vehicle whereby some sanity can be restored to the debate?  Is this the only possible <i>modus operandi</i> to take from the political arena this matter which is essentially of a private nature?</P>
    <P>In relation to legislation generally there is no doubt that moral standards as such do not change.  We often read and hear different people claim that the moral standards of the nation are changing. <Col N="339" /> I do not believe that, in general, the moral standards of the people change.  It is the limits of tolerance that change, the amount society is prepared to tolerate in relation to either public or private morality.  Basic moral standards do not change.  I accept that it would be quite wrong for a parliament to react in an over-hasty sort of way in response to those changes in the degree of tolerance. They may often move back in the opposite direction.  Even accepting that parliament is correctly cautious because over the years many pieces of legislation have stood the test of time I do not think that any of us in this parliament could make the excuse that the continuance of the 1935 Act until one subsection of it was overthrown by the courts was an awaiting by Parliament for the shifts of tolerance to restore some degree of credibility to that Act.</P>
    <P>The last time I spoke in the Seanad I said in relation to legislation in volume 86, column 127 on 9 February 1977:</P>
    <P>. . . the question has been raised as to what legislation is or what legislation should do.  I do not believe that many members of the Oireachtas expect legislation to force an individual to be a better person.  None of us can force anyone else to be a better person against his will.  Neither can legislation force anyone to be a better person against his will.  All legislation can do is impose limits, impose a set of checks and balances, set certain standards of public morality and protect the individual against the excesses of others, guarantee certain rights for them.  Legislation cannot make him a better man.  It might be able to prevent him from committing certain acts for fear of the penalties and punishment. Legislation might not make him a worse fellow but I do not believe it can make him a better fellow.  It cannot guarantee that he will observe the rules of his church or whatever church happens to be the majority church at the time.  It certainly cannot dictate in regard to his private morality.  That point has been clearly demonstrated by the decision of the <Col N="340" /> Supreme Court on the constitutional case which is fundamental to the whole argument. . . .</P>
    <P>I still believe that.  I read recently an extract from a lecture given by a very famous justice, Lord Devlin, on morals in the criminal law.  This particular paragraph is very relevant to this debate and relevant to what I just quoted from my last speech in the Seanad.  He said:</P>
    <P>The last and the biggest thing to be remembered is that the law is concerned with the minimum and not with the maximum; there is much more in the sermon on the mount that would be out of place in the Ten Commandments.</P>
    <P>That is particularly relevant to legislation generally, certainly legislation which endeavours to provide controls in the area between public and private morality.  There is far more in the sermon on the mount than could be provided for in the Ten Commandments. Lord Devlin further said:</P>
    <P>We all recognise the gap between the moral law and the law of the land. No man is worth much who regulates his conduct with the sole object of escaping punishment, and every worthy society sets for its members standards which are above those of the law.  We recognise the existence of such higher standards when we use expressions such as &ldquo;moral obligation&rdquo; and &ldquo;morally bound&rdquo;.  The distinction was well put in the judgement of African elders in a family dispute: &ldquo;We have power to make you divide your crops, for this is our law, and we will see this is done.  But we have not power to make you behave like an upright man&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I came to my conclusion in 1977 but I was very pleased to see how much it was in line with the words of the learned justice.  No law can make somebody an upright man and no law in relation to matters of private conscience and private morality can make him a better man.  He must decide that for himself.  It is something which parliament should respect, that he has the right to decide for himself as to how good or how bad a <Col N="341" /> person he wants to be.  The law can say what he may not do and impose certain punishments to protect society in general and the public order.</P>
    <P>Laws generally should be limited to the regulation of aspects of conduct which are predominantly social rather than predominantly private.  We are in a peculiarly Irish situation when we have so many people who agonise with their conscience so much on this particular matter and yet not on other matters of human justice or basic social justice.  It is a peculiarly Irish thing that we seem to have a conscience only when it comes to sexual matters but we do not have any qualms of conscience about coming in to make decisions or walk through lobbies in relation to equally important matters of social justice, rights of an individual and the manner in which we treat the less well off sections of our society. When it comes to matters relating to sexual conscience we all challenge the theologians who advise the Vatican and the other major churches.  This is probably part of the reason why this debate has dragged on for so long without being a credit to any person.</P>
    <P>My approach in this matter is in relation to the area of family planning and contraception and the right which I believe belongs to an individual to decide for himself or herself how he or she orders his or her sexual affairs in private without interfering with anybody else.  It is unfair that those violently opposed to any change insist on continuing to link the debate on this matter with divorce, abortion, euthanasia, sterilisation and all the other words designed to cloud the issue and to suggest to anyone who feels he wants to bring about a reasonable change, a recognition of the <i>de facto</i> situation and the genuine aspirations of many young Irish men and women, that they are opening the floodgates to promiscuity and the permissive society. Everybody who speaks in this debate should say very clearly that we are talking about reform of the law in relation to family planning and contraception.  That is the only matter which is before us. Any of the other matters which have extraneously been dragged into the debate by certain people for the promotion of their own points of view are outside this <Col N="342" /> debate, outside this Chamber and outside the decision which this political party and I believe any other political party in the House might make in relation to any of those other matters if they arise.  We will deal with them when they come up but they are not a matter of concern at present.  They are not part of this debate and should not be used to bully or coerce any individual or group of individuals in the House into voting one way or another.</P>
    <P>I have taken some trouble to set out honestly my viewpoint on this matter.  I accept that it is a viewpoint which will differ from that of others in this House and in the Seanad.  I sincerely respect the point of view of people who feel that they cannot in conscience bring themselves to support any change in legislation and who feel that any change can only bring about a worsening of the situation.  I do not agree with them, but I respect their right to hold that point of view.  All I ask from them in return is that they allow me to hold my point of view and respect the fact that I have genuinely come to these conclusions.</P>
    <P>I want to set out the position in regard to my party.  We have for some years at several Ard-Fheiseanna committed ourselves to the introduction and implementation of a realistic policy in relation to family planning.  That was reiterated again at our Ard-Fheis last May.  I spoke extensively on this matter and the delegates reiterated the previous commitment by the party.  The Ard-Fheis is the single and most important decision-making body on policy.  We have traditionally held the view that on matters such as this which relate to a person's conscience and private belief we should not seek to impose on any member of the parliamentary party or any member of the party at any other level the majority decision of the party in the manner in which they vote.  I think that is a very good thing.  It is in many ways a reflection on the Irish parliamentary system and the way it evolved that there has not been a greater tradition in allowing members of political parties to vote as they see fit on matters which they believe to be of great import to their conscience.</P>
    <P>As I have said in the Seanad and <Col N="343" /> other places, my belief is that the area of distinction between private and public morality should be the subject of a free vote at any time, that it should be referred to an all-party grouping and consensus legislation should be put forward. That would better reflect the general overall view of the people with their differing views, attitudes and philosophies. Part of the difficulty in relation to this debate has been the imposition by different parties of whips to vote in particular ways.  I would have thought that the Irish parliamentary system, Irish politics and democracy in general would have been better served if all the parties allowed their members to vote as their consciences dictated.  I do not think there would be any loss in electoral reputations in doing that.  More credit and respect would be gained by Parliament if that were done.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister realises I am not saying this in any political way, but I do not believe that each of the 83 other Deputies in the Minister's party is in complete and enthusiastic agreement with the measures in this Bill.  If that party represent a broad cross-section&mdash;which they obviously do since they won so many seats&mdash;surely some of those Deputies feel, as do some members of my own party, that they do not want to support any measure in this area.  Surely there are other Deputies who are disappointed that the Minister did not feel in a position to introduce a wider and more liberal measure.  Is it not rather difficult to believe that each of those 84 Deputies from different social backgrounds, financial circumstances and philosophies and representing all parts of the country, has decided to agree totally to the measure?</P>
    <P>I found it impossible to believe that each and every member of the Labour Party in 1974 had decided totally and absolutely in favour of the measure of the Government of the day.  It would have had more effect on the attitude of the people in 1974 and would have more effect now if all Members of the Dáil were allowed to vote as they saw fit on matters which do not impinge on the running of the State but rather relate to the individual and how that individual <Col N="344" /> lives his life and conducts his private relationships in private with other human beings.  There are differing viewpoints within our parliamentary group, just as there were differing viewpoints among the judges who handed down the decision in the McGee case in the Supreme Court and brought about the final realisation that there was some need for amending legislation.  It is good that there should be those differences, that society has the checks and balances of having people with differing viewpoints and philosophies.</P>
    <P>I have never been able to understand and have been saddened by the vehement and occasionally vitriolic criticism which has been levelled, mainly at my party colleagues but also at others, because of the manner in which they voted on measures such as this in the past and very often because they voted in the opposite lobby to me.  I did not feel any annoyance with them for doing so. Surely it is the most illogical of sentiments for someone to castigate a person, especially a parliamentarian who is in public life, for voting as his personal beliefs demand, simply because that vote happens to be at variance with how the critic looks at the same issue.  Some of the most outspoken critics on these occasions are the people who would indignantly insist that they themselves are the most liberal of fellows.  I cannot see that any person has an ounce of real liberalism if he is not prepared to respect the vote and the viewpoint of somebody else, especially in an area such as this.</P>
    <P>I believe the State should not interfere in the sphere of private morality, of conscience and of personal choice, as long as those areas do not injure the common good, public order or morality.  In common with every other legislator and every other responsible or concerned citizen, I share the anxiety that the moral fibre and values of our society should not be eroded.  I am as anxious as any parent that my children should grow up in a healthy and Christian society.  In that regard I would not be prepared to yield best to any man; yet I and others like me will be criticised because we say there is a need for change in legislation on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> We cannot close our eyes to what is happening around us.  We cannot ignore the legitimate demands of many young couples that they be allowed to plan their lives and their families in the manner best suited to their personal needs; nor can we afford to deny their claim that they be allowed to order their sexual affairs as they see fit and as a matter between themselves and their God.  In so far as it does not interfere with the good order and discipline of the State, I do not see how their call can be denied, and neither, if I read the judgment correctly do the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>I have gone to some trouble to outline my own and the party's attitude in this area.  We awaited, with a great deal of interest, the publication of this Bill.  The Minister, on foot of an election promise, set up an all-party informal committee. It would have been appropriate if that committee had been asked to give their views to the Minister as to how best this legislation might have been produced.  In the event, that did not happen and the committee only met once since their inception. The Minister promised Deputy Quinn some six or seven months ago that before he published this Bill he would have consultations with the Labour and Fine Gael Parties.  I do not know if there were consultations with the Labour Party or with Deputy O'Connell but there were certainly no consultations with this party.  From that point of view, this is the first opportunity I have had of outlining my reservations about the Bill.</P>
    <P>When the law is made to look a farce it is time for it to be amended.  When the amending legislation to correct that situation is in itself in many repects a farce <i>ab initio</i>, one can only wonder at the system that produced it and at the political will of the promoter of the legislation.  I am disappointed at some of the provisions and the basic thinking embodied in the Bill.  It says very little for the Government's social conscience or their awareness of the issues involved when it handles such a sensitive matter, which causes so much marital and personal stress, in this way.  Admittedly, it is a cleverly worded attempt which appears designed to rid themselves of a problem rather than helping to solve the real problem facing many thousands of <Col N="346" /> young, caring and concerned men and women.</P>
    <P>There are three main areas in relation to the Bill that cause us considerable concern.  The first is&mdash;the Minister acknowledged this in his speech&mdash;that central to the McGee judgement was the fact that the 1935 Act was repugnant to the Constitution because it invaded the privacy of Mr. and Mrs. McGee and did not allow them to order their sexual affairs as they wished.  The courts, very correctly, pointed out the constitutional right of these people to make up their own minds in private as to how they should order their sexual and family affairs. The Minister said that the Supreme Court also has indicated that families, in arriving at decisions about the methods by which they plan their families, should not have those decisions impeded by the action of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill hinges on the idea that people, in order to get advice on family planning and to get the various forms of contraception, will have to go to a doctor and obtain from him a prescription or authorisation, even if the contraceptive they want to get is of a non-medical nature.  The Bill recognises that they are of a non-medical nature because it sets out in section 4 (2) that the person is seeking the contraceptive <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes or for adequate medical reasons.  The medical reason is the alternative not the primary reason for visiting the doctor.  The primary reason is for family planning purposes.</P>
    <P>The right of a husband and wife to decide how to order their sexual affairs is apparently, under section 4 to be discussed and decided upon by a doctor, not in his medical capacity, not with his training qualifications or expertise in healing the sick but because he happens to be there and is a device that can be used to implement the measure.  He writes the script for family planning purposes or alternatively for medical purposes.</P>
    <P>The section also provides that the prescription or authorisation must contain reference to the fact that it has been written in accordance with this Bill.  Not only is the doctor to be taken into consultation with the Mr. and Mrs. McGees <Col N="347" /> of this world as to how they order their affairs but notification is to be given to the pharmacy that the items on the script are being dispensed for family planning purposes.  It is of great concern to us that the very kernel of the McGee judgment appears to have been violated and breached in this Bill.  It appears highly likely that the provisions of this Bill will be challenged and the joining of the doctor and, to a lesser degree, the pharmacist into the private decision of the couple would not be regarded in a benign fashion by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill hinges around the medical profession deciding who should and should not be eligible for the prescription of contraceptives.  The Minister has placed the House in the invidious and intolerable position of having been used as a propaganda vehicle to endeavour to influence the medical profession at a meeting which they will have tomorrow. The Central Council of the Irish Medical Association met last January and decided they would not recommend to their members that they should participate in the implementation of the Bill. The Minister met a deputation from that organisation and, as a result of that, they agreed to reconsider their decision at their March meeting.  Their March meeting takes place tomorrow morning. To our surprise, the Minister suddenly insisted that this Bill, which has been in existence since before Christmas, must be discussed today.  I could not at first understand why.  I have to confess now that I believe it was an effort through this debate to bring pressure to bear on the medical profession to persuade them to change their minds.  This is the second real area of concern to us, that there has been an abrogation of the Minister's responsibility.  It is not a nice responsibility or one that I envy him but there is a responsibility on the Minister to decide who is, who should or should not be eligible for family planning services and the availability of contraceptives. The Minister has abrogated that responsibility. The decision should have been taken by him and placed firmly in the legislation but, from his desk in the Custom House, he has assigned that responsibility to the waiting rooms and <Col N="348" /> surgeries of doctors, especially general practitioners, throughout the country. That was not a fair thing to do.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to try to place on doctors the moral responsibility for deciding upon eligibility generally for contraceptives. It was a cynical piece of buck passing. In what way does a doctor's ordinary medical training qualify him to pass judgement on whether the person visiting him is, to quote from the Bill, &ldquo;seeking the contraceptive, <i>bona fide</i>, for family planning purposes and in appropriate circumstances&rdquo;.  This is what the legislation will require the doctor to do, in effect, to sit in moral judgement on the people of the nation.  This is not right and the majority of doctors do not wish such a burden to be placed on their shoulders.  It will be left to the doctors to decide on what is or is not a family.  It will be left to the doctor to decide that a married woman who had her last child 18 months or two years ago is not now seeking contraceptives for <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes.  Will he have to decide that the common law husband and wife are not <i>bona fide</i> people who have a real interest and concern in family planning matters?</P>
    <P>If this Bill is implemented as it is set out now, will not the opinions, judgements and decisions vary according to the personal beliefs, or in certain cases the lack of personal beliefs, of some of the doctors?  Will applicants have to go to a doctor's surgery to explain their own religious and personal beliefs, their philosophy, their outlook, their family and financial circumstances and the many other factors that influence couples in deciding that they want to avail of family planning?  Will they have to explain all those factors to an overworked, busy GP before he decides on a non-medical matter in which he has had no training or education?  It is an odious responsibility to place on a general practitioner, the decision as to who should or should not be allowed to purchase condoms.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many doctors now practising realised when they undertook their six years or more of training, followed by subsequent experience and the expertise gained in treating the sick, that all of that was a preparation to now being <Col N="349" /> placed in a position when they will by law be allowed to write chits for condoms? Was it for this that they and their families and the taxpapers contributed so much in time and money during the years?  Let us be honest about this.  The decision as to who should or should not be allowed to purchase a condom has as little to do with the general practitioner as chiropody has to do with a dentist.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the legislation relies so heavily on doctors as the main people for decision-making.  In the debate in 1974 virtually every Deputy who spoke from the Minister's party who were then in Opposition suggested that the most logical method of having contraceptives distributed and family planning services provided was through the health boards.  In fact, Deputy Hugh Gibbons, who is not a Member of the House now, indicated that in certain cases he considered doctors were not the appropriate people to be involved and he indicated he was in favour of the health boards being the responsible people to provide this service.  Deputy David Andrews was the one Fianna Fáil speaker I came across who suggested a scheme that would appear to have been the forerunner in thought to this Bill, but every other Fianna Fáil speaker advocated that the health boards should carry out the family planning services.  I find it rather ironic that under the terms of this Bill the health boards will be obliged to set up advice centres in relation to family planning matters but they will not be allowed to dispense contraceptives.</P>
    <P>We are in a situation where the odious responsibility of deciding on non-medical matters is placed on a doctor. We are forcing people in full health to visit a doctor's surgery.  For the last few months we have been urging people to cut down on their visits to the doctor. We have been pointing out that the average person pays an unnecessary number of visits to the doctor each year. Recently the Minister launched a campaign to discourage people from thinking that they should be given a prescription every time they go to a doctor and to discourage people from expecting that they must have something dispensed from a chemist.  In that context we were <Col N="350" /> talking about people who were sick but now the Minister wants to send healthy people to a doctor, to get a prescription and to go to a chemist to have something dispensed.  That seems at variance with the entire concept of discouraging people from overworking doctors, from having an over-reliance on drugs and an over-anxiety to obtain prescriptions every time they visit a doctor.</P>
    <P>We are placing the doctor in a semior quasi-judicial role because in section 4 (2) it is stated that once the doctor writes the prescription it shall be conclusively presumed that the person has been given the prescription for <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes.  Not only is the doctor to be the arbiter, the moral policeman of the nation, but he is being placed in a role where his decision put on an authorisation, not on the basis of medical knowledge, expertise or training, is to be the conclusive proof which will leave the subsequent people who have to deal with the prescription and the holder immune from any recourse of the law.  In other words, once a doctor signs a prescription and hands it to a person, whether he was right or wrong that person has immunity from the law and from any of the so-called penalties set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a particular personal and practical difficulty presented to any doctor now who thinks he might want to opt out of this situation.  The Minister has said that he has a conscientious right to do this but I should like to point out that although there is a marginal note referring to conscientious objections the section itself makes no reference to objections of conscience whatever.  It allows a person the right to opt out for any reason he or she wishes, whether it be conscience or otherwise.  If a doctor opts out of this scheme his patients will find themselves in an embarassing position. They will hardly leave the doctor to whom they and their families go for all other health services, to visit a different practitioner simply for the purpose of having an authorisation chit for the purchase of condoms.  Therefore, a doctor who for reasons of conscience objects to the principles enshrined in the <Col N="351" /> Bill and decides not to work it will find that a number of his patients will leave him because they will not want to put themselves in the embarrassing position of having to go to one doctor for all family medical services and to another doctor simply to get the benefits of this Act.</P>
    <P>That represents a particular difficulty that exists in rural areas where there is a scarcity of doctors, where often there may be only one doctor.  If that doctor opts out of the scheme, to whom will the person affected go?  The provision also seems clearly to place an additional cost on people in Ireland more than anywhere else who wish to avail of contraceptives. They will be obliged to pay medical fees and pharmacist dispensing fees.  That does not appear to me to be fair.  That is the second of the three areas of real concern we have on this side.</P>
    <P>The third area is one with which, to my amazement, the Minister has not dealt.  It is a problem that must be causing extreme concern to every doctor who is now being invited to write authorisations in relation to non-medical matters in regard to which, as I have said, he has not got any training or expertise.  The problem relates to the application of the Consumer Information Act, 1978.  Section 6 of the Act is somewhat different from the corresponding section in the British equivalent.  It provides for the imposition of penalties on people who make false or misleading statements as to services and so forth, and it lays down that if a person, in the course or for the purpose of a &ldquo;trade, business or profession,&rdquo; does certain things&mdash;the British equivalent provision excludes &ldquo;profession&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That section in the Irish Act states that if such a person recklessly makes a statement&mdash;I am quoting from different parts of the section&mdash;in relation to the provision, in the course of trade, business or profession, of any service, or the fitness for purpose of any service, or as in subsection (4), the examination, approval, use or evaluation by any person of any service, that person shall be guilty of an offence.  Subsection (2) states that for the purpose of this section, anything likely to be taken for such a statement as <Col N="352" /> to any of those matters shall be deemed to be a false statement.  Paragraph (b) of the subsection provides that a statement made regardless of whether it is true or false shall be deemed to be made recklessly unless the person making it had adequate reason for believing it was true. The most frightening thing of all for a GP faced with the prospect of writing chits for a non-medical purpose is subsection (3), which provides that in relation to any services consisting of or including the application of any treatment or process, this section shall be taken to include the effect of the treatment.</P>
    <P>Is a general practitioner to be invited, when somebody comes to him to discuss contraceptives, to write a chit or prescription for non-medical contraceptives specified in the Bill as being non-medical? It has been accepted in the legislation that that doctor has not had training or special education, that he has as much expert knowledge on the matter as the patient coming to him.  Is he to be placed in a situation where, if the item which he has prescribed or authorised does not have the desired contraceptive effect, the patient would be entitled to claim that the treatment or the service provided had not been satisfactory and that the doctor was in violation of the Consumer Protection Act?  Would such a doctor also be left open to civil damages?  The Act contains criminal penalties of £500 or six months' imprisonment for a first offence and £10,000 or two years' imprisonment for a second offence, plus a rather difficult onus of proof placed on the defendant.</P>
    <P>Where would the doctor stand from the point of view of civil liability if any of these non-medical items which he had prescribed were not effective and a pregnancy resulted or some other effect that had not been intended?  I am amazed the Minister did not see fit to enter a saver clause in section 4, or if he did not think that was necessary, he should have dealt at some length with this real fear by doctors that by having prescribed something they knew nothing about they would be in violation of the Consumer Information Act and therefore liable to civil as well as criminal damages.</P>
    <P>There are some other items which I <Col N="353" /> propose to deal with briefly.  We agree with the Minister's reiteration of the prohibition of abortion or of anything to do with it.  There is reference, however, to abortifacients, but extraordinarily there is no attempt whatsoever throughout the Bill at a definition of what an abortifacient may be, although we all know of the considerable debate and controversy at present in relation to the abortifacient effect of some items used for contraceptive purposes, mainly IUDs.  I will not bore the House or embarrass the Minister by quoting from a speech by Deputy O'Malley in 1974 when he complained about the inadequate definition of abortifacients in the 1974 Bill.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, for some reason or another the Minister for Health has got over that by not attempting to define abortifacients at all.  Now, everybody involved&mdash;the pharmaceutical chemists, the wholesalers, the importers, and especially the doctors&mdash;have been left in a position where it will be an offence to have anything to do with abortifacients, but the legislation does not attempt to define what an abortifacient is.  I am not saying that the definition in the 1974 Bill was a very good one but it contained an important provision which has not been repeated in any shape or form in this Bill.  Section 7 of that Bill provided that the Minister might appoint a committee to advise him on whether a particular preparation or appliance was an abortifacient and whether such a drug, preparation or appliance was also a contraceptive. The section provided that the committee would consist of not more than five persons among whom would be persons with medical qualifications. Licences would not have been granted, according to that section, in respect of a contraceptive which in the opinion of the committee was also an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>At least that made some effort to define an abortifacient for the medical, pharmaceutical and other professions involved. Now doctors and others are left in a position where certain items in common use which are widely suspected of being abortifacient in their effects may or may not be prescribed and may leave those concerned open to criminal <Col N="354" /> proceedings if they prescribe them.  It is a very sensitive, delicate and tricky field but they are not to be given any assistance by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to family planning clinics will be changed dramatically.  Health boards will be obliged to set up information clinics to give information to people on different methods of contraception, natural and artificial.  The Bill also provides that other people will be entitled to apply for licences, these people presumably being those who are running family planning clinics now.  I agree entirely with the Minister that existing clinics should apply for licences.  There is no gainsaying that during a particularly difficult period, when the Oireachtas was negligent in its duty, a number of these clinics fulfilled an important function in helping young families.  That should be recognised.</P>
    <P>Under this new provision none of these clinics will be allowed to distribute contraceptives.  That provision is too farreaching in its effects.  There is the restriction that none of these clinics may be operated without a licence from the Minister and the Minister would have the necessary control to ensure that a clinic was operating properly.  If he were so satisfied, then, in the issuing of his licence he could allow a clinic in certain circumstances to issue contraceptives. In certain cases where a clinic could dispense advice but was not licensed to issue contraceptives persons attending at the clinic would be placed in a difficult position.  It is extraordinary that the statutory health boards should be allowed to set up clinics and not then be allowed to distribute contraceptives in conjunction with advice.  The Minister has said that the health boards have indicated that they did not want to be in that situation. I wonder how workable or attractive a health board information centre will be if a person, having been advised at the clinic that X, Y or Z appears to be the most appropriate thing for him, or her, is told to go to the GP to get a chit to be dispensed by a chemist, as soon as the door is open to operation of the scheme. That is a particularly cumbersome method of working.  I would have <Col N="355" /> thought that health boards who have statutory responsibility, could have been trusted to take part in the distribution of contraceptives as well as in the dissemination of advice.</P>
    <P>Family planning clinics which have been properly checked out and are controlled to the satisfaction of the Minister could, before an issue of licences, be allowed to distribute contraceptives.  I am sorry to have to say that of late I have begun to get complaints and indications from certain people that some of the clinics are going beyond the bounds that many of us would never have dreamed they would have reached or would have wanted them to go to.  The fact that these reservations have been expressed may be one of the reasons why the clinics have been treated in this way within the legislation.  This is worthy of consideration before this Bill is enacted, if it is enacted at all.  If the Minister is in a position to issue licences he should be in a position to be satisfied that the clinic is being properly supervised and therefore ought to be allowed to distribute contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the legislation does not contain a requirement for any of these clinics, either those outside the health boards or the health board clinics, that the personnel provided in them should be trained.  I would have thought it extremely important to place on anybody operating one of these advice centres the onus of seeing that the persons giving the advice had been suitably trained.  This applies especially in relation to the clinics which are to distribute information on natural methods of family planning.  Anyone who has looked into this matter to any degree knows that advice on the ovulation or the Billings method if not carefully given in an exact and controlled way has little hope of being successful.  Therefore, it is imperative that the staff disseminating that information be highly trained, and that the health boards also have an obligation to disseminate information on natural family planning methods.  That that is not in the Bill is a defect.  There is no reference whatever to an obligation being placed on the health boards or any other bodies providing these centres to <Col N="356" /> have staff trained to a certain degree of skill and qualification.</P>
    <P>There is a heavy reliance on ministerial regulation and we have had various examples over the last few months of how Ministers have used regulations to get around discussion in the House.  Someone whom the Minister will know has objected consistently over the years to this parliamentary device to give the Minister power to write his own legislation after a Bill has been enacted.  I do not like to see it contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I find extraordinary the Minister's attempt to define family planning service&mdash;three words&mdash;by using two of those words, &ldquo;family planning&rdquo;, in the definition section.  If you want a definition of family planning service you must read the definition, which is not a definition at all, it is a contradiction or an absurdity. Section 1 says</P>
    <P>&ldquo;family planning service&rdquo; means a service for the provision of information, instruction, advice or consultation in relation to any one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>(a) family planning,</P>
    <P>Is that a definition of &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo;?  The Minister must be joking. One has to go to section 2 to read about the Minister's responsibility.  The section says:</P>
    <P>The Minister shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) secure the orderly organisation of family planning services, and</P>
    <P>(b) provide a comprehensive natural family planning service,. . . . </P>
    <P>Then the section goes on to define what a comprehensive natural family planning service is.  Therefore, in the definition you substract a natural service to work out what is an artificial service.  If you want a definition of the definition section you must read further down this Bill. That is either extraordinarily devious or extraordinarily inept and I do not think that the Minister is an inept man.  Of course, it might have been embarrassing if the definition section had had to define what exactly is a family, because then the &ldquo;all things to all men&rdquo; aspect of the <Col N="357" /> Bill, the representation to one side that it provides for all adult persons, the representation to the other side that it provides only for married persons, would be seen to be patently false.  It could not be right on the two counts.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Bill does provide for single persons.  Section 5 provides that a person may import contraceptives into the State as part of his personal luggage when he is entering the State.  No Interpretations Act and no court would assume that to be referring only to married couples.  It is certainly not a definition of &ldquo;family planning service&rdquo;.  If the Bill is to have a proper definition section that needs attention.  If there is to be a proper definition section some attempt should be made to define what is an abortifacient.</P>
    <P>The drafting of the Bill is remarkable. It seem that under section 4 the person, after he has gone through this dreadful charade of finding a doctor who will write him a chit, must go to the chemist with that prescription.  Section 4 (1) (b) (ii) provides that:</P>
    <P>. . . the person to whom the contraceptives are sold is named in a prescription or authorisation in writing. . . .</P>
    <P>I took legal advice on this.  Could a man not send his wife, or could a wife not send her husband to the chemist? Presumably they would both be involved in the use of this contraceptive.  The legal advice is no. Section 4 (1) (b) (i), referring to the chemist, says:</P>
    <P>A person shall not sell contraceptives unless&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a) . . . .</P>
    <P>(b)  he is, or is a servant or agent acting as such of, a pharmaceutical chemists,. . .</P>
    <P>That wording is not repeated in section 4 (1) (b) (ii).  The wife who might be a servant or agent of her husband, or the husband who might be a servant or agent of his wife, would appear to be excluded by the exclusion of the phrase which is in section 4 (1) (b) (i).  Not only does one have to go through the demeaning process of going to the doctor to get a <Col N="358" /> prescription for condoms but one cannot send the marriage partner to have the prescription dispensed.  The person who obtained the prescription must attend in person at the chemist's shop.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why the general practitioner is obliged to state on the prescription that the prescription is for the purpose of this Act.  As I have said earlier, the Bill seems to be involving the pharmacist as well as the doctor in private decision-making in relation to the ordering of a couple's sexual affairs.</P>
    <P>This section also appears to restrict absolutely the sale of these items to chemists.  I wonder if the Minister has taken rural Ireland into account.  In rural Ireland some dispensing doctors still exist; not only do they try to cure patients but they sell drugs and medicines direct to them, so it will be difficult to implement this Bill in rural Ireland.  A dispensing doctor will not have the opportunity to opt in, because the sale can only be to chemists.  A dispensing doctor carrying a range of other drugs that a pharmacy would normally carry would be precluded under this Bill from dispensing contraceptives.  Poor rural people living in poor housing conditions and under financial constraints are the people who convinced me that there should be some sort of family planning available and these people are not catered for under this Bill.  These people have very little opportunity to go to Dublin or to the main centres.  One of the reasons in equity why there should be a realistic change in legislation was to allow these people the same opportunity that the wives of the people in this House would have of availing of these services if they wanted to.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a lot of confusion about medical card holders.  We all know that at the moment female medical card holders often have contraceptive pills prescribed for them but the doctors have to go through the farce of prescribing the pill as a cyclical menstrual regulator.  I would have thought that under the provisions of this legislation at least that would have been dispensed with.  Not only is it not dispensed with but now it can be argued that because the health boards have not been given that function and because they have been prohibited <Col N="359" /> from dispensing contraceptives in their family planning clinics, they must question very closely any prescription issued to GMS card holders for items that appear to be contraceptive in their intent because health boards have been specifically excluded from the payment for or authorisation of such things in this Bill.  That also is not designed to help the poor and less well off sections.</P>
    <P>From the doctor's point of view, if he opts out for conscientious or other reasons, if he has a large number of GMS patients on his register it could be financially damaging.  The GMS card holder, especially the male card holder, will now be told that the doctor to whom he goes for general medical services will not prescribe condoms so he will almost certainly approach the local health board to have his name transferred to another doctor.  For their principles, doctors are likely to suffer financial damage. That is an unfair position in which to place a general practitioner.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary situation in relation to sections 5 and 6.  Section 5 relates to the control of importation of contraceptives and section 6 relates to control of manufacture of contraceptives. Section 5 says, in relation to the Minister issuing a licence:</P>
    <P>. . . . grant to the person a licence authorising the importation of specified quantities of specified contraceptives if&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the Minister is satisfied that the contraceptives are required by the person for sale to persons specified in section 4 (1) (b) (i) of this Act, or</P>
    <P>In relation to the control of manufacture section 6 says:</P>
    <P>. . . . if the Minister is satisfied that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the contraceptives will be sold to persons specified in section 4 (1) (b) (i) of this Act, or</P>
    <P>(ii) the person is a person specified in the said section 4 (1) (b) (i) </P>
    <P>But it does not say all the contraceptives nor does it say only to those chemists. <Col N="360" /> As those sections now stand, as long as some of the imported contraceptives were sold to a chemist or some of the manufactured contraceptives were sold to a chemist there is no restriction on those people in distributing them to others.  I would put that down to ineptness because I cannot see any other reason why that wording is here.</P>
    <P>I agree with the concept in section 9, the making available of grants to organisations to carry out research into natural methods of family planning.  At the Fine Gael Ard Fheis last May I said that an important part of the entire function of Government should be the encouragement of research into finding efficient natural family planning methods. At that time I praised the work being done in this area in Trinity College and in the Rotunda.  We all have to recognise that while this is an extremely successful method in parts of the world, especially in the Third World, it has not achieved the same rate of success in Ireland for some extraordinary reason.  That is all the more reason that we should inject money into research into this method. There is no need for this section here. This is a little bit of cream to sell the cake.  The Minister is entitled to make grants available from his Estimates to whomever he wishes.  If the Minister has a problem as to where to channel the funds, all the Minister has to do is to channel the funds through the Medico-Socio Research Board.  As an expression of good intent, I do not disagree with this section but it would have been more honest not to have put it in at all because it is unnecessary.  If it is necessary to have this section, why has the Minister excluded the provision of funds for research into the possible harmful methods of artificial contraception? Would it not have been appropriate for the Minister for Health to write some section into this legislation suggesting that money should be made available to carry out research into those harmful methods?  That has not been dealt with at all.  Yet, this is to be a comprehensive family planning Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 11, described as dealing with conscientious objections, makes no reference to objections of conscience. It allows anybody to opt out for <Col N="361" /> whatever reason he or she wishes.  With all these reservations, the House must understand my difficulty.  I took time and trouble to point out that I was very much in favour of a regularising, an improvement and a liberalising of the law to recognise the <i>de facto</i> situation that exists.  When I look at the legislation that has been presented with its deviousness, its defects and the unfair responsibility which it places upon doctors in making them the moral policemen of the nation, the keepers of the national sexual conscience, it is very unfair.  It is unfair to introduce constitutionally suspect clauses in relation to involving doctors and pharmacies in the sphere of private morality within a marriage, the very kernal of the McGee judgement, and it is extremely unfair to leave doctors open to the criminal action effects of the Consumer Information Act.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why this debate has gone on for so long is that we have always been a predominantly male-oriented Oireachtas.  Many of the people who oppose change in this area might react differently if they were women.  In my thinking in this area I have tried to understand the role of the woman who by God's design is the child bearing half in any sexual relationship.  For 12 years I have been a member of a very big local authority.  I have a lot of practical political experience, and experience of the social problems of couples in bad housing circumstances and of couples both of whom are working in an effort to build a house and create an environment in which to provide for their family, not because they are selfish as alleged but because we all recognise the high cost of marriage and of founding a family and a home and that they want to so order and space their family that they can provide in the most efficient way for their education and living costs as they come along. I have seen the fear and disappointment that ensues when that aspiration is not achieved when a pregnancy occurs unexpectedly. I have seen young mothers old before their time because of excessive pregnancies because of being obliged to rear a large number of children in poor financial circumstances in deadful housing conditions.  I have seen all of these things that have convinced <Col N="362" /> me that we as a Parliament should endeavour especially to think of the role of the woman in this regard.</P>
    <P>It was all those things that convinced me many years ago that there was need for a compassionate change in legislation, a need to take our heads out of the sand and realise the decisions that have been taken by many thousands of young men and women who consider themselves no worse Catholics or Church of Ireland members or members of any other religion than other people. In that regard I think that the ordinary man or woman is very often in a better position to judge than many theologians because, with respect to the churches, as far as I can see there are as many views on contraception from theologians as there are methods of contraception.  I know many thousands of Irish men and women are practising contraception and are regularly attending their religious services.  I do not have a theological hangup about this&mdash;I suppose because I have a simple outlook on life&mdash;and when I found theologians with differing viewpoints in this area I decided to make up my mind as I saw fit.</P>
    <P>I remember being told many years ago that a sin is not a sin until the person involved in the act himself believes it to be a sin.  Quite obviously, many thousands of our population practise contraception and family planning and practise their religion.  They do not believe they are committing sin; I do not believe they are.  I do not believe that legislation that does not recognise that situation, that does not mend its hand and provide a realistic service for those people is bringing itself into disrepute and only causing and compounding further problems for itself.</P>
    <P>I have great reservations about this legislation for the reasons I have outlined. I wonder what sort of situation will we be in, what sort of limbo we have been speaking in this morning, if the doctors at their meeting tomorrow reaffirm their decision not to work this legislation because the nub of the legislation is the odious responsibility placed on them.  If they decide not to pick up that ball and run with it, are we in a situation where the Bill will be withdrawn or substantially amended?  It <Col N="363" /> is a ridiculous and untenable situation for me to find myself in.  I can only say if this is the best that can emanate after all these years I am saddened.  I can only hope that at some future date somebody will have more courage, more resolve and sufficient character to approach and finally settle the entire area of the State's role in deciding on the boundary line between public and private order and morality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I come to this debate with a feeling of <i>deja vu</i>, that this cannot be really happening.  In many ways I think contraception at this stage should be a dead issue.  It is only here that we can solemnly discuss, not ways of helping people to live responsible and happy lives but actually a way of limiting their chances of so doing.  After long years of discrimination in Northern Ireland when one-man-one-vote was finally granted there was a heartfelt cry of &ldquo;too little, too late&rdquo;.  If ever the people of this island could echo that comment it is now with this Bill.  In meeting the needs of Irish people on this issue, politicians&mdash;and I am not restricting my comments to one party&mdash;have failed miserably to respond responsibly and disinterestedly to the challenge of our times.  I think it was Yeats who said, when an Abbey audience disrupted a play of O'Casey: &ldquo;You have disgraced yourselves again&rdquo;. That comment would equally validly apply to what is going on here today.  It is ironic and a serious reflection on Irish people that in 1979 we should be debating an issue and trying to impose restrictive measures which did not exist in this country 50 years ago because contraceptives were then freely available with no outcry from either politician or priest.  Nobody declared 50 years ago that a permissive society was rampant or that the free availability of contraceptives was leading to widespread abortion. Family life was sacred then even with the free availability of contraceptives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking back on the 1935 Criminal Law Amendment Act, I found that the particular amendment was just put in as an incidental, that what we were concerned with had nothing to do with <Col N="364" /> family planning.  The Attorney General at the time said, and I quote him, that the Bill was &ldquo;the result of the recognition by members of all Parties of the necessity for strengthening the law dealing with sexual offences, particularly with regard to offences against young girls.  It has to be admitted that there has been an increase of offences against young girls in recent years in this country.  This increase may be attributed, with a considerable show of reason, to the altered conditions of modern life, with its greatly enlarged opportunities for amusement and enjoyment, and the mingling of the sexes without that supervision which obtained in former days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He further said:</P>
    <P>It is, I think, generally admitted that the real cure for the ills which make this Bill necessary lies with parents and those charged with the care and upbringing of young persons.  That such a measure should be introduced at all, should be, if such is necessary, a warning signal to all thinking persons and, in particular, to parents.</P>
    <P>The main provision of that Bill was in respect of extending the age of consent for girls; it had nothing to do with family planning.  Section 17 was only thrown in as an incidental and was not even discussed by the Minister who introduced that Bill.  Here we are, 50 years later, making a feeble attempt to restore the fundamental rights of people to family planning and I think failing miserably in that attempt.  Is it any wonder that we have become the laughing stock of the modern world?  That is exactly what is happening.</P>
    <P>I doubt if it is necessary to make it clear where I stand on this issue, or where my party stand, but for the record and to set the remainder of my remarks in context, let me do that now.  I remember in 1970 I first tabled a parliamentary question asking the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O Moráin, if he would consider amending the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act.  No one in the House knew what that Act was.  The Minister said there were more urgent matters for consideration by his Department.  I asked did he not think the <Col N="365" /> right to contraception was an important matter, and the Fianna Fail benches created an uproar.  They derided and ridiculed me and made me the laughing stock of the House.  When I dared to mention the word &ldquo;contraception&rdquo; there was uproar in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Robinson, Senator Horgan and Senator West endeavoured in 1971 to highlight the problem and to introduce a Bill which would guarantee fundamental human rights which had been guaranteed by the United Nations Charter which was signed by Ireland. Their Bill was not even extended the courtesy of a First Reading.  That is an indication of the closed-mind thinking of the Government.  In 1972, together with Dr. Browne, I endeavoured to introduce a similar Bill in the Dail, but without success.  We were ridiculed.</P>
    <P>These efforts were not in vain because public attention was being focused on this important issue and women, in particular, were realising that their basic human rights were being trampled on. To digress, in 1970 I went down to Clare to speak to a group.  There were middle-aged and elderly ladies there and when I talked to them about contraception, the need for it and the right to it, they did not rebel.  They did not throw me out of the hall.  They received me with courtesy and hospitality and we discussed it in a rational way.  I was astonished, and I felt that as legislators we were failing in our duty in not explaining in a rational way the need for contraception as a basic human right.</P>
    <P>It was obvious to me that a change in attitude was under way.  The subject was beginning to be discussed.  A debt of gratitude is owed to Senator Robinson for her persistent efforts in the face of mindless prejudice and obscurantism on the part of legislators.  She succeeded in taking this whole matter out of the realm of of justice and putting it into the realm of health.  A great deal of credit is due to that good lady for what she did.</P>
    <P>It was only when the Government were forced to deal with the ramifications of the McGee case that in 1974 they finally agreed to bring in their own Bill dealing with contraception.  I need hardly dwell on that fiasco, other than to say the position taken by some of our <Col N="366" /> political leaders made a mockery of the whole legislative process.  Five years later, here we are as a legislative body finding ourselves once more the object of ridicule in the eyes of the world with this pretence of a Family Planning Bill which makes our doctors the arbitrators of public morals.  Once again we are refusing to recognise the fact that contraception is a basic human right declared as such in the United Nations Charter of which Ireland was a signatory.</P>
    <P>My personal view is that access to contraceptive methods is a basic human right, no more, no less.  This is a view which I have held and publicly stated since the sixties when it was not just unpopular but unthinkable in many cases to express such a view.  This fundamental belief has been reinforced by my work as a doctor, my experience in this House, and my constituency work.  My party and I take issue with this Bill in three main areas.  First, it fails to take cognisance of the basic human rights of the individual.  Secondly, it does not take as of prime importance the question of the dignity and the autonomy of women. Thirdly, it makes indirect obeisance to the Catholic Church view.</P>
    <P>I will take first the question of the individual's rights.  The rankest political novice could tell at a glance that this Bill was not drafted to meet the needs of the people.  It is a piece of political fence-mending in the wake of the McGee case, not the greatest jumping off ground for any legislation.  It does not even end there.  The Bill is designed with a common denominator in mind, the lowest common denominator as represented by the backwoodsmen of the Fianna Fail cumainn.  Often associated with the Minister's political style is the saying about politics being the art of the possible. It is a fairly cynical definition at best.  When that definition is put to work as a guiding principle, as it evidently has been in the drafting of this Bill, that cynicism reduces all the possibilities to a singularly nasty compromise which is the best the backwoodsmen would allow through.</P>
    <P>What kind of leadership is that?  Of course politics calls for compromise, for working with groups of people who have different interests at times.  I accept that. <Col N="367" /> It does not and it should not call for this frantic pacifying of Fianna Fail grassroots supporters.  This is a challenge of leadership.  Can we listen to our people, learn from them and, at the same time, talk to them and carry them with us?  If the traffic is all one way, if the backwoodsmen are winding us up and making our wheels turn, we are not in politics but in a sophisticated protection racket.  That is what I see before me today. It reminds me of the old joke: &ldquo;You can tell I am their leader because I am behind them.&rdquo;  That is evident here.</P>
    <P>There is a capacity within the Dail and even, I suspect, within the Fianna Fail Party to produce leadership on this issue.  At the moment too many people are leading from behind the prejudices and fears of the unenlightened section of their supporters.  That is a damning indictment of legislators in this House. Not only is the Bill a sop to backwoodsmen, but it is also the subject of much clever politicking to ensure that, if it fails, its failure will be seen to lie not with the Minister but with the medical profession, the doctors.  No amount of pressure, no political blackmailing, no clever footwork will ever hide from doctors the fact that they are being asked to make moral judgments and bear the responsibility which would give credibility to the so-called politics of realism.</P>
    <P>We should keep in the forefront of our minds that we should legislate for the future and not for the past.  This Bill pretends to delve into the future, when its eye is fixed firmly on the rear-view mirror. It cribs, cabins and confines the lives of young people in order to massage the prejudices of the middle-aged and old. We have a huge proportion of younger people in our population.  In conscience, can we offer them what they would call a Mickey Mouse compromise instead of what they need and want?</P>
    <P>Not only have we a young population, but we also have a changing ethos.  We hear a great deal of waffle about ours being a pluralist society.  This is often taken to mean that we must not confine our thinking to the Catholic population but that we must think in wider terms <Col N="368" /> because we have other religious beliefs. The fact is that pluralism has an even more interesting meaning.  In Ireland we are pluralist in the sense that we have Protestants, Jews and many other believers.  We also have non-believers. We are also pluralist in the sense that, within the community of believing and practising Catholics, there are differences of views, of emphasis, and of priority.  All devout Catholics do not believe and practise along exactly similar lines.  It is that variety which must inform our thinking.</P>
    <P>Is it informing our thinking?  It is true that Article 44 is no longer with us.  Its passing was unlamented by many Catholics, including the late Cardinal Conway.  He did not see that a special relationship between Church and State was necessary for the growth of either. Article 44 now seems to be re-appearing at the back door.  We no longer have rule by the crosier because too many people like myself believe that the Church's role should not and need not be buttressed by the State's laws.  As an alternative, will we have moral judgements by courtesy of the stethoscope?  That is obvious to me in this Bill.  If politicians find themselves unwilling or unable to separate in their minds their functions as law-makers and their responsibilities as believers, we may find ourselves in that very position.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally it is the responsibility of politicians about which we are talking in this Bill.  The Catholic Church in its statement of 4 April 1978 said that according to its teaching the use of artificial contraception was wrong, that this teaching was binding on the consciences of Catholics.  But the Bishops' statement went on to say that it does not necessarily follow from this that the State is bound to prohibit the distribution and sale of contraceptives.  There are many things which the Catholic Church holds to be morally wrong which it has never suggested should be prohibited by the State.</P>
    <P>This is a clear, unequivocal statement from the Bishops that they have no intention of interfering in the legislative process.  That is an admirable statement to make.  But regrettably&mdash;despite this unequivocal statement that the Church will stand aside and permit our <Col N="369" /> legislators to legislate for all our people&mdash;some members of the Catholic Hierarchy are already introducing a note of revisionism in that policy.  They are aided and abetted by Catholic organisations in statements, loaded with emotive overtones and predicting dire consequences which will necessarily follow on such legislative change in this area&mdash;witness the leaflets being produced at the gates of this House, the linking of contraception with abortion. They say in clear, unequivocal terms: An abortion clinic in your area?  The facts say &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, there is no title on it.  The Minister, pandering to the dictates of these groups, is shirking his responsibility, deciding instead to throw the whole question over to the doctors. Irish doctors are not the arbiters of morals.  They never have been and do not want to be, as has been made painfully obvious.  Yet this Bill proposes to change their role radically, to put them in the position of making moral judgments about their patients&mdash;they must be satisfied, before authorising a prescription for contraceptives, that the person is seeking contraceptives <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes or for adequate medical reasons and in appropriate circumstances.  I do not know what the Minister means by <i>bona fide.</i> He has not spelled out in his speech this morning what he means by <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes.  Now we have entered the doctors' dilemma.  How is a doctor to determine whether a person is seeking the contraceptives <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes?  What rule or measure does the doctor use to judge appropriate circumstances?  I will say merely that, in order to be constitutional, this provision must comply with the requirements of the McGee case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="371" /> As I read the judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh in particular&mdash;and indeed of others&mdash;it is far from clear that the rights recognised in that decision are as restricted as those provided by this Bill. There is nothing in the McGee case to indicate that married couples have the constitutional right of access to contraceptives only for <i>bona fide</i> family planning purposes or for adequate medical reasons.  Indeed the whole tenor of that decision is to the effect that married couples have the right of access to contraceptives as they think proper, not for any specific purpose or purposes at all.  If this is so, that section states that it cannot be constitutional.  One can easily think of cases where married couples might wish to use contraceptives for a purpose other than family planning or of medical necessity.  For example, they may wish to have no children.  To describe the use of contraceptives as family planning in such cases would surely be an abuse of language.</P>
    <P>I mention these points because I have not been enlightened by the Minister's speech this morning.  He has not attempted to spell out what he means by <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes. If ever there was ambiguity written into a Bill, this is it.  What does the Minister mean when he says that?  Has the doctor to ensure that the person is married? These questions have not been answered.  What about the widow or widower?  What about the marriage that has broken down, though not legally? What about the thousands of annulments from the Catholic Church not recognised by the State?  What about such cases that may confront the doctor? Is the doctor being asked to interpret the law, and what happens if he interprets it wrongly?  Under this Bill he can be arraigned before the courts for authorising contraceptives to a person who is not seeking them <i>bona fide</i> for family planning purposes.  It is not enough for the Minister to say that it is not the intention of this Bill to prosecute doctors for erring in their interpretation of its provisions.  When the Bill becomes law the courts interpret the law, not the Minister's mind.  Very few of my colleagues <Col N="372" /> in the medical profession can restrain a shudder at the very idea of putting themselves in this sort of position <i>vis-a-vis</i> their patients.</P>
    <P>Neither is it a simple situation.  First of all there is the moral judgement facing the doctor: does he wish to authorise contraception to anybody?  If he does not, then his patients must go elsewhere&mdash;with the consequent personal misery, inconvenience and injury of the special and important relationship between doctor and patient.  Some patients may very well end up with a real family doctor and a contraceptive doctor which can only damage the credibility and lower the morale of the medical profession.</P>
    <P>Let us assume for the moment that the doctor goes along with the Bill's basic premise, is prepared to authorise contraceptives to married people and to those with what we might call, stable sexual relationships.  Here there is a basic infringement of privacy and dignity: dignity of the individual, infringement because we are saying: we will not treat you as an individual with individual rights but, because we have a family-orientated society, we will rate you as a family.  If it is a married couple must both partners appear in the doctor's surgery to establish the fact that they are both seeking the contraceptives <i>bona fide</i>?  What happens if one partner only appears?  Must the doctor telephone the other spouse to confirm the request? This provision is in the Bill.  If the Minister says &ldquo;No&rdquo;, what about a spouse who requires them for extramarital relationships?  Is the doctor held accountable for the legitimacy of use? Responsible doctors have been searching around for some method of shaking off this responsibility, this degrading, unrighteous tinkering with other people's lives ever since the Bill was first mooted.  How can it be done?  If one tries to put the responsibility for contraception back where it belongs, with each individual, by leaving a padful of authorisations in one's waiting room for people to take when they come to one's surgery and fill in their names, they may fall into the hands of children.</P>
    <P>Morally the thing just will not wash. Doctors are there to doctor and not to <Col N="373" /> make moral judgments which they have not the slightest desire, not to mention the competence, to make.  What is suggested here is that doctors are now the rearguard of the morality back-up.  Peter Ustinov once said that the problem with most churches is that they start out by putting down sin and end up by putting down sinners.  That is all very well if this is how a church operates, and I am not saying that that is so.  But to make doctors into the instruments of putting down sin and putting down sinners is a distortion of what the medical profession is all about.  So, morally, this Bill is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>It has certain wider implications outside of strict morality which are worth looking at.  One is the unspoken belief that adults in this country are not capable of making up their own minds or have no right to do so.  This concerns me greatly especially as it affects women.  The position of women in Ireland has changed for the better in recent years.  This is largely because of the intervention of the EEC, which is prepared to drag its members, kicking and screaming, into the latter half of the 20th century in this respect at least.  But it now appears that the rights of women and the enormous potential of women are to be sacrificed to this atavistic prejudice which is almost unspeakable in its quiet, purposeful brutality.  At the back of the failure of many attempts to create humane contraceptive legislation is the unspoken belief that our women are most manageable when they are, if not barefoot and pregnant, then at least pregnant and surrounded by children.</P>
    <P>There is more than the dignity of women at stake here.  The role and the function of doctors are at stake.  Doctors are not human dispensing machines for condoms and must not be regarded as such.  If this Bill is passed, it will make them so.  Doctors are already grossly overworked so why should we absorb much of their time in a needless rubber stamping exercise.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this Bill should come now at a time when the Department of Health, through the various <Col N="374" /> health campaigns of the Health Education Bureau, are trying to convince people that the responsibility for their own health is in their own hands.  People are being encouraged to see health as a resource that they must look after and not to see the doctor as a constant support and a fixture in their lives.  It is a weird contradiction that this Bill should at this time take the responsibility for an area of their own health out of the hands of the individual and place it squarely in the unwilling and overworked hands of the GP.  When I talk about taking responsibility out of the hands of the general public it is not just the narrow aspect of the question of contraception that I am talking about.  People who cannot be responsible for their own methods of family planning are robbed of responsibility for their own physical health, if they are women, and also of responsibility for their mental health if they already have a family or are under pressure. Most ironic of all is the fact that for many of the people looking for contraceptives a visit to the doctor will be a new thing.  They will come from the youngest and healthiest sector of our community.  We are needlessly turning them into patients, turning them into health consumers, turning them into dependants.  That is what will be achieved by this Bill.  It is a total contradiction of the admirable stance of the Department and the Health Education Bureau in the matter of individual responsibility for health.</P>
    <P>Let me touch now on the link which is being carefully forged in the public mind by those who do not wish us to create humane and proper contraceptive legislation.  That link is summed up in the nasty dual phrase, contraception and abortion.  They fit together very neatly because they have been shaped and polished and honed to fit into each other by those who do not wish us to think or talk about contraception on the basis that if we are scared of abortion then we can be scared off contraception.  I wish to make it clear that I am totally opposed to abortion.  That is why I think this is a nasty and irresponsible trick to play.  It is nasty because, if there is a connection between the two, it is that freely available contraception should <Col N="375" /> limit the demand for abortion.  A total of 2,533 Irish women went for abortions last year.  Hundreds have already gone this year.  Even that 2,533 is but the tip of the iceberg, because that figure reflects only the people who went to England and gave Irish addresses, whereas many hundreds who go abroad for abortions do not give Irish addresses for fear that they might be identified.  Already this year hundreds have gone to England to terminate pregnancies which might have been prevented by proper contraceptive methods.  These ghastly statistics should give pause to those who trivially link the two.</P>
    <P>Linking contraception and abortion is irresponsible and unproductive in the long term.  It is a re-enactment of the story of the little boy who cried &ldquo;Wolf&rdquo; so often that he wore down people's sensitivity to the whole wolf problem and when the real wolf came they did not even get out of bed in response to his yells.  If one yells abortion long enough when what is under discussion is responsible contraceptive legislation, then not only does one damage the chances of the creation of such legislation, but one desensitises everybody to the question of abortion.  I hope those people who loath abortion so much will think again on this question.  Shouting abortion when nobody is threatening it may mean that, when there is a real possibility, all of the forces that could be mobilised to oppose it will be just too bored and tired of the whole thing to come out and do something about it.</P>
    <P>I must confess that this whole issue of abortion fills me with anger at the hypocrisy of our so-called Christian society.  Last year 2,533 abortions were performed on Irish women.  As a doctor I have witnessed the stigma and the scorn attached to the unwed mother.  She is ostracised.  Her life is made a hell. What is the alternative? It is the abortion trail to Britain.  What do we do to stop it? Pious rantings and ravings about promiscuity and contraceptives never stopped one single life being aborted.</P>

      <P>With due respect, I have seen it at a much closer level when girls have come to me out of fear. Generally in our society the pregnant unmarried girl has been so ostracised because of the mores we have established in our society that she feels she must run off.  Over and over again hundreds have come to me.  I have tried to persuade them to stay here by telling them that I would try to ensure anonymity for them by getting a false address for them in London to which their parents could write.  Not too long ago one girl came to me whose brother was a priest, and I thought that surely he would understand when I spoke to him.  I had to find an anonymous place in Dublin for her to have her baby and get a false address for her in England.</P>
      <P>What are we doing about all this?  We are doing nothing.  I had no back-up services at all for these people.  The Church must come in for criticism for its failure to come to grips with this problem.  It was only when I started out on this campaign of highlighting, month in and month out, the ghastly statistics of the number of abortions on Irish girls who went to Britain that CURA was established to give people some help and guidance in this critical hour of their lives.  Only a doctor knows the crisis in a girl's mind.  She will almost attempt suicide.  Her whole life is changed and she finds herself so helpless.  We have no back-up services.  These girls come from small villages and towns.  This is what is happening here and we have, by our very standards and our saying that there must be no contraception, pointed the way to Britain for an abortion.  We, as a society, must take the blame for what has happened to so many thousands of Irish women journeying to Britain to look for abortions.</P>
      <P>In the light of that we can hardly afford the luxury of indulging in righteous indignation.  We have failed in the past and we are failing in the present to create the type of society which will cherish all children equally regardless of circumstances of birth, a society in which an unwed mother could have her child at home without being ostracised by the self-righteous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As editor of a weekly medical <Col N="377" /> magazine I had been trying to highlight these ghastly statistics and to break through the pious complacency that surrounded the problem.  I had been attempting to discourage people from turning the blind eye.  What have the restrictions on contraceptives achieved? Have they decreased the number of abortions?  Would we prefer to see unmarried girls on the abortion trail than have a situation in which there were contraceptives available to prevent such pregnancies in the first place?  That is the stark choice.</P>
    <P>The Irish Family planning Association have done a great deal in preventing an increase in the number of abortions among Irish women.  The association have provided advice, counselling and contraceptive devices but the future of the clinics is to be left to the discretion of the Minister.  He will decide whether they are to be licensed and they will not be in a position under this legislation to receive donations for contraceptives which is the only form of income they have for financing their operations. Because of this and the other restrictive clauses in the Bill I foresee the virtual closure of these clinics.  Is the Minister prepared to cope with the 40,000 or 50,000 people who attend these clinics each year?  Is he in a position to assure the House that we have a sufficient number of doctors, trained fully in all the different methods of family planning, to cope with this massive influx?  He cannot give any such assurance.  He is not in a position to provide the services that the family planning clinics have been providing.  Is he prepared to cope with the demands of the 35,000 people who receive through the post contraceptives from the Irish Family planning Association? Has he calculated the impact of these huge numbers of people attending at doctors' surgeries for prescriptions?</P>
    <P>This Bill will prevent people from receiving contraceptives through the post.  May we ask, then, what will be the position of those people who receive 12,000 condoms yearly through the post?  What will be the position of people in a small village in which there may be only one chemist to dispense contraceptives <Col N="378" /> on prescription but who, on grounds of conscience, may refuse to do so?  Are our people to subject themselves to the squinting eyes of a parochial society?  Will the whole village be informed of who is a sinner?  Is the whole situation not reminiscent of Brinsley McNamara's &ldquo;The Valley of Squinting Windows&rdquo;?  Have we any regard for the privacy and dignity of people?  At least they are guaranteed anonymity by the services provided by the family planning clinics.  Apart from a chemist opting out what is to be the position if the one doctor in a village opts out also on grounds of conscience?  Where, then, is the all-embracing and comprehensive family planning service?  The Minister has said clearly that doctors or chemists can opt out on grounds of conscience.</P>
    <P>I oppose this Bill.  It is being opposed by this party but should the legislation be steamrolled through the House by reason of the weight, moral or otherwise, of Fianna Fáil's 84 seats, we will have a political gesture but an inadequate provision for the present and future needs of our people.  There is not any evidence of sex education in schools or in the public media that will inform people and prepare them for the fundamental and vital decision regarding family planning. All we have is a contemptible example of the politics of the possible.  We should reject the Bill and the cynical mentality that brought about its introduction.  It is that mentality and not the individual's right to contraception that should be stifled in this House.  The Minister stated that he would have consultations with the Opposition parties.</P>

      <P>I apologise.  Deputy Boland stated that the Minister had said he would have consultations with us on this matter.  There should have been consultation with both parties in regard to this Bill.  I have never been consulted on the issue.  The Minister may say that it is a question of this Bill or of nothing.  The situation is better than that envisaged in the Bill.  At least there is a family planning service.  The clinics are operating. The Minister could have provided a proper and comprehensive family planning <Col N="379" /> service and considered it as part of the public health services to be operated by the health clinics in the same way as immunisations and pediatric assessments, for instance, are undertaken. Perhaps it would have involved a little extra cost to the Exchequer but we would have been providing a service not only in terms of family planning but for couples who have fertility problems and who could have consulted with doctors, nurses and other people concerned in this area.  This would have involved a slight change in the Health Act but it would have been worth while.  In such a comprehensive scheme people attending the health centres could be provided with whatever advice, information or contraceptives they required.  We would have supported such a move and for once we would have been seen as a legislative body who are mature in our thinking concerning the needs of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are in the EEC we should keep in line with thinking in Europe.  There is pressure on us from Europe to produce a family planning Bill but I contend that we are being ridiculed by our colleagues in the other member states in relation to what we are doing in this area.  I should have thought that the leadership would have come from the Minister for Health, bringing with him his backbenchers and, in turn, the people. If there is any party to do that it is Fianna Fáil but it is regrettable that they have failed to grasp the nettle.  I am aware of the sort of situation that can exist in a village in rural Ireland but with a little more education in the whole area of family planning the Government could have come out of this situation much better and could have enhanced their prestige.  But they have failed to bring in a comprehensive family planning Bill that would have ensured normal basic human rights for our people.  What we want here is proper legislation but once something is on the Statute Book it may not be changed for a long time.  It took 44 years, for instance, to even try to change the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935.  It is not good enough, therefore, for the Minister to say that we will start off with this Bill <Col N="380" /> because otherwise we will have nothing. Another 44 years will take us well into the next century.  That is a long time to wait for basic human rights and, apparently, we have another 44 years to wait for them.  That is a terrible indictment of our legislators.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Church here has contributed enormously to this sex-is-sinful syndrome.  Everybody appears to be obsessed with sex, the mingling of the sexes, boys and girls mingling together. We have a lot to answer for because we have tried to keep the young girls and boys of Ireland apart.  We have developed an unnatural approach to sex as such and this sex-is-sinful syndrome is very prevalent here as a result.  The Church never speaks out enough against crimes of violence or other matters such as alcoholism, the biggest illness here but it is always sex, sex, sex.  Nobody can deny that it was made clear to us all that sex was wrong.  We were told that the natural thing was wrong and children were brought up with an unhealthy approach to it.  That is what has distorted our way of thinking.  We are recreating this situation because this is not an unnatural thing.  It is a lovely change to see boys and girls of 15 talking to each other.  Not too long ago such conversation was forbidden here; they were kept in different schools and we did not have a co-educational system.  The results of all that can be seen in our thinking in this Bill.  We are frightened now to come through because we know we have created this thinking among our people and are afraid to tell them that what they are thinking is wrong.  We are afraid to tell them that they must change their thinking.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity to be legislators in the real sense of the word and to say that as legislators we are going to bring our constituents with us, not follow them.  If we did that we would be respected by the electorate.  Legislators need respect by the electorate but that is what is missing here.  We capitulated on many issues.  This morning we capitulated on the farm levy issue, yielded to the interests concerned.  This capitulation is very bad and it is bringing this Chamber and the Government into disrepute.  We are yielding on issues even <Col N="381" /> though we know it is not in our best interests. The farm levy was introduced with the best of intentions and it could have been modified but now we have decided to capitulate.  We need respect but we do not have it and are not doing anything to enhance our position with the public.  Is it any wonder that people laugh at us and say: &ldquo;One cannot trust a politician&rdquo;.  It is a shame that that can happen.</P>
    <P>The doctors will make a decision on this matter tomorrow.  I am aware of the attempts that have been made to try, by every means possible, to get them to agree on this matter.  In my view they would be making a grave mistake in supporting or even working this measure on behalf of the Minister.  If they support it they will regret it.  The consequences will be incalculable.  They will go down in my estimation as an independent body who can speak for themselves.  If that happens I could not in conscience look upon them as the special profession that they are because they would be pandering to the Minister.  If that happens we will be going backwards and we could talk about people on arriving at Dublin airport turning back their watches 50 years.  That is what we will be doing if we agree to the Bill and it is wrong that we should consider that.  The doctors will lose my respect as a profession if they decide to operate the Bill.  I want to make that clear, not on party grounds but because it is a farcical attempt to solve a serious problem.  This Bill is making a mockery of the whole thing and because of that we have a duty to vote against it.  I wonder if it is possible to amend it to make it workable.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about those in the lower income group who need help.  The general medical service patients are not provided for in the Bill.  At present they can get the pill but not any other method of contraception.  The pill is not the answer to contraception.  It can be and is dangerous.  The side effects are many and serious.  We have doctors here ordering wrong oral contraceptives with too high a dose of estrogen.  I do not think we should risk our lower income group to the hazards of the pill.  They should be equally entitled to other <Col N="382" /> methods of contraception free.  We are offering them the pill.</P>

      <P>Ambulances are built for the health boards and the Dublin Fire Brigade to a standard specification by Hanlons Limited, Longford.  The ambulances are built on a Ford Transit chassis which is imported from Britain to the Ford factory in Cork.  Because of an industrial dispute at the Ford plant in Britain from October to December 1978, there were delays in delivering 14 chassis through Hanlons, with consequent delays in the delivery of ambulances to health boards.  Fords have stated that the earliest date by which they expect these chassis to be delivered to Hanlons is mid-March 1979.  We will do what we can after that to get them as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>General anaesthetic facilities will be provided in the dental suite of the new health centre in Tullamore, now nearing completion.  In addition improved theatre facilities are planned for Tullamore Hospital and these could be made available for dental patients, if necessary.

      <P>These people received increases, but merely to compensate for the abolition of food subsidies.  Their actual income did not increase, but there was an increase in terms of money which put them outside the eligibility limit for medical cards.  Thousands of people are in this situation.</P>

      <P>I see the point the Deputy is making, but I am not aware that there is any particular substance in it.  The guidelines were increased at the same time.  The social welfare allowances were increased in the budget, <Col N="399" /> but they will not come into operation until 1 April so there could not be anybody who is affected by them as yet.  In the meantime, increased guidelines have come into operation since January.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of compensation for the phasing out of food subsidies was dealt with fairly comprehensively in the budget in a number of ways.  There were increases of 16 per cent and 12 per cent for social welfare recipients.  In addition to that, as far as those same people with families were concerned and lower income group earners, the children's allowance increases were intended to compensate for food subsidy reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the revised rates of eligibility for medical cards came into effect on 1 January and reflected increases in the CPI up to mid-November and those increases in the CPI did not include increases arising from the removal of food subsidies?  Therefore there is a case for a further revision to take account of the changes since then as a result of the removal of food subsidies.</P>

The process of having the compulsory pasteurisation of milk introduced throughout the country is going ahead and local authorities have responded to my request to apply for special designation orders in respect of their areas of jurisdiction.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau (Establishment) Order (S.I. No. 22 of 1975) gives the Minister wide powers of control in relation to the bureau's spending of its allocation.  The Order provides, <i>inter alia</i>, (i) that the bureau shall submit to the Minister such information regarding the performance <Col N="417" /> of its functions as the Minister may from time to time require; and (ii) that the Minister may, as he thinks fit, declare that any of the powers vested in the bureau in relation to the appointment and employment of staff shall be exercisable only with his consent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that there was any element of criticism of that particular activity by the Health Education Bureau.  I would have thought that it was a particularly desirable production because it is intended primarily for general practitioners.  I would regard it as beneficial and advantageous that as many general practitioners as possible would use that diary and be constantly reminded of the desirability of impressing good health practices on their patients.  It surprises <Col N="418" /> me genuinely that the Deputy would criticise that particular activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I asked the Minister if he was aware of any criticism.  I did not express any.  The other area which has been the subject of some criticism is the involvement of the bureau in the sponsorship of show jumping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was an excellent decision by the Health Education Bureau.  This indoor show jumping event was the first ever in this country.  It was a major sporting event.  Through the efforts of the bureau and other interested parties we succeeded in having it and ensuring that it was sponsored entirely without any participation by a tobacco or drink company.  In addition, I would have thought that because of the television and other media coverage it got it was an excellent occasion on which to preach the positive health message.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept, as I am sure the House does, the Minister's appreciation of the widespread publicity which the event received but did the bureau or the Minister not find any embarrassment in the fact that the majority of the main prizewinners were horses named after a tobacco firm and that the amount of advertising they received was at least as great as, if not greater than what the Health Education Bureau received?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that particular tobacco company would receive that publicity anyway because from their own point of view they were clever enough to select some of the best horses in the country and use them for their own shrewd commercial advertising purposes. Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about that.  So far as the event is concerned I am quite satisfied that participation by the Health Education Bureau in it was absolutely beneficial and did give them the opportunity of focussing an enormous amount of media attention on their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>Would the Minister not consider that money might have been spent better on a sport with a major participation element on the part of the general public?

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>A scheme of conciliation and arbitration is available to the nursing profession.  I am aware that this scheme is greatly valued by the representatives of organised nurses.  Following <Col N="420" /> the expression towards the end of last year of dissatisfaction among the nursing profession, with the unanimous agreement of all the representatives of the organised nurses, a special conciliation committee was established under the scheme to carry out a full scale review of the pay and conditions and the status of the profession.  All the parties concerned are determined that the committee will complete its work at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>I would mention, for the information of the House, that there was a pay settlement in September last year involving increases ranging up to 15 per cent in addition to the standard increases provided for in the National Pay Agreement. When I met the representatives of all the organisations catering for nurses last December, in an effort to improve the atmosphere in which the work of the special committee could take place, I offered to provide funds to give an additional element of retrospection for part of this settlement.  This offer was accepted by all parties as being contingent on going through the necessary procedures under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme, to ensure compliance with the terms of the National Agreement.  I am informed that the necessary procedures have now been almost completed and I expect that the arrears will be paid immediately following the meeting of the Staff Negotiations Board on 8 March.</P>
      <P>The special conciliation committee which has been set up to investigate the principles which should govern the remuneration of nurses and certain other staff presents a unique opportunity for the profession; it provides a forum in which to establish the place of the nurse and the other staff concerned in the community.  On my own behalf and on behalf of the management side, I have given an unequivocal commitment to support its work to the full.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether the sweetener, as it was described at the time, which was publicised last Christmas as a special payment to nurses has yet been paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am dealing <Col N="421" /> with in the reply.  It is a retrospective 5 per cent.  It was my hope and my intention that it would have been paid at Christmas time but, unfortunately, and mainly because of the views of the representatives of the nurses' organisations it had to be processed through the full machinery.  It will certainly be paid within the week commencing 8 March.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying they held it up.  The Government sanctioned it.  The Deputy will recall that we provided money in last year's estimate for this payment, but the representatives of the nurses' organisation were anxious that it should be processed through the conciliation and arbitration machinery. Unfortunately that was the principal cause of the delay in having it paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the main part of the question, the Minister and the House will recall a debate here before Christmas.  It was suggested that this body could be in an industrial dispute with the Minister by the end of March unless there were specific proposals in relation to their pay and conditions.  Is the Minister aware of moves which appear to be afoot to bring that matter to a head?  Can he say if any action is envisaged by his Department to head off that very undesirable situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the situation and I am in constant touch with the different representatives of the nursing profession about it.  It is a complex situation.  As the Deputy knows, early on in the proceedings I offered the nurses an opportunity to proceed on two different fronts.  On the one hand, I offered them a special commission to look into their status and their relative position in the community.  Side by side with that, I suggested that they <Col N="422" /> could go to conciliation and arbitration on pay.  That proposal, which I still think was probably the best, was rejected by the nursing profession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In its place, with the universal agreement of all the representatives of all the nursing organisations, we established this conciliation and arbitration committee.  That committee is doing both jobs.  It is evaluating the status of nurses in the overall situation and, at the same time, dealing with pay and conditions.  I hope it will be able to report fairly quickly, but it has a very important task.  I think the Deputy will support me in this.  It offers a unique opportunity to the nursing profession, which they were looking for, to get a full-scale investigation, assessment and evaluation of their situation.  Many people on the representative side of the nurses' organisations think it is worth while taking time over that.  However, I know nurses in some areas are anxious for some more immediate results.  There is a meeting tomorrow of the special conciliation committee at which I hope the situation will be brought forward a bit further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment, on procedural grounds, has been ruled out of order.  The points I make relate to some extent to the amendment I wished to introduce, but of course are related to the existing section 1 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In speaking on the Second Stage I took the view that the constitutional amendment before the House, although welcome and desirable, was much too restrictive.  My attitude is that a golden opportunity is being lost.  We have the opportunity in this generation to provide further constitutional guarantees for all adoption orders.  We have the opportunity also to provide the constitutional framework for the development of our laws in regard to children in general and adoption in particular.  It may be another generation before a similar opportunity arises.  Therefore my approach is to appeal to the Minister to further copper-fasten existing adoption orders and, in addition, to provide the constitutional basis for the extension of our laws.  I do not accept that the Bill, as presently framed, does this.  It is widely considered that there are circumstances or exceptional cases where the adoption of legitimate children should be permitted. It is generally accepted that we need more child-centred legislation to be enacted and constitutionally guaranteed to cover the exceptional cases as mentioned in Article 42 of the Constitution:</P>
      <P>where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children,. . . . </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made it clear that the present Bill cannot guarantee that there never again will be a danger of an adoption order being held to be invalid.  He stated that it was impossible to provide such a guarantee unless we provide a constitutional time limit.  The Minister stated that there was no way realistically that we could offer to adopters an absolutely water-tight guarantee that an adoption cannot be challenged.  I believe that this Bill and this section closes one door but that there are further doors which could and should be closed at this stage.  A vehicle for so doing is an addition to Article 42, which I have suggested. Apart from the circumstances outlined in the McL. case there are <Col N="437" /> dangers where adoptive parents may be exposed to harassing and distressing litigation after bonds of affection have been formed between them and their adoptive child.  In that situation, of course, the position of the child has to have our careful consideration, sympathy and support.  For instance, what would be the situation if a child genuinely thought to be or presumed to be illegitimate at the time of adoption subsequently was proved to be legitimate? Would the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the family, as provided in Article 41 of the Constitution, then supersede the adoption procedure permitting an order to be made for the return of the child from the adoptive parents?</P>
    <P>Any system is subject to human error. If administrative mistakes are made, surely we must make every effort at this stage to ensure that constitutionally the hands of the Supreme Court are not bound.  There is also the situation that there is discrimination under our present system against certain children who are legitimate or presumed to be legitimate. As things stand under our present legal system their only options are institutional life, fostering, or removal from the State for adoption elsewhere. Surely this is not a situation we can accept. Surely it is a situation crying out to heaven for remedy.  We will not be able to change our laws to deal with the situation unless we provide now the constitutional framework.  This is our opportunity and I beg the Minister not to let it pass.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech dealt at length with the difficulties associated with making the child's welfare the first and paramount consideration.  In a closely-argued and well-researched speech he dealt with the legal obstacles to providing for this.  The proposal which I am putting before the House informally and asking the Minister to consider will, I believe, overcome this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am allowing the Deputy to make his statement but I would point out to him that we cannot discuss an amendment that has been ruled out of order.  All of the Deputy's statement is on that amendment. <Col N="438" /> I am giving him the latitude to make his statement and then we will move on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  If the Chair will allow me a few minutes I will cover the point I have to make.  What I believe is important is that the Minister be committed to the course I have in mind.  If he is, I have no doubt that the constitutional and legal means can be devised to achieve the desired objective. The proposal I make is one which, with all humility, I suggest is one way of achieving the desired result.  I am totally open to any counter-suggestion from the Minister or otherwise.  Basically we have to find a <i>via media</i> between the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the family and the individual rights of the child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us are unanimous on the value in our society of having the family as the basic unit.  Clearly this principle must be supported constitutionally, legally and in our public attitudes.  Therefore, the removal from the Constitution of the words &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo; is not the way to tackle the problem. However, at this point I would refer to a common misconception in regard to these words.  The rights are not conferred by the Constitution; they are recognised by the Constitution.  There is a considerable difference here in reading Article 41.  That Article is the constitutional recognition of a pre-existing position of rights which presumably are conferred on the family under natural law.  These rights are not conferred by the Constitution; they are recognised by the Constitution.  This is an important point.  My proposal is to add a subsection to Article 42.5.  This subsection already provides for the position where in exceptional cases parents fail in their duty towards their children.  Therefore my proposal is to extend this section by providing that the machinery of Article 41 cannot be used to invalidate a law enacted by the Oireachtas expressed to be by virtue of existing Article 42.5.  I believe this could be the answer to the search for a balance between the rights of the family and the individual rights of the child.  The proposal, if accepted, would continue to provide recognition <Col N="439" /> for the inalienable and imprescriptible rights of the family but would provide that such recognition would not invalidate laws dealing with adoption or otherwise with the child's welfare.  The net result of my proposal is to continue the recognition of the family and its rights&mdash;in which I believe totally&mdash;but at the same time would permit us to guarantee and develop our laws in regard to children on a child-centred basis.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to point out&mdash;-and I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair&mdash;in regard to this Bill, that this is 1979, the International Year of the Child.  The brochure produced for the National Streering Committee under the auspices of the Minister for Health suggests that this is the year for the Government organisations and individuals of our country to examine the special problems and needs of children and to work together on a constructive and practical programme for their benefit both at home and abroad.  I believe that this is such an opportunity which we should not let pass.  While I accept that progress is being made in regard to this Bill in the section we are dealing with which incorporates the Schedule providing that adoption orders cannot be declared invalid solely because the Adoption Board is not in court, I would urge the Minister to use this opportunity to provide for the further copperfastening of adoption orders and, at the same time, to provide a constitutional framework which would permit our adoption laws and laws relative to children in general to develop.</P>

      <P>So far as the Chair is concerned I gave the Deputy permission to read his statement. It was on the amendment and was not in order.  If the Minister wishes to reply to that point he may do so but that finishes it at that stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins) Gerard Collins">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for his indulgence in giving me the opportunity to reply to the comments of Deputy O'Keeffe.  I must say that I am not at all sure that Deputy O'Keeffe is fully aware of the ramifications of what is involved <Col N="440" /> in the amendments which he had hoped to move here this afternoon.  If he were aware the Deputy would not be as anxious as he seems to be to speak on it.  I find this amendment completely unacceptable because it would enable the Oireachtas to legislate in such a way as to abrogate entirely the rights of the family which are at present guaranteed by Article 41 of the Constitution.  Any Act of the Oireachtas which professes to be made by virtue of what is now section 5 of Article 42 would not be open to challenge in the courts no matter how flagrantly it cut across the guarantees in Article 41.  The Act might have very little to do with Article 42 even though it professes to be made by virtue of that Article and it would still have the effect of nullifying Article 41.</P>
      <P>The amendment that Deputy O'Keeffe has commented on is modelled on Article 28 of the Constitution which frees from challenge as to its constitutionality any legislation passed by the Oireachtas in time of war or in time of armed rebellion which is expressly for the purpose of securing public safety and the preservation of the State.  That provision, however, was intended to cater for exceptional circumstances where the life of the nation is threatened and is totally inappropriate as a headline for the provision in the Constitution for what is intended to have permanent effect.  The amendment, far from guaranteeing any rights whatsover to any child or to any adult, would actually withdraw the constitutional guarantees which are already there and instead give the Oireachtas a free hand in a vital area.  The approach represented by the amendment is in marked contrast to what was in the Private Members' Bill some months ago which sought to strengthen the control of the Constitution over the legislator and not to weaken it.  The opposite would happen if we were to adopt this suggestion of Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could argue that the Oireachtas should not be trammelled at all by a written Constitution because the Parliament in the United Kingdom is not so trammelled but it would be entirely anomalous to have a written Constitution which provides very explicit guarantees indeed in an area which is <Col N="441" /> basic to social life and then to provide that the Oireachtas is free to disregard those guarantees.  That is why I say that I am not at all sure that Deputy O'Keeffe is fully aware of what would have happened if the amendment which he commented on were accepted and made part of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that Article 42 deals solely with those exceptional cases where the parents, for physical or moral reasons, fail in their duty towards their children.  There is no question whatever of abrogating in any way the rights of the family.  I specifically make the point that I wish to retain the inalienable and imprescriptable rights of the family.  I am merely trying to find a solution to those exceptional cases as referred to in section 2 of Article 42.  I put this proposal forward in that context only, totally accepting the need to retain the family as a basic unit of society but, at the same time, seeking to find a <i>via media</i> so that the individual rights of a child can be upheld.  I am very much open to the Minister coming back with any further proposal if he is of the one mind with me that we need more child-centred legislation; that we need, in this International Year of the Child, to turn our thoughts more towards having legislation which is designed more for the child's welfare.  I accept that any such proposal should not interfere with the right of the family.  I would ask the Minister to put his mind along the same wavelength as mine and use his own brains and those of his Department to find such a proposal.  Then I would be happy that I have done my job.</P>

      <P>This amendment refers to the regulations in the lump sum ceiling and to the point which was raised by Deputy Ryan on Committee Stage.  I should like to point out that the question of earnings in transportable goods industries is not the only factor that I would have to take into account in regard to any change in the regulations.

      <P>In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="443" /> 12.  Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a dismissal (or termination of employment) occurred before the commencement of this section,</P>
    <P>(b)  the employee concerned would have been entitled to redundancy payment if section 10 or 11 of this Act had been in operation on the date of dismissal or termination of employment, and</P>
    <P>(c)  the employee concerned had appealed to the Tribunal before the 1st day of January, 1979, but a decision relating to that appeal had not been made before the commencement of this section,</P>
    <P>the Tribunal shall, as soon as practicable after the commencement of this section, make a decision relating to that appeal as if sections 10 and 11 of this Act had been in operation on the date of dismissal or termination of employment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment refers to a problem that has arisen in the application of the original Act.  As I said last week, I am not unsympathetic to trying to solve the problems created for a small number of people.  Consequently, I am submitting this amendment to the House.  It extends from four weeks to 52 weeks the period during which a person on non-statutory short-term employment&mdash;for instance, a three-day week&mdash;may continue on such short time while preserving the right to claim redundancy.  Decisions are awaited in respect of a number of cases that have been held up for a considerable time.  Because of the uncertainty of the situation I consider it only just that the tribunal be entitled to avail of the new provision in reaching a final decision. Therefore, I am accepting the suggestion made last week by Deputy Ryan concerning the payment of moneys directly from the fund.  The existing provision will cater for that situation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> In page 8, in column (2), in the reference opposite schedule 3 in column (1), after the amendment of paragraph 4 to insert the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The insertion after paragraph 4 of the following paragraph:</P>
    <P>`4A.  Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 4 (and anything in clause (b)  of the definition of &ldquo;date of dismissal&rdquo; in section 2), the period of notice due to an employee under section 4 (2) (a)  of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, but not given by the employer, shall, where the Tribunal so orders, be allowed as continuous service for redundancy purposes where, but for the failure of the employer to comply with the provisions of that Act, the employee would have qualified for redundancy payment.' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is fairly simple and I expect it will be acceptable to the House. On Committee Stage I undertook to consider certain aspects of the minimum notice provision.  I was not entirely happy with the Committee Stage amendment. I was concerned about a particular area.  This was the position of people who failed by a very narrow period of time to become entitled to redundancy payments.  On the basis of an examination I have carried out I am suggesting now that a period of notice which an employer failed to give under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, be allowed as reckonable service for redundancy purposes.</P>
    <P>A problem can arise if a person is slightly short of the required period of 104 weeks and fails to receive the statutory entitlement by way of notice under the 1973 Act.  The amendment takes care of such cases by allowing the appeals tribunal to hold that the period of statutory minimum notice not given to such an employee shall be included as continuous service for the purpose of entitlement.</P>

However, my major concern is that the Bill fails to deal with a major problem in the area of redundancy, that is, the temptation on the part of some workers to go so far as to conspire towards their redundancy. This is a very difficult question and I am not sure of how it should be coped with. One can visualise a situation in which for instance a father whose oldest child was being married would find a lump sum of, say, £3,500 to be very tempting. Unfortunately, the jobs that are lost in this way are very often much more productive than some of the jobs being created by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister so far has not been able to meet any of the points we have been making on this amendment but I hope he will see his way to meet some of the suggestions. So far, the Minister's case has been that the amendment is not necessary to achieve what we seek, that it is not necessary to put the words we are suggesting into the Bill to achieve our objective. It is my view that our objective is not being achieved as the Bill stands. There is no reason to believe that, if the Bill is passed without the amendment, our objective will be achieved in the future.  In the advisory service and under the courses operated by country committees of agriculture there should be an element of preventive veterinary medicine. The courses may contain an element of advice on preventive veterinary medicine but they are provided by persons who are not part of the service.  The services of persons in the district veterinary offices are sought but their skill and training is not in the area of teaching or in the area of imparting knowledge.  Their concern is purely with the administration of the existing regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say that the district veterinary offices are in a position to give that advice but officers there are so bogged down with administrative work in relation to the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication schemes that even if they had the training to give this advice they do not have the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our proposal is that the terms of reference of the new body should be extended to give them a mandate <Col N="447" /> to give advice in preventive veterinary medicine.  We are all aware how important prevention is in illness and the Minister earlier adverted to the high loss occurring here through calf-mortality. He told us that many calves die because of inadequate knowledge on the part of the farmers looking after them.  Those farmers are not getting the proper advice on preventive measures to be adopted in cases of illness.  It is not enough to tell farmers that they can go to the open day at Grange where they would get advice on calf management, because Grange in County Meath is of little use to farmers in the west or south. We want a service which will obviate the necessity to call the veterinary surgeon in every county.  Our amendment seeks to give a mandate to the advisory service to give advice to farmers.  The fact is that there is not a veterinary surgeon employed by the advisory service in any county.  How could they possibly give advice on veterinary matters when there is not a qualified person among their number?  Whenever they want to give advice they have to call on the district veterinary office who are concerned with the administration of disease eradication programmes and have no mandate in the area of advice or of education.  The case I am making is a very good one and my amendment is reasonable because it does not require them to do it in every county. It simply says &ldquo;the lectures or courses may include preventive veterinary medicine&rdquo;.  Further on they say that the &ldquo;advice given may include preventive veterinary medicine&rdquo;.  We are not requiring them to do it in every county; we are merely saying that they may do so.</P>
      <P>I believe such a section is necessary to make it quite clear that the intentions of this House were that advice on preventive veterinary medicine should be given as part of the functions of the advisory services.  If it is not in this Bill, it is likely that representatives of the profession might say at a later date &ldquo;You are not entitled to start employing vets or giving advice in veterinary matters.  That is a matter for the private practitioner.  It is not in the Act, so you are not entitled to do it&rdquo;.  I can see that happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> If, in five years time, a Minister were seeking to have preventive veterinary medicine included in the work of the advisory services he might find that the profession could stop him because it is not in the Act.  I am not saying they will do that.  I hope they would not adopt that attitude and I have no reason for believing they would adopt it but, in drafting legislation, one must provide for every contingency.  In the absence of statutory provision allowing&mdash;I stress the word &ldquo;allowing&rdquo;&mdash;the advisory service to give advice and the education service to give education on preventing veterinary medicine, I do not believe we can be sure that it can or will be done. That is why I believe this is an essential amendment and I hope the Minister will accept the case I am making.  I am not making it in any sense as a criticism of him.  It is something I hope he will be able to accept as being constructive and to the benefit of agriculture and of all parties in this House.</P>
    <P>The second point I am concerned about is that AnCOT should be in a position to give courses specially designed for employed farm workers.  I am not saying that employed farm workers are not catered for in some of the courses being given in agriculture but the majority of the people taking part in these courses are self-employed farmers or farmers' sons.  Why is that the case? In some areas, such as the western counties, there may not be a sufficient number of employed farm workers and there would not be a demand for courses for these workers but, in other parts of the country, for example, Leinster, where there are substantial numbers of employed farm workers the courses are organised at times and under conditions which appeal to farmers, not farm workers.  They are run during the day when a farm worker may not be able to be released from his employment to attend. There are no provisions for compensating an employer if he let a farm worker off to attend a course.  He may not need to be compensated in some cases but in others he might require compensation because he could be at a loss by releasing the farm worker to attend a course to acquire additional skills. The farm worker could them move on to <Col N="449" /> more remunerative employment.</P>
    <P>There should be a special mandate for the authority to provide courses.  In some cases employers might not want their workers to get involved in such courses.  The authority should have a mandate to ensure that the professional competence of employed farm workers is raised to the maximum extent so that they can make the best contribution to agriculture and command the best wages or salaries that can be obtained for their skills.  At the moment that is not happening.</P>
    <P>This amendment would allow the authority to make arrangements to have courses specially designed for farm workers if, in respect of any part of the country, they are satisfied the employed farm workers are not being adequately catered for in existing courses and lectures provided on a general basis.  As I said, such arrangements need not be made in every country.  They should be made if and when the authority are satisfied that the existing courses are not meeting the need.  This is not an unreasonable amendment.  We are not tying the arms and legs of the authority in this matter.  We are not saying they must do it whether it is reasonable or not.  We are merely saying they must do it if they are satisfied it is necessary.  That puts the discretion in the hands of the authority and points them in what I believe is the right direction.  This amendment is framed to be reasonable and not to damage the structure of the legislation.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting it, or that he would introduce an amendment worded in the way his advisers would see as more appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not answered the suggestion in my amendment that special attention should be given to those farmers whose performance in terms of the income they derive from their land falls furthest below the physical potential of the land.  We all have information available through the soil surveys carried out by the Agricultural Institute in Wexford.  We know what the agricultural potential of various types of soil is.  We know how many cows land can carry.  We know the maximum grain yield that can be achieved in various <Col N="450" /> parts of the country.  We also know that actual performance falls very far below that.  There is one midland county&mdash;not Kildare&mdash;I will not mention the county&mdash;where the potential is furthest from being achieved.  In another county, Cork, the nearest to the potential of the land is being achieved.  The difference between the two countries is very great. In terms of optimum use of our natural resources our advisory and educational efforts should be concentrated in those counties and among those farm families which are furthest from achieving their potential.  There should be a deliberate policy of concentrating manpower resources where the greatest return can be obtained.  It is to achieve that end that this amendment is being introduced.</P>
    <P>This amendment is not simply and solely concerned with the potential of the land.  It is also concerned with the economic potential of the land.  There may be areas where there are many farmers working, where there are manpower or financial resources, large cash balances in the bank and those cash balances are not being used to develop the land to the full.  That could be a consideration for the specific direction of advisory and educational resources to those areas.</P>
    <P>The distribution of advisers is not revised on a rational basis.  There are some counties which have large numbers of advisers and a very favourable ratio of advisers to farmers, although they make good use of them, there is not the same need for them as there is in other parts of the country.  Because the tradition has been to think of this service on a county basis, if a particular county gets a certain number of advisers they will always keep that number, regardless of changes that may occur or the growth of new needs elsewhere.  A particular county may have 25 advisers; the agricultural population may have fallen drastically in the county, optimum production may have very nearly been achieved and the return in terms of economic output per adviser may have fallen, yet the advisers are not shifted from that county to other counties.</P>
    <P>I realise that for any Minister to try to shift advisers from one county to <Col N="451" /> another, to reduce staff in one county and increase it in another, is to take a very grave political stance.  I do not believe it would be an easy stance for the present Minister or any successor to adopt.  However, we are setting up an authority who are to be independent in these matters and they will be able to take decisions which would be politically difficult for us as Members of this House.  This amendment will direct them in making assessments about manpower distribution to look at the economic potential of different counties.  If there are some counties whose economic potential is not being achieved, this amendment will direct the authority to see that advisers are moved into such counties.</P>
    <P>I want to make a general point which relates to some amendments I introduced which were ruled out of order. It is essential to set targets for the advisory service in each part of the country in regard to agricultural growth.  Advisers should not be able simply to limp along in a particular county without a return in terms of growth in production in the area for which they are responsible. If a large number of advisers are working in a particular county, there should be seen to be a response in terms of increased production in that county; if that is not happening, we should look at the situation.  We should have an agricultural plan in each county with targets for that county in respect of different commodities.  Over a five-year period we should see if the advisory and educational services are working there. If it is manifest that the targets have not been achieved, whereas in another county with the same resources in terms of numbers of advisers and educational facilities available the targets have been achieved, there must be a case for reassessment of the resources as between those two counties.  There is no way in which that issue would come to light unless there is a county agricultural development plan with specific targets for each county.  This is something towards which the Government may be working in the context of their announcements in the White Paper.  If not, I would urge them to consider this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="452" /> The Minister has not dealt fully with the case we have made in the fourth part of this amendment.  It is a very polyglot amendment containing four quite disparate parts.  The point I wish to make concerns the farm home management service.  This is a service which gives advice not on farming matters but to farmers' wives or to farm families on how to manage the home, how to budget properly, the kinds of food which are good for children and the way to lay out a kitchen from the point of view of minimising labour.  As things are developing, the husband could now be doing much of the work.  These are the things the service is setting out to do. They do it by means of lectures and 100-hour courses for wives.  In my opinion it is a very valuable service.  What we are questioning in this amendment is whether it is being provided for the people who are most in need of it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that anybody could benefit from these courses, whether male or female.  Given that the number of farm home management advisers is limited, as is the amount of money available from the Exchequer for this service, is it right that it should be confined only to farm families?  I contend that deprived families who are not from a farming background and may not live in rural areas have a greater need of this sort of advice than the majority of farm families.  I know from my own limited experience in this area that lack of ability and knowledge about how to manage the home is one of the most common reasons for deprivation.  The reason so many children do not succeed at school is that they do not receive proper nutrition in the morning before going to school.  I am talking now about poor families.  I produced figures in this House when discussing the provision of free milk showing the number of children who go to school every morning without having had any breakfast.  The number is alarmingly high.  The reason is not that the parents cannot afford to pay for breakfast but they are giving them the wrong sort of food&mdash;chips, for instance&mdash;at night, instead of giving them the right sort of food at the same cost at a time when they need it most.  This is not due to lack of love on the part of the <Col N="453" /> mother but simply lack of knowledge as to what should be done.</P>
    <P>I believe this service could provide advice for deprived, poor families throughout the country.  It is a pity these advisers are not able to help non-farming families on a systematic agreed basis in conjunction with the health boards.  The amendment proposes that this advice may be given by the authority, by arrangement with the appropriate health board, to needy families of a nonagricultural or non-rural background.  It is not saying that it should be done holus-bolus and that the service should cease to be a farm home management service.  Before any advice is given to a non-farming family, it is necessary that the authority should agree to it and that the health board should also agree.</P>
    <P>There is nothing here which states that the health board should not have to compensate the authority for the fact that their advisers are giving advice to people who are not strictly the responsibility of AnCOT and giving it on behalf or at the request of the health board.  There is no reason why the health board should not compensate the authority for the fact that their staff are being used to do work which is primarily a health board function.  The Minister was worried that the acceptance of this amendment would mean that it would no longer be a farm service, that it would not come within the mandate of this authority and that the money would be provided in the agricultural Vote for something which is not essentially agricultural.  That is an objection not to the principle but to the practicality of this seggestion.  The objection could be met by the health board undertaking the financial responsibility for reimbursing AnCOT for any services rendered by the farm home management advisers to the health board in relation to deprived families.</P>
    <P>That would get over the Minister's difficulty without dividing the service.  It would be a pity if the situation had to develop where the health board had to employ their home management advisers in addition to others being employed by AnCOT, one dealing with non-farm <Col N="454" /> families and the other dealing with farm families.  That would be a gross waste of resources.  We have already an existing service under the county committees of agriculture and it should be used to help both farm and non-farm families where they need advice on home management. My amendment seeks to achieve this in a practical way and I hope that the Minister, on reflection, will see his way to meeting this.  If he does he will be doing something small but significant to deal with a genuine social problem.  It is not an agricultural problem&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the amendment.  As I stated previously, not all of the courses available have been open to agricultural workers.  As Deputy Bruton pointed out, it may be necessary to provide for payment of a kind that will allow for substitution so that the worker concerned would not be at a loss with regard to wages.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Bruton said about home management courses is very important. In my county it has been the practice to provide home management courses and they were open to people in towns who were interested in them.  In Kildare we found that the demand for the courses was not as great among rural people as among town people and some courses were not run for that reason because essentially they were, I suppose, farm management courses. There was a considerable demand from urban areas for admission to the courses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>If I concede the good faith of Deputy Bruton's sincerely expressed concern for people who require home guidance, the business of instruction in domestic house-keeping, the logical conclusion would be a farm advisory service penetrating into darkest Dublin.  To say the least the idea is rather far-fetched.  Classes for farm workers are available now.  There is no power in the land to prevent them from attending classes sponsored by county committees of agriculture and that will continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton may be under a slight misapprehension about veterinary advice. Are we talking about veterinary advice or advice on animal husbandry? The Deputy knows that mortality among young animals is most frequent where the standard of animal husbandry is low.  Animal husbandry and veterinary medicine are related but essentially they are dissimilar.  The business of animal husbandry is the job of the stockman and all stockmen need instruction in these matters.</P>
      <P>We are rehashing what we said already.  There was no suggestion such as that put forward by Deputy Bruton now in the 1977 Bill.  I do not know if it was a sudden flush of inspiration that inspired the suggestion in this case.  I think the comhairle should be allowed as much freedom as possible in the direction of the advisory and training services but to fan out almost to disappearing point into the business of deciding what colour of wallpaper an urban or suburban housewife might put in the living-room&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>There may well be a social need.  Deputy Bruton spoke about the distribution of agricultural advisers throughout the country.  Under our present rather antiquated system of county advisory committees that is being revised and the question of deployment of staff will be a matter for the comhairle. The Deputy was rather simplistic in equating the efficiency of performance in certain counties as against others to the single factor of availability of farm advice.  It is one factor but there are many others in certain regions of the country.  Another very potent factor is the relative age of the farm operators; their marital status has a profound bearing on it as has the innate ambition that may wane in a man's life under certain social conditions.  That is a problem but it cannot be assisted to any noticeable extent by the provision of agricultural advice.</P>
      <P>An amendment such as the Deputies have been advocating would be an unnecessary and undesirable limitation on the freedom of the comhairle to decide how best to do their own housekeeping. Deputy Bruton strayed miles from the amendments and spoke about a five-year plan or a county agricultural plan. This is a matter for the comhairle to decide.  My immediate reaction to that suggestion is that counties as we know them do not by definition constitute a particular region with particular peculiarities.  Within a county there are different types of agricultural land and different kinds of farming enterprises.  A county plan based upon the notion of a geographical entity alone would be unwise. Agricultural development should be built around some economic project, the production of some lines of commodities. Indeed, agricultural development is taking place in that form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we discussed this matter before we spoke about the evolution of specialised advisory services in certain areas of production.  We must not only <Col N="457" /> recognise the existence of but should actively encourage this evolution, where we will see the participation of the processing end of an enterprise in the whole scheme, from the sowing of a seed in the ground to the production of the basic food materials right through to the manufacture and the sale of a product. That rather than some geographical concept is a far more rational way to approach agricultural development. However, these too, are matters for the comhairle.  The people who make up the comhairle will have the special and single assignment of looking after these matters of training and advice.</P>
    <P>I will not continue to re-hash because almost everything that was said today was said when we last discussed this section and I do not see any point in repeating it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting to see the Minister's reaction to what Deputy Bruton said.  The Minister did not give enough of his views on one major point in the second part of the amendment in relation to including preventative veterinary medicines.  This is very important. It is an area where great progress could and should be made.  Deputy Bruton rightly makes the case that not one practising veterinary surgeon is employed by the county committee's advisory services.  Veterinary surgeons in the Department deal with the eradication of disease but are not qualified to carry out this type of instruction.  I am prepared to accept that a great number of lectures can be given by people other than veterinary surgeons in this field but I cannot accept that there is a dire need for this type of man to be attached to the advisory service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bruton has asked that this section be added to the Bill to bring this to the attention of the comhairle and so that there would be provision whereby these people can be employed.  This does <Col N="458" /> not interfere with the Bill, it only widens the scope and the responsibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will Deputy D'Arcy give some details as to why he expects veterinary advice to be available in counties at all times?  Almost in the same breath the Deputy says that a veterinary surgeon dealing with animal disease eradication would not meet the case, that there was something wrong with that.  What kind of instruction was the Deputy looking for?</P>

      <P>They were not there to be seen.  They suddenly seemed to appear from nowhere and to some degree the same applies to new diseases in cattle and sheep.  Deputy Bruton did not say that these people should be attached to every county but said that the service should be available so that these people can be called to give instruction in classes. The important point was that provision should be in the Bill to ensure that if needed they can be employed without the Bill having to be amended in the House.  The Minister admitted the number of fatalities in calfing and in lambing.  I talked about 12 per cent and the Minister said it was higher in sheep.  I blame this on the lack of knowledge by the farmer of how to treat sheep and sows prior to the calving and lambing seasons and of how to treat liver-lamb disease.</P>

      <P>That is just one disease. The only person properly equipped to <Col N="459" /> give instruction in these areas is a practising veterinary surgeon.  The men attached to the Department do not have the up-to-date knowledge of the diseases. New drugs for the treatment of diseases are coming on the market all the time.  It is hard for any farmer to keep abreast of all these drugs and it is as hard for the men in the Department who do not use the drugs in the eradication of TB and brucellosis to keep abreast of new developments.  A vet from the Department visited my yard and I referred him to a problem I had with a cow.  He said that &ldquo;my job is TB and brucellosis, you will have to get a practising vet&rdquo;.  The vet from the Department said that he had been in that job for ten years and had lost touch, and that he would have to get a refresher course to learn about all the new diseases.  This is a simple and valuable request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>My mind is clear on this. I am a practising farmer.  The thing seems to appear from nowhere.  It comes from the pressure of the soil, over-use or under-use of manure, lack of this, that or the other.  It is an extraordinary situation. <Col N="460" /> Many people had sprayed for rust in corn for the past 10 years.  I never sprayed for it but this year we had to spray every acre of corn we had.  We were then told there was mould and three or four other things tending to appear. We will not call these new diseases but they are there and people do not know of them.  The same applies to cattle and sheep.  This is an important request which does not upset the Bill in any way but it just puts in a provision that is needed to bring down fatalities in calves and lambs.  That would add significantly to the increase in lamb and cattle numbers.  It is a very valuable area.</P>

I asked him what was the reason and he said that all types of things were appearing.  It was not starvation.  I accept that in mountainous areas where people are inclined to leave sheep out about six weeks too long, not bring them down and give them some feeding, in those cases it certainly can be starvation but I do not accept it where people are treating sheep well on low land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the provision for the agricultural worker, I understand that the agricultural worker can avail of the 161 EEC course which is in operation right across the country at present.  I hope I am right in that; the Minister did not say whether we were or not, although I made the point on the last occasion. The Minister may have missed it but that is my understanding, that all agricultural workers can avail of this course.  It is important to have specialised courses for agricultural workers.  It would be in the interest of <Col N="461" /> agriculture and of everybody if these courses were made available.</P>

      <P>I think the farm home management courses are valuable. Deputy Bruton has widened it considerably by saying that we should take in the question of where there is a problem in a home in providing food and so on.  What I am interested in, not from a selfish point of view in my own county but right across the country, is that the farm home is providing good holidays and is a good money spinner where it is properly developed.  Farm home management courses are essential so that we give the proper type of food to people who come here.  The courses should not be confined.  They are not confined in my county.  If an individual <Col N="462" /> comes to the advisory service in our county and wants instruction in farm home management, our committee has given responsibility to the instructors and instructresses concerned to give those people the service they need.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 10, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="463" />&ldquo;Section 2 (1) of the Act of 1977 is hereby amended by the addition of a new paragraph (f) in the definition of `agriculture' as follows:</P>
    <P>`(f)  design and erection of farm buildings, yards and other structures,' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The point was raised that the design and erection of farm buildings, yards and other structures was not included among the matters contained in the definition of &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; and, therefore, that the giving of advice or provision of courses of education in such matters would not be included specifically in what the advisory services could do.  From having attended a course I know that in fact advice is being given quite liberally on this matter of the design and erection of farm buildings, yards and so on.  This is being done but from the point of view of clarity its non-inclusion within the term &ldquo;agriculture&rdquo; may be a lack of clarity in the Bill.  From this point of view I would ask the Minister to consider accepting the amendment.</P>

One could put down a hundred amendments on all the different facets of farming, to get advice on geological structures, on drainage and every specialist item in every county involving a certain pool of specialists.  The practicality in the long run is that you have to decide where to concentrate your men, and what kind of men they will be.  I would not wish the Dáil to fence in or inhibit the comhairle from doing what they see fit.  I am quite certain things will change.</P>
      <P>Deputy D'Arcy spoke about the remarkable incidence of cereal disease in recent times.  A number of things are happening which are causing this.  One is the concentration on growing cereals. Greatly expanded production and changed practice in rotations are responsible for some build-up in the fungus diseases in cereals.  For instance, the frequent growing of cereals in the same field&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It does not require courses to be given.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 10, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The following section shall be substituted for section 4 of the Act of 1977:</P>
      <P>`4.&mdash;A draft of every order proposed to be made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each such House.' &rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned with a very basic principle of parliamentary accountability for the actions of Ministers.  This amendment seeks to provide that a draft of every order made under this Bill by the Minister shall be laid before each House <Col N="466" /> of the Oireachtas and shall not take effect until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House. Minister have order-making powers and should have them, but I believe very strongly they should be accountable in respect of the orders they make.  They should not simply make orders and lay them on the Table of the House because, unless somebody finds something objectionable in them, they never come before the House.  They should have to get the approval of the House before they are made so that the House will be conscious of what the Minister is doing.</P>
    <P>The objection the Minister will raise to what I am proposing is that a great deal of parliamentary time would be taken up in approving orders made by the Minister.  That is not the case.  If it is a non-contentious matter, the order could be put through in ten minutes after a simple introductory statement by the Minister.  We will not delay unduly, nor would any Opposition.  The important point would be achieved, namely, that the Minister would be accountable to the House for the orders he made under this Bill, and they would be seen to be approved by the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable provision.  Far too much power has been delegated over the years to Ministers to do this, that and the other by order, without any reference to this House.  That dilutes and reduces the democratic supervision of the administration, and that is a bad thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Down through the years Ministers have had power to legislate by order.  These orders have to be laid on the Table of the House and any Member can object to them, but they may be missed for many reasons.  If we are to have real democratic control of legislation by order, it is imperative that such an order should have to be brought before the House and passed.  This may take time if somebody decides something is wrong. It could be done now if Deputies were alert but in practice there are so many orders&mdash;and Deputies are overworked and have not got research facilities available to them&mdash;that they are missed. Such orders should be at least mentioned <Col N="467" /> in the House.  Estimates for millions of pounds have been brought in and passed in a matter of minutes.  The relevant Minister explained the necessity for doing that.  The Minister for Agriculture would be doing a good job if he accepted this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This approaches the frontiers of idiocy.  I do not know of any legislation which embodies such an absurd proposal as this: that every order made by any Minister for Agriculture in the future must be debated before it is agreed.  I would expect that a great many orders would be made by a Minister for Agriculture, and necessarily so.</P>
      <P>The section was imported bodily from the 1977 Act without any trouble.  The notion that every order made by the Minister would have to be discussed by the Dáil&mdash;possibly at great length, and possibly it would suit a political party, maybe my own, or maybe some other party to filibuster it&mdash;would reduce the comhairle to complete impotence and induce the Dáil to spend its time on political gamesmanship when it should be doing its work.</P>
      <P>Protective mechanisms are provided in all similar legislation, including the 1977 Act, whereby the order is laid before the House and can be annulled after 21 days by a vote of the Dáil.  The mechanism which will prevent abuse certainly is strong enough.  But we do not want to bring it to the point where it will actually stultify the purpose of the legislation in the first place.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 10, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 13 (1) of the Act of 1977 is hereby amended by the addition of the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>`(c)  arrange, as far as possible, that the provision of classroom space in any given area by it or with the aid of the Minister for Education is <Col N="469" /> jointly planned so that to the maximum use is made of such classroom space.</P>
    <P>(d)  make arrangements where appropriate for the exchange of staff on a part-time basis for particular courses' &rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is concerned with the provision of classroom space by the comhairle and the Minister for Education. At present&mdash;at very considerable public expense&mdash; agricultural education centres are provided by the county committees of agriculture throughout the country.  Structurally and in every respect they are very little different from exactly similar classrooms, with similar facilities, being provided in schools perhaps a few hundred yards away from the agricultural centre.  Very often they are not in use and will not be in use at the same time of the year.  It is not the best use of public resources, in some cases, that these two facilities&mdash;the agricultural facilities and the strictly educational facilities run by the schools&mdash;should not be provided jointly. Some of the buildings would need to be separate.  Obviously the offices would need to be separate.  But, as far as possible, these facilities should be provided and used in common to avoid the waste of national resources in this area.  That is the first point.  The second concerns the arrangement for the exchange of staff on a part-time basis for a particular course. We all know that the schools are concerned with education in agricultural science.  Amongst their teaching staff, in some schools anyway, there are teachers qualified in agricultural science.  It should also be a responsibility of the Comhairle to ensure that where their advisers could usefully give instruction in schools, they should do so.  There should be an acceptance of the principle that exchange should take place, where necessary. This is what this amendment proposes to do.  It is concerned with making the best use of the manpower and physical resources available to the Government in the joint interest of education and agriculture.</P>

      <P>I do not think this amendment is necessary in the matter of the interchangeability of resources.  I need hardly go further than my own county of Kilkenny when I was fortunate enough during my last term as Minister for Agriculture to acquire Kildalton College, now probably the best agricultural college in the country. There is a constant exchange of students and teachers between the regional technical college in Waterford and Kildalton.  To put a stricture on that, to lumber it with all sorts of ifs, buts and provisos would be to make it less effective. The existing provisions are perfectly adequate.

I believe that the thinking behind this amendment would be very useful&mdash;an interchange of teachers and space is important.  Since this debate began we have stressed the need for education.  While I may be somewhat ignorant of the position in every other county, the question of education, space and interchange of teachers is important. The Minister has given us one example of what happened in Kilkenny.  Might I ask him what happens in Galway, Mayo, Cavan and all the other counties? Is the Minister satisfied that there is adequate space in those counties for the agricultural education of the farmers within that area?  They may not all be in the position of having an agricultural college situated in the middle of their county.  Is the Minister satisfied that the rest of the country is as adequately served as Kilkenny?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 provides that the Minister might seek the advice of the comhairle in relation to a matter on which they are competent, but it does not allow the comhairle to provide advice of their own accord.  This would be <Col N="472" /> a reasonable power to give them.  The Minister has been stressing throughout the debate how much confidence he has in the wisdom of the comhairle and in the fact that they will do all the things that we would all hope will be done.  If that confidence is justified he should have nothing to fear from allowing them, of their accord, to give him advice on some matters in regard to which they have a certain competence and in circumstances where they feel such advice should be given.  I hope therefore that the amendment will be accepted.</P>

      <P>I also believe that if written advice is being given it should be made known to the Dáil so that proper formality would be achieved in regard to relations between the Minister and the comhairle.  I am not as anxious about amendment No. 19 as I am about amendment No. 18, because it recognises that there are circumstances in which the Minister might not want to publish his advice Amendment No. 19 says that, if the Minister does not want publication of the advice he has received from the Comhairle in certain matters, he can refrain from publishing it and he can lodge a statement in the Library of the House saying that he is not publishing it and giving the reasons why. As a general principle advice of this nature should be made public and the House should know of it.  Whether or not the wording of Amendment No. 19 is too restrictive and would prevent the Minister from having even reasonable discussion in the matter is open to argument. I am not entirely happy with the wording of amendment No. 19 and would not press it for that reason.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 is a good amendment. The comhairle should, as is provided in the amendment, be free to give advice to the Minister when they think it should be given and not just when the Minister asks for it.</P>

      <P>There is no barrier to the giving of advice to the Minister for <Col N="473" /> Agriculture by the comhairle.  The provision in section 30 (2) of the 1976 Act is imported into the new Act and the same arrangement for the exchange of views between the Minister and the comhairle persists.  It is interesting that at that time Deputy Bruton or any member of the party that is now in opposition did not express any opinion of this matter.  They seem to have felt at that time&mdash;and indeed I must say I felt&mdash;that the communications between the comhairle and the Minister were adequately and sensibly provided for.  To put a statutory obligation on the comhairle to communicate with the Minister would be to reduce the thing to a degree of fatuity that I cannot see the sense of.</P>

He is saying that it is fatuous for us to give the comhairle power to give advice to the Minister and of course they can give advice to the Minister.  Well, if that is the case why is it necessary to have section 10, because section 10 gives the Minister power to ask advice from the comhairle?  If the communications are so good surely there is no need to give the Minister power to look for advice in section 10 as is being proposed to be done.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;An Chomhairle shall advise the Minister on any matter relating to agricultural training or advice on which its views are requested by the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If communication is so good there should be no need for this section because if the Minister asks for advice he should get it without having anything in the Act.  It has been deemed necessary by whoever drafted this Act&mdash;and presumably by the Minister himself&mdash;to insert section 10 so that such advice could be sought by him.  If that is necessary then surely it is equally necessary to add the words I am proposing to add to allow the comhairle to provide advice to the Minister on their own initiative.

If the comhairle wishes to talk to the Minister about some point or policy there is nothing to stop them. That is the purpose of section 10 and it is also the superfluity of amendment No. 18.</P>

If the Minister is doing something that is inimical to the opinions of the board he will not ask their opinion and in the absence of power to give the advice they might consider themselves inhibited in that regard.

The fact that the provisions I am suggesting were not included in legislation that was before the House in 1976 when I was concerned with matters other than agriculture is not an agrument against my amendments.

      <P>I should like to see accepted by Deputy Bruton the importance of the office of the Minister for Agriculture regardless of who may be the incumbent of that office at any time as against the function which must be secondary to that of the Minister in that he is a democratically elected Minister in a Government elected democratically by the people.  This important democratic provision does not apply to members of the board.  Therefore, it is necessary to acknowledge the importance democratically of the Minister's position.  He has a serious obligation to the Government and to the people he is serving but the responsibility of the comhairle is different. In any event in order to achieve results there must be close co-operation between the comhairle and the Minister. From time to time it will be necessary to discuss the policies of the comhairle because they will require a substantial contribution from taxpayers' money. That is why we have included section 10.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about giving advice.  Section 10 purports to give the Minister the power to seek formally the advice of the comhairle.  The reality is that the Minister has so much power anyway in respect of the comhairle that regardless of whether we include section 10 he would be empowered to obtain their advice.  It is not that I am objecting to section 10 but I am saying that perhaps it is not necessary and that the amendment we propose is necessary.  We say this because the comhairle do not have the powers of leverage that the Minister has.  Our amendment is designed to allow the comhairle to give advice on their initiative in respect of matters on which they consider they should give advice.</P>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister introducing arguments about the dignity of the office of Minister, an office to which perhaps all of us aspire.  The question at issue is whether this subsidiary body should be free on their own initiative go give advice formally to the Minister.  In addition the comhairle should be in a position to publish if necessary any advice they give.</P>

      <P>That is so and ultimately this House will decide on the various issues but it should have available to it all the evidence and a subsidiary body such as the comhairle who have expertise and who know what they are about should be free to advise the Minister formally.  If the Minister is pursuing a line which is inimical to the interests of advice and education the comhairle should be in a position formally and on their own initiative to advise him that he is pursuing the wrong course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, having received such advice, the Minister were to continue pursuing his line of action he is of course accountable to this House and finally the issue will be decided by this House.  A Minister should not be afraid of receiving advice <Col N="478" /> from anyone and if he does not agree with that advice he should be able to reach his own decision and to say why he disagreed with the advice.  Only a Minister who is afraid and who is not able to defend his position would be afraid to receive from an outside body advice that might not directly be in line with the Minister's opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 11, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;No fee may be charged in respect of any advice given by An Chomhairle under this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I tabled this amendment as a matter of principle.  It has always been accepted that advice under the advisory service was free but this Bill proposes to impose charges for certain advice.  Those who avail of the service always appreciate that it is for the purpose of helping them to improve their knowledge of agriculture.  Unfortunately, some farmers do not make use of the service, even though it is free, and they are the people we should be encouraging to avail of it.  The introduction of a charge for the service will not encourage such people to make use of it.  We should continue to provide this service free of charge.  It would be a retrograde step to charge any fee.  We are all anxious to encourage farmers who did not avail of the service in the past to do so now, but we cannot do that if we charge a fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that in the Green Paper published last summer the Government indicated that they intended introducing charges for certain advice but, subsequently, in the White Paper they temporarily abandoned that proposal.  It was never made clear why they proposed the charge and then abandoned it.  The Government have abandoned other things that had been more formally adopted as Government policy in the recent past.  If they can change their minds in one direction, they can change it in another just as easily.  We could find ourselves in a situation where the Government, having abandoned the idea of a charge next July, might introduce such charges, and reintroduce other matters, to the detriment of the farming community.  In that context a guarantee such as that sought by Deputy Bermingham would serve a useful purpose because the Government <Col N="480" /> would have to declare their position on this issue and foreswear the possibility of introducing such charges.</P>
      <P>We are aware that the Government considered such a move and abandoned it, possibly in anticipation of electoral pressure.  They abandoned other things under threat of one sort or another, but who is to know that the sands of time might shift in a different direction next July when certain events have passed and the urgency will not be there to the same degree.  Such a guarantee would be useful in what one might describe as a fluid political situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any reference in the Bill to the charge of fees.  There was a reference in the old Act, but that has gone.  I do not accept Deputy Bermingham's point that this is a traditional advisory service that farmers got free.  That is not the case. People are paying fees now for the type of advisory service they require and that indicates that for a certain type of advisory service farmers will put their money on the line.  I say that to illustrate the inaccuracy of Deputy Bermingham's observations.  The service has been free to farmers under the committee of agriculture system, a system we are altering, but we are not talking about fees in the Bill.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I stated that the whole business of farm advice is in a state of evolution.  It may well be that we will see our way in a couple of years to concentrate specialist advisers in a certain area.  It would be idle for the House to anticipate at this stage what the situation will be in relation to such advisers in the future.  Deputy Bruton, who raised a point about what was contained in the White Paper and the Green Paper, mentioned some weak-kneed forebodings about what might happen on 8 July.  I take it he was speaking about the aftermath of the direct elections to the European Parliament.  If he wants to engage in some cheap political point-scoring, he can go ahead, but I had hoped we were involved in a serious attempt to start on the right foot in establishing an advisory and training service for our premier industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's instruction is most edifying particularly when one bears in mind that on the last occasion he spent a lot of time referring to Fine Gael farmers.  He did not quite mention the Blue Shirts, but I imagine he would have had he been given any encouragement. He was dealing in dead political controversy.  His rapid conversion to political probity and the responsibility of these matters seems to be somewhat belated and, one could say, opportunistic.  Because what I am saying does not suit him, he is adopting the mantle of virtue and does not want to hear what I have to say.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred dismissingly to Green Papers and White Papers, as if he had no part of them, although he was a member of the Government that produced the Green Paper, their discussion document.  One of the few ideas in that Green Paper in relation to agriculture, to which the Minister contributed no doubt, was the suggestion that there be charges for the advisory services.  That was Government policy last June.  But it ceased to be Government policy for the time being in December when they published their White Paper.  If they could change their minds so quickly, and with so little evidence being produced as to their opinion in the first place or to their change of opinion in the second, there is no reason to believe that in another six months, whether there was an election or not, they might not change their minds again.  Therefore, Deputy Bermingham's guarantee in this matter is relevant and is not just political point-scoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be an element of justifiable point-scoring, in the context of what happened lately, to be made in this issue. However, there is also a substantial point in relation to the charging of fees which the Minister has not dealt with, because he has not referred to the Green Paper which contained this suggestion. Did he agree to the inclusion?  Did he believe there should be charges for the advisory service when the suggestion was made in June?  Did he change his mind in December, or was it the case that he disagreed all along, or that he agreed all along but other people <Col N="482" /> prevailed on him to change his mind last December and drop the idea?  We do not know.  But there is no guarantee in the absence of that knowledge that the proposal to impose charges might not rear its head again.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> This is the major amendment we are putting forward to this Bill.  It seeks to go to the heart of the Bill and to the purposes in the Minister's mind in proposing the Bill.  To explain the case for our amendment it is necessary to go back to what has happened in the recent past, I hope not in a manner in which one gets involved in any unnecessary politics but simply for the purpose of illuminating what the amendment has in mind.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, on assuming office found himself with a series of reports and recommendations from various people to the effect that the advisory, educational and research services under the aegis of his Department needed to be reorganised and streamlined.  He proceeded to take decisions, decisions that in fairness it should be said had been long delayed, on the issues contained in the various recommendations. His decision was that the advisory, educational and research services which hitherto had been operating under separate directions&mdash;the research service was under An Foras Talúntais and was set up in 1958; part of the educational service and the advisory service were under the county committees of agriculture and the remainder of the educational service, the college education service, was the direct responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;should be reorganised and brought together under one authority which was to be known as the National Agricultural, Educational and Research Authority, which was subsequently abbreviated to NAA.</P>
    <P>The main principle was not one of title but that the various services should be brought together under one single authority with one single direction and with the staff being employed under one authority and the previous separate entities that had existed with independent functions should exist under a single guiding authority.  The then Minister's purpose in doing so was to ensure that they followed the same line of policy and that decisions in research which obviously had implications for education were taken with a view to their educational implications and that decisions <Col N="491" /> in education also took account of the decisions taken in the field of research.</P>
    <P>The idea was that one policy would be followed by one authority in the single overriding interests of Irish agriculture. This was incorporated in the 1977 Bill. During the debate on that Bill, the present Minister, then Opposition spokesman on Agriculture, declared his total opposition to the principle of the Bill in so far as it involved bringing the Agricultural Institute in as a component part and merging it with education and research services under one authority. The then spokesman felt that the decision to abolish the Agricultural Institute was unwise, that they should retain their independence and that it was only if they retained their independence that they would be able to work as well as they should.</P>
    <P>This was a genuine difference of opinion.  The present Minister was wrong.  However, whether he was right or wrong, it was a legitimate argument, a political issue on which there could be a difference of opinion.  On attaining office the Minister reversed the work of his predecessor and introduced this Bill, the purpose of which is to take the Agricultural Institute from under the authority of the National Agricultural Authority and have them as a separate entity with freedom of action subject only to their responsibility to the Minister.</P>
    <P>There are certain advantages in this from the point of view of the Minister, the staff of the institute and other people. By exercising greater freedom some good may come from their research programmes.  But there are also disadvantages. The Agricultural Institute could pursue one line while the comhairle, which is concerned with research, advice and education, could pursue a different line.  There is no easy way to reconcile these operations unless the Minister intervenes and tells them to co-ordinate their activities.</P>
    <P>That one must go to the level of the Minister to get co-ordination between two separate institutions whose basic objectives must be the same suggests that no matter how well intentioned the <Col N="492" /> Minister may be, there will be instances where the proper degree of co-ordination will not take place because there are two separate institutions with separate staff structures and separate interests.  We all know that institutions tend to acquire an interest of their own rather than the interests of the people they are intended to serve.  This is not to suggest that there is anything selfish or wrong about these people.  But it is a fact of administration that institutions tend to acquire interests of their own.  So long as there are separate institutions concerned with research, advice and education there will be divergence of interests between them and divergence arising from the fact that they are separate administrations.  It is inconvenient or difficult to co-ordinate them when there is one institution in one town and another somewhere else and no central direction keeping them together, when one is doing research and the other providing advice and education. Deputy Clinton proposed to join them together so as to make sure they were co-ordinated.  The Minister may have accepted a lot of the arguments put forward by Deputy Clinton, but felt there were other arguments in relation to the independence of research and the continued existence of the Agricultural Institute which were of greater importance. This is a legitimate area of disagreement and I do not propose at this stage to argue one case against the other.</P>
    <P>I have tried to approach this Bill on an independent basis, looking at it on its merits and trying to put forward amendments in the light of my experience.  I am not seeking to follow everything done in the 1977 Bill.  I am quite ready to put forward other proposals if I think they will meet the case.  The amendment we are putting forward is designed as a compromise to meet the legitimate argument of the Minister and the legitimate objectives of his predecessor.  It proposes that the Agricultural Institute as a legal entity would continue to exist: it would not be abolished as was proposed in the original Bill.  The comhairle being created in this Bill would also continue to exist.  Legally they would be two separate institutions, but with one major difference, in that they would have the <Col N="493" /> same personnel on both their boards.</P>
    <P>This would not make the employees of An Foras Talúntais the employees of the comhairle or <i>vice versa.</i>  The staffs would be separate and would have the right to have their own staff structures, promotional opportunities and so on. Perhaps fears about the staff position was one of the reasons why some of the staff of An Foras Talúntais were so opposed to the proposals made by the previous Minister.  Their fears will be met by this amendment, because the institute will continue to exist as an independent entity, as will the comhairle.  But there will be only one guiding voice in the policy field, because the two boards will consist of the same members.</P>
    <P>The board will meet on one day as the board of the comhairle and perhaps the same day or another day they will meet as the board of the institute.  The same chairman will preside and the same people will represent the different interests. The result will be that there will be continuity of policy.  When those people are dealing with the affairs of the institute they will be the people who met the previous week as the board of the comhairle. Therefore, they will be aware of the needs of the comhairle and of their difficulties in relation to obtaining results in research or whatever.  They will be able to bring the knowledge they have as members of the board of the comhairle to bear on the exercise of their functions as members of the board of the institute and <i>vice versa.</i>  While the two institutions will remain separate and the Minister's major objection to Deputy Clinton's proposal will be met, the overriding objective of Deputy Clinton to ensure a unified direction in policy will also be met by the fact that the same board consisting of the same people will be doing the two jobs.</P>
    <P>This is a very reasonable compromise between two sincerely held and legitimate points of view.  It meets the bulk of the case made on both sides.  If it is a good compromise&mdash;and I hope it is; I have only my own opinion to go on yet until I hear what other people say&mdash;I am only sorry that it was not put forward earlier.  If it cannot lead to a solution we shall have to try again.  The Bill has not <Col N="494" /> gone through the House and if this amendment does not meet the case we can put forward another.  Naturally, we reserve our position to do that if this does not meet with agreement.  As of now, I think this is a reasonable amendment which meets the Minister's case and also the case made by his predecessor. It is a proposal which is in the interests of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this amendment may be related to my amendment 23, as the Chair has said, it seems to me to be different.  We are suggesting that one member of the board shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for Education, that at least one member shall be appointed on the nomination of the council of the institute. In the Bill it says two.  I accept the arguments of the Minister for keeping the institute separate&mdash;I said that on the Second Stage&mdash;and I am not in complete agreement with Deputy Bruton when he says there should be one board. I have sympathy with the Minister's arguments to keep them separate and if that is what the Minister wants to do I will not hold up the Bill on that decision. I do not think they should be involved too much in the other way either.  I am saying one instead of two; I believe there should be a connection but I do not believe the same board should operate for both the institute and the comhairle.</P>
      <P>The number of members in the Bill for the General Council of County Councils is two, I think.  If that is correct, it seems to be very small.  I think that four would be reasonable because you could divide the country into four areas of production. I do not mean areas such as provinces but people on the General Council of County Councils should come from areas which would represent the different kinds of farming we have in different areas.  If you have four, you would have more or less full representation of the various areas where different kinds of farming are operated.  I think there should be at least four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We say the remaining members shall be representative of agricultural and rural organisations from which at least one farm worker shall be appointed.  It is <Col N="495" /> necessary to have at least one farm worker on the board, somebody who is employed as a farm worker.  There is little doubt that that very important section of the agricultural community have not shared in the general wealth percolating through the agricultural area in the past few years.  That is a pity; they are a great body of people.  They must be skilled people at present because agriculture is a very skilled industry. They should have at least one member on the board.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (B) says that the staff of the comhairle shall constitute one-third of the membership of the board.  This is something I must press.  This is the criterion laid down for semi-State bodies in the Worker Participation Act.  One-third of the board of semi-State bodies is now to be made up from the employees of the company or organisation.  I cannot accept that legislation now introduced would provide for less than the same proportion in the case of the comhairle being on the board.  We must spell that out clearly, that we recognise worker participation in any boards that are being set up under legislation.  If we were ever serious about worker participation, here is a genuine case where the people employed are mainly in the advisory services and who would be very knowledgeable on programmes to be carried out and so on.  It would be a retrograde step if we did not recognise in the formation of the Comhairle the principle of worker participation.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that this is not an industry but I believe worker participation in the comhairle is even more essential, if such a term could be applied in that context, than in industry.  It is essential that these people should contribute in a substantial way.  The criterion here should be at least equal to what is provided in the worker participation legislation recently introduced for semi-State bodies.  I believe that these two provisions&mdash;that there be at least one agricultural worker on the board and that one-third of the board should consist of employees&mdash;are vitally necessary. I shall have to press strongly for them.  I should like to have the Minister's opinion on these proposals.</P>

      <P>We now come to the controversial area of this Bill.  The former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, who brought in the previous Act and had it passed in the last stage of the life of that Government, genuinely believed&mdash;and it is a widely held view&mdash;that all institutions participating in our agricultural development should co-ordinate their services so that agriculture might grow for the benefit of the whole nation.  The Minister has taken up a certain stand on this issue and he has separated the Agricultural Institute from the advisory services.  With his large majority in the Dáil, he can enact whatever Bill he feels is in the best interests of the nation, but it will not be too long until we see whether this Bill is a success or a failure.  The separation of the Agricultural Institute from the advisory services will erect barriers between the people engaged in research and those providing advice.  There is a wealth of knowledge in the Agricultural Institute which should be channelled through the advisory services to the farmers.  The Bill introduced by Mark Clinton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>He hardly went far enough in trying to provide this information through the advisory services.  While I did not agree entirely with his Bill, I felt in principle that all the services should be co-ordinated in an attempt to get this information across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most important section in the Bill.  Deputy Bruton and I spent a considerable time in trying to work out what we consider to be a fair compromise. We suggested the compromise that the same board should represent both institutions.  This is a good attempt to co-ordinate the services.  There is no use in the Minister denying that barriers have been created.  I am prepared to accept that when Deputy Clinton enacted his Bill barriers were erected, but they were easy to take down.  The barriers which will be erected now will not be easy to take down because, in between the barriers are the advisory services, and the Agricultural Institute are at one <Col N="497" /> end and the farmers are at the other.</P>
    <P>The setting up of one board to run both these institutions is the last chance we have to find common ground and common policy.  We all have the same thing in mind, that is, to provide a better, more progressive and more worthwhile service to farmers.  We may have different ways of doing that.  The Minister believes his way is the right way.  We believe Deputy Clinton's way was right. We have suggested a reasonable compromise whereby the research and advisory services can, to some degree, co-ordinate the available services.</P>
    <P>Huge sums of money are being spent on research and advice.  I want to bring to the Minister's notice the amount of money the Agricultural Institute costs the taxpayers.  I understand the figure is somewhere in the region of £7 million per annum.  The Minister may correct me if I am wrong.  I further understand &mdash;and I am subject to correction on this also&mdash;that the cost of the advisory services is around the same figure.  The Minister will have to justify to the taxpayers and to everybody else the expenditure of that sum on the Agricultural Institute.  He will have to show he is getting value for that money and that he is doing the right thing in the national interest. That is important because the growth of agriculture is basic to the economy.  The Minister has been Minister for Agriculture for long enough to know what I am saying is true.  I lay great emphasis on the fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not absolutely sure of the figure of £7 million.  I thought the Bill would be taken tomorrow.  It is a massive figure which the Minister must justify.  We have asked to have certain people put on the board because the educational aspect is important.  We have named certain colleges and institutions of education which should have a member on the board to ensure that the educational aspect is always to the forefront.</P>
      <P>The General Council of the County Committees of Agriculture should have two members on the board.  The county committees have done an exceptional job on a voluntary basis.  It would be very unreasonable and unfair if the Minister did not give them reasonable representation.  Down through the years, in difficult circumstances, when money was not very plentiful, they increased agricultural output and kept the advisory services going.  The Minister's proposition is to give the council one member, but that is shabby treatment of them.  They represent the 27 County Committees of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>As a compromise we have suggested one board.  Both institutions have the same purpose in mind, to increase agricultural output.  I appeal to the Minister to accept amendment No. 22 to ensure that the co-ordination of the services, which are costly to the taxpayer, will provide the best value for the nation.</P>

      <P>I shall deal first with the amendment put down by Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy and then talk about Deputy Bermingham's amendment. Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy's amendment seems to me to be a rather awkward and clumsy effort to resurrect the old idea to which Deputy Bruton referred&mdash;moderately enough, I must say&mdash;that in the monumental words of the 1976 Act, section 10, An Foras Talúntais is hereby abolished.  They would create this concept.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an effort to install a board that would be, indifferently, on a Monday An Foras Talúntais Board and on a Tuesday, An Chomhairle Oiliúna Talmhaiochta.  It would be quite grotesque. It would be a board of the kind that might opt for one or the other.  I do not propose to reopen the discussion.  Such discussion would be quite pointless on the merits or demerits of separating or amalgamating An Foras and An Comhairle except to say, as I have always said, that the amalgamation and obliteration of An Foras would be absolutely fatal to the research concept.  I shall say no more.</P>
      <P>The amendment seemed to incorporate this.  It would seem to have a kind of dual-purpose board.  The board I am thinking of for the comhairle is a smaller board because its function is less.  Its importance is not less.  The numbers of its duties would be diminished by the retention of the board of An Foras Talúntais, and their activity would be confined to advice and training.  Therefore an over-large board would not be necessary for the comhairle.  In any event, to have the same, over-large, board functioning in a dual capacity would be quite unprecedented and unreal.  I would not entertain the idea at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham's proposal would make for a very unbalanced comhairle. For instance, in his amendment the number of nominees allotted to the Minister for Agriculture is none.  In any fair approach to the matter that is hardly a good situation.  The general council with their representation would be over-large. One must bear in mind what one is trying to do.  One is trying to bring together a number as small as will be acceptable of the best agricultural brains in the country.  I would propose that these would be selected regardless of their political stripe and hardly any by the Minister.  I will be looking for people whose concern it is to ensure that agriculture and the agricultural industry develop.  It is important at all times to <Col N="500" /> think of the agricultural industry, not to think merely of the production of crops and their process and sale.  It is people from these disciplines I should like to see comprising the greater part of the personnel of the board of the comhairle. There are many groups.  I do not believe that the universities have a function in this, because the comhairle themselves will not be concerned with third-level education in their functions.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Bermingham's point about worker representation, the intention embodied in the legislation of which he seemed to be thinking did not contemplate the incorporation of such a non-industrial body as the comhairle in that context.  It might be worth recalling what was said at the time of the passage of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977.  Because of its innovative nature the Government decided to confine its scope initially to seven companies.  The reason behind this decision was to facilitate a close and effective monitoring of the operation of the scheme in order to discover what lessons might be learned from its practical application and to see whether any changes might be called for in future legislation on the basis of this practical experience. Based on the successful implementation of the proposals, it is intended to extend it by way of further legislation to other State enterprises.  This is an extract from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

With <Col N="501" /> all due respect to Deputy Bermingham&mdash;and I have respect for his opinions&mdash;I do not think we should start an exercise in this type of council participation on the part of members of the staff because of the definition I have given: that the people I would hope to see on the board in the future would be people who will be expert in the complicated export manufacturing and production fields.  I do not wish to denigrate in any way the people on whose behalf Deputy Bermingham spoke, but I submit to him that I do not think this is a suitable place for the application of worker participation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): During the course of his contribution yesterday evening the Minister for the Environment emphasised that the cost of houses had risen substantially between 1973 and 1976.  Of course that is a fact but everything else rose substantially during that period due to an international recession brought on by the oil crisis and there is no necessity for me to labour that.  Interest rates also increased during the same period but they never reached 14 per cent, not to mention the record figure of 14.15 per cent that they have reached at present.  The Minister also stated that the Government backbenchers at that time did not demand Government action.  The fact is that the Government backbenchers of the time did not have to call for Government action because the National Coalition Government took action and subsidised interest rates when they reached 13.95 per cent.  They subsidised them to the tune of 1 per cent and kept them down for as long as it was necessary to keep them down.  So much for the period 1973 to 1976.  There seems to be some doubt on the Government's side as to whether we subsidised the interest rates when they reached 13.95 per cent.  There is no doubt about it; we subsidised interest rates for an extensive period during our term of office and during the recession to the tune of 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="503" /> I want to look at what happened since the Minister for the Environment took over the Department of Local Government, because that is what we are concerned with here.  The Minister took over that Department and came into office with a policy of making it easier to buy a house.  He told us last night that immediately he came into office he took steps to curtail the escalation in house prices.  If he did he was not very successful, because the net result of the Minister's operations and of the Minister's policy was to increase the cost of the cheaper type of house in this city in the private sector by £3,500 in just over 12 months.  That is what happened in round figures and leaving out percentages and everything else and talking in figures that people easily understand at this stage.  The price of houses increased by £3,500 in little over 12 months.  The Minister's free grant, as he called it, of £1,000 was gobbled up three-and-a-half times and the new house purchaser was that much worse off.  The £1,000 and the further £2,500 which the house buyer had to find to pay for his house found its way into the pockets of the building contractors and the land barons who had land banks around the city.  They are the people who reaped the benefit of the Minister's free grant of £1,000 and the other £2,500 which the unfortunate house purchaser had to put to it.</P>
    <P>In his contribution the Minister also stated that there was a slowing down in the rate of increase of house prices in the first nine months of last year.  He anticipated that there would be a further slight slowing down towards the end of the year.  That is probably so. Nevertheless, the price of a semidetached house in December 1978 was still between £3,500 and £4,000 dearer than it was when the Minister came into office with his policy and his promise to make it easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the position for the first nine months of last year and up to the end of the year by implication. The Minister of course was speaking about housing prices.  But housing prices are governed by house building costs.  I <Col N="504" /> am very concerned and alarmed to note that since October 1978 the cost of house building which had slowed down up to that has again resumed its upward trend.  In the month of January, according to figures supplied by the Minister to me today, there was a steep increase over the average in the previous quarter.  In fact, in the last quarter of 1978 the house building cost index showed that the average monthly increase was 1 per cent.  In the month of January 1979 it had risen to 2.07 per cent.  My information is that it is still increasing. It is worthy to note that the trend in the house building cost index since September 1978 has shown a steady increase and the figures month by month in the house building cost index since September is as follows: September, 1978, 163.1; October 1978, 163.8; November 1978, a steep increase to 166.6; December 1978, 167.4; January 1979, 168.7 and February 1978, 172.2.  That does not look well for the future and it certainly does not look well for young people who want to buy a house in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The average monthly increase in the house cost building index for the past two years was .91 per cent, but from October 1978 to January 1979 it has risen to 1.39 per cent.  If the January increase were to continue for the year the index would show an increase of 24 per cent in the coming 12 months.  That figure is very far removed from the 5 per cent talked about by the Minister for Finance, who, incidentally, I have not seen here today.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated that he is taking steps to keep down housing costs.  I should like the Minister of State, who apparently is to speak next, to comment on the trend in the housing cost index since September 1978 and to deal particularly with the increase from 1 per cent on average for the last quarter of 1978 to an increase of 2.7 per cent for the month of January.  Is the Minister as alarmed about those figures as I am and what are his proposals for dealing with the situation?</P>
    <P>The Minister boasted considerably about the increase in the SDA loans operated by local authorities.  The maximum loan available by way of this <Col N="505" /> scheme is £9,000 and the qualifying income is £3,500 per annum.  I fail to understand how a person on an income of that level can be expected to service a loan of £9,000.  However, even if he could service it and thereby acquire a house, the Minister could say he was providing that person with some service. But, the fact is that a person borrowing to the maximum under the SDA loans scheme would have to find about £7,000 more before being able to purchase an average house in this city.  In other words, he would need to have saved in full his salary for two years, and we all know that that is not practicable.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me I propose telling the Minister what I think he should do.  There is no point in his talking about 1973 or 1978.  He is the man who came into power on a policy and on a promise to make it easier for people to buy houses and cheaper to keep them.  The only way the Minister can make it possible for people to buy houses is to increase substantially and dramatically the SDA loan of £9,000 in order to bring it to a realistic figure. There is no point in talking about what was the level of the loan in any other year.  The Minister is being told how ineffective the present level is.  As well as increasing the maximum loan to a realistic figure it will be necessary to increase substantially the qualifying income ceiling of £3,500 so that people will be able to avail of the increased loans.</P>
    <P>Next, the Minister should subsidise interest rates, as we subsidised them, until such time as they are reduced to a realistic figure.  It is pointless for the Minister merely to table an amendment to our motion expressing the hope, in common with the general public, that the interest rates will decrease.  Until such time as they are reduced to a realistic figure it is the duty of the Government to subsidise them and thereby to act in accordance with their promise to make it easier for people to buy houses and cheaper to keep them.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment which the <Col N="506" /> Minister moved to this motion yesterday. The case in favour of the amendment was so effectively and comprehensively made by the Minister that there is little need for me to repeat the facts and figures which he placed before the House.  It is necessary, however, for me to take issue with some of the statements made in the course of the debate by Deputies Keating and Fitzpatrick and to place the facts on the record.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating followed the pattern which he set for himself in the several debates here on housing matters last year.  He laid on a barrage of inaccuracies, irrelevancies and various opinions&mdash;such as his objection to wives working after marriage&mdash;and unfounded and unprincipled allegations, abusing the privilege of the House, which, quite properly, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle did not allow him to develop.</P>
      <P>The statistics and the facts are readily available in my Department's Quarterly Bulletins, in replies to Dáil questions and any other statements made by the Minister and myself in this House.</P>
      <P>Not for the first time, Deputy Keating alleged that house prices had been rising more rapidly than ever before.  This is pure bunkum.  The rate of increase of house prices was brought well under control during the past year by Government action and prices had levelled off by the last quarter of that year.  During the full 12 months my Department's Quarterly Bulletins recorded increases in new house prices of 24.8 per cent.  The prices of previously occupied houses increased by 17.8 per cent.  This was small stuff compared with the increase of 36 per cent during the first year of the late unlamented National Coalition Government. That is one record which the present Government will not emulate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputy had thought before rushing in to criticise the proportion of expenditure under the public capital programme devoted to housing he would hardly have been brash enough to raise the subject.  The fact of the matter is that the percentage of the PCP related to housing dropped from 19.2 per cent in 1976 to 15.1 per cent in the Coalition's last budget in 1977.  The corresponding <Col N="507" /> percentage this year at 17 per cent is higher than the 1977 figure.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was selective in his use of statistics in a way which was calculated to mislead.  He did not say, for example, that the number of new house completions increased from 24,000 three years ago to 24,548 in 1977 and to 25,444 in 1978.  Naturally he omitted also to refer to the substantial boost given by the Government to public capital expenditure in other important sectors of the building industry such as roads, sanitary services and telecommunications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keating had the gall to suggest that the building industry badly needs a boost.  Where has Deputy Keating been since 1973?  Output in the building industry dropped by more than 1 per cent in 1974 and by a further 7.4 per cent in 1975.  Output increased by 4.4 per cent in 1976 and by a further 2.5 per cent in 1977, largely as a result of the job-creation measures announced within three weeks of the change of Government in July 1977.</P>
      <P>Last year the Government gave a major boost to the building industry by increasing the public capital expenditure affecting the industry by 27 per cent.  As a result, output in the industry increased by about 11 per cent and reached an all-time record.  Provision has been made this year for a further increase of 27 per cent in the public capital expenditure affecting the industry.  This should result in a further significant increase in output.</P>
      <P>Since July 1977 direct employment in the industry has increased by about 7 per cent.  Nobody, apart from the Deputy, is suggesting that there is a need for a further boost to the industry.  Any such boost could only aggrevate the present shortage of skilled workers in certain sectors of the industry and push up unduly housing and other costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>House prices have been rising not only because the costs of materials and wages and land have increased, but also as a direct consequence of growing national prosperity which encourages <Col N="508" /> people to aim at higher standards of construction, accommodation and environmental amenities than they would have accepted even a few short years ago.  While the Government have effectively tackled the problem of unreasonable levels of house price increases, they have ensured that these actions will not discourage this trend towards overall improvements in housing standards.  This trend is common both to the private and local authority programmes.</P>
    <P>The results of this desirable and commendable development have been analysed by An Foras Forbartha in the case of private housing estates being built in the eastern region, Dublin, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow, comparing the position in 1976 with that in December 1978.  The survey was based on an investigation of 11,580 houses being constructed in the region in 1976 and 10,197 in 1978 and showed that over the two-year period the following important changes had taken place:</P>
    <P>(a)  substantial increase in floor areas of houses;</P>
    <P>(b)  increase in detached two-storey houses;</P>
    <P>(c)  increase in four-bedroom houses and decrease in three-bedroom houses;</P>
    <P>(d)  increase in garages and decrease in carports;</P>
    <P>(e)  almost no houses without central heating of some type compared with 40 per cent in 1976.</P>
    <P>(f)  increase in timber ground floors with reduction in concrete floors;</P>
    <P>(g)  increased usage of brick facing;</P>
    <P>(h)  increase in tarmac roads and decrease in concrete roads.</P>
    <P>Indicative of the trend towards higher standards was the fact that in the eastern region the percentage of all houses constituted by detached two-storey dwellings rose from 6 per cent in 1976 to 34 per cent in 1978.  The number of four-bedroomed houses in the area rose from 27 per cent to 54 per cent of the total, the proportion with individual garages rose from 20 per cent to 49 per cent and the number with central heating increased from 60 per cent in 1976 to 99 per cent in 1978.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" /> Deputy Keating made the case that there is a severe shortage of mortgage finance.  The facts are that in 1978 almost 27,000 loans for the purchase of houses were approved by the major lending agencies.  This was a greater number than was ever approved before in any one year and was almost 2,000 higher than in 1976, the last full year for which the Coalition was in power. Furthermore, a total of £223 million was paid out in house purchase loans in 1978.  This amount was £50 million more than in the previous year and financed the purchase of almost 23,000 houses.  At the beginning of 1979 the lending agencies had approved applications for over 22,000 houses and the expectation is that over £300 million will be paid out in loans this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating made the case that a fund should be set up to provide finance for 99 per cent and 100 per cent mortgages.  For the record, I should like to draw attention to the fact that, subject to the loan limits, local authorities can make 98 per cent loans to tenants who want to purchase a house.  Furthermore, under the low rise mortgage scheme applicants who are allocated a house by a local authority can be given a subsidised 98 per cent loan to purchase that house without regard to any loan limit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the £1,000 new house grant which, he admitted, some people have got, but many who expected to get it did not.  Since the grant was introduced in July 1977 over 15,000 of the grants have been allocated and more than 8,000 have actually been paid.  Thirteen million pounds will be spent on new house grants in 1979.  This compares with only £2.38 million in 1977 when the income restrictions on eligibility for the grants, imposed by the Coalition Government, were threatening to eliminate that scheme altogether.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating said that the £1,000 grant discriminates against the person who wants to purchase a new house in Dublin city on the grounds that no new houses are being built in the city.  This statement, like many more of his assertions, was not in accordance with the facts.  Over the past three years more <Col N="510" /> than 8,000 new houses were built in the city, including 3,700 private houses.  Six hundred new house grants of £1,000 have been allocated by my Department for houses in the city area and 518 of these have been paid.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Keating and Fitzpatrick spoke about the drop in the output of new houses by local authorities. This has rather a remote connection with the subject matter of the motion but, since the Deputies saw fit to raise it, it is necessary for me to set the record right.  Before the change of Government in 1977 there was a deliberate policy to downgrade the housing programme. New house and reconstruction grants were effectively being phased out.  The SDA loan and income limits had remained unchanged for years.  At a time of rising costs the Public Capital Programme provision for housing had been cut back&mdash;from £115 million in 1975 to £105 million in 1976 and to a mere £99 million in 1977.  In particular, the local authorities' housing programmes were being wound down, with completions falling from 8,794 in 1975, to 7,263 in 1976 and 6,333 in 1977.  That downward trend could not be reversed overnight, but I am glad to say that the measures taken by the Government are now beginning to show results.  In particular, the huge increase in the PCP provision for housing&mdash;from £99 million in 1977 to £140 million in 1978 and to £165 million in the present year&mdash;is bound to have a telling effect.</P>
    <P>The level of output on new local authority housing in 1979 will be about the same order as in 1978.  The most reliable measures of activity are the numbers of dwellings in progress taken in conjunction with the average number of men employed on the programme. The average number of dwellings in progress at the end of each month in 1978 was 8,611, compared to 8,702 in 1977 and only 8,195 in 1976.  The average monthly employment in 1978 was about 6,400 which exceeded the 1977 average level of 6,295 and was well above the 1976 average figure of 5,634. Work at the planning stage is also well up on the average 1977 figure&mdash;18,241 at 31 December 1978 compared to a 1977 monthly average of 16,861.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> The 1,386 new completions in Dublin city in 1978 was disappointing, but there were exceptional reasons for it.  Even with this low figure, the corporation have been able to offer alternative accommodation to over 2,800 families in new dwellings or arising from vacancies in their existing housing stock.  In the last two years a total of 5,872 dwellings became available for letting by Dublin Corporation compared with 5,273 in the 1975-76 two-year period.  It is likely that the total number of dwellings becoming available for letting by the corporation in 1979 will be around the 3,000 mark.  At this level a two-year period would clear the vast majority of the current approved waiting list.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating and Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed to the fact that the Coalition Government had subsidised building societies' interest rates and they called on the Government to introduce a similar form of assistance now.  As the Minister explained last night, the subsidy by the Coalition Government was introduced at a time when the inflow of funds into societies was particularly low and decreasing so that the societies were unable to finance the private housing programme of the day.  In order to enable the societies to pay a more attractive rate of interest to investors and so generate inflow without increasing the mortgage rate, the Government introduced a temporary subsidy.  The objective of the subsidy was, I must emphasise, to improve the intake of money by the societies, not to assist mortgagees.  This is borne out by the fact that when the 1 per cent subsidy was introduced in May, 1973 the mortgage rate was 10 per cent.  When the subsidy was reduced to ¾ per cent in August 1975 the mortgage rate had risen to 11¼ per cent and when the subsidy was abolished the mortgage rate was 12½ per cent.</P>
    <P>When the interest rate on building society loans was at 13.95 per cent from 1 November, 1976 until 18 April, 1977, the Coalition Government made no move to reintroduce the subsidy.  In view of the anguish which Deputy Keating and Deputy Fitzpatrick expressed about the &ldquo;brutal&rdquo; increase in building society <Col N="512" /> interest rates, it is only right to put the position into proper perspective and to remind Deputies opposite that the present admittedly high interest rate is only 0.2 per cent, or a fraction of two-thousanths, higher than the level which applied just before the Coalition Government were removed from office.</P>
    <P>I mention that, as an exercise, calculations were made of the cost of public funding of a subsidy which would enable building societies to offer a 9 per cent interest rate to investors while at the same time keeping the mortgage rate at a pre-December 1978 level.  Such a subsidy would cost almost £15 million a year. There is no question that a sum of this size could be provided for this purpose from State funds.  In any event, it is my personal conviction that all the money that is available from Government sources for housing should, as far as possible, be applied to help persons genuinely in need of adequate housing. While there are still numbers of our people in need of proper accommodation there can be no question of applying millions of pounds of public funds to assist building society mortgagees, most of whom are already adequately housed.</P>
    <P>This is the second time in the course of a week that I have spoken on a motion on housing and housing finance. We must bear in mind the fact that this Government have done far more than the previous administration did to encourage house building in both the private and public sectors.  We have rescued the national housing programme from the decline which had set in before the Coalition left office, when housing output was dropping by nearly 3,000 units between one year and another.</P>
    <P>The £1,000 new house grant has been criticised by Fine Gael.  Why do they not say openly that they are against it and would abolish it if they had their way? Although they speak against it they will not say openly what they would do.  It appears they would definitely abolish it. Contrast the position in relation to that grant and the position which existed during the period 1 January 1976 to mid-June, 1977, in particular when the Coalition were in office, and it was virtually impossible for the ordinary working man <Col N="513" /> to get a new house grant.  Without any prior announcement and with effect from 1 January 1976 an income limit was imposed on all applicants for new house grants.  This made it virtually impossible for the ordinary person to get a grant.  Compare that with the present position in relation to the £1,000 new house grant.  In 1976, only 6,388 new house grants were allocated whereas approximately 14,000 of the £1,000 grants, without any means test, were sanctioned in 1978.</P>
    <P>The removal of rates on houses both private and public must have an effect on the general housing position and on the prospects for persons who intend to provide their own houses.  People seeking mortgages had to be concerned with the ever-increasing rates on private houses, particularly when they had to pay full rates after ten years when family expenses were starting to increase.  The Coalition parties, especially Fine Gael, seem to have completely forgotten about the removal of rates from houses and its effect on persons seeking houses.</P>
    <P>Again contrast the situation in regard to SDA loans with the present position. The SDA loans limit has been increased twice and is now double the June, 1977 limit.  The income limit was also increased by practically 50 per cent. Between September 1973 and June 1977 the Coalition failed to make any changes in these limits.  They sat on the fence and ignored increases in costs, prices and earnings and allowed expenditure under this scheme to continue to drop.  This is reflected in the fact that payments under the scheme were less than £17 million in 1977.  Payments increased to £26 million last year and provision has been made for an expenditure of £43.5 million this year.</P>
    <P>Subsidies on private housing sites provided by local authorities increased by 66 per cent.  During the period 1973-June 1977, the price of houses was increasing rapidly and there was a downturn in the number being built&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I remember speaking here at that time.  We all know what happened. House improvement grants were static for a great number of years.  There was no improvement whatsoever in these grants under the Coalition Government. We increased these grants from £200 to £600 without any means test.  In addition, we increased from £75 to £350 the grant payable for the provision of water supplies, sewerage facilities and septic tanks for private dwellings.  In other words, the house improvement grant plus the sanitary grant, is almost equivalent to the £1,000 new house grant.  Proof of the popularity of that scheme is the fact that about 38,500 applications were received last year.  The fact that applications for home improvement grants are coming in at that rate means that there will be no great deterioration of existing housing stock. The existing stock will be maintained, if at all possible, as a result of this incentive of up to £950 in rural areas and £600 in towns and other areas.</P>

      <P>I should like to remind the party opposite and to put on the record of the House that at least 5,000 additional houses per annum could be regarded as being added to the housing stock as a result of these grants. The figure of 5,000 is a very reasonable one when related to the 38,500 applications received each year for home improvement grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why Fine Gael are continually putting down motions like the one before the House, having regard to what this Government have done for housing since July 1977 and bearing in mind the way in which they ran down the housing programme during <Col N="515" /> their latter years in office.  The land bank was also run down.  We must also remember that it takes a few years to finalise a scheme after the purchase of the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were a prospective house purchaser listening to the Minister of State I would be very disappointed. All he has done is give a long litany of what we in Government are alleged not to have done.  He told us about the amazing things he and his party have done since July 1977, yes my party felt obliged to put down a motion because of the brutal increase in house prices.  It is incongruous that the Minister should say that everything in the garden is rosy while we are literally forced to put down this motion.  This subject is close to the hearts of many thousands of people.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made statements which, to me, are not altogether true.  He has deliberately avoided giving appropriate figures which would put certain statements he made into their proper context.  For example, he mentioned the decline in housing numbers while we were in Government.  The National Coalition Government were faced on assuming office with a housing crisis which was well known to Fianna Fáil long before they left office.  The then Minister, Deputy Tully, laid it on the line and said that he would provide 25,000 houses per annum.  He did so.</P>
      <P>The Minister was very careful not to give the figures of new houses built in 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972 because, if he had done so, he would have cut the ground from under his argument.  He is well aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give credit where credit is due. Fianna Fáil came into office having purchased the votes of the country with promises and with public money.  They succeeded in getting into office and removed car tax and rates on private dwellings.  Through an extraordinary level of borrowing they brought down the Consumer Price Index, which stood at 7.9 per cent for the year ended 15 November 1978.  They did that by certain budgetary means, mainly through massive borrowing.  Yet, despite that reasonable reduction in the CPI, we are <Col N="516" /> faced with an increase in the cost of housing during the same period of something over 34 per cent.  To complicate matters and throw further doubt on why this increase should have taken place, the cost of certain imported building materials decreased during the same period.  Yet the Minister of State tonight and the Minister last night treated us to a long litany of the great things they have done, without giving any explanation as to why this anomaly exists today.  They did not give a scintilla of hope to anybody facing the terrible prospect of having to purchase a house. Such people are badly in need of hope.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned land banks.  A little imagination would relieve the enormous pressure which this issue is causing for many people.  What is wrong with providing unserviced sites through the local authority or the NBA free of charge to a certain category of persons and letting those who can afford to pay for them do so?  That type of approach would relieve a great deal of pressure on a certain sector in the community. Yet to do that would seem to be beyond the bounds of imagination.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned that the SDA loan had been raised to £9,000 and said that the income limit had been increased by 50 per cent.  He did not give the figure involved&mdash;£67 per week. Many people who wanted to get their own houses some months ago, when the £7,000 limit applied in the case of SDA loans, were anxious that the income limit should be increased from £3,500 per year.  What did the Minister do?  He increased the loan to £9,000 but not the income limit, which meant that not one extra person became eligible for that £9,000.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the situation as a politician dealing with problems in his Clare constituency. People come to him, as they come to me, for advice on how to apply for an SDA loan.  They are told they must provide a statement of income for the past year and so on.  In many cases I feel obliged to advise young couples who are embarking on the purchase of a house prior to their marriage that they may not be able to afford the cost involved. I have to tell them that they may be putting a millstone around their neck <Col N="517" /> that may cause trouble in a short time simply because the repayment on a £9,000 SDA loan is £24 per week.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that £9,000 will not purchase or build a house.  In any area of the country I hazard a guess that it will cost at least an extra £4,000 or £5,000 to provide any kind of house. In the area where I come from, where land is at a premium because of expansion in industry, it will cost another £9,000 to provide a house.  A young couple must pay £24 a week on the £9,000 loan and to get the extra money necessary it will cost them more than that to repay the bank on a short-term or a personal loan basis.  That young couple are being asked to pay between £40 and £50 per week in repayments on a mortgage but to have that privilege they must have an income of less than £67 per week. How in the name of God can that couple hope to survive?  It is socially intolerable position.  A young couple are embarking on married life and are faced with this kind of financial pressure at a crucial time in their lives.  They are at an age where they have much to offer to the community, when they should take part in community and recreational activities, but yet they find themselves in a position where they can offer nothing to the community in which they live because their time is taken up completely in trying to face this massive mountain which is their housing mortgage.</P>
    <P>Yet, this goes on because we have an obsession about house ownership.  In other countries they do not seem to have this same obsession.  They are quite prepared to live in rented accommodation and the kind of money they might borrow to provide a house they are borrowing in many cases to put it into productive purposes, such as personal enterprises, small industries and so on. In West Germany, for example, a young couple could provide themselves with a house but it would mean repayments on a loan of £60,000 or £70,000.  Instead, they rent a house but they borrow that kind of money for a productive enterprise.  In this country owning one's own house is one of the main ambitions of every young couple.  Successive Governments have encouraged and enticed people into thinking on these lines <Col N="518" /> and to adopting this attitude.  No thought is given to the fact that in many cases the so-called house owner will never own the house because often mortgages outlive young couples.  These are the hard facts of life.  On a quick calculation the kind of money one is talking about on a £9,000 loan, with repayments over a 30-year period, comes to about £24,000.  I am not suggesting that the first day a young couple set out to repay a £9,000 loan they are thinking on these lines but that is the kind of money invested by them in their house.</P>
    <P>I do not know the answer but I do know that in the Fianna Fáil manifesto it was stated that the Minister for Local Government&mdash;this was prior to the appointment of Deputy Barrett&mdash;would ensure that people would be given a chance to own their own houses.  In fact, it is having the reverse effect.  Because of the massively increased costs, people are being forced to request the local authority to house them.  I am a member of two local authorities, one at urban level and the other at county council level, and I know the delays that occur.  I am aware of the red tape in providing local authority houses and I know of the long queues now formed for housing. People are seeking such houses who four or five year ago would not have dreamt of going on a local authority housing list. They do that because at least they are wise enough to see that they just cannot meet demands that the type of loan necessary will make on them in providing their own houses.</P>
    <P>On aspect of housing finance that has always intrigued me is the formula which building societies and insurance companies apply with regard to mortgages.  One of the first things the applicant is asked to do is to provide a deposit.  The logic of all this escapes me. The building society or insurance company are prepared to give the applicant £20,000, £30,000 or £40,000, yet they insist that he provides a £2,000 or £3,000 deposit.  If his credit-worthiness is such that he can be trusted with £25,000 or £30,000, why has he to be crucified by the demand that he should have £2,000 or £3,000 for a deposit.  He is being <Col N="519" /> crucified at the most inappropriate time for him.  What is wrong with 100 per cent mortgages?  Is it true that the person able to fork out £3,000 can use this as his ticket to success in qualifying for a mortgage?  It means nothing.  It should not be beyond the capacity of these insurance companies and building societies to vet their applicants to ensure, before giving them a 100 per cent mortgage, that they are credit-worthy and are a good risk and that they will have no problem with the repayments.  It is quite common on the Continent to give 100 per cent mortgages.</P>
    <P>This idea of offering 90 per cent but not 100 per cent loans is illogical.  I do not know what is behind it.  It would relieve a great deal of the pressure on local authorities if 100 per cent mortgages were provided.  A person might be able to repay the mortgage but would find it difficult to save a lump sum of £3,000.  In any event, even if married couples are moving house the money would be needed for furnishing and so on, which they will not be able to afford if they have spent it all on a deposit insisted on for no good reason.  The result is that these people are now coming on to the local authority housing lists.  The local authorities have always tried to work within the limits placed on them by the availability of finance.  At the moment a very restricted service is being given by the local authority and the Minister cannot deny that the allocation for housing does not measure up to the demand which is increasing because, as the motion says, of the brutal increases in the price of houses.  People who should not be on that list are now making demands on the local authorities because they have no option.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the removal of rates, but in the case of first time house purchasers I have never heard of a prospective house purchaser worrying about how he would pay the rates.  That was a bill that would arise sometime in the distant future.  If a new house costing £10,000, £12,000, £15,000 or £20,000 had a valuation of £15 or £20, the rate would not be applied for ten years.  The removal of rates affected me and no doubt the Minister <Col N="520" /> and the Minister of State, but that was in the case of a house that was fully rated.  I am talking about a person moving into a new house.</P>

      <P>The problems facing newly-married couples are massive in any context.  The position into which they are being pressed is socially undesirable and reaction to this kind of pressure will be seen in the future. Despite the assertions of the Minister, and despite the rather vague statements in newspapers recently that interest rates might come down slightly, the only kind of message that the prospective house purchaser is waiting to hear from this House is that the Minister is prepared to relieve their burden.  Let the Minister do that by giving an assurance that he will subsidise the interest rate if it goes beyond a certain level or by giving a guarantee that interest rates will not rise. That is the kind of message that thousands of people are waiting for, not a litany of what the National Coalition did or did not do in their terms of office and not a litany of what the Minister has done in the past 18 months.  What the Minister has done seems to be the most ineffective in controlling the price of housing and the burden that prices are placing on the shoulders of many young married couples.  The guarantees or promises or assurances sought will not be forthcoming, because, as the Minister of State said, it would cost £X million and we have not got that kind of money.</P>
      <P>Surely the Minister of State must know that when money was required for the purchase of votes and to induce people to vote in certain ways money was found but once the votes have been collected there is no sense of gratitude required on the part of the Government to look after the people who voted for them.  When the Minister says that money could not be spent on that kind of relief it is a very sad day for many thousands of people who must slog along trying to keep their heads above water&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment because I consider it to be quite an important issue.  I asked the Minister today if he was aware of the increasing hardship caused to literally thousands of people in Ireland as a result of the abolition of the food subsidies which lowered their standard of living.  No provision was made for this in the eligibility limits for medical cards.  The Minister did not quite grasp the significance of my question. Indeed, I got the distinct impression that he was astray on the whole issue.  I will try now to explain to him, perhaps in simpler language, exactly what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines for eligibility for medical cards are rather constrictive and very stringent.  In the calculation of whether a person is entitled to a medical card, as little as 70p or 80p outside those guidelines can render a person, or indeed a whole family, ineligible.  The Minister may argue&mdash;and I daresay he will&mdash;that the hardship clause can be invoked in <Col N="524" /> respect of those people outside the limit of eligibility for a medical card.  That is grand in the mind of the Minister but, unfortunately, in the application of these guidelines that does not prevail.  Certainly it does not prevail in the Eastern Health Board area, the largest area in the country, where people with an income of 70p or 80p above the limit are denied a medical card.</P>
    <P>The hardship caused these people is incalculable.  They must pay £3 to £5 for a surgery visit and up to £7 for a doctor's call to their house.  This is especially true with regard to poorer families, families with a large number of children who, more than anyone, experience the greatest degree of hardship.  As we know, in many large families there is constant sickness because of malnutrition, overcrowding and taking into account also that infectious illnesses are inclined to spread from one member of a family to another.  I am not talking about drugs here.  I am talking about family doctor visits, when a family can spend as much as £10 per week out of a normal working man's wage on medical care. That is a considerable amount to spend on medical care; and these are people just barely outside the limits of eligibility for a medical card.</P>
    <P>The limits are unrealistic having regard to today's cost of living and the expenses that are not necessarily taken into account in the consumer price index.  I do not think doctor's visits are included in that, and that is a very important item in any household.  The stringent application of these guidelines is bad enough.  But perhaps I may be permitted to digress for a moment to say it is a sham and farce to say that the chief executive officers meet and decide these guidelines.  I know this for a positive fact, and no Minister for Health is going to stand up in this House and say with truth that the eight chief executive officers meet and decide the guidelines for eligibility for a medical card.  I say that is a downright lie because I know it for a positive fact.  The Minister for Health&mdash;not the present Minister&mdash;but a Minister for Health does this purposely to take the &ldquo;flak&rdquo; from him.  He says that the chief executive officers go through the process <Col N="525" /> of deciding what will be the limits.  They do not; it is decided in the Department of Health.  I know this for a positive fact, so I can say that without fear of contradiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines decided on 1 January this year for eligibility for <Col N="526" /> medical cards afford a single person living alone £28 per week or, if it be a husband, wife and four children, £56.50 per week, and that is gross income before tax is paid.  There is allowance given for outgoings such as rent, mortgage repayments in excess of £4 per week.  They will allow also exceptional expenses necessarily incurred in travelling to and from work where this creates undue hardship.  Could anything be more ambiguous than that, because the normal travelling expenses a man incurs travelling to and from work are not taken into consideration in deciding whether or not he is eligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy say that reasonable expenses travelling to and from work are not allowable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the normal expenses are not, only when they create undue hardship.  I will read it from the guidelines for eligibility for medical card as issued by the Eastern Health Board, Report No 1, 1979, which says exceptional expenses necessarily incurred in travelling to and from work where these create undue hardship.  Therefore, it must be established that there is undue hardship and that the expenses are necessarily incurred.  It is not a case of normal expenses; one must prove that they create undue hardship.  I am trying to explain what kind of income entitles a person to a medical card.  For example, a husband, wife and four dependant children with £56.50 gross per week get a medical card.  Having regard to their expenses, I feel that is inadequate and places so many people just above that limit in considerable financial difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is bad enough but it bears no relation to the realities of today's cost of living.  These guidelines will not be revised until 1 January 1980.  That has been established by the Minister.  He says it would be impractical to revise the guidelines at frequent intervals to take account of movements in the consumer price index.  I do not know how impractical it would be if these eight great men were to meet just twice a year instead of once.  If the Minister says they go through this process of deciding the income limits for eligibility for a medical <Col N="527" /> card, why could not they do it twice a year instead of once?</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything about twice a year.  I said at frequent intervals. I would not regard twice a year as being frequent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am saying twice a year.  I am asking that it be revised to twice a year to take account of movement in the consumer price index in the preceding six months.  Indeed, it was done up to a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done on one occasion, twice in the one year, because there was rampant inflation under the Coalition Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>But my point today is this.  Since the guidelines were established the food subsidies were abolished.  I am saying that as a result a different situation prevails today than when those guidelines were decided.  It is a completely different ball game now.  As a result there has been a drop in people's living standards.  Their money is not buying as much as it did before the food subsidies were abolished.  That is simple and clear and I do not think the Minister would argue that point with me.  The new guidelines did not take this into consideration. I am not arguing with the Minister.  I am saying merely that perhaps he overlooked it.  I am endeavouring to bring it to his attention and asking him if he would give me a promise that these guidelines would be revised because a special situation has developed that was not taken into consideration when these eight men met to decide the guidelines that would come into effect on 1 January last.  As the Minister knows, if they go through this process and if they say and do what the Minister says they do, it is obvious that they met in November.  Indeed, they could have met in October.  What is apparent to me and is apparent to the number of people who have been deprived of a medical card as a result of this&mdash;and there are thousands involved&mdash;is the drop in the number of people receiving medical cards.  That has <Col N="528" /> been established.  There is an announcement to that affect.</P>
      <P>A special situation has arisen here.  It is not the normal type of situation and the Minister should be flexible enough to admit that it has happened.  That is all I am asking the Minister to do.  It is an unusual situation in that the food subsidies were not taken into consideration.  In normal circumstances we cannot correct it until 1 January 1980.  That is a long time to wait.  The Minister should take into account the large number of people who have been deprived of a medical card and who for 12 months will suffer hardship as a result.  This is an intolerable situation and the Minister has an obligation to do something about it. As he said today, he will be providing some recompense for some people in the social welfare field.  But there are those just outside the medical card range and they are already suffering hardship. They are borderline cases and there are quite a few thousand of them in the country.  I feel it would not be asking too much of the Minister to establish new guidelines to operate from 1 April and arrange for this to be done at six-monthly intervals thereafter.  The Minister would not be bowing to any vested interest in doing that.  The Government were able to bow to the farmers, so surely it would be a nice gesture on the part of the Minister and the Government if they were, for a change, to show a little concern for the underprivileged and the disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Connell in bringing this very important matter to the notice of the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with another aspect of this, and that is the situation of small farmers, particularly in the west.  I should like to bring to the Minister's notice that not alone has the small farmer suffered from the abolition of food subsidies but will also suffer from 1 April because of changes in the multiplier system.  It is not clear to me how small farmers are assessed for medical cards.  I would suggest that the Minister bring in something along the lines of the <Col N="529" /> multiplier, as he is doing at present for assistance, in order to make them eligible for medical cards.  The Minister knows as well as I do that small farmers, with perhaps three or four cows and three or four calves, and who are married, are at present not eligible.  Nobody has defined how a person living on a small farm is assessed for eligibility for a medical card.  Is the number of hens taken into consideration or the number of bog acres he has, or is it based on the number of pigs he has?  The position is that there is no guideline so far as the small farmers are concerned.  I would appreciate if the Minister could tell this House exactly how the CEOs assess the income of these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell raised a number of points.  First of all, I want to deal with the question of the information he has apparently received about the determination of the guidelines.  I want to state categorically that the guidelines are decided by the CEOs meeting together and it is their decision.  I do not know what happened in the time of my predecessor, but I believe it was the same in those days because statutorily this is a function of the CEOs.  The chief executive officer of the health board is the person on whom this function is placed by statute.  CEOs came together in pursuance of that statutory obligation and settle the guidelines.</P>
      <P>By coincidence I had a prearranged meeting with the CEOs today to discuss other matters but I availed of the opportunity to discuss this aspect with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically discussed with them something often said in this House: that the hardship provisions in the Health Act with regard to medical cards are not realistic and that they are never applied.  The CEOs assured me today that they are.  There is a very positive approach to the hardship provisions and they exercise the discretion which is given to them by the Health Act in so far as cases of exceptional hardship are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Let us come for a moment to the food subsidies.  I said, by way of reply in the Dáil, that it would be quite impractical to change the guidelines and to operate and implement adjusted guidelines at frequent intervals.  I meant frequent intervals. The guidelines were changed on 1 January.  If we were to change them again now, that would be a frequent interval. I do not think it would be impractical to change the guidelines twice in one year, but that is about as much as we can do.  Let us not forget that it is not just a question of taking a decision to change the level of income; it is a question of giving out more medical cards.  It is a major administrative operation to review the issue of medical cards to the 40 per cent of our population who are covered by medical cards, so it is not something we can do every month.  It was done once because inflation was up at around 20 per cent and over 20 per cent and the situation was so acute that it was deemed necessary by the CEOs, in the pursuance of their statutory duty, to revise the guidelines twice in the one year.</P>
    <P>The effect of the removal of the food subsidies on the guidelines, if we were to give full effect to them at this stage, would be very small.  I have had a calculation done and, in the case of a married couple for instance, if we were to increase the guidelines by the extent of the change in food prices by the removal of food subsidies, it would increase that £40.50 to £40.78&mdash;that is, 28p.  From my discussions with the CEOs on this matter I know that an amount of 20p or 30p would be involved already in rounding up the figures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of a husband and wife the increase would be 28p and it would be 3p in the case of each child.  In deciding on the levels, the CEOs, having made their calculations, would round up the figures at the various levels.  A figure may have been calculated at, say, £40.10 or £40.20 but may be round up to £40.50.  Therefore, I <Col N="531" /> do not think that there is established a case for changing the guidelines and all that involves in respect of these rather small increases&mdash;and they are small when measured.</P>
      <P>The food subsidies' impact is not really related to medical cards in the way suggested by Deputy O'Connell.  It is related more to social welfare benefit and income levels.  The food subsidies real impact is on social welfare recipients and on lower-paid workers.  The right way of correcting any disadvantage and any hardship which might be caused by the changes in relation to the food subsidies would be through those mechanisms and to that extent I suggest we have done reasonably well.  I misunderstood what Deputy O'Connell was saying today.  I thought that one of his arguments was that we were increasing social welfare benefits to counteract the removal of food subsidies and that those increased levels of social welfare benefits would take people outside the guidelines.  I am assured by the CEOs that this will not happen.  They tell me that in 70 per cent of the cases income is not taken into account, that 70 per cent of cases are on the basis of categories or groups.</P>

The CEOs assured me that, from their intimate knowledge of the workings of the scheme, they could not visualise a situation in which an increase in social welfare benefits would affect medical card holders to the extent of depriving them of their medical cards. But the matter having been brought to their attention they are now alerted to it <Col N="532" /> and will take it into account in their administration of the scheme.</P>

The delay in the start of EMS does not remove the need for the controls.  The principal control measures are in respect of capital outflows.  The measures in relation to inward movements of capital are merely designed to monitor possible speculative movements and they do not hold up the flow of investment capital into the country.

    <P>An international company has expressed an interest in the tannery but it is too early to say whether this will lead to a firm proposal.  In view of the present uncertainties, it is not possible to say whether the Gorey leather company will continue as a bovine leather tannery.</P>

      <P>The Florence Agreement, or the UNESCO Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific and Cultural Materials, was accepted by Ireland on 19 September 1978.  This agreement applies only to Customs duties and does not affect value-added tax.  It does not provide for the exemption from duties or tax of medical instruments and requisites.  However, books, publications and documents of all kinds in raised characters for the blind are among the items which may be imported duty-free from other contracting states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Protocol to the agreement which was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO in 1976 would broaden the scope of the agreement to make possible the duty-free importation of further articles for the blind as well as materials specially designed for the education, employment and social advancement of other physically or mentally handicapped persons, subject to certain conditions. Medical instruments and requisites are not included.  It is expected that the new provisions will apply in Ireland and other EEC countries as from 1 January 1980.  The question of the removal of VAT from medical instruments and requisites <Col N="433" /> is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <P>Any person who wishes to avail himself of a disabled person's grant should apply to his local authority&mdash; county council or corporation of a county borough.
