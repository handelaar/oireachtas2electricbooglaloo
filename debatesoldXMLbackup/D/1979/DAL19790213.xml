    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if any report has been submitted to his Department by Irish Dunlop Limited concerning their future production programme at Marina, Cork, in the context of this company's recent UK and European rationalisation decisions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that Irish Dunlop are taking measures to adjust to the changing circumstances which have led to the present difficulties being experienced by the motor vehicle tyre industry in the UK and Western Europe while at the same time doing their utmost to minimise adverse consequences for employment at their Marina plant in Cork.  The company have recently announced that employment will need to be reduced by 90 during the coming months mostly by early retirement and a policy of non-replacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the difficulty likely to be long term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not, but the difficulty arises from the drop in demand for motor vehicle tyres and due to the modern technology used in the manufacture of these tyres the life of them is longer than it traditionally was. <Col N="920" /> However, Dunlops in Ireland have expressed the hope that the action which they have taken will be as far as they will have to go, although, as the Deputy is aware, they had severe redundancies in Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any information that the Pirelli production programme and the tyre plant programme of the other company in Dublin seems to be stabilised while Irish Dunlop seem to be facing uniquely difficult circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin firm, Semperit, have their problems in terms of reduced demand but I am hopeful that they will be able to avoid any serious consequences of that situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the progress which has been made in examining the possibility of reopening the former Van Hool McArdle factory at Inchicore, Dublin, under the auspices of CIE, or anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority have been co-operating with the liquidator in efforts to obtain a replacement bus building project for this factory but so far these efforts have not been successful.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any proposals by CIE to take over the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister on his file answers of last February and November to similar questions?  Am I to take his answer as meaning that the efforts of the IDA have been going on for a year without result?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Have CIE, to the Minister's knowledge, given any thought to the proposal which was made here more than once that CIE should resume the business which it dropped 18 months ago in the event of being unable to find somebody willing to reopen the bus and coach building project?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy understands, I do not have any responsibility for CIE.  Questions of policy to be pursued by them are matters for the CIE board and another Minister.  The Deputy is probably aware that CIE have proposals in regard to the building of buses for their own use in another part of the country outside Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly  Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Kelly</b> asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the reason for the drop of 1.2 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively in the volume of production in the wood furniture and brooms sector, and the paper and printing sector in the August-October period of 1978, over the same period of 1977; and if the trend is likely to be reversed in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of production is ordinarily governed by many factors such as market demand at home and abroad, willingness to restructure and develop new projects, industrial relations and general competitiveness of individual enterprises in the industry.  In the particular quarter mentioned in the question, as far as both industrial sectors are concerned, production was largely maintained for the months of September and October, compared with the same months in 1977.  However, production during the month of August&mdash; traditionally the holiday month&mdash;appears to have been lower in 1978 than in 1977.  It is not possible to indicate particular factors which influenced production during August 1978.</P>
      <P>A more accurate assessment of production trends may be made by comparing figures over a longer period of time.  In the ten months ended October 1978 the level of production in the wood and furniture and brushes and brooms sector was marginally lower than in 1977 while in the paper and printing sector it was slightly higher.  The trends cannot be attributed to any particular factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the wood and furniture and brushes and brooms sector some reduction in the level of production may be expected in the current year due to <Col N="922" /> difficulties in the timber processing area. In the case of paper and printing some increase in production is possible in line with the expected general improvement in the economy.</P>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly  Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Kelly</b> asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy why a decline in production of 3.3 per cent in the clothing and footwear industry in August-October 1978 took place over the same period in 1977; and if this trend is expected to be reversed in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of production is ordinarily governed by such factors as market demand here and abroad, willingness to restructure and develop new projects, industrial relations and general competitiveness of the individual enterprises in the industry.  In the particular quarter mentioned in the question, there was not a consistent trend in so far as production, compared with the same period in 1977, increased in the final month following reductions in the two preceding months.  It is not possible to isolate particular factors as the cause of the average decline of 3.3 per cent in production over the period.</P>
      <P>A more accurate assessment of production trends may be made by comparing figures over a longer period of time.  The latest available statistics indicate that for the ten months period January&mdash;October 1978, the level of production was virtually the same as for the corresponding period in 1977.</P>
      <P>As far as can be foreseen, no significant overall change in the level of production is expected in 1979 in this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there will be no improvement in output next year in the industries mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No significant increase in production is expected but there may be an increase in productivity or output in that sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is no significant increase in production but an increase in productivity, surely that implies laying off workers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It could imply that but I hope that will not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How will it be avoided if productivity is improved and production stays static?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of production may show some small increase.  It is dependent on a number of factors, mainly, how much we can sell abroad and to what extent our market is penetrated by imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a definite question?  Does he anticipate redundancies in the clothing sector during 1979?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been heavy redundancies in these two sectors over the past four, five or six years.  I do not anticipate any further redundancies this year, but unfortunately, one cannot guarantee that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the decline to which Deputy Bruton's and my question draws attention is very likely to be attributable in part at least to a heavy increase in imports of clothing and footwear?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in my reply, there was no decline in the ten months of 1978 for which figures are available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister or Industry, Commerce and Energy the <Col N="924" /> plans the IDA have for industrial development in each of the following towns in County Cork: Kinsale, Bandon, Clonakilty, Dunmanway, Skib-bereen and Bantry; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to a reply which I gave to a similar question on 8 June 1978.  I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the following is the up-to-date position.</P>
      <P>Construction of a new plant for the Eli Lilly project is well advanced at Dunderrow near Kinsale.  This project will employ 150 persons initially in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.  I announced recently that the IDA intend to construct a 10,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Kinsale which will be actively promoted for suitable industry.</P>
      <P>The former Jacobson factory in Bandon has been acquired recently by an existing industry there for the purposes of relocating part of their operations in the premises.  The IDA have acquired a 3.4 acre industrial site in Bandon on which a 10,000 sq. ft. advance factory will be located.  Work on this factory will commence as soon as the planning procedures are completed. Two projects in Bandon were recently approved for grant assistance under the IDA's small industries programme and these will provide about 30 jobs at full production.</P>
      <P>Work has been completed on the 15,000 sq. ft. cluster of five units for small industries at Dunmanway; two of these units have already been occupied by new industries and the IDA are promoting the remaining units for suitable small industries.</P>
      <P>In Clonakilty the IDA have approved grant assistance to an existing firm which will lead to a small expansion of its workforce.  The IDA plan to build a new 7,000 sq. ft. advance factory in Skibbereen on the site which the authority own in the town.  I also announced recently that the authority intend to build a 12,000 sq. ft. cluster unit in Bantry.  Final arrangements for the acquisition of a suitable site are being made at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

The authority plan to commence construction of the factory in April 1979. Construction is expected to take about six months.  The authority will continue to actively promote the proposed factory for a suitable industry.  However, at this stage it is not possible to indicate what type of industry is likely to locate there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The IDA's strategic 72-acre site in <Col N="926" /> Dungarvan is being promoted for a large-scale industry requiring a substantial volume of water, but there are no firm proposals before the authority at present.

      <P>The Industrial Development consortium met once since 31 July 1978, on 29 November 1978. Representative matters to which the consortium are giving impetus are the further development and diversification of the activities of State-sponsored industries, the development of the timberprocessing, fish-farming and processing, and agricultural products processing industries, manufacturing aspects of the telecommunications services and the tool-making industry.  They have also given attention to the identification of new products suitable for production in this country.  On the industrial training side impetus has been given by the consortium to the advance industrial units scheme which is being established on a pilot basis and in which five bodies represented on the consortium are involved. As I pointed out in reply to a related question on 8 November, various subgroups of the consortium are carrying out studies of methods to encourage growth in industrial activities and to remove obstacles to development in particular industries.</P>

      <P>The IDA are at present in contract with a number of companies which have expressed interest in the project but it is too early to say what the outcome of these contacts will be.

      <P>The Deputy will recall that my predecessor engaged a firm who subsequently decided to pull out and, unfortunately, that gave the project a major setback, to say the least of it.  As well as that, zinc prices until very recently, up to the last two months, remained at an extremely poor level.  I am glad to say that they have increased reasonably in the past two months but it was in that time only.  I understand that one of the companies involved in the fixing of the European producer price raised its price yesterday by a further 40 US dollars a ton.  Hopefully the other companies involved will follow suit.  I think that will improve the situation so far as this smelter is concerned.  It is also worth bearing in mind that 12 months ago it was impossible to interest anybody in this matter.  I am now glad to say that we have had several inquiries over the past couple of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy the precise terms of further State assistance being given by the Government to Avoca Mines Limited, Avoca, County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1975 when Avoca Mines Limited encountered serious cash flow problems due to a fall in the price of copper to £500 per tonne, the State has guaranteed the company's bank borrowings.  By the end of 1978, when the Government reviewed the question of further assistance to the company, the State was guaranteeing £2.3 million of the company's total overdraft of £2.85 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On conclusion of the review, which involved a study by a firm of international mining consultants of the prospects for a viable operation at the mine, the Government decided to maintain State support of the mine for the time being at least.  The prospect of a sustained improvement in the price of copper, which has increased significantly in recent <Col N="931" /> months was a considerable factor in the Government's decision.</P>
    <P>Government support will take the form of a repayable loan to enable the company in the first instance to discharge their present overdraft liabilities and secondly to meet operational expenses mainly on the purchase of some new equipment during 1979 by the end of which it is hoped that the company will be in a position to meet their obligations from their own resources.</P>
    <P>There can be no certainly that the improved copper price now prevailing will be maintained.  Any significant deterioration in copper prices or in such factors as production costs, ore grade and ore tonnage mined could seriously affect the assumptions on which the Government's decision was based.  I must emphasise therefore that the support measures approved by the Government will be kept under continuous review having regard to developments on these critical aspects of the Avoca operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if his Department have received any approaches from the Tara and Bula <Col N="932" /> mining companies concerning the future of the Tara operation, with particular reference to the debts of the Tara Company and their current trading position and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the renegotiation of Tara's arrangements for financing their mine development was indicated in a recent statement issued by the company.  This is very largely a matter between the company and the financial institutions involved but my consent has been sought in relation to certain aspects of the arrangements.  I have decided to defer the giving of my consent pending examination of questions relating to mining operations in the vicinity of the boundary area between the Tara and Bula properties at Navan.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, no doubt, the two companies are concerned with their respective portions of a single orebody. Tara are lessees of the State in respect of their portion while Bula Ltd. own the mineral rights for the part of the orebody within their property.  The dividing line between the two portions of the orebody is, essentially, the centre line of the River Blackwater because the orebody extends beneath the river bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tara are engaged at present in mining production but Bula have not yet secured planning permission for their proposed mining operation on the other side of the river.  Extraction of ore in the immediate vicinity of the dividing line, with optimum regard for safety and economic factors, would, I am advised, ultimately require a certain degree of co-ordination of the two separate mining plans or other appropriate arrangements. In the meantime, it is important that operations by Tara, currently or in the immediate future, should not prejudice an equitable settlement of mining procedures in the boundary area.  In their recent statement, Tara indicated that, for their part, they are satisfied on this score.  My Department are engaged in consultations with the parties concerned in this matter but until these consultations have been concluded I will not be in a position to indicate what arrangements <Col N="933" /> are likely to be adopted to deal with the issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Minister's extremely ominous reply relative to the mining operations of Tara could he now confirm that there are grounds for a solid belief that Tara have mined the pillar underground areas in the boundary line of the Blackwater which indeed&mdash;quite apart from any dispute with Bula&mdash;is quite contrary to the safety recommendations of his own expert, Dr. White, and that this gives grounds for an extremely serious situation relative to the mining operations of Tara?  Would the Minister confirm that in view of the very serious statement which he has made to the House now in relation to the operations of Tara?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Tara have mined to a very limited extent under the Blackwater river.  I am advised and believe that there is no danger whatever in that.  I understand that is the belief of the mining inspectorate of the Department of Labour.  The possibility of any danger arising would occur only if the Tara mining plan and operation under the river were not co-ordinated with the mining plan and operation of a possible future operator who would mine from the other side of the river. Therefore, there is no danger in Tara's present mining operation which I understand has the full approval of the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with it from that point of view.  I am concerned about the situation of equity between the two companies which could arise if there was not co-ordination of their mining plans, if they are going to mine up from each side to a common boundary.  My concern, therefore, is a long-term one related to the question of equity between the two operations, assuming that the second one can get going.  If I did not look at it in this way there is a possibility that the second of the two companies, in terms of time, might have to sterilise certain parts of the orebody on their side which, in my view, would be inequitable to that company. Therefore, I have asked both of them to try to co-ordinate their plans in <Col N="934" /> this regard so that both of them can extract the maximum amount of ore for the benefit of the nation generally.  If an abnormal amount of ore had to be sterilised that would not be in the public interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>If on the commencement of any mining operations Bula will now be obliged to have a sterilised area that in fact is tantamount to an admission that Tara have in fact already mined what in effect has been classified by the Minister's experts as the safety pillar area.  They have thus intruded into the boundary area, are pre-empting the prospect of co-ordination and have acted contrary to the agreement with the Minister and contrary to the recommendations of the Minister's expert, which is separate from the Department of Labour, who are concerned with mining safety regulations. The situation, therefore, has really got out of hand and it is something on which, in the national interest, in view of the money involved and the agreements involved, the Minister should have a public inquiry involving Tara in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The conclusions which the Deputy seeks to draw are not valid and nothing irreparable has been done. The amount of mining near the boundary is very small.  Tara have now ceased mining there and have gone elsewhere in their mine to mine until a co-ordinated mining plan can be worked out between the two firms concerned. The Deputy is wrong in saying that there would be a sterilised area on the Bula side of the dividing line.  There will, in fact, be a sterilised area on both sides of the dividing line.  It is my concern to see that (a) it remains as small as possible and (b) that it remains as equal as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he is aware of the recently published reports of the United States nuclear energy regulatory bodies revising in very considerable measure their previous endorsement of the findings of the Rasmussen Report (details supplied) concerning nuclear reactor safety; and if, in the light of these new major reservations and the extent to which the Government have hitherto accepted the assertions of this report, the Government will now defer any decision to <Col N="937" /> authorise the ESB to proceed with the first stage of the construction of a nuclear power station at Carnsore Point, County Wexford, pending a full public inquiry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Nuclear Energy Board that there is a mistaken belief that the Reactor Safety Study Report generally known as the &ldquo;Rasmussen Report&rdquo; has been disowned by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of the USA.  The board add that the US Risk Assessment Review Group, while concluding that the Executive Summary (a non-technical synopsis) of the Rasmussen Report was not representative of the report itself and should not be so used, have in effect substantially endorsed the bulk of the Rasmussen Report.</P>
      <P>I have already made it clear in this House and elsewhere on several occasions that I have no objection in principle to an inquiry into the nuclear project provided such inquiry can serve some useful purpose.  The Deputy is, of course, aware that the present Government have not taken any decision as yet to proceed with construction of a nuclear station as approved in principle in 1973 by the last Government and in their consideration of this issue the Government will have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to the further relevant views of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on the Rasmussen Report.</P>

      <P>On 28 November 1973 the previous Government approved in principle the provision of a nuclear power station.  That decision still stands, although its implementation was deferred in October 1975 by the ESB because of the depressed state of electricity demand at that time.</P>
      <P>However, the Government will very shortly review the earlier decision with a view to deciding whether it should be processed further.  A final decision to go ahead with a nuclear project would not fall to be taken for at least a further two years.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can rely on it.  I would draw the attention of the Deputy and the House to the fact that some months ago, without any question being raised either in this House or outside it, I announced my approval of a project by the ESB to build an enormous coal station on the Shannon Estuary. The capital cost of it, at current prices, is estimated at £350 million.  Its total cost eventually will probably exceed £400 million; it may even approach half-a-billion pounds.  The order of magnitude of which we speak there is not dissimilar in general terms to the order of magnitude of capital investment that would be covered by the project in this question.  It is remarkable that this enormous commitment of public funds in relation to County Clare has raised no questions at all.  The very sort of economic consideration which Deputies and others put forward are equally valid to the question of that station.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course that is so.  But a coal station has a much shorter life.  It does not have to be concreted over and guarded for the next thousand years. The Minister has just said that the statement in the White Paper of three weeks old is accurate and nothing more is being done than an examination of the feasibility of this project.  Would the Minister undertake to reconcile that with the statement in the Government's Green Paper on energy which is only about six months old and which clearly says that we are going to need both coal fired and nuclear plants and that to opt for one to the exclusion of the other would be merely exchanging our existing dependence on imported oil for an equally heavy dependence on another form of energy?  Are these two statements of official Government policy reconcilable?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The supply position for briquettes and turf in plastic containers is generally tight in various parts of the country including Athy.  The reason is that growth in the demand for briquettes and turf in sealed plastic bags has been such that it now exceeds the production capacities of the factories and bagging plants and supplies have had to be rationed on the basis of purchases in an earlier period.  The recent cold weather, difficulties with other fuels and industrial relations problems have contributed to the problem.  Supplies of unbagged machine turf, however, are available without restriction at the bogs which serve the Athy area.</P>
      <P>I should add that a new briquette factory is being built and will be in production next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not causing the shortage because over the past two years the percentage of the output of briquettes which have been exported to the Six Counties has been 4.5 per cent.  Early this winter when it was apparent that there was again to be a shortage I started discussions with the board of Bord na Móna with a view to reducing the already small amount of exports because I felt that, in all the circumstances, residents of the south and tax-payers under this jurisdiction were entitled to priority.  The board, however, pointed out to me that they had traditional good customers in the North who purchased other materials from them, particularly peat moss of which <Col N="943" /> there was no shortage, and they were anxious not to cut off these customers altogether and create difficulties for them.  As a result I agreed with the board that the percentage of output from now on that would be exported to the North would be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Loadings by reference to age of driver have always been a feature of the underwriting practice of insurance companies.  Such loadings are applied to policyholders in the &ldquo;young&rdquo; and &ldquo;old&rdquo; age categories.  The amount of the loadings varies from company to company. There are no age loadings specific to the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To facilitate the calculation on a scientific basis of the levels of premium appropriate to particular risks, statistics <Col N="944" /> relating to loadings generally on an industry-wide basis are being collected and analysed by the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee established in October 1973.  Pending the completion of this exercise, which is necessarily of a long-term nature, loading of premiums continues to be operated on a relatively arbitrary basis&mdash;by reference to area, age of driver and/or age of vehicle.  I have urged on the MPAC the need to make available as soon as possible the results of their work.  In that regard I await with interest the results relating to age loadings, for at this stage, I am not satisfied that these loadings and particularly those for drivers in the &ldquo;old&rdquo; age groups are fully justified.</P>

      <P>No general policy to curb imports is feasible in view of this country's EEC membership and GATT commitments. We cannot for instance unilaterally place restrictions on imports from other member states of the EEC.  Certain limited action is, however, open in relation to third country imports causing disruption on the Irish market.  We benefit from an extensive range of restrictions in the form of quotas or ceilings imposed by the Community on all significant low-cost suppliers of textiles and clothing.  In addition we have been successful in applications to the EEC Commission for national controls on imports of footwear and tyres, and we apply anti-dumping duties in the case of certain products.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The single-engined Alouette III helicopters used by the Air Corps can be flown only in visual flying conditions, day or night, as the pilots fly and remain orientated by reference to external visual aids, for example the horizon, view of the ground and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to have the capability of flying in conditions of reduced visability such as at night or as may arise during daytime because of bad weather, a helicopter must have two engines and be equipped with special stabilisation <Col N="946" /> systems and instrumentation, navigational and landing aids to enable the pilot to conduct the flight under instrument flight rules.  The Alouette III helicopters have not got this capability.</P>
    <P>The provision of a twin-engined helicopter which would be capable of flying on instruments, day or night, is under active consideration.  While such instruments would give a capability of flying at night or in reduced visibility, they would not provide the capability of landing in these conditions without assistance from ground aids.

      <P>I am so aware.  It is my intention that all unsuitable married quarters will be replaced by modern housing as part of the programme for improving conditions for serving soldiers.  In the case of the Curragh Camp 50 modern married quarters were completed at Orchard Park a few years ago and a further 50 new dwellings nearby will be completed soon.</P>

I intend to press ahead with further housing at the Curragh, possibly as many as 100.

I have given a direction that where the occupants of married quarters are transferred to new houses, the quarters vacated will not be relet.  One of the problems in the past has been that pressure has been brought to bear, particularly by young married soldiers, to allow them to occupy such married quarters.  I would remind the House that the local authorities have as much responsibility for the housing of members of the Permanent Defence Forces as they have for other worthy applicants.</P>
      <P>I would appeal to all local authorities to consider applications from soldiers as fairly as applications from other members of the community. Local authorities should not discriminate against members of the Permanent Defence Force.

    <Title>Health Contributions Bill, 1978: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): On the last occasion I had just risen to speak before I was asked to move the adjournment of the debate. The system of health services and of their funding which this Bill is intended to replace is as follows: holders of medical cards make no contribution to the health service but are entitled to all health services free of charge, while the next category, that known as the middle-income group, make a payment towards the health services under the Health Contributions Act, 1970, as amended. When that Act was introduced the contributions were £7 per year for the self-employed and 15 pence for insured persons.  These contributions are now £24 per year and 50p per week respectively. <Col N="999" /> The Minister is replacing that system by what he calls a pay-related system but what he is introducing is not a pay-related system or at least it is a pay-related system but subject to a ceiling and is geared to favour the better-off sections.</P>
      <P>Under the present system the holders of medical cards will not be asked to make any contribution towards the health services but will be entitled to all health services free of charge.  The next category&mdash;those people whose incomes from one source or another do not exceed £5,000 per year or, if they are farmers, although I am not absolutely clear about this from reading the Bill. if their valuations do not exceed £60 per year, will replace what are known as the old middle-income group and their contribution will be 1 per cent of reckonable earnings up to £5,000 which, in effect, means that they will contribute from £1 up to £50 per annum. In return for that payment they will be entitled to free hospital services&mdash;hospital beds, hospital maintenance and medical and surgical consultant fees.  One might think that is a generous increase in the category of people who will qualify for what was previously available to the middle income group.  If we have regard to inflation and the increased costs of hospital services and maintenance, the increase from £3,000 to £5,000 is a small one and does not bring many extra people into this category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final category of people consists of those earning more than £5,000 a year or, in the case of farmers, those with a valuation in excess of £60.  They will not have to pay any higher contribution than those earning £5,000 a year or those with a valuation of £60.  They will qualify, under the Minister's new scheme, for free hospital beds and maintenance but will be required to pay their own consultants' fees.  That is the system as I understand it.  It is not a pay related system because the pay relating element is chopped off at £5,000.  Under the scheme a person with an income of £2,500 will pay £25 per year while a person with an income of £20,000 will <Col N="1000" /> pay only £50 per year.  The Minister will say in answer to that &ldquo;Yes, but the people with an income of over £5,000 will have to pay their own consultants' fees&rdquo;. The Minister has killed two birds with the one stone.  He has succeeded in pleasing two groups of people and has gone a little of the road with everyone. People who are earning over £5,000 a year have to pay only £50 even if they are earning £20,000 a year.  The people earning £2,500 will be conscious of the fact that they will be paying half as much as the people earning perhaps ten times as much as they are.  The Minister has the advantage in that he can say to the consultants &ldquo;Your source of income will not be affected or dried up.  You can continue to charge your patients who have an income of over £5,000 a year or those with a valuation of over £60&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to call this a pay related scheme.  It is a question of going a bit of the way with everybody as was the case with the budget and with the university grants which have been altered today. The fees are going up by 25 per cent and the grants are going up by 20 per cent. This is typical of the approach of the Government to many things since they came into office.  They juggle about with figures and systems and produce a hotch-potch which is neither one thing nor the other.  This is a classic example of that.  When the former Minister for Health introduced the scheme of a free for all health service, he was told in no uncertain way by the consultants that it could not be operated.  The major reason given for not operating it was that there would not be enough hospital beds to accommodate the huge influx of people who would come into hospital.  Where have the beds come from since?  The Minister cannot claim that in his 18 months in office he has produced many new beds.  With the best will in the world he could not do that.  If people with huge incomes are being asked to pay only £50 a year those who earn £2,500 a year who have not a medical card and who are asked to pay £25 a year are being asked to pay too much if this is regarded as a pay related scheme.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy from one of the less well off constituencies I am very concerned about medical cards.  A great <Col N="1001" /> proportion of my time over the last 12 months has been taken up in interviewing people who have complaints about medical cards particularly those whose medical cards have been taken from them and who are frightened of going to the doctor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical cards do not come under the Bill but, as other Deputies have mentioned them, I will allow the Deputy to make a brief statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I will not argue with the Chair because that does not lend itself to good debate or pleasantness.  The fewer people who have medical cards the more people will be called upon to pay contributions under this measure.  I am making the case that people who cannot afford to contribute are being pressurised into making a contribution under the Bill by the manipulation of the medical card system.  On these grounds I fail to see any reasonable reason why debate on them is not allowed.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil manifesto stated that they would ensure that no person will be denied medical care because of their inability to provide for it out of their own resources.  I want to go on record as saying that is exactly and precisely what is happening at the moment.  There are many families, and women in particular, who need medical care for blood pressure, depression and arthritis who cannot afford to go to a doctor.  On top of that these people will be pushed into the scheme and will be asked to pay I per cent of their income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the example of a county council workman who is earning £51 a week.  He is earning £51 a week.  He is married. His take home pay is £43 per week.  He is living in a new house.  I am speaking about an actual case.  His rent to the local authority is £6 a week in round figures.  That reduces him to £37 a week to support himself and his wife and to provide fuel, food, clothes, and everything else.  Under the Minister's system, that man is being asked to pay his own general practitioner and to contribute £20 a year, or whatever it is, towards this scheme.  That is an outrageous <Col N="1002" /> request.  It is outrageous treatment of people with small incomes who need medical attention and cannot afford it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the public relations service he has at his disposal. In the past week, under big headlines, the newspapers have given the impression that thousands of people would qualify for health cards under the Minister's present scheme.  I put down a question to the Minister on 1 November last asking how many cards had been withdrawn in the previous quarter and I got a reply to the effect that the number of cards withdrawn in the July to September quarter 1978 was 24,539. That is a shocking total.  Since then I have been trying to find out the number of cards withdrawn in the quarter beginning 1 July 1977.  I put down a question to the Minister early in December and the reply was that the information was not readily available but that it would be supplied to me.  I did not get the information and about a fortnight ago I wrote to the Minister and asked him for it but I still did not get it.  Last Thursday I repeated the question.  I have just got the reply but, to be quite candid, I cannot make much of it.  The reply states: &ldquo;The information sought is given in the attached table&rdquo;.  To begin with there is no attached table.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>The grand total shows a reduction from the figure given in reply to the Deputy's question on 1 November 1978.  This is due to subsequent modification of the earlier figures received from the Southern Health Board.  These figures, of course, take no account of new cards issued and over the same period the total number of medical cards increased by just over 12,000.</P>
    <P>I do not know what that means.</P>
    <P>The fact is that health cards are being cancelled or withdrawn all over the country.  The ceiling for a health card for a man and woman is about £40.  I put it to the Minister that he is being unreasonable, or his health boards are being unreasonable, in expecting a married man employed by a county council with a take-home pay of £43 after he pays his income tax and his superannuation contributions <Col N="1003" /> to pay £6 rent and to pay for food, heating, clothing, transport and everything else and pay a doctor £3 or £4 a visit to himself or his wife and to pay for drugs up to £5 a month.  It is being harsh and it certainly does not live up to the Fianna Fáil manifesto which said nobody would be denied medical care because of their inability to provide for it out of their own resources.  These people are now being shoved out of the medical card system and into the net in which they will be called upon to pay 1 per cent of their earnings.</P>
    <P>Some people might say if the husband stopped drinking pints or smoking it might be good for him, but human nature is human nature.  In the case I am talking about the unfortunate woman has to take a bus and travel six or seven miles to Clones and pay the doctor £3 or £4.  This is not an isolated case.  The wage of a county council labourer is fairly typical of incomes in rural Ireland. Food subsidies have just been removed and the cost of living has just gone up. The £51 this man gets from the county council does not go as far and leaves him with a smaller disposable income.  I am afraid in the long run this will increase the cost of health rather than reduce it.</P>
    <P>Whether the Minister knows it and whether he is responsible for it, since he took office we have gone back to the stage where the social welfare officer counted the hens and almost counted the eggs so far as small farmers are concerned. There are not as many hens and therefore there are fewer eggs, but these officers are going through the incomes of small farmers with a fine comb.  Studies and surveys carried out show that the vast majority of farmers are living on less than £40 a week, less than £2,000 a year.  Those people should not be asked to pay their general practitioners.</P>
    <P>I remember when the late lamented Donogh O'Malley was Minister for Health.  He was told one day by way of a supplementary question that county managers, as they then were, were denying health cards to people with old age pensions.  His reply was that anybody who would deny a health card to an old <Col N="1004" /> age pensioner was not fit for his job.  A circular went out and from that day until recently anybody who had an old age pension qualified for a health card.  I am sorry for labouring this but with all due respect I think it is relevant to where these contributions are to come from.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The only major point I want to make is: who is liable for them? Human nature being what it is, people usually put off going to the doctor until they have to.  They certainly put off going to the doctor when they cannot afford it.  In this case in my constituency the patient goes to the doctor in Clones. The last day she was there the doctor informed her that he was charging her a nominal sum only because she could not afford to pay.</P>
      <P>There is no point in the Minister telling me, as he is technically entitled to, that there is a hardship clause and that the last word lies with the chief executive of the health board, who will administer justice.  As far as I can see, there are blanket guidelines of £26 for a person living alone and £40 for a married couple with allowances for children. These guidelines are being operated in the area with which I am most familiar and the hardship clause does not seem to exist.  Small farmers and people who live on small incomes in towns are being vicitimised.  There should be a flexible rule.  A person who requires a great deal of medical attention should be given a health card.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to section 14. The information which the Revenue Commissioners receive from inspectors of taxes is being treated less confidentially than heretofore.  Since the change of Government this is the third Bill in which the Revenue Commissioners have been given authority to disclose to other Departments information which they have received from taxpayers.  The <Col N="1006" /> Agricultural Rates (Relief) Bill is one of them and the Bill in connection with grants under the Housing Acts is another.  I deplore this departure which must have been a calculated decision taken at Government level.  Section 14 reads:</P>
    <P>So far as may be necessary for the proper administration of the Act of 1970 and of this Act, information regarding health contributions and the reckonable earnings, reckonable emoluments and reckonable income of individuals in respect of whom health contributions are payable which is obtained by the Revenue Commissioners in connection with the collection of income tax or health contributions may be supplied by them to the Minister or to a health board.</P>
    <P>I object to that arrangement.  Information given to the Revenue Commissioners has always been treated in a confidential manner.</P>

The Minister should look at section 14 and try to see if there is any way to stop the passing of confidential information from Department to Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin to reply by saying that I appreciate the generally constructive and helpful attitude of most Deputies towards this Bill.  I do not suppose that I can legitimately complain if a number of Deputies availed of the debate on this measure to range over the health services in a very broad way.  It indicates that individual Members are on the one hand very knowledgeable about the health services, their scope and details of their administration and also that they are concerned that our health services should be as near perfection as we can make them and that they should be continually pressing for improvement in one area or another.  A number of very good points were made in the discussion.  The Chair was reasonably lenient in the scope allowed to Deputies and I doubt that I will be permitted to reply in detail to various points made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first issue which arose in the minds of most Deputies was the income ceiling or limit which will be as I have already indicated on a number of occasions, £5,000 or thereabouts.  We must always keep in mind here that it is essential for efficient operation of this new service that the same maxima will be applied on both the social welfare side and the health side.  There would be almost insurmountable difficulties and complications if we did not have the same ceiling for both.  On the social welfare side the ceiling is fixed at approximately one and a half times average industrial earnings.  The reason for that formula being used is to ensure that the overwhelming majority of wage and salary earners are included in the scope of social insurance.  That more or less decides the ceiling for it.  I have already pointed out also in connection with the social welfare legislation and with this legislation that the final figure will be determined before 1 April and will be <Col N="1008" /> settled and brought into operation by regulation.</P>
    <P>So far as the health side is concerned it is important to remember that the ceiling and indeed the income generally which will be used as a basis for qualification will be the income for the preceding year.  In other words, the income limit for eligibility purposes in the year commencing 1 April 1979 will be the income for the preceding year, the income earned between April 1978 and April 1979.  That will have the effect of some easement in so far as people at the upper limit are concerned.  A decision regarding their eligibility will always be based on their income in the preceding year.  The situation in regard to manual workers with incomes in excess of £5,000 has been stressed on a number of occasions during the debate but the only point that can be made in the case of this category is that they now become eligible to pay for their consultant services.</P>
    <P>Deputies know the history of this matter and I think any fair-minded Deputy would have to accept that what we are doing now is a very considerable advance on the complicated anomalous situation which prevailed up to now where you had a limit of £3,000 and superimposed on it a situation in regard to manual and non-manual workers.  The whole thing had got into a practically unintelligible state in recent years.  These proposals bring clarity and certainty into the situation.  In future there will be clear-cut categories of persons entitled to certain services.  That is a distinct advantage and a definite advance.</P>
    <P>The higher paid workers&mdash;and I think I am entitled to call anybody earning more than £5,000 a year a higher paid worker&mdash;will not be left unaided as regards these consultant services.  With the full co-operation of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board we will be able to provide a very satisfactory method whereby the people earning over £5,000 a year will be able to provide against any liability they may incur regarding consultant services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland asked me if the new package which the VHI Board were bringing in would be open to the general public and I am very glad to say that it will.  I speak about it principally in connection <Col N="1009" /> with manual workers earning over £5,000 a year because it is of particular interest to them.  But the situation will apply which has always applied, namely, that the package will be open to every member of the general public.  The VHI will shortly be publicising their new scheme and they will now be providing the following benefits: maternity benefit to cover a range of payments for consultancy fees; relaxation of the existing rules governing payments where miscarriages are involved; they will provide for special nursing; there will be relaxation of existing rules governing payment in respect of day surgery and the introduction of a new benefit dealing with cases requiring convalescent care.  In addition, for a limited period the existing entry restrictions regarding previous medical history will be lifted.  There will be no waiting period in regard to eligibility for benefit and no entry age limit, which is very important.  The age loading for subscribers over 60 will be discontinued. Finally, and perhaps equally important, is the fact that anybody who wishes will be able to pay premiums on an instalment basis.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge that everybody in employment, certainly in the upper regions of income, should without delay get in touch with the VHI and study the package which will now become available.  I have been urging the trade unions to draw the attention of their members, particularly those with over £5,000 a year, to this new package.</P>
    <P>I have indicated to them that the VHI board will be prepared to organise discussions and seminars, and I believe that if the wives of most of the higher paid workers were to become fully aware of the package the VHI are now offering we would have a major influx of higher paid workers into the VHI, which is what we are aiming at.  It would be a very attractive package.  It would provide considerable benefits and I would hope that it will be very widely availed of by the trade union movement and by salary wage earners generally. The package has not been fully publicised yet, but I believe that it will be possible for families to provide against the cost of consultancy services for as <Col N="1010" /> little as £11 per annum for each adult and less than £4 per annum for each child.  If you take those figures and allow for the fact that the full premium payable to the VHI board is available for income tax purposes, this is a bargain which is being offered.  I repeat that I asked the trade union leadership in particular to bring these services to the attention of their members.  I urge strongly that they would avail of them and get into the VHI.  Any member of the VHI will agree with me and confirm that it is a most satisfactory organisation to belong to.  It gives a very efficient service. When you submit your claim it is dealt with in a most expeditious manner and with the minimum of bureaucratic inquiry.</P>
    <P>Some doubt was expressed here about the possibility that difficulties might arise in the allocation of hospital beds and that there might be some question that fee-paying patients would procure an advantage over non-fee-paying patients.  I assure the House that any such fears are groundless.  These matters have been discussed with the medical organisations and the health board managements, and the House can be assured that there will be no change whatever in the existing situation.  Beds will be allocated in the public wards entirely on the basis of medical needs.  This will be the governing criteria and it will be impressed on hospital managements, health boards and voluntary hospitals that this is to be the situation.  Not indeed that anybody need fear that there will be any question in any of our hospitals of anything otherwise prevailing. The guiding principle will be that patients will be admitted to hospital, as they have always been admitted to our public wards, on the basis of medical priority.</P>
    <P>Deputy Boland queried the figures of yield from these new health contributions, and perhaps I unwittingly contributed to some misunderstanding here. It is calculated at 1 per cent at existing rates and will bring in about £30 million in a full year.  In 1979 the 1 per cent will not be operating for a full year, but only from April to December.  Therefore, at the £5,000 a year ceiling, 1 per cent in that April to December would bring in <Col N="1011" /> £22.5 million.  To that must be added what the existing flat rate contributions will bring in between January and March, and that will be a figure of £4.1 million.  Therefore, the total estimated income for 1979 will be £26.6 million.</P>
    <P>Some Members have expressed concern about the situation in regard to farmers.  The new situation will be that farmers will pay health contributions the same as any other section of the community, on a pay-related basis.  The upper ceiling will be related to a £60 valuation and valuations under £60 will be calculated <i>pro rata</i>, and the 1 per cent will be a figure so calculated.  There will be improved machinery for the collection of the health contributions from the farming community because the existing situation is not entirely satisfactory.  The health board records indicate that the average collection rate is about 70 per cent, though the figure may be a little higher than that.  Many persons have been billed and therefore contribute to the overall total, though because they are medical card holders they would be entitled to exemption.  The new system will apply fully to the farming community and every effort will be made to perfect the system of collection.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies, in particular Deputy O'Connell, referred to the question of drugs.  This is a very important element of the whole administration of the health services.  First of all, Deputies will have seen that I was at last able to promulgate the necessary regulations to give effect to the Misuse of Drugs Act last week. Unfortunately, these regulations were a long time in course of preparation.  They are very complicated and complex, and they involve long, arduous and tedious discussions with many interests, all of whom had to be consulted and whose advice had to be obtained.  Now they have been promulgated and the Misuse of Drugs Act is now fully operative, and we hope that it will be effective in controlling abuse of dangerous drugs which exists in our community.</P>
    <P>Apart, from dangerous drugs, there are the normal, ordinary drugs and there is a fairly widespread agreement that we are as a community far too dependent on drugs and medicines.  The marvellous <Col N="1012" /> advances that have been made in the pharmaceutical industry in recent times are, of course, a boon to mankind.  They now enable all sorts of illnesses and diseases to be cured and cleared up which previously were, if not incurable, very nearly so.  There has undoubtedly been a marvellous improvement in general medicine as a result of discoveries of the pharmaceutical industry.  However, that very improvement has brought its own danger in its train.  Some people are inclined to think that there is no illness, disease or defect that cannot be cured if one has access to the right drugs.  Of course we know that that is not so. Therefore it is important to maintain a balance in our approach to drugs and medicine, to realise their value and at the same time realise their limitations.</P>
    <P>In general, the GMS relies to too great an extent on drugs and medicines.  We are making a consistent effort to curtail the excessive use of drugs and medicines.  At the same time we do not want to interfere with the legitimate interests of the patient, or the doctor's right to prescribe what he in his discretion considers to be appropriate.  With the full co-operation of the medical profession we are introducing a number of measures which will reduce the cost of drugs in the GMS and will help to reduce the dependence of the population in general on drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>For the information of the House, a very important seminar will take place on Friday of this week.  It is being organised by the Irish Medical Association in co-operation with my Department and the Health Education Bureau and it will be entitled &ldquo;The Alternative to Drugs&rdquo;.  It will seek to get the message across that when one visits a doctor it is not always necessary to come away with a prescription for a drug or medicine. Very often a doctor can meet the needs of a situation in a different way and the patient should not feel cheated or deprived if having visited a doctor he does not emerge with a prescription to be brought to the nearest chemist.  I hope this seminar will perform a useful service in this area.  Side by side with the organising of that seminar, the Health Education Bureau will initiate a campaign along the same lines, to encourage <Col N="1013" /> a more conservative approach to medicines, a campaign which will be designed to get the message across to the general public that drugs and medicines have their legitimate uses but that it is socially wrong and bad medicine to rely too much on them.</P>
    <P>One criticism made by Deputy O'Connell is entirely without foundation and if he thinks about it he will realise that it is not a valid criticism.  Deputy O'Connell said that by bringing in this legislation we are establishing a massive bureaucracy.  We are doing exactly the opposite.  The combined effect of this proposal for a new system of collection of health contributions and the new pay-related system which will apply in social welfare, will be a very considerable reduction in administration and bureaucracy.  From now on there will be only one clear-cut specific percentage deduction, made by the employer, and employers will know exactly who they must make the deduction from, and overall there should be a much tidier administrative system.  That is certainly one of the objectives.  Anyone who studies the thing in detail will realise that there should be very considerable savings all round in administrative costs when these new systems are introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware of, and most Deputies will support, my emphasis on health education and preventive medicine.  Here, as in most EEC countries, it is recognised that this is ultimately the only way to bring the cost of health services under control.  It is only by persuading more and more people to take care of their health and to avoid the sort of life style that creates ill-health, that we can meet the very heavy cost of our health services in the future without placing an undue and intolerable burden on the taxpayer.  In relation to health education we are continuing our efforts in regard to smoking, and Ash Wednesday this year will be proclaimed a national &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; day.  With the assistance of the Junior Chambers of Commerce throughout the country we hope to have a major &ldquo;no smoking&rdquo; campaign throughout the country on Ash Wednesday.  More details of that will be announced in due course but that <Col N="1014" /> is one of the efforts we have in mind for the immediate future in our campaign against cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>Increasing attention has been directed to the problem of alcoholism.  There was an interesting seminar recently which most Deputies will have read about where some of our experts gave their views about the incidence of alcoholism and the dangers involved in excessive drinking.  A different situation prevails here than that in regard to smoking and it requires a different approach.  We have to develop our services in relation to alcoholism.  We have, I regret to say, a fairly high number of people who suffer from the disease of alcoholism and we must increase and improve our services for this very vulnerable section of the community.  We must also give much greater attention to prevention in this area.  Nobody would suggest that we embark on totally restrictive campaigns. We must curtail and limit the abuse of alcohol, to try to eliminate excessive drinking and if at all possible encourage widespread support for the concept of moderate drinking.  Most people would agree that alcohol is one of the benefits available to mankind, but it is only a benefit if it is sensibly and moderately used.  That must be the keynote of our approach to alcoholism and excessive drinking.</P>
    <P>Many other issues would naturally arise in the course of a debate of this sort and one is tempted to go on and turn this debate more or less into a general resume of the activities of the Department of Health.  However, I intend to resist that temptation.  I would hope that I have dealt to their satisfaction with most of the points raised by Deputies.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude, I wish to comment on one point raised during the course of the debate.  This was the suggestion that we should have health programmes on radio and television.  I am glad to be able to inform the House that we have made and are making considerable progress in that regard.  It is clear to most Deputies that the power of television in this area is enormous.  It is a very effective medium for getting across all sorts of messages. The RTE Authority and the Department of Health have a mutual interest in this field.  People are interested in their health <Col N="1015" /> and, therefore, good health programmes could be good television.  I think that concept is accepted in RTE and we have had many useful and helpful discussions involving the Department of Health and the Health Education Bureau.  In the months ahead we can expect quite a number of useful and beneficial programmes in the field of health on radio and television.  I am glad to be able to mention that to Deputies and also to say that the attitude within RTE is entirely helpful.  There are many difficulties involved in this, but in regard to attitude I may say that there is nothing but helpful co-operation forthcoming.  A great deal can be done and enormous benefits can ensue from co-operation between the Health Education Bureau and the RTE Authority.</P>

      <P>I recall the Deputy mentioned that.  The cost of the scheme in 1978 was about £2.1 million.  From 1 April it will be extended to the community as a whole.  It is not a very expensive scheme from the point of view of administration.  It is regarded within the Department as a scheme which gives very good value from the administrative point of view.</P>
      <P>The complaint about the scheme concerns the delays which occur in making the refunds and we must give attention to that aspect.  I met a deputation yesterday representing suffers from asthma. They are very appreciative of the refund at present given to people with limited eligibility and the fact that this refund will now be available to all members of their society, to all asthmatic sufferers. They say that the benefits is seriously impaired by the delay in the making of the refunds and I undertook to consider that aspect.  Deputy Boland need not have any fears about wasteful or excessive administration costs.  The scheme can be very simply administered and will give good value.</P>

    <Title>Redundancy Payments Bill, 1979: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, was not a controversial piece of legislation; nevertheless it was important. Its importance is highlighted by the fact that since the redundancy payments scheme came into operation at the beginning of 1968 over 100,000 workers have benefited from it.  That figure gives an idea of the contribution which the scheme has made in promoting the restructuring of industry, in facilitating retraining and re-adaptation, in promoting the climate necessary for change, and in alleviating the anxiety and the hardship which so many would otherwise have had to experience in situations of redundancy.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the scheme there is a fund financed by contributions by employers and workers as part of the general social insurance stamp.  Under the scheme a redundant worker with at least two years' service with his employer is assured of a lump sum payment. This is payable by the employer who can then obtain a rebate from the fund varying generally from 55 per cent to 70 per cent.  If the worker is unemployed a weekly payment may be paid at the employment exchange. Workers' entitlements are calculated by reference to age, service and pay.  The independent Employment Appeals Tribunal determines issues of entitlement. The scheme at its initiation was seen as providing employees with some compensation for the loss of their jobs, recognising the rights built up by workers in their employments.  The financial help in the form of lump sums and weekly payments was meant to be of assistance to employees in the period between the loss of one job and the securing of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from this, the scheme could be <Col N="1017" /> seen as an adjunct to our moves from protection to free trade.  The removal of tariff barriers had begun in the early sixties and was greatly extended by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement in the middle of the decade.  Membership of the European Communities was also foreseen, with which would come further dismantling of our tariff barriers.</P>
    <P>It was realised that some industries would have difficulties in facing increased competition and that a degree of rationalisation involving job changing would be a probable consequence.  The 1967 Act was an important response to alleviate the hardship of workers made redundant.  The Act was designed to reduce worker resistance to necessary changes in our manpower structure. Other elements of our manpower policy, including the advisory and placement facilities of the National Manpower Service, the resettlement allowance scheme and the training and re-training programmes of AnCO were all available as well to help promote the changes the country needed.</P>
    <P>On reviewing the legislation, I have had regard to these factors as well as to developments since the scheme began.  I have also taken into account criticisms, representations and suggestions received.  There have been detailed discussions with both employer and worker representative bodies.  The proposals in the Bill which is now before the House are based on the premise that the redundancy payments scheme should continue and that it be developed as a component of manpower policy.</P>
    <P>All parties were agreed that the scheme needed to be significantly recast. The general improvement in the level of social welfare benefits, and especially the introduction of pay-related benefit, raised the question of the continuing need for redundancy weekly payments. These are paid in conjunction with unemployment benefit and pay related benefit but normally subject to the rule whereby the aggregate weekly amount does not exceed 85 per cent of pre-unemployment average net weekly earnings or £50, whichever is the least.  This 85 per cent rule has meant that since its introduction in 1976 redundancy weekly payments have been curtailed in many <Col N="1018" /> instances.  In fact, there are cases where redundant workers have ceased to become entitled to any weekly payments.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive study of the redundancy payments scheme published in 1977 under the auspices of the Economic and Social Research Institute concluded that the weekly payments, being an income maintenance feature of the scheme, should be discontinued, income maintenance being more appropriate to the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>My own examination of the scheme has led me to the same conclusion.  One of the main provisions of the Bill is, therefore, to discontinue weekly payments. It is proposed, however, that persons currently in receipt of redundancy weekly payments at the point when they are abolished that is 6 April 1979, will continue to receive their entitlements until they are exhausted or cease for other reasons.</P>
    <P>Weekly payments have always been associated, particularly by the trade unions, with the workers' contributions. This probably results from a comparison with the British scheme which has no weekly payments or workers' contributions. I consider it appropriate, therefore, that as weekly payments are to be discontinued, so too should the workers' contribution.  A proposal is accordingly included in the Bill to abolish the workers' redundancy contribution from 6 April 1979.  The redundancy payments fund will be financed henceforth, it is proposed, entirely by employers' contributions.</P>
    <P>It is further proposed that these employer redundancy contributions should, as with social welfare contributions in general, be pay-related.  They will be collected as part of the general social insurance contribution and be levied on earnings up to the same ceiling as for social insurance purposes.  The figure specified in the Social Welfare Act, 1978, is £5,000 but provision is made in the Social Welfare (Amendment) Act, 1978, to update this figure by means of regulations which are to be subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance: a draft of any such proposed regulations must come before each House of the Oireachtas for approval. <Col N="1019" /> I do not think it is necessary for me to outline the advantages of a system of contributions related to pay.  Deputies will recall that during the passage of the Social Welfare Bill last year the House discussed the conversion from flat rate to pay related contributions.  I would just like to say that a pay related basis is all the more appropriate for redundancy contributions since the workers' lump sums and hence the employers' rebate entitlements will be pay-related.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that the rate of the redundancy contribution be set at 0.5% per cent of reckonable earnings.  It is estimated that this will give the redundancy fund an income of about £9 million in the year commencing 6 April 1979 which I expect will keep the fund in credit at least up until the end of the first year of operation of the revised scheme when it is my intention to review the situation, including the adequacy of the contribution rate, in the light of the experience in the meantime.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing to raise the statutory ceiling on lump sums.  The ceiling for calculating lump sums is at present £2,500 and I propose to double this figure.  This would give a best possible lump sum of £4,087 when the revised scheme comes into operation as against £2,043 now.  Assuming the upper age limit for qualifying is dropped to 66 after the first year of operation of the scheme this figure will, of course be somewhat reduced&mdash;to £3,702, in fact.  I will come to this reduction in the qualifying age later.</P>
    <P>An unsatisfactory characteristic of our redundancy payments scheme as it has developed over the years is its complexity. I am sure this observation will not be lost on Deputies who have had to understand how the scheme works.  An important objective in my review of the scheme was, therefore, to simplify it to the greatest extent possible so that it is more easily understandable to those who have to do so.  Indeed the amendments I have already indicated, though not proposed for simplicity sake, will mean a much less complicated scheme.</P>
    <P>The rebate system as it now exists is particularly complex.  At present an employer is entitled to a 55 per cent <Col N="1020" /> rebate if he gives the requisite two weeks' notice, with an extra 2½ per cent for each week of extra notice up to a maximum of eight weeks or 70 per cent. Further, in the case of employees with over 20 years' service, that part of the employees' service over 20 years is rebated at 100 per cent.  Where two weeks' notice was not given, the rebate could be reduced to 45 per cent.</P>
    <P>This complicated rebate system was designed to encourage employers to give additional notice to workers so that they might make arrangements about further employment and also to provide advance information on impending redundancies to the State agencies concerned so that they might be better able to carry out their functions in relation to the redundant workers.  I refer in particular to the placement function of the National Manpower Service and to AnCO.  Since the enactment of these rebate provisions there have been other developments which ensure that these objectives are more effectively achieved than through the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, make provision in regard to the giving of notice.  The National Manpower Service and AnCO and their offices throughout the country concern themselves with the placement and training of redundant employees whenever possible.</P>
    <P>I am proposing therefore to confine the notice provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts to simply two weeks, which is adequate for the administration of the scheme, and at the same time I am proposing a uniform level of rebates set at 60 per cent, which is just below the average rate of rebate up to now.  I might point out that this is a rate which is fairly high, especially when compared with the UK's current 41 per cent.  For failure to comply with the minimum of two weeks' notice, a provision is included whereby the rate of rebate may be reduced from 60 per cent to 40 per cent.  I am further proposing that the Minister for Labour should have power to vary these rates of rebate by regulation, subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance and possible <Col N="1021" /> annulment by either the Dáil or Seanad.</P>
    <P>When the 1967 Act was enacted the old age pension age was 70 years.  This continues to be the age up to which a person can qualify for redundancy payments, as it was brought down with the old age pension age.  I feel the upper limit for redundancy payment entitlement should be set at old age pension age and accordingly a provision to that effect is included in the Bill.  I am however aware that a sudden drop could disentitle many people, both employers and workers, with reasonable expectations in this respect in the event of redundancies.  It is proposed therefore that the drop should not occur until one year after the other provisions in the Bill come into operation, that is, from 6 April, 1980.</P>
    <P>In 1967, when the scheme was established, the normal working week was 42 hours and the number of hours in a week which a worker was normally expected to work in order to qualify under the scheme was set at half that number, that is, 21.  The reasoning behind this is that the scheme should cover employments from which employees are deriving the main source of income and should not extend to subsidiary jobs.  I am proposing that, since the normal working week is now 40 hours, the number of hours needed to qualify be reduced to 20.</P>
    <P>One of the problems faced by an employee who is under notice of redundancy is the need to get another job. While most employers would in the circumstances allow employees reasonable time off to look for work or arrange for training, I feel this is something which should be given to employees as of right. I have accordingly included a provision in the Bill to this effect.  To safeguard against abuses, employers may require the employee to give reasonable evidence of appointments in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the Employment Appeals Tribunal, you may well be aware of delays in hearing resulting from a backlog of cases.  This is largely due to the increased work-load imposed on the tribunal by the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  I have been conscious of this problem for some time and I am proposing in the Bill that the membership of the <Col N="1022" /> Tribunal be considerably expanded. Provision is made to permit the appointment of five vice-chairmen instead of three and of 30 ordinary members instead of 24.  I have also provided that should the work-load of the tribunal warrant it, additional appointments may be made for the speedy despatch of business.</P>
    <P>I now come to the remaining amendments to the Acts which affect details of eligibility and the administration of the scheme.  The first of these amendments is to the effect that an employee shall not lose previous service in the case of reinstatement or re-employment under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>A further amendment concerns the concept of &ldquo;obligatory period&rdquo;.  In the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the &ldquo;obligatory period&rdquo; was devised as some protection to employers in cases where redundant employees wished to leave before the period of employers' notice expired.  It means the period of notice to which an employee is entitled either under the contract of employment or statute.  Where the employer gives longer notice the &ldquo;obligatory period&rdquo; of that longer notice is the period which expires at the time when the employer's notice expires.  An employee wishing to leave before expiration of employer's notice and remain entitled to redundancy payments can do so only by giving, within the obligatory period, written notice of intention to leave, and with the employer's consent.  When an employer objects the Employment Appeals Tribunal can decide the issue.</P>
    <P>This provision can operate unsatisfactorily. For example, the employee might obtain an offer of other employment conditional on his taking up the job without delay, but if the employee leaves before the obligatory period he loses redundancy entitlement, and if the employer nevertheless pays, he loses entitlement to rebate.  I am therefore proposing that the parties may by agreement bring forward the termination date of employer's notice so that the employee's notice may be within the obligatory period.</P>
    <P>The time limit for claiming a redundancy payment is 52 weeks which the Employment Appeals Tribunal may extend <Col N="1023" /> to 104 weeks.  It could happen that an employee could become redundant, and entitled to redundancy payment&mdash;having been technically dismissed by one employer and employed by another&mdash;without his learning of the fact before the 104 week limit had expired. This would be because of the failure of an employer to give notice or a redundancy certificate.  I am proposing to empower the tribunal at their discretion to extend the time for claiming in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The next provisions I want to refer to concern a worker's entitlement to claim redundancy in the event of being on short time.  In order to explain, I refer first to the position in relation to lay-off. At present the legislation provides that where an employee's employment ceases by reason of his employer's being unable to provide the work for which the employee was employed to do and it is reasonable in the circumstances for that employer to believe that the cessation of employment will not be permanent and where the employer gives notice to that effect to the employee prior to the cessation, that cessation of employment shall be regarded for the purpose of the redundancy payments scheme as lay-off.  The reasonableness or otherwise of the employer's belief that the cessation of employment will not be permanent is subject to scrutiny of the tribunal, which have regard to all the circumstances in deciding whether employer's belief was reasonable or whether the purported lay-off in fact amounted to a constructive dismissal.  In the case of short-time, however, the tribunal are precluded from investigating the matter because of the absence of any provision as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the employer's belief that short time will not be permanent.  I propose therefore to include a provision which will subject short-time to the same tests as lay-off.</P>
    <P>In another respect, too, the existing provision in relation to short-time is rather unsatisfactory.  A worker can claim redundancy if he is put on short-time, which is for this purpose defined as less than half his normal weekly hours or for which he receives less than half his normal weekly remuneration and where <Col N="1024" /> such short-time continues for specified periods.  Where the short-time working leaves the worker with half his normal hours or normal pay or more, he may still be able to claim redundancy on the grounds that his former job has ceased and the new job does not constitute an offer of suitable employment which would disentitle him to redundancy payments. But, in the latter case, that is where the reduction in hours or pay is not more than one half, the worker would have to refuse the new working conditions immediately or carry them out for not more than four weeks.</P>
    <P>The Employment Appeals Tribunal which decides these issues has intimated that on the basis of counsel's opinion it feels constrained to decide in such circumstances that the worker who has worked the new situation for four weeks or more has accepted revised terms and conditions and is not therefore entitled to claim redundancy.  It is felt that the legislation should not discourage the acceptance of reasonable short-time working whenever appropriate, and should not encourage workers to claim redundancy by virtue of part-time working which is not a particularly severe reduction. Therefore the Bill provides that in such circumstances dismissal for redundancy may be deemed to have occurred notwithstanding that the person has accepted reduced hours and/or pay for not more than 52 weeks, that is, he shall not for that reason alone lose redundancy entitlement.</P>
    <P>Under the 1967 Redundancy Payments Act, the rules governing continuous employment lay down that employment shall be taken to be continuous unless terminated by dismissal or by the employees voluntarily leaving the employment.  It is nevertheless also provided that continuity of employment is preserved in certain circumstances and subject to defined time limits where employment is resumed with the same employer whether or not notice of termination of employment had been given. Childbirth or maternity is not actually specified in this respect but, where an absence of up to 26 weeks for any cause is authorised by the employer, continuity of employment is preserved if the employee had been dismissed within <Col N="1025" /> such 26-week period but was later re-employed. I am providing in the Bill that an absence for childbirth for a period not exceeding 13 weeks should not break continuity of a woman's employment, even if the absence was not authorised, that is, had not the prior agreement of the employer, provided there is a resumption of work.</P>
    <P>Section 39 of the 1967 Act provides that notices of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal must be sent to the Minister for Labour.  Appeals under the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977 and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 go directly to the tribunal.  As there is no necessity for appeals under the Redundancy Payments Acts to be channeled through the Minister, the Bill includes a provision that such appeals should go direct to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Under the coming pay-related system of contributions the rate of redundancy contribution should not have to be changed from time to time simply because of the declining value of money since it is set at a percentage of reckonable earnings.  It is being proposed that the ceiling to reckonable earnings will change automatically whenever it is changed for the social insurance contributions. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to change the rate by reference to the varying requirements of the Redundancy Fund, and as the redundancy contribution will be collected under the PAYE system along with the social insurance contribution, any change can only be made with effect from the beginning of a tax year and must be determined in good time.  The yield required will depend primarily on the incidence of redundancies, and also on the age and service pattern of the redundant persons with due regard to the reserve in the fund.  The Minister for Labour, as manager of the fund, should be in a position to act quickly to keep the income and expenditure of the fund in a proper relationship, without, if possible, having to borrow from the Exchequer. Therefore the Bill includes a provision for the variation of the rate of contribution by regulation subject to the sanction of the Minister for Finance, with a <Col N="1026" /> proviso that every such regulation shall be laid before each House and if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed the regulation shall be annulled accordingly.  I have already drawn attention to the provision for the variation by regulation of the rate of rebate.</P>
    <P>The method of calculating the amount of lump sum is set out in Schedule 3 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 as amended; it also sets out the rules governing normal weekly remuneration by reference to which the lump sum is calculated.  Briefly this is a half week's pay for each year of continuous employment between the ages of 16 and 41, and a week's pay for each year over the age of 41 plus one week's pay, pay in excess of £48.08 per week being disregarded.  I am proposing that power should be given to the Minister for Labour to vary the basis of calculation of lump sums by regulation but, as with respect to the power to vary the rates of contribution and rebates, this would be subject also to the sanction of the Minister for Finance and possible annulment by either House of the Oireachtas.  Similarly the Bill enables revision of the ceiling to gross normal remuneration by Regulation so that, with the minimum of procedural difficulty, this ceiling may be adjusted as may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>If an employer refuses or fails to pay a worker his statutory lump sum entitlement the Minister is required to pay the lump sum out of the fund whereupon all rights and remedies of the employee with respect to the lump sum are transferred to and become vested in the Minister. The Minister, in cases of insolvency, is then entitled to claim, in the bankruptcy arrangement, administration of the insolvent estate or winding-up, the amount paid less the amount of rebate which would have been payable.  A provision that in winding-up and bankruptcy circumstances the Minister's claim should rank as a priority debt, apart from helping to preserve the solvency of the fund, should, it is felt, reduce the incidence of direct payments from the fund in that the lump sum entitlements would in fact more often be paid along with wages due, and it would also thereby cut out or reduce the delay in workers getting their <Col N="1027" /> payments.  Accordingly, I propose to cover this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, the penalties provided for in the 1967 Act have not been updated and the Bill raises these penalties.  In addition the Bill contains the standard provisions covering citations, construction and commencement and for removal by regulation of any difficulties that may arise in bringing the revised legislation into operation.</P>
    <P>In view of the way in which this Bill had to be drafted I directed that the Explanatory Memorandum should set out as clearly as possible the various changes proposed.  I might add that it is my intention to have a guide-book prepared on the amended scheme when this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I believe that the proposals in the Bill are worthwhile and useful and I hope that all Deputies can support them.</P>

      <P>Any speech by a Minister or by the main spokesman of a party dealing with redundancy payments cannot be complete without an examination of the whole question of redundancy and its impact on the central economic problem facing the country, unemployment. I have to chide the Minister for having the gall to come into the House and speak with a text prepared by his civil servants and not once refer to the massive problem of redundancy which has jeopardised our employment creation. I want to deal with the question of redundancy before I come to the general provisions of the Bill.  Some Ministers have told us that last year there were 13,000 redundancies, I understand there are no official statistics yet.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you would let me develop the point and you would see the relevance of it.  The Minister said in the first paragraph of his speech:</P>
      <P>Its importance is highlighted by the fact that since the redundancy payments scheme came into operation at the beginning of 1968 over 100,000 workers have benefited from it.  That figure gives an idea of the contribution which the scheme has made in promoting the restructuring of industry, in facilitating re-training and re-adaptation, in promoting the climate necessary for change, and in alleviating the anxiety and the hardship which so many would otherwise have had to experience in situations of redundancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputies on this side of the House fully support that.  Have the State given enough thought to the general impact of the Redundancy Payments Acts on <Col N="1030" /> employment?  I know many workers who have been tempted and have taken the lump sum, which is very attractive to them to solve their transient financial difficulties, who find themselves about nine months later without anything, looking for employment.  As well as that the jobs they left, where machines were installed, were much more productive than a lot of the jobs we are now creating.</P>
    <P>We have got to look at redundancy legislation in that light.  The Minister was right in what he said in the first paragraph of his speech.  We have to provide for the restructuring of industry, we have to facilitate retraining and readaption and we have to promote the climate necessary for change.  We have to alleviate the anxiety and the hardship but we have also got to protect employment which is more meaningful than a lot of the &ldquo;make work&rdquo; jobs, the wealth-consuming jobs, we are creating today. The Minister and the Government should look at that aspect of the problem.  How can we provide for that situation?  Instead of favouring capital against labour, which is a by-product of our current redundancy legislation, should we not see if we can provide for the restructuring of industry and the necessary climate for change and at the same time protect productive jobs?  It would be much better if the redundancy fund was called perhaps the Job Maintenance Fund.  Part of that fund could be used to maintain threatened jobs.  Long before I was ever in this House I worried about the impact of redundancy legislation.  We all know that the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, and this Bill are, in general, necessary and worthy; but this Bill gives undue attention to the aspect to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>Payments were made last year under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967.  Some Ministers say 13,000 and others say 10,300.  It does not matter how many; it is not central to the argument I am going to make.  The fact is that several thousand jobs were lost last year.  It may be as many as 13,000, if we are to believe the Taoiseach.  Would the Minister for Labour institute an examination to see how many of those jobs could have been saved and how many of them should have been saved?  How many of these people have been replaced by machinery, because of our bad industrial relations situation?  How many of these jobs have been lost because of the payroll tax effect of all social insurance, including redundancy repayments?  How many of those jobs were more worthy than the other so-called jobs created under the environment improvement scheme, the employment action team programme, the community youth training programme and all these short and temporary schemes.  When it comes to Committee Stage I hope to be proposing amendments to the Bill which may provide for this sort of situation.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to address himself in his reply to the problem of redundancy.  I would ask him especially to institute some sort of examination into what happened to those jobs last year, what sort of jobs they were and why they were lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said, both inside and outside this House, on many occasions that one <Col N="1032" /> of the chronic problems facing this country is not just one of unemployment but one of under-employment.  So long as our redundancy legislation makes it easy for workers to accept lump sums and so long as we have such gross under-employment we will have severe redundanices and our employment creation efforts will be badly reversed.  The Minister has given no indication that he has any grasp of that fact.  The NESC report No. 35 shows that our manufacturing industry produces just over half per man what industry in the Benelux countries and Denmark produce.  In other words, by their standards we could do with exactly half our industrial work force.  The comparison with Germany is even worse.  That is the extent of under-employment here.  That is the slack that has yet to be taken up so long as redundancy legislation ignores the problem&mdash;and this Bill does ignore the problem.</P>
    <P>The question of redundancy cannot be divorced from unemployment.  I will only refer to unemployment in passing because that is a separate debate.  Our problem of unemployment is greatly worsened by under-employment, which is very seldom talked about.  So long as we keep making up so-called jobs lasting for six weeks and so long as we keep deluding ourselves by making up jobs like those under the environmental improvement scheme, we are hiding the true nature of the problem.  We are &ldquo;conning&rdquo; ourselves; we are preventing ourselves and our people from facing up to the necessary solutions to this problem, and this Bill will not help that situation.</P>
    <P>Before I read the Minister's speech I had prepared some comments, but I had to say what I have said because his speech was so disappointing.  It is fair to say that, in so far as this Bill amends and improves the present redundancy structure, it is generally welcome.  That does not mean that we on this side of the House will not criticise some of its provisions. I have already said that social insurance, of which redundancy repayments have now become an incorporated part, constitute, like health payments, a payroll tax.  In other words, for every employee employed an employer <Col N="1033" /> has to pay into the Exchequer or the social insurance fund or the redundancy repayments fund.  He has to pay a tax on each employee.  I made the same remarks in relation to the Health Contributions Bill which was before the House today.</P>
    <P>We have to look at that policy.  I readily admit that there is no easy answer to the question of where to find the funds to replace social insurance, but so long as we tax employers for employing people we are asking for trouble.  We are further inhibiting the employment of labour as opposed to the employment of capital.  That does not make sense in our national situation.  I have already asked the Minister for Health and Social Welfare and I ask the Minister for Labour also to look at that situation to see if there is some alternative.  Perhaps we cannot phase it out altogether but perhaps we could phase out gradually the social insurance liabilities of employers, but unfortunately the provision in the Bill to transfer all payments, which are doubled, to employers does not make sense in our conditions.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister had to do away with the employee's contribution because he is doing away with the weekly redundancy payments, but it is folly to pass all these things on to the employer.  Perhaps the whole lot does not amount to very much, something like £25 a year, but when it has been added to pay-related social insurance and health insurance contributions it becomes a lot.  Indeed it is another reason do disemploy people.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the redundancy lump sum will be a pitfall as far as some employees are concerned.  In my constituency, which is totally working class, I come across the problem where workers are tempted by the lump sum to accept redundancy.  I would not go so far as to say that they conspire at redundancy, but the temptation of the lump sum weakens their resistence to redundancy&mdash;indeed in some cases it increases the likelihood of redundancies.  I therefore repeat my request to the Minister to examine the situation to see if this temptation could be reduced but at the same time making genuine provision <Col N="1034" /> for people who become unavoidably redundant.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances I welcome the Bill in general.  I have criticised the added burden being placed on employers, this further addition to what in effect is a payroll tax.  I welcome very much the provision establishing workers' rights to reasonable time off to look for work or training during the two weeks redundancy notice period.  That is a good provision but I wonder if two weeks is long enough.  Are there problems in the way of extending it to four weeks or six weeks?  I do not see why people in those extraordinary circumstances cannot be given more than two weeks, although I regard the provision in general as being a good move. The Minister apparently anticipates problems with it, but with trial and error it can be improved.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision for increasing the membership of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  On the other hand, the Bill gives the tribunal extra work and I wonder if, even with the increased membership, they will be able to react quickly enough.  They will have to decide, for instance, whether an employee <i>bona fide</i> is seeking time off to look for alternative work.  The tribunal members might be needed to make themselves available throughout the night.  However, the provision is a good one and I hope the Department will appreciate the need for speedy examination of applications.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I am not satisfied that the weekly redundancy payments should have been abolished.  I accept that already, because of the £50 or 85 per cent limit, many workers might not in any case draw weekly payments. However, there are many who do and who would in the future if given the opportunity and I suggest that we should make some short-term provision to ease the blow of redundancy.  I agree that the abolition in general is not a bad thing but I suggest that arrangements should be available whereby the blow would be eased for a period of six or seven weeks.</P>
    <P>I shall refer briefly to section 6.  The Minister may reduce to 45 per cent the rebate paid to employers if two week's notice of redundancy has not been given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1035" /> I am wondering if this entire matter does not require closer examination.  The provisions of the previous Redundancy Act had been affected by the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Act dealing with minimum notice.  In the Ferenka situation the terms of the minimum notice legislation were not complied with and I am far from convinced that a sufficient penalty was imposed in that situation.  I wonder why we should pay any rebate in cases where employers do not abide by earlier legislation.  When there is failure to give two weeks' notice I suggest we should not give any rebate.  Why should an employer who breaks the law get away?  I do not think this Bill provides sufficient sanction to ensure that employers will abide by the law in this respect.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in several parts of the Bill to give the Minister power to make regulations.  These regulations would be brought before the House and would be subject to annulment by the House within 21 days.  I am opposing that sort of provision.  Recently we had here the unsavoury experience whereby the annulment motions on food subsidies were not allowed to be discussed although the Opposition had requested a debate on the matter.  It is not good enough that motions are debated only when it suits the Government to have them debated. Before any regulation of the kind envisaged in this Bill would come into operation I would seek a positive vote of the House, because that is the only way to uphold the rights of Parliament.  Unfortunately, Parliament is being subverted by tactics which are within the bounds of order.  In regard to this Bill I shall be opposing each section which allows for a negative vote if such is sought.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill takes into account the reduction in the old age pension qualifying age from 70 to 66 and it is proposed that the provisions for those who are 66 are precisely the same as the provisions currently applicable to those who are 70.  In other words, if one becomes redundant at 69 one qualifies for a lump sum payment but if one is 70 one will not get any such payment.  That is an unfair provision.  Any such sharp chopping off must be unfair and unjust. <Col N="1036" /> Therefore, I suggest that the Minister consider some method whereby there would be a phasing out so that at, say, 66 a person would qualify for three-quarters of the payments and at 67 for 50 per cent.  I am merely using those figures to illustrate what I have in mind, but such a system would be more tolerable and just.  It seems very wrong that a man who is perhaps 65 years and nine months qualifies for a redundancy lump sum payment but does not qualify for any payment if he is 66 years and a day.</P>
    <P>So far as I know there is not in the Bill any provision to amend the situation in the event of the old age pension qualifying age being reduced.  I note that the Government have not made any move in that regard, but hopefully they have not excluded the possibility of reducing the age to 65 or perhaps lower during the remainder of their term in office.  Such a move this year would have been a major contribution in the area of work-sharing proposals.  Perhaps the Minister would provide a positive approval by the Dáil for regulations to take account of any reduction in the old age pension qualifying age, thereby eliminating the need for further legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>I regret having to be sharply critical of the Minister but, unfortunately, he has not being doing his work.  It is difficult to understand a Minister for Labour introducing a Bill to deal with redundancy payments without referring to the problem of redundancy and without making some appeal to both employers and workers not to usè either this legislation or previous legislation unless it is absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>However, I welcome the general provisions of the Bill as far as it goes.  On Committee Stage I shall be proposing amendments on the lines I have indicated. There will be even more amendments from us, although not perhaps of as significant a nature as those I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill because it is legislation that is long overdue, but that is not to say that I am necessarily satisfied with every aspect of the Bill.  Although the Bill is extensive it seems to lack any indication of concern for unfortunate workers who are displaced <Col N="1037" /> from their jobs.  I welcome the efforts of those in authority who are emphasising the need for job creation and for programmes in this respect.  We are living in difficult times.  We have a serious problem in respect of employment for our young people.  I accept that there must be a substantial national investment to ensure that we build a society which will meet the needs not only of today's young people but of generations to come.  In these days of tremendous challenge we must do everything possible to give all our people a stake in this country.  It may be necessary sometimes to be over ambitious in talking of job targets and so on, but although there are times when the projected figures seem unattainable we must aim at the highest figures possible.</P>
      <P>We must not overlook the fact that our industrial revolution brings in its wake the scourge of redundancy.  Job losses are estimated at about 13,000 per year.  It is not my intention to become involved in arguments about how many jobs have been created or how many have been lost: so many different figures have been put before us that it would be impossible to follow the trend.</P>
      <P>The matter that concerns me most&mdash;and it is one that should concern everybody in authority&mdash;is this: what is wrong with our traditional industries which have been based on national resources and which have been so viable for the past 40 years?  They are in serious difficulties at present.  Optimistic forecasts are not being given of their future prospects.  I agree with the previous speaker that there is need for an in-depth study of the sound, basic traditional industries that have been the foundation of our industrial wing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking of traditional industries I am concerned with the workers, many of whom I know.  There are men of 50 years of age who started work as young apprentices and who now find that, after 30 years' service, neither they nor the industry know where they are going.  Unfortunately this is an age bracket which is most seriously hit in redundancies and it is difficult to retrain such people or resettle them in other employment.  What <Col N="1038" /> have our traditional industries been replaced by?  I appreciate the efforts of the semi-State bodies involved to create employment but many jobs which have been created in the recent past will not last as long as the traditional ones.  I cannot over-emphasise the contributions that were made by these unfortunate men who find themselves in a position where their concern for their families and their future is being met by a redundancy payments Bill.  That is not showing sufficient concern.  These people accepted the challenge of industrialising our country in our early years.  They contributed in a big way, at times with very inadequate and poor machinery, to the creation of the industrial wing of our economy.  They accomplished this through dedication, efficiency and a nationalism of a standard that we can be proud of.  Unfortunately, the story does not end on a happy note for these people.</P>
    <P>The sections of this Bill are poor consolation for a man who, after 30 years' service, is told: &ldquo;We may have work for you in six months' time&rdquo;.  I have heard many stories from these people.  Some have been told:  &ldquo;We do not need you any more.  We have this wonderful new machine&rdquo;.  It is a question of more profits, less hands.  Others have been told:  &ldquo;We are sorry we have not got a job for you.  You are entitled to some redundancy.  We cannot compete with Taiwan or Hong Kong&rdquo;.  The most amazing story of all, which got tremendous national publicity, was that of the Gorey leather workers who were told by management:  &ldquo;We are sorry but we want to close down&rdquo;.  How can workers appreciate what we are trying to do for them through this kind of legislation when there is that type of management in control of industry?  That is why I ask what has gone wrong with our traditional industries.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for the redundancy cancer we are suffering from at present.  Each year new industries brought in by the IDA are replacing the older types.  I hope the replacing industries will give the same service to the workers and to the people as the traditional ones which, through our entry into the EEC and free trade, have <Col N="1039" /> gone to the wall.  There is more to this Bill than payments.  There is more to this problem than talking about conditions, contributions and so on.  We are talking about men and women who are being told that they are not wanted any more. It is a very human and sorrowful picture to be depicting: it is about people and not subsections.  I am concerned for these people and, like the previous speaker, I have my doubts about many of the new types of jobs.  We are facing the eighties with a colosal youth population and what is done now must be done right.</P>
    <P>These redundant workers have given the best part of their lives to a particular industry and, because of their age, a closure means the end of the road for work for them.  This Bill is not doing enough for these people, who through no fault of their own and despite dedicated and long years of service, have lost their permanency in the work force.  The Government and industry have a definite responsibility in this.  Every effort must be made to cushion them.  When a person reaches the age of 50 he is at a very difficult time in life.  No matter how responsible a person is, many industries consider him too old at 50 years of age. To be considered old at 50 years of age is a condemnation of the system and of the industrial progress which is alleged to have been made throughout the world.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the introduction of this legislation, I am concerned that the Minister has not used the opportunity to amend other provisions of the redundancy payments scheme.  He should have broadened the scope of the legislation. In the Bill it is proposed to reduce from 21 to 20 the number of hours to be normally worked in a week to qualify for redundancy payments.  The 21 hours should be reduced to 16 hours per week. For redundancy purposes this would cover people such as cleaners in vocational schools, bus drivers and many short-term workers.  Under this legislation, to qualify for redundancy payments a worker must be employed by the same employer for a period of 104 weeks.  This period should be reduced to 52 weeks.  This would allow <Col N="1040" /> for greater mobility of workers and would cover a large number of workers in the clothing, footwear and construction industries.</P>
    <P>My views on this issue are supported by the ESRI Report on Redundancy and Re-employment in Ireland published in September 1977.  One of the major reforms proposed in that report is that thought should be given to providing some protection for workers whose occupations are characterised by very intermittent employment and who, although they experience frequent spells of unemployment, may never qualify for redundancy payments.  It has long been recognised that workers have what are known as property rights arising from their jobs.  If a worker loses these property rights, he is entitled to adequate compensation from his employer.  A worker is entitled to a redundancy lump sum payable by his employer and I recognise that the Bill increases the lump sum payable.</P>
    <P>The earnings ceiling of £5,000 per annum for calculation of the lump sum and for payment of contribution is far too low.  The figure of £5,000 is little more than the average male industrial earnings.  I suppose the Minister will tell us it is remarkable that the ceiling of £5,000 is the same as the figure for the social welfare pay-related contributions and health services.  That does not mean I accept that figure either as introduced by the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  It is still too low.</P>
    <P>The method of calculation of lump sum payments should have been improved to bring our legislation into line with the redundancy payments scheme in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  While I welcome the Bill, I will be putting down a number of important amendments on Committee Stage.  I hope the Minister will consider them constructively so that we can produce the best possible redundancy payments scheme for all workers.  I will have more to say on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Bill I appreciate, as other Members of the House must, that it is introduced after almost 12 years' experience of the existing scheme.  It is very important to underline <Col N="1041" /> some comments made by other speakers about the terrible trauma of long time employees who suddenly find themselves redundant either because of competition from other countries or because of rationalisation which can cause unfortunate closures.  It is our duty and our obligation to cushion workers as best we can by increasing the various sums payable and by extending the time limits during which payments can be applied for.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>If the worker is unemployed a weekly payment may be paid at the employment exchange.  Workers' entitlements are calculated by reference to age, service and pay.  The independent Employment Appeals Tribunal determines issues of entitlement.</P>
      <P>Many employees who find themselves redundant need not necessarily be close to retirement age.  On reaching the age of 40 years and becoming redundant a man may find how difficult it is to become re-employed. This is where the placement agencies can play a most important part in ensuring that men are redundant for as short a time as possible.</P>
      <P>The House must agree that there has been a tremendous improvement in workers' conditions since this principle was first introduced in 1967.  This has been most beneficial when one considers the serious recession we went through during the oil crisis.  Many people lost their jobs when high unemployment followed high inflation in the 1973, 1974 and 1975 period.  We know the hardships suffered by men in what appeared to be secure employment who found themselves unemployed.  The Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, has stood up very well to the test of time. With the experience of the past few years to go on, one must compliment the Minister on the speed at which he is bringing in this new Bill to cover the anomalies in the original Act.  It is a very fine Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said redundancy weekly payments are normally subject to the rule whereby aggregate weekly amount does not exceed 85 per cent of pre-unemployment <Col N="1042" /> average net weekly earnings or £50, whichever is the least.  He said:</P>
    <P>This 85 per cent rule has meant that since its introduction in 1976 redundancy weekly payments have been curtailed in many instances.  In fact, there are cases where redundant workers have ceased to become entitled to any weekly payments.</P>
    <P>This Bill seeks to take care of these problems.  The weekly payments system and the worker's contribution are to be discontinued.  That is to be welcomed. The trade unions will welcome the dropping of the weekly payment, or the worker's contribution as it is known. The fact that the redundancy payments fund will be financed from the employer's contribution is welcomed as is the making of the employer's redundancy contribution pay-related.  Putting them under one heading is a sensible arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider the case of the self-employed who do not qualify for redundancy payments.  They should be catered for by being allowed to pay for stamps on a voluntary basis.  Many owners of small businesses are struggling to pay their way on low incomes.  If the business of a self-employed barber or hairdresser collapses owing to ill-health he cannot claim redundancy.  Although we do not consider ourselves self-employed we are another example of that category.  If TD's lose their seats after a certain number of years they may have difficulty surviving on their pensions. We should also introduce a scheme for the retraining of the self-employed who have had to close their business.</P>
    <P>The ceiling for calculating lump-sum payments is at present £2,500.  The Minister proposes to double this figure. This figure should be linked with the cost-of-living index in order to make allowance for inflation.  The Minister should also be allowed to increase this figure from time to time.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the rebate system is complex.  Employers should be encouraged to retain employees under notice for as long as possible.  I see that there is an adequate bonus of 2½ per cent <Col N="1043" /> of the rebate for each week of extra notice up to a maximum of eight weeks. I can understand that the scheme has to be limited because of the possibility of abuses.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the function of the National Manpower Service has been noticeable since the Minister came into office.  We should not spare our efforts in trying to ensure that we have an efficient placement service.  The new temporary hire service which was referred to in the White Paper is also very important.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that employers will be encouraged to give workers under notice of redundancy reasonable time off to look for alternative work.  It is also fair that employers are safeguarded from abuses by employees.  I am glad that the membership of the Employment Appeals Tribunal is being increased.  It is unfortunate that they have such a backlog of cases.  The Minister has decided to increase the number of vice-chairmen by three to five and to increase the number of ordinary members by six to 30.  I hope, if he finds that the workload is not being catered for, that he will increase the numbers or perhaps in some way have temporary appointments made to the Employment Appeals Tribunal pending the hearing of the present backlog.</P>
    <P>I shall not take up any more time as I think Deputy O'Keeffe is anxious to speak and I have more or less made the points I wish to make.  I am delighted with this legislation and I should like to commend the Minister and his officials for the vast improvements in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief on this Bill which deals with how workers should be treated when they find themselves redundant.  In a general sense I wonder whether we are devoting enough thought to preventing redundancies. Our effort at industrialisation is succeeding over a number of years to a large extent because of the very good work of the IDA but on the other hand we have the difficulty that a certain number of the jobs created are offset to a very large extent by the number of redundancies.  From that point of view <Col N="1044" /> fresh thought is necessary as to how to approach the question of preventing job losses.  This is something relevant to this Bill.  There is agreement on all sides of the House that in the unfortunate circumstances that might arise where a worker finds himself redundant he must be treated properly and given adequate sums to keep him going until such time as he finds alternative employment.  At the same time we must look at the situation in regard to the frightening level of redundancies we have had in recent years.  I suppose there are many factors behind this.  Certainly, our entry into the EEC contributed to some extent to redundancy in certain vulnerable industries. I believe that if we can create the same dynamic in the area of preventing job losses as we have as a result of the IDA efforts in job creation we shall have introduced a further dimension to the solution of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that there are agencies which do their best in this area.  We have Fóir Teoranta which tries to help our companies running into difficulties.  I think we are not doing enough.  The cost of creating a new job as calculated by the IDA is so high that I wonder if we are devoting sufficient time, money and energy to protecting the jobs already there.  Whether this should be resolved by establishing a new agency or whether perhaps an arm of the IDA should be involved here I am not sure, but I believe new thinking is needed in this area.  I understand that the number of redundancies last year was of the order of 13,000. When we consider that colossal figure we must come to examine whether any of those redundancies could have been prevented with the idea of establishing a situation in the future in which the rate of redundancy would be kept to the lowest possible level.  Accordingly, while welcoming the Bill and appreciating that every effort must be made to look after the worker who is redundant I urge the Minister to devote time and energy and the time and energy of his officials to concentrating on that problem.  If we can reduce the number of redundancies significantly I believe we shall have come a long way towards solving the unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who for so long has been trying to read different things into different debates and of course it is an indication also of the lack of work and effort that the same Deputy puts into the preparation of any of the speeches he produces here&mdash;that the figure was given by me in reply to a Parliamentary Question recently.  I repeat that the figure for 1978 was 9,867, the first time since 1973 that the number of redundancies has been under 10,000 in one year and it is 3,000 better than in 1977.  This discredits much of what Deputy Mitchell said at the outset regarding redundancies going on unabated. Having said that the figure is down to under 10,000, I accept entirely that there must be no complacency and that we cannot be happy with that figure.  We must strive and spare no effort to ensure that it is further reduced. That must be our aim.</P>
      <P>Still referring to Deputy Mitchell's opening comments, the speech that I delivered was a factual account of the changes being introduced in the redundancy structure as a result of the experience of the operation of the scheme over a decade or more and, as well, the introduction of pay-related social welfare from April next.  Understandably then, that pay-related aspect of redundancy would apply in addition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the general acceptance of the Bill.  I emphasise again that the figure for the qualified redundancies notified for 1978 cannot be challenged and can be substantiated.  Deputy Mitchell suggested that we should use the fund to save jobs.  The emphasis on job saving rests, and should rest, with other State agencies&mdash;for example, Fóir Teoranta and the IDA.  The redundancy fund is <Col N="1048" /> specifically and specially for the unlucky worker's benefit.  The number of redundancies has been reduced and the aim should be to reduce it further.  We must cushion the redundant worker against unemployment, particularly the aged or advanced worker to whom Deputy Ryan referred.  There is a trauma, a disappointment, a change of lifestyle in that person's life.  When redundancy looms and then becomes a reality certain hardships are created and so this cushioning is necessary.  Obviously, this is primarily the purpose of the redundancy fund.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Government's commitment to job saving through agencies such as Fóir Teoranta and the IDA, in the budget last year and again this year extra money has been provided for the employment maintenance scheme in the clothing, footwear and textile sector in order to help alleviate hardship in that type of vulnerable industry.  These are obvious ways, and obviously they are reflected in the redundancy payments figures for 1978 which I have just given to the House.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their research into the Bill and their study of it.  I also look forward to further discussion on Committee Stage of some of the points mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the two weeks' notice.  He was complimentary about the decision to allow reasonable time off but he asked if that could be extended. The difficulty here would be that the two weeks now allowed in the redundancy payments scheme have to be directly related to reasonable time off for seeking employment.  As the Deputy is aware, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act requires notice for periods of longer than two weeks.  To extend the time available for seeking work beyond that two weeks would be unreal and not easy to operate because it is tied up with the Redundancy Payments Bill.</P>
    <P>Redundancy was viewed from many angles.  In my opening statement I suggested that the scheme was introduced in 1967 for many reasons, some then existing and some anticipated.  Of course, it must always be our aim to avoid redundancies to the greatest possible degree. However, for various reasons at different <Col N="1049" /> times redundancy becomes a reality, and the 1967 Act was a recognition of that.  The changes and improvements suggested now are designed to assist further the worker who becomes redundant.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell referred to the employers' contribution as a tax on the payroll.  I do not agree.  An employer has duties to his employees and they include a contribution to a redundancy fund to be used in the event of redundancy occurring. Hopefully, it will never happen. However, it is important that an employer should contribute to the redundancy fund because of the danger of redundancy facing workers in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell suggested that there could be a phased reduction in the contribution in order to give an employment incentive.  We are talking about the 0.5 per cent contribution, which is a small portion of the overall contribution between employer and employee.  To reduce it would have little or no effect.  I have already mentioned the employment maintenance scheme as being far more positive.</P>
    <P>Another Deputy said that we had better jobs in the past.  I do not know what was intended by that comment.  But it is important to compliment, as Deputy O'Keeffe did today, the IDA, who are doing a tremendous job in creating new posts here.  It is the duty of the Government and the community to fulfil the expectancy of young people and to create as many jobs as possible to help these young people through work experience&mdash;in other words, to give them an opportunity of advancing towards full employment.  There is a growing pattern of movement of manpower.  Understandably, we will always have a certain amount of movement in this area.  If it leads to redundancies, we can only hope that they will continue to fall in number.</P>
    <P>The removal of the weekly payment was referred to.  It appears that this will be an improvement for all employees. There were restrictions on the existing weekly payments combined with lump sums.  Quite a sizeable percentage of redundant people qualified for no weekly payment, a still bigger percentage qualified for a reduced weekly payment, and only a small number qualified for <Col N="1050" /> the full weekly payment.  That could be seen to be discriminatory in itself.  It was accepted and welcomed by both sides of industry generally that that change should take place.  I am satisfied that the recipients under the new arrangements will do better from 6 April next.</P>
    <P>The point was made that employers should not get a rebate if they do not give the two weeks' notice.  It would be fairer, and our experience in the Protection of Employment Act, for example, has been that undesirable though the notices are, employers appear to be complying with the terms of that.  I have little reason to believe that they would not now comply with the two weeks' minimum notice under this Bill, particularly when there is a situation where minimum notice and terms of employment cover the notice period at any rate. It would obviously be in unusual circumstances that an employer would not comply and the exception in that case would not necessitate any major change in this.</P>
    <P>It is provided that the upper age for redundancy entitlement will now automatically correspond to the old age pension age.  As well, the present arrangements will entitle a 66-year old person to avail of payments up to 1980 rather than 1979 in order to be fair to people as a result of transitional changeover there.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the danger of giving powers to the Minister.  I must emphasise the need for flexibility to run the fund effectively, because the level of the fund income depends on the level of contributions, the level of redundancies and the level of lump sums paid.  As Deputies are aware, the size of lump sums depends on a number of factors. To manage the fund effectively I need the powers to influence the level of the money in the fund quickly so that when I act the fund responds.  It would be undesirable for the fund to have to borrow from the Exchequer as it had to in the past.  It should be self-supporting.  I hope that Deputies will agree to the enabling provision proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is not accurate to say that redundancies are continuing unabated.  I fully appreciate and support Deputy Ryan's point that the older age groups suffer the <Col N="1051" /> greatest trauma in a redundancy situation and their placement can be more difficult than the placement of the younger age groups.  However, the scheme is weighted in favour of the older age group by a more favourable calculation of the lump sum.  I assure the House that I will keep this aspect of the redundancy payments scheme under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you. Deputy Ryan also referred to the fact that the wage ceiling for the lump sum calculations should be higher than the £5,000 and that the basis for calculation should be higher.  The raising of the ceiling will mean a very substantial increase in lump sum entitlements.  As to the basis, after a year's experience I propose to examine this revised scheme.  This is a sensible approach because at the end of a year's experience we can see what effect the lump sum payable calculated according to the scheme will have, the position of redundancies and redundancy levels and the effect of our contribution to meet the needs.  All these things can be looked at more closely after a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan made other points in relation to the reduction in hours.  When a worker qualifies for redundancy payments he must do so in relation to the employment that is his main source of income.  Therefore, at present it would be a little unrealistic to reduce the minimum hours to below 20.  Having examined this situation I believe that 20 is the most desirable figure.  Deputy Ryan also referred to the qualifying period and suggested one year to qualify rather than two.  Having weighed the situation and listened to the points made I am convinced that two is reasonable.  While I do not believe in arguing UK legislation as the best to follow, just for the sake of it, two years is the qualifying period there.  I have already doubled the ceiling from £2,500 and that is a major step forward. I indicated that I would review the calculation of the lump sum after one <Col N="1052" /> year's experience of the scheme.  Of course job losses must be kept to a minimum, but the measure we are dealing with today only changes the present redundancy payment scheme by making certain provisions and worth-while improvements in respect of workers who become redundant.  Deputy Briscoe raised an interesting point in relation to the self-employed.  I am not quite sure how the self-employed person would qualify for redundancy payments by making himself redundant.  However, a self-employed person is entitled to qualify for training under the AnCO schemes.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the procedure for consideration by the Dáil of the Estimates for the Public <Col N="1053" /> Services ought to be improved and directs the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1) Report to the Dáil within six months with its recommendations for additions or amendments to the Standing Orders which would be required to achieve the following objectives:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Presentation to the Dáil and circulation to members of the ordinary yearly Estimates for the Public Services not less than one hundred and eighty-four days prior to the consideration of the yearly resolutions imposing taxation and not later than the last day of the eighth month of the preceding financial year.</P>
    <P>(b) Appointment of one or more Select Committees to be designated &ldquo;Estimates Committee(s)&rdquo; as soon as may be after the presentation and circulation of the Estimates in accordance with sub-paragraph (a), to examine the Estimates, to recommend any amendments to the Estimates, (including both reductions and increases in provisions under particular subheads) that may be deemed necessary and to report to the Dáil not later than thirty days prior to the commencement of the financial year involved; provided that an Estimates Committee shall:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) Consist of not less than six and not more than twelve members, none of whom shall be a member of the Government or a Minister of State: and four members or one half of the membership, whichever is the lesser, shall constitute a quorum;</P>
    <P>(ii) Be otherwise constituted according to the provisions of Standing Orders 66 and 69 so as to be impartially representative of the Dáil;</P>
    <P>(c) Mandatory consideration by the Dáil of that portion of the report of an Estimates Committee which relates to a particular Estimate at <Col N="1054" /> the same time as the Estimate in question; and</P>
    <P>(d) Grant of permission for any member to move in the Dáil after notice:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) An Amendment to a motion for a grant of money proposed for the Public Service imposing preconditions to the expenditure of the money, and</P>
    <P>(ii) A motion reducing an Estimate in respect of any particular item; and</P>
    <P>(2) Make any other recommendation it thinks fit for the improvement of the present procedure for consideration of the Estimates for Public Services by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>One of the bases for the development of parliamentary democracy in these islands has been the principle of no taxation without representation and in the original development of Parliament one never agreed to any spending without agreeing at the same time to the taxation proposals to pay for it.  Unfortunately in the course of time the control of Parliament or the Dáil over money being spent has reduced considerably; it has reduced to a very great extent even since the foundation of this State.  I propose to illustrate that in the course of my contribution.  It was in order to reassert the control of this House over the spending of large sums of public money that this motion was put down in the name of four Fine Gael Deputies.</P>
    <P>I wish to illustrate the seriousness of this position and the lack of proper control and lack of consideration of Estimates for public spending.  I will do this by reference to some figures.  Last year the Dáil approved the spending of approximately £2,500 million.  The spending of £600 million was never discussed because it was part of the Capital Budget and by tradition the Capital Budget is not discussed in this House. That disposed of the £600 million and there was not a conscious decision of the House to approve or disapprove of that programme.</P>
    <P>Of the remainder, £550 million was passed on 27 June 1978 without any discussion <Col N="1055" /> on that date.  The time had elapsed wherein the Dáil could consider the matter and if the expenditure of this sum had not been approved on that day the Government would have ground to a halt because the money would not have been available.  The expenditure of £550 million was approved without any discussion of the merits or demerits of the way in which the money was to be spent.</P>
    <P>On the same day a further spending of £806 million, on top of the £600 million and the £550 million, was approved in limited-time debates.  Some of these debates were shorter than one hour and there were very brief speeches from all sides of the House because of the lack of time.  We can see, therefore, that much more than half and perhaps two-thirds of the total Government expenditure in 1978 was either not discussed at all or discussed only in a limited fashion by this House.  Yet in theory that money is spent only on the authority of this House and legal procedures relating to ensuring that money is not misspent refer back to the authority of this House.  Any investigation as to whether funds have been misappropriated is directed to finding out whether the spending was in conformity with the authority of this House.</P>
    <P>As I have illustrated, the authority of this House is given in a very cursory and unsatisfactory manner in debates of limited time&mdash;sometimes without any debate at all&mdash;and not in such a way that the authority which is cited so often could be said to be deliberate and well thought out.  Because of the slipshod procedures in relation to finance this House is not doing its job of properly scrutinising public spending.  We were sent here by an electorate who think we have some control over the way money is spent and believe they are electing people who will have such control.  In fact, our procedures are such that we do not have the control we should have because discussion is in the form I have been describing.</P>
    <P>The second point is that the money for a given year is not discussed at all until that year has already commenced. For instance, the Estimates for 1979 were not published until 30 January <Col N="1056" /> 1979.  Already one-twelfth of the money provided in those Estimates had been spent before the Estimates were published and none of them has yet been discussed.  Approximately two-thirds of the Estimates probably will not be discussed fully during 1979.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of democratic Parliaments Estimates for a given year are published in advance of the year to which they apply, and this means that if the Parliament in question discusses those Estimates it is doing so before the year commences.  If a valid point is made during the course of debate it can have some effect because it is not too late for the Government to listen to what has been said and decide to alter their spending programme in the light of the arguments put forward.  That is not possible here.  Even in the limited number of cases where debates take place on Estimates, they are of little or no value because the money is already committed. The year has already commenced and the Government machine is grinding on spending the money and it is far too late to change spending plans in the light of something said during the debate. Usually half the money has been spent by the time the debate takes place and the rest of it is probably committed. Contracts may have been entered into and if a debate takes place it is too late to have any effect at all in a policy sense.</P>
    <P>I believe that the lack of procedures in this House in relation to the consideration of these Estimates is, in fact, unconstitutional and that the House is not acting in conformity with the Constitution in its lack of procedures for the consideration of Estimates.  I wish to illustrate this by reference to Article 17.1 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>As soon as possible after the presentation to Dáil Éireann under Article 28 of this Constitution of the Estimates of receipts and the Estimates of expenditure of the State for any financial year, Dáil Éireann shall consider such estimates.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for 1978 were presented to this House on or about 30 January 1978.  As I have already pointed out, the vast majority were not considered by the House until 27 June 1978. <Col N="1057" /> In fact, far from being the soonest possible date on which the Estimates could have been considered, the date of 27 June was, in accordance with the provisions of the Central Fund Act, the latest possible date on which those Estimates could have been considered.  Under the Central Fund Act the Government may not spend more than four-fifths of the money concerned until the Dáil has approved of the Estimate.  On 27 June the Dáil was about to go into Recess until October of that year and if the Dáil had not approved of the Estimates in June the Government would have, perhaps, run out of money in relation to some of the Votes in September or so with the result that it would have had to grind to a halt.  The date, 27 June 1978, was not, as is required by the Constitution, the earliest possible date on which Estimates could be considered but the latest date. There is a substantial argument for saying that in adopting that procedure the House was not acting in conformity with the terms of Article 17.1 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the method adopted by the Dáil to deal with Estimates.  We are perhaps the most restrictive Legislature in allowing Private Members to put forward proposals in relation to Estimates.  Until 1974 it was possible for a Member to put down an amendment to an Estimate. He was allowed put down an amendment to reduce a provision for a particular amount.  That power was little used and the all-party Committee on procedure recommended that it be removed.</P>
    <P>The position now is that a Member may not put down any amendment to Estimates.  For example, a Minister introduces an Estimate for £100 million for the Department of Forestry and every Member listens to his speech.  All Members are entitled to speak once during that debate, after which the Minister will reply.  This format of debate does not allow any real dialogue to take place on individual spending heads.  All that may take place is a series of party political statements on the Estimate. Members may not introduce any amendment. The Dáil must either accept or reject the Estimate in total; they must accept <Col N="1058" /> every penny of the money proposed in the Estimate or reject the entire Estimate.  There is no possibility of any Member putting down an amendment asking the Minister to reduce the amount proposed to be spent, for example, on the planting of trees in order to increase the amount of money available for timber processing.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for a Member to seek an increase under any heading without any compensating reduction elsewhere nor is there power for him to reduce a particular sum.  In terms of restriction of Members' rights to amend Estimates we are, to my knowledge, one of the most restrictive Parliaments in the world.  I have read a document prepared by the Inter-Parliamentary Union on members' rights in budgetary matters throughout the world and this shows that in 27 of the 54 Parliaments surveyed members may put down amendments to reduce or increase expenditure. Those members have complete freedom to reduce or increase estimates.  In seven legislatures they may reduce but not increase expenditure, the position that existed here up to 1974.  In nine legislatures they may reduce expenditure but only increase it with the permission of the Government, and in eight legislatures they may reduce and increase expenditure if alternative provisions are made elsewhere.  In only three legislatures in the world may Members not move amendments in plenary sessions.  We are one of those three whose Members may not move any amendments to estimates.</P>
    <P>I argue that it is not sustainable to say the House is able to consider the Estimates if it does not have the power to amend them.  A consideration which is limited to accepting or rejecting is, in my view, not consideration in any real sense. I do not believe that we are complying with the intention of the drafters of our Constitution in respect of the provisions of Article 17 in that respect.  The procedures adopted here in relation to the consideration of Estimates of expenditure would not be acceptable to a county council.  In fact, we have less power over our Estimates of expenditure than a county council has over its expenditure and yet we hear a lot of complaints <Col N="1059" /> about the powerlessness of county councils.  In county councils at least members have an opportunity of putting forward amendments.  Estimates are presented to them before the year to which they apply begins and must be approved before that year begins.  If a member feels that too much is being spent, for instance, on housing and not enough on water supplies, it is not too late for the county manager to change the provision in relation to that matter. The year has not commenced and if the manager does not agree to a change the member has the power to move an amendment to the estimate.  If that amendment is carried the manager must do what he is told by a majority vote.</P>
    <P>That power does not exist here and Members do not have the power over budgetary matters in relation to Estimates that the European Parliament have over the European budget.  We have heard a lot about the powerlessness of the European Parliament but as far as the budget is concerned they have more power over their budget than we have over ours.  I do not believe that that is a satisfactory position.  It is a position that has accumulated over the years during the tenure of office of successive Governments; it is not a matter that any one party can be blamed for but it is one that all parties should seek to change.</P>
    <P>Before explaining the reasons for the individual terms in our motion I should like to note that the Government have submitted an amendment to the motion which, while not doing all the things we would like it to have done&mdash;it does not give the specific directions as to the improvements the House would like to see in Estimates that the original motion submitted by our party does&mdash;goes a considerable way on the road with us in recognising the need for reform of present procedures.  I should like to welcome the Government amendment.  It meets the case in a substantial manner but I reserve my final position on that amendment until I hear the contribution of the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Our motion is looking for the matter to be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the body which has responsibility for procedure <Col N="1060" /> and privileges in this House.  It is not seeking to make a direct change in Standing Orders but is referring it to a specialist body to come back with specific changes and giving them precise terms of reference.</P>
    <P>We are looking for a report from the Committee on Procedure and Privileges within six months.  The Government amendment sets no time limit and this is regrettable.  It would be better if the committee were given a definite term to come back with their report because if a specific term is not set the matter could drag on for years and we would never get a report.  I would have preferred the Government amendment to have included a time limit.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1)(a) of our motion asks that the Estimates be circulated, not as is the case at present 30 days after the year to which they apply has already begun, but 184 days prior to the beginning of the year&mdash;in other words, we would be looking for the Estimates for 1980 to be circulated in September 1979.  This is in line with the procedure in most Parliaments. For instance, in Holland the Estimates for 1979 were presented to the Dutch Parliament in September 1978. The first stage of the discussion in the Parliament was a general discussion on the Government's policy that underlay the various Estimates.  During September, October and November there were specialist discussions in committees of the individual Estimates&mdash;the Agriculture Committee discussed the Agriculture Estimate, the Environment Committee discussed the Environment Estimate and so on.  The proposals were teased out in great detail by individual members who, over the years, had accumulated considerable expertise in their own fields.  The report was sent back to the Dutch Parliament in December and the final budget was adopted in December, before the year to which it applied had begun.  The whole process was gone through before the year in question had begun.</P>
    <P>If it is possible for the Dutch to do that it should be possible for us to present our Estimates three months in advance of the year to which they apply.  It may be argued that this is the case only in continental countries and that only <Col N="1061" /> people with a continental legislative tradition were able to do this, but this is not so.  It is also the case in Canada which has the same parliamentary tradition as we have.  Their Estimates are presented to the Canadian Parliament three months before the year to which they apply has commenced.</P>
    <P>It is possible under the terms of our Central Fund Act for Estimates to be presented in advance of the year to which they apply.  There is no change required in the law for Estimates to be presented in the House in September of the preceding year rather than in late January of the year in question.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1) (b) of our motion seeks to set up select committees called &ldquo;Estimates Committees&rdquo; which, as soon as may be after the presentation and circulation of the Estimates, would examine the Estimates, recommend any amendments to the Estimates, including both reductions and increases in provisions under particular subheads, that may be deemed necessary and to report to the Dáil not later than 30 days prior to the commencement of the financial year involved.  Having received the Estimates in September, the Estimates Committee would have to report back to the House by the end of November and in December a plenary debate on the Estimates could take place in the House and they would be finally adopted before the year in question had begun.</P>
    <P>The House will note that it is proposed that the Estimates Committee could make recommendations both as to reductions and increases in particular subheads.  They would only be recommendations. It should be pointed out that it is impossible under our Constitution for Members to move amendments to increase provisions under particular subheads.  To give Members that power, which is enjoyed by more than half the Parliaments in other countries, would require an amendment to our Constitution. As I said, they would only be recommendations and could not take place other than on a motion of a member of the Government in plenary session. However, it is possible under our Constitution for Private Members in plenary session to move amendments either to reduce an Estimate in respect of a particular <Col N="1062" /> item or to impose a precondition as to the expenditure of the money.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (1) (d) of our motion proposes that Standing Orders be altered to allow Members to insert amendments to Estimates, either to impose preconditions to the expenditure of money or to reduce them.  Our motion seeks to give the Committee on Procedure and Privileges freedom to make any other recommendations they think fit for the improvement of financial procedures.</P>
    <P>My last point refers to the format of the Estimates documents themselves. They are not as informative as they should be.  The documents presented to the House merely tell us what was spent on a particular subhead last year and what it is proposed to spend this year. We all know that Government financial plans and spending do not relate to one year only.  If the Government start a particular scheme during 1979 it may extend many years after.  If it is started half way through the year, the amount spent during 1979, and therefore the amount appearing in the Estimates for 1979, may be only half the amount which would be spent in a full year.  I believe the budget documents should be amended to give us not only what was spent last year but what it is proposed to spend this year and what will be spent in subsequent years if the Government's plans are continued.  This way we will be able to see more than one year ahead the implications of the proposals we are being asked to agree to in any given year.</P>
    <P>Changes could be made in the format of the Estimates to incorporate the notion of programme budgeting, which gives people reading the budget better information as to the precise purpose of the expenditure in question.  At the moment we are presented with a bald subhead&mdash;subhead A.1,  Salaries and Wages, so many thousand pounds&mdash;and no idea is given how that money will be spent.  In agreeing to a sum for a particular subhead the House does not know very much from reading the Estimates Volume what it is agreeing to or why.  It would be useful if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, in addition to agreeing to the matters I have already outlined, were to consider the format of the Estimates documents. <Col N="1063" /> If that were done the discussion in this House would be a great deal more useful.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;is of the opinion that the procedure for consideration by the Dáil of the Estimates for the Public Services ought to be reviewed and directs the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consider and make recommendations within six months about such improvements, if any, which it considers desirable&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the only change.  I have been listening to Deputy Bruton's remarks and I fully appreciate his views on this very important matter.  I have considerable sympathy with the view that the time which the Dáil devotes to debating the annual Estimates is not enough.  The percentage of Dáil time devoted to consideration of the Estimates dropped from 36.9 per cent in 1973 to 3.2 per cent in 1977.  I understand that there was a considerable improvement <Col N="1064" /> in 1978.  By any criterion this is evidence of a serious decline in the surveillance of public spending by the Legislature.  Even when account is taken of all the opportunities available to Members of the Dáil to raise public expenditure matters at Question Time in the House or to debating more general public expenditure issues during the passage of financial legislation the total amount of time spent on the examination of public spending by the Dáil is inadequate. This stands out even more clearly when one considers the high and rising level of Government expenditure.  This year, for instance, over £2 billion will be spent on current provision for Public Services alone.</P>
      <P>This far, therefore, I can agree with Deputy Bruton, and indeed with the other Members of the Dáil who have voiced their concern in recent years about the situation.  However, what I cannot agree with is the automatic assumption that the only way to improve matters is to bring the Estimates forward by about six months and to establish an Estimates Committee.  Examination of public spending by the Legislature should be efficient in terms of the demands it makes on parliamentary time and in terms of the burden it places on the administration. There is no <i>Prima facie</i> certainty that the arrangements proposed in the motion would satisfy these conditions. The terms of the motion preclude consideration of other alternative ways of strengthening the functioning of the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as consideration of the annual Estimates is concerned the Report of the Informal Committee on Dáil Procedures in 1972&mdash;which considered the option of an Estimates Committee, but rejected it&mdash;suggests that there may be viable options for strengthening Dáil surveillance of public expenditure other than setting up an Estimates Committee.  The informal committee argued that the best use possible should be made of Dáil time devoted to consideration of the Estimates and, to achieve this, recommended that a time limit be placed on the length of speeches in debates on the Estimates.  That is something that must be considered by the House, that there <Col N="1065" /> may be various other options to be considered. I am sure Deputy Bruton will agree with me on that point.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise, of course, that I have an open mind on the appropriate way to reform procedure. But rather than pre-judge the whole question from the beginning&mdash;as Deputy Bruton's motion seems to do&mdash;I should like to see the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examine the whole question of Dáil control of public expenditure and come up with recommendations which would reflect Irish conditions and be workable.  That is another very important point.  There is very little use in setting up committees unless we are convinced that they are workable.</P>
    <P>The scrutiny of public expenditure is one of the most important functions of Parliaments in democratic countries. Some idea of the different ways open to Parliaments to ensure adequate control by the Legislature of public expenditure may be obtained from reviewing the practices of our EEC partners.  For instance, in the United Kingdom, a public expenditure committee was set up some years ago as a means of enhancing Parliament's consideration of the Government's spending programme.  In the case of this committee the emphasis is away from close examination of the annual Estimates to a more wide-ranging scrutiny of the aims, priorities and efficiency of public expenditure generally. The committee can consider public expenditure programmes in the context of the Government's five-year projections, as set out in their latest annual White Paper.  With the assistance of expert advisers the committee provide a source of information and expertise in public expenditure matters for individual members of Parliament.  Interestingly enough&mdash;and this is extraordinary&mdash;there was an Estimates Committee already in existence in the House of Commons but it was found to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>In the Parliaments of our other EEC partners there is a well-developed committee system.  Broadly speaking these committees examine governments' annual public expenditure proposals.  These form part of the governments' budgets <Col N="1066" /> which are presented to Parliaments in the later part of the year preceding the new financial year.  The committees draw up reports on the basis of which the Parliaments debate the annual Estimates of expenditure.  These reports also identify the main issues in the budgets.  In this way they increase the information available to the Parliaments and ensure that Parliamentary time is used efficiently.  As a consequence of this, the level of debate is very high.</P>
    <P>In the case of continental countries, however, it must be borne in mind that institutional structures and budgetary procedures differ considerably from those in Ireland; for example, the annual taxation and expenditure proposals are considered in tandem in these Parliaments. In addition, there are usually statutory requirements or conventions which limit the amount of time these Parliaments and their committees may devote to examining the annual budgets and which effectively restrict Parliaments' powers to amend budgets in any major way.</P>
    <P>I think it will be apparent therefore that Deputy Bruton's motion seeks to import into Dáil practice a continental system of examining public expenditure. The motion ignores the fact that the conditions making procedures of this kind workable in continental countries, from a political and administrative point of view, are absent in the Irish context. Simply to bring consideration of the Estimates forward by about five or six months and to establish an Estimates Committee gives no guarantee that Dáil examination of the Estimates would be improved and, moreover, would be certain to cause some serious administrative difficulties.  For instance, bringing forward the Estimates would probably cause a greater number of Supplementary Estimates and the Dáil would be expected to examine these in the latter part of each year when it would also be engaged in examination of Estimates for the following year. Moreover, there would be serious difficulties encountered in the separation of the Government's annual public spending proposals in the Estimates and their taxation proposals in the budget. That is a point that must be given very <Col N="1067" /> serious consideration.  In order to get over these difficulties and make the system proposed by Deputy Bruton workable it would be necessary to make much more fundamental changes in the timetable of the Estimates, budgetary processes and in the related arrangements in the Dáil and administration.  Of their very nature such changes would need to be looked at much more carefully than Deputy Bruton's motion suggests.</P>
    <P>It is not even certain that the committee system approach is the one which answers the real needs of the Dáil.  I believe, for this reason, that a broad examination of the question by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is required. Another way to approach the problem would be to set aside a minimum number of days each year for consideration of the Estimates.  It is absolutely essential, whatever solution is arrived at, that it should be workable and effective and that it should reflect conditions in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>While the Committee system may appear attractive the general experience is that Committees are only as effective as the degree of time, ability and interest which their members, particularly their Chairman, are able to put into them.  We have a number of committees of the Dáil in existence already which make considerable demands on Members' time. The Dáil is a relatively small chamber and there may not be sufficient Members with the time and interest for effective participation in an Estimates committee system.  If Dáil procedure for consideration of the Estimates is to be changed the Government would prefer that the new procedure should be viable from the start.  A period of experimentation with its potentially disruptive effects would be undesirable given the critical importance of the Government's public expenditure measures at the present time as an instrument of macro-economic control. For all those reasons, therefore, the question of how to improve the way in which the Dáil considers the annual Estimates is something which should properly be referred to the Committee Procedure and Privileges for the full <Col N="1068" /> examination such an important matter requires.</P>
    <P>The Government are not opposed in principle to a review of the procedure for consideration by the Dáil of the Estimates for Public Services.  We cannot, however, accept the motion put down by Deputy Bruton and his colleagues as it seeks to pre-determine the outcome of such a review.  The Minister for Finance has tabled an amendment which would enable such a review to commence and I commend it to the House, now that I have amended the amending motion, because we also believe that there is a need to look at the whole structure of debates where Estimates are concerned.  For that reason, I strongly recommend to the House that they approve of the amendment which I have tabled.</P>

      <P>I believe this is the first occasion in the lifetime of this Dáil where there was absolute unanimity in Private Members' Time in relation to a motion, apart from the one we had on apartheid.  As Labour Party Whip I am delighted that we have been able to reach this unanimity.  As a Member of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges I certainly look forward to that Committee having an intensive discussion during the next three or four months and reporting to the Dáil within the stipulated period of six months.  I am very pleased that there is a time limit on our report because otherwise it might drift on through the summer.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Bruton and his colleagues for tabling this motion, because there is no doubt that in the past four or five years there has been a marked decline in the extent to which the House has debated Estimates.  The examination of tens of millions of pounds of the taxpayers' money has mostly been very cursory.  There has been very little real debate.  This is a very serious reflection on our parliamentary system as it has evolved.  It is not unfair to say that in Western Europe we are possibly the only Parliament that is devoting so little time to discussion on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> We have to separate a number of functions in relation to committees.  We have what is possibly the most prestigious committee of the House, the Committee of Public Accounts.  Accounting officers from the different Government Departments appear on a very regular basis before that committee but their appearance is very much <i>post facto.</i>  It is very much an historical examination of expenditure and aspects of expenditure thrown up by that committee, very often expenditure going back two, three, four or five years and examining anomalies within the accounting systems of Government Departments.</P>
    <P>We have never had in the Dáil a committee which would have a very sharp look at a cost benefit analysis of current Estimates.  If we had a committee in relation to two or three major Estimates for 1979 we now would be examining in depth the projected Estimates of expenditure for 1979 and we would be going through the Book of Estimates.  We have to carry the exercise a little further.  We have to have a situation where the politicians have access to the senior public officials in the various Government Departments so that we can sit across a table within the precincts of Leinster House and discuss with them aspects of the Estimates of their Departments for 1979.  The exercise might be very educational for the politicians.  It may be very difficult on occasions for public servants and Ministers may impose constraints on the degree of disclosure and the degree of policy analysis which public officials may be obliged to disclose during the course of such examinations. I submit that that exercise is desirable in the national interest.</P>
    <P>We have a Joint Committee on EEC Secondary Legislation and there was a great deal of perturbation when it was suggested by that joint committee that senior officials from different Government Departments should come before that committee and outline aspects of EEC directives as they affected their individual Departments.  There were certain constraints laid down by the Minister for the Public Service and the Minister for Finance in relation to the appearance of such officials before the Joint Committee on EEC Secondary <Col N="1070" /> Legislation but, in practice, it has been found that there has been no cause for conflict, no great cause for embarrassing public officials in relation to analysis of directives or regulations or draft directives even though at times they had impinged on policy aspects and where they have so impinged the public officer, quite rightly, has said, &ldquo;This is a policy matter. I cannot discuss a policy aspect.  I can discuss an aspect of administration, elaborate on information.  My function as a public servant ceases at that stage because it then becomes a political policy consideration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have no idea in the Dáil, more particularly those of us who have never had the privilege of serving in office in any shape or form, as to the mechanism, the models used in Departments.  We have never met the economists or accounting officers of different Government Departments.  Most Members of the Dáil never see them.  They are the financial managers dealing with the estimates behind allegedly closed doors in Government Departments.  As a result a great deal of frustration, a great deal of misinformation, a great deal of surmise tends to develop as to the role of such officers. If we had estimate committees in this House they would provide a singular opportunity for Members of the House to debate and examine and bring forward recommendations relating to the estimates in different Government Departments.  For that reason I am enormously pleased that Deputy Bruton and his colleagues have advocated this.  I remember advocating it strenously in a document which I produced on parliamentary reform in 1973 when we were in office.  I do not think there were shredders then but if there was a shredder available it would have been shredded within five minutes and, meeting some of my colleagues in Cabinet at the time, I was very nearly shredded in the process for having dared to suggest such a thing.</P>

      <P>The very idea of suggesting reform, particularly when one is in Government, was treated almost as <Col N="1071" /> an act of parliamentary treason but nevertheless we all mature; governments mature.  The Tánaiste has been singularly co-operative in relation to this proposition from the Opposition and his Minister of State has added a very necessary touch to the motion by putting a time limit on the Report of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This is heartening and necessary to us in opposition because the Government have a substantial majority on that committee but that will not prevent us from prodding along the proposal for parliamentary reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Needless to remark, if we are to have four or five major estimate committees operating within this House, we shall have to have expert staff available to the Members.  We are going to have a situation whereby 30 or 40 Members of the House, Government and Opposition will be involved.  Presumably the Government will have a majority on any estimates committee and I would hope that the Opposition would provide the chairman of such committees as this would be healthy in any estimates committee. Inevitably we will require extra staff.  I do not think it will be possible for Dáil Deputies to spend many weary and unnecessary hours discharging their public responsibility by sitting on such committee if, in the process, they have to dash out to spend many other hours meeting constituents, answering voluminous correspondence, attending party meetings and not having any secretarial help in order to discharge that type of responsibility.  Most Deputies would be only too anxious to participate in such estimate committees but at the level of secretarial assistance available to them at present I do not think they will be able to discharge that responsibility in an effective manner.  There is not much glory in being a member of a committee if one finds oneself with a lovely list of membership of the committee and no Dáil seat at the end of the session.  That is something which is always uppermost in the minds of most Deputies.  So I would hope that there would be a parallel development in the provision of money within the Vote for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  If we are to have that <Col N="1072" /> kind of estimate committee structure money will have to be provided to ensure that it is discharged in an effective manner.</P>
    <P>At this stage, since I have gone into what may well constitute aspects of the report on this matter, it would be best to leave these aspects to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges discussion and report on the situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome this substantial step forward in parliamentary reform.  I have deplored the fact that so little time has been devoted in recent years to the Estimates.  It is a disedifying and entirely frustrating exercise to come into this House at the end of the Estimate year and bang through, on the nod, millions of pounds like payout day at a racecourse, paying the punters rapidly when, in fact, one is nodding through millions of pounds.  This is not a proper way to discharge our parliamentary responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Lest it be in any way misunderstood, I say all this as a public representative coming from a political party which, by and large, is in favour of increasing public expenditure in the national interest. I am utterly opposed to any waste in the expending of taxpayers' money, but there are some people who believe that one should have estimates committees or committees of review of State-sponsored bodies or committees of examination of public expenditure with a view to slashing public expenditure.  That should not be the purpose of any such examination.  I believe in spending money on social services, on the creation of jobs, on health, on education, on creating a better society.  I believe in spending more public money on that and on maintaining and expanding our State-sponsored bodies.  But such moneys must be spent with every penny being accounted for and every penny being spent in the most profitable, cost-benefit conscious way for the benefit of the country.  On the agricultural side, where there has been a waste of public expenditure&mdash;and this has been pointed out in many a report&mdash;and also in other areas of economic and social development, I am quite convinced we would get far better value for the taxpayers' money if we had that kind of in-depth examination. <Col N="1073" /> In that context, believing that expenditure of money is very necessary in the national interest and believing that the taxpayer has to pay for it, in the long run if the taxpayer really wants to have the kind of society which we all aspire to, this is one way of bringing about a better society.  In the process we need the kind of estimates examination committee which has been advocated here by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to join the Labour Party in the welcome to the Minister's amendment. We can now get down to work in the near future.  There will be a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges next week and I hope that a subcommittee can be set up urgently and proceed to examine the situation. We will have the help of our research staff to bring forward a structure in relation to next year's Estimates and I hope that Deputies will be prepared to give their time in the discharge of their Parliamentary functions to participate in this essential aspect of parliamentary reform and control on behalf of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, I should like to say that I had been slightly reserved in my attitude to the Government's amendment, but having heard the Minister's speech I wholeheartedly welcome the Government's approach.  The Minister has been constructive by adding to his amendment a provision in relation to a time limit of six months.  We have done a good day's work this evening.  The setting up of terms of reference for this body is a step forward in parliamentary reform, perhaps the greatest step in the history of this Parliament since its foundation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will briefly refer to a few points made by the Minister.  He seemed to be somewhat reserved about the suggestion in the motion that the Estimates should be published before the year to which they apply has commenced.  He seemed to think this would create great difficulty. I seriously suggest that reforms would be of very little value unless the Estimates were published prior to the year in question and that they would be discussed at that time.  No matter how <Col N="1074" /> good the discussion would be in the House, if it were to occur when the year was half way through the debate would be of very little value because the Government could not change their spending plans at a time when two-thirds of the money would have been spent.  No matter how intelligent a debate then would be it would be of very little value because the money would have been spent.</P>
    <P>Therefore, an essential component of any reform must be bringing forward the publication of the Estimates to well before the commencement of the year in question, and this has been laid down. We would not be doing anything unusual if we were to publish the Estimates and approve them before the year commenced.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that dealing with the matter through committees might not be the best way, that there might be a better way.  He may have a point.  There is a feeling that already there are too many committees. Deputies may feel that going into a committee does not give them any publicity, that doing so is going into a political graveyard, that in the final analysis, if we are to get re-elected we must get publicity for the work we do in the House.  I agree that committees may not be the best answer to this problem.</P>
    <P>Our motion was not as restrictive as the Minister painted it.  Part (2) of the motion suggested that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be able to make any further recommendations they may think fit.  I am not a member of that committee and I will not have an opportunity of participating in the discussions on this issue.  Therefore I will avail of this opportunity to make suggestions about the way in which the work could be done.  The New Zealand Parliament have a procedure whereby in plenary session Members of the House may speak on Estimates for no more than five minutes but they may speak as many times as they like on an Estimate. Members are not allowed to speak for hours and hours, making boring contributions of the kind we are sometimes used to here.  The time is limited to five minutes, the Minister replies for five minutes, and the Member may speak again as well, of course, as other <Col N="1075" /> Members.  The Estimates can be taken in this way down through the subheads from subhead A, and any Member may speak again if not satisfied with the Minister's reply.  I suggest it would be worth the time of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to have a look at the New Zealand procedure in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>It was evident from the Minister's contribution that he had had the benefit of considerable Departmental expertise and I would hope that not only would the research services of the House be available to the Committee on <Col N="1076" /> Procedure and Privileges but also that the obviously considerable resources of information in the Department would be made available so that the committee can make the best possible recommendation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for his attitude. In a relatively short time we have done a good day's or indeed a good month's work.</P>

    <P>Apart from some minor receipts and grants which the council may agree to accept for specific purposes, An Chomhairle Ealaíon is financed by a grant-in-aid under Vote No. 5.  The council's accounts in relation to this are presented by me to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The council enjoys the degree of independence as to supervision and accountability normally enjoyed by the recipient of a grant-in-aid.  The Arts Acts do not make any specific provision <Col N="953" /> for borrowing powers for the council.  I appoint the council and an officer of my Department has been a member since 1973.  Section 8 (1) of the Arts Act, 1951, as amended provides that the council may appoint or engage such and (subject to my approval) so many officers and servants (in addition to the Director) as they think fit.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission are financed by a grant under section 8 of the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, which is paid out of subhead G of Vote 12, Office of the Attorney General.  The commission's accounts are required to be presented by the Minister for Finance to the Houses of the Oireachtas under section 9 of the Act.  There is no specific provision in the Law Reform Commission Act for borrowing powers for the commission.  The functions of the commission are the review of the law and, after due examination, research and consultation, the formulation of proposals for law reform.  The commission's programmes of law reform are submitted by me to the Government who may approve them with or without modification. The Attorney General may also request the commission to examine and formulate proposals for the reform of any branch of the law.  The members of the Law Reform Commission are appointed by the Government.</P>

      <P>The 1979 non-tax revenue estimate of £375 million includes an estimated £17 million in Post Office revenue in respect of 1978, the collection of which was delayed because of an industrial dispute. If the 1978 and 1979 figures were adjusted for this factor the increase in non-tax revenue in 1979 over 1978 would be 14.5 per cent.  Non-tax revenue is not subject to the same variations as tax revenue because the former includes a large amount of interest payments fixed at the times the loans were issued from the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The Meath County Council lodged with the Commissioners of Public Works on 16 November 1978 an application for a coast protection scheme at the areas mentioned.  A large number of applications from local authorities for coast protection works have been received.  A national priority list for coast protection works does not exist.  Because of the protracted investigations required for coast protection proposals, and the limited staff available, it is not possible to say at this stage when the application from Meath County Council will be reached to enable the preliminary engineering examination of the problem to be carried out.  Accordingly it is not possible to give any information as regards feasibility, cost, duration, or employment content of the necessary works or the financial contribution that would be expected from the Meath County Council towards the works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following statement.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Children's Allowances in the Public Service</i>
      </P>
      <P>1.  In the public service, schemes for the payment of children's allowances apply to (a) certain categories of civil service staff (see (2) below), (b) members of the teaching service and (c) members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>2.  Under existing arrangements (but see paragraph 6) the following staff are eligible for children's allowances:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Civil Service</i>
      </P>
      <P>(i)  Married (or widowed) male officers serving in the former marriage-differentiated grades (i.e. general service and allied departmental grades).</P>
      <P>(ii)  Widows reinstated in the service in an established capacity.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Teaching Service</i>
      </P>
      <P>(i)  Married (or widowed) male teachers.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Widowed female teachers.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Defence Forces</i>
      </P>
      <P>Married men (all ranks).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The current rate of children's allowances is £55 per child a year. The allowances <Col N="959" /> are payable in respect of dependent children under 16 years of age, or under 21 years of age in the case of invalid children or children in full-time education.  These rates and conditions apply in each area of the public service referred to above.</P>
    <P>4.  Children's allowance schemes in the public service do not have a common origin.  In the civil service, the scheme began in 1925, in conjunction with the introduction of a system of marriage-differentiated pay for general service and allied departmental grades.  The extension of the scheme to cover reinstated widows was agreed in 1961 under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the civil service.  The payment of children's allowances in the teaching service began in 1951-52, following the introduction of a marriage-differentiated pay system in that service.  In the Defence Forces, the principle of additional remuneration for married officers with dependent children has been a feature of the pay system since 1922, but the scheme of children's allowances in its present form, incorporating civil service rates and conditions for eligibility, dates from 1963.</P>
    <P>5.  The details requested at (c), (d) and (e) of the Question are given in the table attached.</P>
    <P>6.  It should be added that, following negotiations between the Department of the Public Service and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, proposals for the settlement of outstanding equal pay issues in the public service are currently being discussed under the appropriate public service conciliation and arbitration schemes.  These proposals provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that (a) women public servants will be entitled to receive children's allowances on the same basis as men with effect from 31 December 1975 and (b) children's allowances will be discontinued in the case of new appointees to the public service.  When these discussions have been finalised, the inclusion of an explanatory note on children's allowances in <i>Eolaire an Stáit</i> will be considered.</P>

      <P>A claim made on behalf of public health nurses in respect of week-end work has been the subject of an arbitration hearing. The findings of the arbitration board were rejected by some public health nurses and they have withdrawn their services at week-ends.</P>
      <P>Measures have been taken by executive officers of the health boards concerned to deal with the situation.  These measures vary from place to place to suit local requirements; they are of a temporary nature and are carried out by trained nurses.</P>
      <P>The following are particulars of the various rates being paid:</P>
      <P>(a)  Saturday&mdash;fixed payment of £1.15 plus £1.15 per call; Sunday&mdash;fixed payment of £2.30 plus £1.15 per call (these are the rates which obtained prior to the arbitration findings).</P>

      <P>The information sought is given in the attached table.  The grand total shows a reduction from the figure given in reply to the Deputy's question on 1 November 1978.  This is due to subsequent modification of the earlier figures received from the Southern Health Board.  These figures, of course, take no account of new cards issued and over the same period the total number of medical cards increased by just over 12,000.</P>

The questions as to the qualifications required for posts of engineer in the Electricity Supply Board and whether staff of my Department who applied for posts advertised in November 1978 by the ESB will be called for interview are matters for the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>The number of engineers from my Department who transferred to the Electricity Supply Board over the past five years was, so far as is known, nine; as my Department has some 260 engineers serving currently, this number can hardly be considered a large-scale transfer.

      <P>Total receipts for goods and services provided by the prisoners in 1978 amounted to £144,000.  Expenditure on materials used in the prison workshops and training sections amounted to £184,000.  The receipts were for goods and services provided by both prison officer  instructors and prisoners as a product of employment or of training. The receipts are not related to moneys paid to prisoners.  Payments to prisoners <Col N="976" /> are made in the form of gratuities and are paid to sentenced prisoners who are of good behaviour and carry out the work assigned to them.  The gratuity at present is £2.10 per week and the total so paid in 1978 was £94,000.</P>
      <P>Prison industries are not intended necessarily to be profit-making operations. That apart, they serve two main purposes:</P>
      <P>1.  To keep prisoners usefully employed and teach them the work habit.  This promotes the good and orderly management of the prison.</P>
      <P>2.  To provide prisoners, as far as possible, with useful skills to help them re-integrate into the community on their release.  Some of them are given AnCO type industrial training in the Glengarriff Training Unit.</P>
      <P>As the appropriation accounts for 1978 have not yet been finalised, the figures quoted above for receipts and expenditure are necessarily provisional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the ACP-EEC Convention of Lomé was signed in 1975, the Community undertook to allow importation of 13,766 metric tonnes of beef and veal from four ACP states, including 8,680 metric tonnes from Botswana, at a nil rate of duty and with a 90 per cent reduction in import charges, that is, levy and MCA.  Regulations which were adopted to implement this undertaking were at that time intended to be in operation only for as long as the safeguard clause prohibiting normal imports into the Community applied. However in April 1977 when the safeguard clause was lifted, the Commission sought, and the Council agreed to, an extension of the regulations on the grounds that Community import restrictions would still prevent exports of beef and veal from ACP countries to the Community.  The regulations have been further renewed on two occasions, most recently on 19 December 1978.  The Government gave their approval to the regulations and the various extensions to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the importance which the Government attach to the principles of the common agricultural policy, any proposal which involves a derogation from those principles must be viewed with serious concern.  In agreeing to the extension of the regulations, the Government have, therefore, constantly emphasised the need to establish an <Col N="979" /> alternative mechanism which would permit continued access for ACP beef and veal.  The Commission has not yet succeeded in devising a satisfactory alternative.</P>
    <P>The Government are very conscious that the Botswanan economy is very largely dependent on beef production. The social, economic and political implications of the question for Botswana were borne fully in mind in considering proposals to extend the regulations permitting continued access to the Community for ACP beef and veal.</P>

In recent years, Ireland has become increasingly interested in the work of the DAC.  As our aid programme has grown, we have sought to apply DAC standards and procedures as far as possible.</P>

      <P>As already announced it is intended that the direct elections to the European Assembly and the local elections will be held on 7 June 1979.  In regard to the question of a referendum on the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution (Adoption) Bill, 1978 I would refer the Deputy to the reply by the Taoiseach to a question on 7 February. The law requires that where two or more polls are taken on the same day the ballot papers at each poll shall be of a different colour.  The Act annexed to the EEC Council Decision of 20 September 1976 provides that the counting of votes may not begin until after the close of polling in all the member states.  The administrative arrangements for the holding of the elections, including the arrangements in relation to the provision of ballot boxes are being considered in consultation with returning officers.</P>

      <P>Under the previous tenant purchase scheme the rate of interest was 11½ per cent.  The rate of interest applicable to the current scheme, which commenced on 1 January 1979 is 12½ per cent.</P>
