    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount available to be drawn by Ireland from the European Regional Fund in 1978 and the amount actually paid to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of money which may be drawn from the European Regional Development Fund is governed by national expenditure actually incurred on projects approved for aid from the fund.  Each quarter, my Department submit to the Commission a report of expenditure to date on these projects together with a claim for payment of the full amount of aid to which this expenditure gives entitlement.  The amount received in 1978 on the basis of such claims was £11,103,552.  A further £3,491,977 was received in January 1979 in respect of claims submitted in December 1978.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, member states are entitled to a fixed quota from the regional fund each year.  Ireland's quota for 1978 was some £24 million, and applications totalling £27 million were submitted in order to ensure that this quota would be fully taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1498" /> The apparent discrepancy between the figures for commitments and receipts is due to the fact that a commitment represents the total amount of aid to be paid during the life of a project.  Since payment can only be obtained from the fund by way of refund of national expenditure, and since this will generally take several years to complete, there is therefore no reason why the figures for commitments and receipts in any year should coincide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister expect the full £27 million to be drawn, if ever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly expect it to be drawn, but I cannot say when because it depends on the duration of the projects in respect of which approval has been given and the aid has been paid.  As I indicated, a number of projects take a few years to complete therefore there will not be a completion of the payment until the projects are completed.  The £27 million is what is known in EEC terms as a commitment appropriation as distinct from a payment appropriation concept with which we are more familiar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the projects in respect of the £27 million been approved in principle and also was any money received during 1978 in respect of previous years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The £27 million was the total amount of the projects submitted but our quota entitlement was £24 million so that there will be some which would not have been approved which would exceed the quota.  In relation to whether money was received in 1978 in respect of previous years, I do not have information on that with me but the Deputy may take it as quite definite that such money was received.</P>

      <i>Notes:</i>
    </P>
    <P>(a)  The 1970-71 base on which the Department of Health increase has been calculated excludes expenditure from the rates which accounted for about 38 per cent of total public expenditure on health in that year.  If the base were adjusted to take account of this the increase for the Department of Health over the period would be 486 per cent.</P>
    <P>(b)  The 1970-71 base figure for agriculture includes provision for price supports for dairy and meat products which are now borne by the EEC through the common agricultural policy.  It is estimated that these supports will amount to about £370 million in the current year and when account is taken of this, the percentage increase in combined EEC and Exchequer aid for agriculture since 1970-71 becomes 487 per cent which is well above the average increase (433 per cent) for all services in the period 1970-71 to 1979.</P>
    <P>(c)  The 1970-71 base figure for the Department of Tourism and Transport has been adjusted to take account of the transfer of the energy services to the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the 2 per cent levy on agricultural products will be used to <Col N="1500" /> finance agricultural education, advice and research as indicated in the Budget Statement, and if so, how.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Receipts from the levy will be paid into the Exchequer and will accordingly make a contribution towards financing educational advice and research services for agriculture which would have to be met otherwise by taxpayers in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that there will be no direct link between the amount paid through the levy and the amount spent on agricultural education, advice and research and that if that is the case, that is in direct contradiction of the impression given by the Minister in his Budget Statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first and second parts of the Deputy's supplementary question is no.  The 1979 estimate of expenditure on education, research, advisory and inspection services is £31.5 million and the estimated yield from the levy is £12 million so there cannot be a direct link but, as I have indicated, if this money were not collected there would be a corresponding demand on the taxpayers in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the number of premises now licensed under paragraph 4 of Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Regulations 1979, for the purposes of collecting the 2 per cent levy on milk and cattle; when these were licensed; if the products in question may be sold to other premises; if it is possible for owners of such premises to comply with the provisions of paragraph 4 (2) of the regulations&mdash;to apply in writing for such a licence to the Revenue Commissioners &mdash;in the absence of a postal service; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Present practice is that licences are applied for and issued in the course of visits made to premises by officers of the Revenue Commissioners. This is a local procedure and centralised records are not maintained.  Consequently, whilst the licences have issued since 1 <Col N="1501" /> May 1979, I am not in a position to state the number of premises now licensed nor the dates they became licensed.  Produce received at a licensed premises may be resold but liability to levy arises only once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the provisions of the order state that a person shall not receive any fresh milk or meat for slaughter unless he is the holder of a licence?  How can the levy be enforced if the Minister is not aware of the premises which are licensed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision in the order that all fresh milk received at any premises becomes liable to the levy, but there is a saver for a case in which the same milk is received at more than one premises.  In that case, liability to the levy arises only at the premises at which the milk is first received.  On the general question, I should like to make it clear that liability for payment of the levy does not arise only where premises are licensed.  It arises whether premises are licensed or not in so far as the duty is payable specifically by the proprietor of the premises.  Holding a licence is largely an administrative means for identifying premises where liability can arise, but not holding a licence does not affect liability to the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that paragraph 4 of the order states clearly that a proprietor shall not slaughter or cause to be slaughtered any live animals unless he is the holder of a licence?  That has operated from 1 May last and I think the Minister will agree it has been quite impossible for anybody to apply for a licence in writing, as is required by the order, because of lack of a postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is mis-interpreting the terms of the order.  The fact that there is prohibition is another matter&mdash;it does not affect liability for the levy.  In regard to applying in writing, the Deputy will appreciate it is possible to apply in writing even in the context of a postal strike, and indeed I understand that quite a large number of licences have been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1502" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister expect a butcher in west Kerry, for instance, to travel to Dublin in his car, for which he cannot get petrol, to deliver an application in writing to the Revenue Commissioners? It is clear to me that under the provisions of the order such a person may not slaughter animals unless he has a licence.  The Minister has not answered the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Which question is the Deputy asking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister expect a person to get a licence, which he must have if he is to slaughter animals&mdash;he should have had it since I May last&mdash;if to do so he must apply in writing?  In the absence of a postal service the only way persons can make written applications to the Department is to drive up from the part of the country where they live, which may be a long distance from Dublin, and deliver the application in writing by hand, and this may be particularly difficult because they cannot get petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of people having to drive to Dublin from Kerry or Athy.  Licences are issued by the local collectors of customs and excise. Indeed officers of the Revenue Commissioners have visited the known premises required to be licensed, have delivered application forms to proprietors for completion, and they have been making further visits to collect completed application forms and to arrange for the issue of the licences. Therefore, the Deputy may take it that neither the postal dispute nor a petrol shortage will interfere with this aspect of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why, then, was the Minister not able to say how many premises have licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this has been done locally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is in contact with his local officers.  He does not even know what his local officers are doing.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Harbour dues at Dún Laoghaire harbour <Col N="1506" /> are payable to the Commissioners of Public Works who administer the harbour under the State Harbours Act, 1924.  The rates of such dues or any variations thereof are regulated in accordance with section 7 of the Act.  When fixing harbour dues regard is had to the relationship between expenditure and receipts and to the charges made for similar traffic in other harbours.  The schedule of rates, which runs to 24 pages, is available for inspection in the Office of Public Works and at the harbour master's office at Dún Laoghaire. The current rates of the principal revenue-producing items apart from miscellaneous goods, are</P>
    <P>(i)  ships 10p per ton</P>
    <P>(ii)  cars and vehicles 100p per ton</P>
    <P>There are mooring berths for approximately 500 pleasure craft in the harbour and the current harbour charge is £5 per annum for each berth.</P>
    <P>Commercial operations are concentrated mainly at the Mailboat Pier, St. Michael's Wharf and the Trader's Wharf.</P>
    <P>Records are kept of harbour dues received for commercial craft and pleasure craft.  Separate accounts for Dún Laoghaire harbour are not published.  The Appropriation Accounts which are published annually are related to the provisions as detailed in the relevant annual Estimates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be possible for people who are interested in identifying actual receipts from pleasure craft in the Dún Laoghaire area to have that information made available?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the steps that have been taken over the past two years to conserve the amenities in Phoenix Park; the extent of new tree plantings; and, particularly, the measures taken to conserve and develop the wild life of the park.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The amenities of Phoenix Park are many and varied and afford a wide range of opportunities for healthy outdoor recreation.  The conservation of these amenities is a matter of constant concern for the Commissioners of Public Works in whom the management of the park is vested.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years certain features have been receiving special attention.</P>
      <P>Despite regular maintenance, the surface of many of the playing pitches has deteriorated seriously in recent years. Some of these pitches have been fenced off, rotavated and reseeded.  When these are returned to use further pitches will be dealt with in the same way over the coming years.</P>
      <P>The herd of fallow deer is one of the principal attractions of Phoenix Park. The size of the herd was reduced to about 60 animals during the war years but has been increasing steadily since then.  It has been decided to maintain the herd at around 300 which is considered an appropriate size having regard to the area of Phoenix Park.  To achieve this target a number of deer have been removed from the herd within the past two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the open parkland, the trees of Phoenix Park are perhaps its most important visual feature.  While no new trees have been planted during the past two years the park woodlands have been comprehensively surveyed by park <Col N="1508" /> personnel and a long-term planting programme is now being prepared with the guidance of a landscape consultant. The first stage of this programme will be undertaken later this year when a collection of native tree species will be planted in a special enclosure near the Furry Glen.  An arboricultural supervisor has been appointed to supervise the planting programme and to undertake the care of existing trees which will include tree surgery where appropriate.</P>
    <P>To help the public understand, appreciate and respect the natural resources of the park plans have been drawn up for the construction of a small nature centre near the Knockmaroon Gate adjacent to the Furry Glen.  The building should be ready in twelve months' time and I hope it will be widely used especially by school groups.  A wildlife warden will be available to assist visitors to the centre.</P>
    <P>The principal interference with park amenities arises from the ever-increasing volume of car traffic using the park.  I will deal in detail with this matter in my reply to Question No. 14 on today's Order Paper.</P>
    <P>13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of the prevalence of car parking in Phoenix Park during race meetings; and if, in view of the danger thus constituted to the public and the damage caused to the grassland, he will take steps to have this practice prohibited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice for over 50 years to provide a car park in Phoenix Park inside the Ashtown Gate on days on which race meetings are held in Phoenix Park Racecourse in order to assist the Garda with traffic problems in the area.  A charge of 50 pence per car is made on these days.  While I do not consider that this car park constitutes a danger to the public, I am aware of the damage to the grassland surface of the car parking area.  However, prohibition of car parking there on race days would cause immense traffic problems on the roads outside the park and, therefore, I consider it advisable to continue the present practice. Apart from this parking in the <Col N="1509" /> designated area the bye-law prohibiting parking of cars on other areas is enforced as far as practicable on race days as well as all other days of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>14.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the measures at present in force and details of any proposed measures contemplated in order to reduce traffic speed in Phoenix Park; if he is aware of the danger to the public from fast moving traffic in the park; and if he will ensure that any measures introduced will be in harmony with the environmental beauty of this much frequented resort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>The main road of the park from Parkgate Street to Castleknock Gate is subject to a speed limit of 40 miles per hour and all other roads in the park are subject to a speed limit of 30 miles per hour in accordance with an order made by the Commissioners of Public Works under the Phoenix Park Act, 1925.  These speed limits are consistently enforced by the Garda who have brought a number of successful prosecutions.  Offenders are prosecuted under the bye-laws.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware of the dangers to the public created by speeding traffic in the Phoenix Park.  The volume and speed of traffic seems to arise mainly from the use of the park by commuter traffic. While such use is undesirable, it is unavoidable pending the provision of roads outside the park capable of catering for the increased traffic generated by the growth of the city to the west of the park.</P>
      <P>While recognising this position I am, nevertheless, endeavouring to take all practical measures to alleviate as far as possible the problems arising from it. The working party, representative of the Garda, local authorities, the Department of the Environment and my own office, to which I referred in the House last year, have made a number of helpful suggestions the implementation of which I have approved.</P>
      <P>Both the working party and myself are fully conscious that any measures taken must be aesthetically acceptable. Indeed, some of the measures proposed have already been turned down on these grounds.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it would be available.  For the information of the Deputy, the recommendations are the closing of the park of through traffic at dusk or at 7 p.m. whichever is the later, the provision of roundabouts rather than traffic lights, additional speed limit signs and the closing of internal park roads.</P>

In 1976 some cracks appeared in the school building and the chairman of the board of management was advised to take the matter up with his own architect who designed the school and to submit a report with an estimate of costs of remedial work so that the question of a grant could be considered.  The report and statement of cost have not yet been received.</P>

    <P>There were also some problems about heating and the Office of Public Works advised the manager and paid the appropriate grant.

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in respect of each of the 15 licensed archaeological excavations towards which a total of £57,700 in State grants was paid, but which in reply to Question No. 319 of 12 October 1977 it was stated that there was no record of a report of the finding of archaeological objects in accordance with section 23 of the National Monuments Act, 1930: (a) if he is satisfied that no archaeological objects were in fact found, and (b) if not, the action he has taken to secure compliance with the provision of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to Question No. 314 of 18 October, 1977.  (a) I am satisfied that no archaeological objects were found in three of the sites.  (b) The Commissioners of Public Works wrote to each of the archaeologists concerned in 1977 asking for a report in the matter.  Since then, as indicated by the Minister for Education in reply to Question No. 21 of 23 May 1979, reports have been received of the finding of archaeological objects at five of the sites.  The Commissioners of Public Works will continue to press the excavators of the other seven sites to furnish reports of any archaeological objects found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it to be satisfactory that these archaeologists who have excavated seven sites at public expense&mdash;even though they have been asked to do so for the last two years&mdash;should not have furnished any report to the Office of Public Works on what they have found; if he considers that this matter should be left in the realm of mere correspondence between the Office of Public Works and the archaeologists in question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply to (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the question is in the form of a tabular statement, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards (e) an applicant for an excavation licence under section 26 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, undertakes that any finds shall not be removed from the custody of the owner&mdash;or from his own custody should he retain such finds with the consent of the owner&mdash;except for the purpose of examination by the Director of the National Museum, until the expiration of 31 days from the date on which he has made a report as laid down in section 23 of that Act as amended by section 13 of the National Monuments Act, 1954.  He further undertakes to furnish to the Director of the National Museum, within six months of <Col N="1524" /> the completion of the excavation or such longer period as may be agreed on between him and the Director, a stratigraphical record on which will be fully set forth the position and description of all finds made as a result of the excavation, together with the location of the finds and the name of the person in whose possession they are at the time of furnishing the record.</P>
    <P>I consider that this is as far as one can go in the matter of guarantees regarding finds.</P>
    <P>I am advised that it would be unreasonable to require as a condition of the granting of a licence that the applicant guarantee publication of the results within any given time in a scientific journal. The amount of information that the excavation will disclose cannot be assessed until it has been completed; and when the excavator has prepared his report he may not succeed in persuading any scientific journal to publish it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, good industrial relations are ultimately based on mutual understanding and trust between managements and unions. Central to this trust must be knowledge that each side will honour agreements freely entered into and that efficient procedures are agreed for resolving fairly and speedily the problems which will inevitably arise from time to time.</P>
      <P>Procedure for the orderly resolution of disputes have been agreed with unions representing the vast majority of employees in the public service and the Government are committed to reviewing and updating these procedures regularly.</P>
      <P>Procedures for the orderly resolution of disputes must of necessity place some constraints on freedom of action by individuals, managements, unions and the Government themselves.  The Government and indeed the vast majority of unions have been prepared to accept these constraints as the price which must be paid for good industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times some groups have displayed an anti-social and, indeed, unacceptable attitude in that they will accept the advantages of the system but refuse to be bound by any of the constraints.  If the Government were to condone this <Col N="1530" /> approach it would inevitably lead to the disintegration of the orderly process of resolution of claims.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to make any necessary changes in procedures that can be agreed with the unions but, in the common interest, they cannot abandon those procedures.</P>

      <P>There are three main legal provisions for the care of children who have been abandoned or who are in need of care.</P>
      <P>Under section 55 of the Health Act, 1953, health boards are empowered to assist a child who has been deserted by its parents or who is not being adequately supported by its parents, by placing the child in a foster home, in residential care, or if appropriate in employment. This is the usual way in which children come under the supervision of a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 59 of the Children Act 1908, a court may order that a child, who is found wandering abroad and not having any home or whose parents do not exercise proper guardianship, be put in the care of a relative or other fit person.  A fit person may be an individual, or an organisation such as a health board.  Where a health board is <Col N="1538" /> designated a fit person, the board have the choice of placing the child in a foster home or in residential care.  A small number of children are supervised by the health board under this section.</P>
    <P>Under section 58 1 (b) of the Children Act, 1908, a child who is found wandering and who does not have a home or whose parents do not exercise proper guardianship may be committed through the courts to a residential home approved by the Minister for Education. The number of children coming into care under this section is declining.</P>
    <P>A decision to return a child to its family will be taken only when the health board are satisfied that the child will receive proper care and attention at home.  At the end of March 1978, there were 994 children in foster care under the supervision of health boards.  At the same time there were 897 children under the care of health boards.  It is estimated that approximately 150 of these children were in care because of abandonment or desertion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the capacity of the various agencies to respond to the problem of abandoned children or children who have strayed from home?  The figures he gave fortunately and thankfully relate to children in care but there are large numbers of children who regrettably are not under the aegis of any authority at the moment and who are abandoned and I am sure there are many more children we do not even know about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately there are such children and I am not satisfied that adequate provision is made for them at present.  As the Deputy is probably aware we have a number of measures in train to deal with the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if his attention has been drawn to recent reports indicating the very bad conditions under which children are living rough in Dublin city, and that there has been deliberate ill-treatment of these children in order to make them more effective beggars and that some of these children have become <Col N="1539" /> involved in crime in order to survive; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>39.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the growing number of reports of distress caused to itinerant and other children found on the streets of Dublin and other urban centres, he will convene a meeting of all interested agencies to review present procedures and personnel involved with a view to coping with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a problem with regard to children living rough and wandering abroad in Dublin city and some other urban centres.  Many of these children come from travelling families.</P>
      <P>I have not had any reports of children being deliberately ill-treated for the motive mentioned by the Deputy.  If, however, the Deputy has any specific information in this regard perhaps he would communicate it to me and I will have it fully investigated by the appropriate authorities.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the recent joint report completed by Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board which makes specific recommendations to improve the services available for travelling children, particularly those who are begging in the city centre.</P>
      <P>As I announced recently in Galway, I am making funds available to the Eastern Health Board to implement the recommendations of this report.</P>
      <P>Funds are also being made available to health boards to enable them to develop new services and improve existing ones for travelling children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would regard the improvement of the quality of life of travelling children as one of the major objectives of the International Year of the Child in this country.  It is for this reason that I have suggested to the National Council for Travelling People, at their annual conference in Galway, that they would prepare a comprehensive plan to help travelling families and their children.  I <Col N="1540" /> envisage that the plan would be prepared in consultation with the various authorities involved and would have clear targets and a set timescale.  The implementation of this agreed plan will have my fullest co-operation and that of the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there appears to be, from all reports, including the recent Hope Report, hundreds of children who unfortunately are not within the responsibility of any agency?  Will the Minister agree that some change in existing legislation is necessary in order to ensure that when parents come before the courts there is automatically some kind of mandatory check on whether or not they have children?  The Garda and others are doing good work in this area but there does not appear to be any automatic checking out of the existence of children.  In some cases babies as young as six months old have been left alone for as long as a week.  I am sure nobody in the House wants that.  There is a loophole there that the Minister would want to close if it is at all possible.  It may not be a matter specifically for the Minister for Health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in view of the present marked deterioration in the petrol supply situation, if he will now introduce a national rationing system based on stated priorities of need, particularly in regard to the medical and employment sectors and if he will make a statement in the matter in order to allay public disquiet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>Petrol rationing is a crude and unnecessarily severe way of dealing with the present difficulties.  Rationing creates nearly as many problems as it solves and I would not be disposed to introduce any such system except as a measure of last resort.  I do not think we have reached that stage.</P>
      <P>When speaking in the Dáil last week on an Adjournment Debate I made it clear that a period of ten to 14 days would probably elapse before the petrol supply position improved.  I see no reason to depart from the forecast I made at that time.  I am confident that the supply situation will improve over the next week or so.  As I have already pointed out, however, one can never be certain of developments in the producer countries and this is a factor which all the consuming countries, including ourselves, have to contend with.  As far as I am concerned, the most important object at the moment is to maximise incoming supplies and I am doing everything possible to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be preferable, in place of the present unofficial rationing which is grossly unfair, to have a national system based on priority of need?  Is the Minister aware that statements have been made by leading medical practitioners pointing out that they have found themselves in emergency situations, postponing important operations because of the shortage of petrol?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government see their priority as bringing in extra supplies to the country rather than rationing in the present circumstances.  As far as <Col N="1542" /> the medical profession are concerned it has always been accepted that doctors must be a special case.  My Department have not received any complaints from doctors alleging inability to procure supplies. Arising out of cases to which reference has been made in the papers and elsewhere I am asking the oil companies to ensure that doctors requirements will be met.</P>

I wish to know and raise on the Adjournment the matter which has been totally confusingly replied to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is our money as much as anybody else's money.  It is going to the parties to fight the election to the exclusion of all others.  I wish to raise also the denial of what would be a normal right of any member of this community, an equal share of the free time for political broadcasts on television and, coupled with that, the denial of the right that would be that of anyone in the country to a fair share of the free time for political broadcasts on Radio Éireann.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise as a separate matter, now that we have a new Authority, what would seem to be a disregarding of the duties imposed by the Broadcasting Act on the old Authority in that they have not attempted, in regard to the European elections, to give a fair balance as far as their broadcasts are concerned.

      <P>This is a motion to conclude the Finance Bill to-night at 7 p.m. The Finance Bill this year has taken exactly 24 hours compared with 48 hours last year.  I do not think that is adequate. It is not fitting that this important legislation should be rushed through the House in this way.  It was not introduced until 5 April.  After that there was a fortnight's recess for Easter and discussion began on 1 May.  Less time has been devoted to this important piece of legislation this year than in any other year.

      <P>No, I have already agreed to it but I should not like Deputies on the Government side to begin talking now when we are less than half way through the Committee Stage when there are important controversial sections at the end of the Bill because that would be a filibuster in reverse, so to speak, if when we have agreed to the closure at 7 p.m. they now prevent us from discussing amendments and sections that we consider important.</P>

      <P>I certainly do not intend to filibuster.  This motion is being moved by agreement.  I accept the point made by Deputy Barry but I should like to remind him that we have only had 24 hours up to this&mdash;apart from the 3½ hours we hope to have now&mdash;because of Deputy Barry's own request.  As he said, the Bill was circulated on 5 April but we did not take the Second Stage until Tuesday, 1 May at the request of Deputy Barry who did not want to take it in the previous week because it did not suit him.  In addition I remind Deputies that the Committee Stage was taken on Tuesday and Wednesday, 15 and 16 May. Again, I wanted Deputy Barry to take Committee Stage on Thursday, 17 May but he indicated that it would not suit him to be here.  I shall refresh Deputy Barry's mind and make it quite clear: he said he had to be in Killarney at an IMI conference and he could not take the Committee Stage.  As Whip responsible <Col N="1585" /> for the ordering of business I am conscious of the fact that this Bill must be through Dáil and Seanad this week. That is why we are agreeing to finish it at 7 p.m. to-night.  The fact that there were less hours this year than last year is not the Government's fault.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on Amendment No. 31<i>a:</i></P>
    <P>In page 23, before section 27, but in Chapter VI, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>29.&mdash;(1) (a) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;an authorised officer&rsquo; means an inspector authorised by the Revenue Commissioners to exercise the powers conferred by this section;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;business&rsquo; means any trade, profession or business (other than banking business within the meaning of the Central Bank Act, 1971);</P>
    <P>&lsquo;documents&rsquo; includes books, accounts and records;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;tax&rsquo; means income tax or corporation tax.</P>
    <P>(b)  The persons who may be treated as &lsquo;the taxpayer&rsquo; under this section include a company which has ceased to exist and individual who has died; and, in relation <Col N="1586" /> to such an individual, the reference in subsection (2) to the spouse is then instead to the widow or widower (the circumstance that she or he may have re-married being immaterial for the purposes of that subsection).</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a person (in this section referred to as &lsquo;the taxpayer&rsquo;) delivers to an inspector a statement of the income, profits or gains arising to him from&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  any business (past or present) carried on by him or his spouse, or</P>
    <P>(b)  any business (past or present) with whose management either of them was concerned at a material time,</P>
    <P>and the inspector is not satisfied with the statement, the inspector may serve on the taxpayer a notice in writing stating&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  that he is not satisfied with the statement delivered to him, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  that he has requested an authorised officer to serve notice under this section on persons who, in relation to the taxpayer, are subject to this section.</P>
    <P>(3) Where a notice under subsection (2) has been served on the tax-payer, an authorised officer may, for the purpose of enquiring into the tax liability of the taxpayer, by notice in writing served on any person who, in relation to the taxpayer, is subject to this section require him, within the period stated in the notice, or within such further period as the authorised officer may allow&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  to furnish him with particulars of any business transactions which that person had with the taxpayer during a stated period, and</P>
    <P>(b)  to deliver to him or, if the person to whom the notice is given so elects, to make available for inspection by an authorised officer such documents specified or described in the notice as are in his possession or power and as, in the <Col N="1587" /> first-mentioned officer's opinion, contain, or may contain, information relevant to any tax liability to which the taxpayer is or may be or may have been subject, or to the amount of any such tax liability.</P>
    <P>(4)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a person who is carrying on a profession, and on whom a notice under subsection (3) has been served, to furnish any particulars relating to a client to an authorised officer, or to deliver to, or make available for inspection by, an authorised officer any documents relating to a client, other than such particulars or documents&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  as pertain to the payment of fees or to other financial transactions, or</P>
    <P>(b)  as are otherwise material to the tax liability of the client,</P>
    <P>and, in particular, he shall not be required to disclose any information or professional advice of a confidential nature given to a client.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where a person fails to comply with a requirement duly made on the person under subsection (3) within the period stated in the notice containing the requirement or such further period as may be allowed by the authorised officer concerned, the person shall be liable to a penalty of £500.</P>
    <P>(6)  The persons who, in relation to a taxpayer, are subject to this section are any person who is carrying on a business, or was doing so at a material time, and any company whether carrying on a business or not.</P>
    <P>(7)  For the purposes of subsection (2), every director of a company is to be taken as being concerned with the management of any business carried on by the company, and a material time is any time which, in the authorised officer's opinion, is, or may have been, material in the ascertainment of any past or present tax liability of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>(8)  Where documents are to be delivered to an authorised officer pursuant <Col N="1588" /> to a requirement duly made under subsection (3), copies of such documents may be delivered instead of the originals; but&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the copies must be photographic or otherwise by way of facsimile; and</P>
    <P>(b)  if so required by the authorised officer, the originals must be made available for inspection by an authorised officer, failure to comply with this provision being treated as failure to comply with the requirement.</P>
    <P>(9)  An authorised officer may examine any document furnished or made available for inspection under this section and may take copies of, or extracts from, them.</P>
    <P>(10)  When exercising any powers conferred by this section an authorised officer shall, if so requested by any person affected, produce to that person a certificate of the Revenue Commissioners authorising him to exercise the powers conferred by this section.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent the limit above which income paid by a disponer to a child over 21, or to a grandchild, under deed of covenant would be regarded not as the income of the child or grandchild but as the income of the disponer.</P>
      <P>Accepting that the purpose of this section is to put an end to the tax avoidance device employed by a number of individuals liable to tax at the higher rates, it could be argued that even a 5 per cent concession as provided for in the section, ought not to be permitted, particularly since there is a total exclusion for covenants in favour of a child who is permanently incapacitated.  It should be noted that this device is of particular value to those in the higher income ranges.  The amendment would enable those taxpayers to use this device to a greater extent than permitted by the section. If the present provision does not prove effective in counteracting avoidance of tax payment the matter may have to be looked at again.  I cannot, therefore, indicate any acceptance in relation to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 32a:</P>
      <P>In a page 24, after line 39, to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  This section shall not apply to a disposition made for the benefit of a child arising out of a judicial separation or any separation deed, or for the benefit of a child whose spouse is deceased.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is the amendment I was talking about originally.  The purpose of the amendment is to extend the section to allow it to cater for children of broken homes; to allow the existing relief to be given to the children of broken homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This may not be obvious, <Col N="1590" /> but it is very important in considering this, that when we speak of a child here we are speaking of somebody over the age of 21 years.  As far as children who are minors are concerned, covenants in their favour are disregarded for tax purposes. It is difficult to see why the special exclusion should be sought for covenants to children of a disponer who are over the age of 21 years.</P>
      <P>I should like to make it clear to the Deputy that the tax provisions in this section do not prevent any parent or grandparent from covenanting income in favour of a child or grandchild.  The provisions ensure that, where such covenants are made, special tax relief is not obtained by the parent or grandparent, so as to reduce the tax chargeable on his income.  This device of covenants has been used to reduce the tax bill of parents and grandparents liable to tax at a high rate.  The present section proposes to counter this device, although it does not close the door altogether, since a covenant of up to 5 per cent of the disponer's income will be recognised for tax purposes and covenants in favour of permanently incapacitated children are being excluded completely from the proposed restriction.  One has to consider the case for the two categories that Deputy Barry proposed to exclude against the background.  I do not wish to delay the House unduly.  If the Deputy wants to argue the case in detail, I shall go into more detail on the two particular cases.  I must indicate, however, that I cannot accept the amendment.  The effect of it would be simply to benefit people in the high tax bracket, in cases where the necessity for this provision is not at all clear when one recalls that we are talking about people over the age of 21 years being the beneficiaries of the covenant, and those paying the money into the covenant being primarily in the high income bracket.  If they were not in this bracket, I do not think that this problem would arise for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, (<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I should like some more information. Section 25 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, relieves a person's main dwelling place from capital gains tax under certain circumstances.  The purpose of this amendment is to extend the same relief to a second dwellinghouse owned by a person if this second dwellinghouse is or has been occupied by a dependent relative of the taxpayer.  A dependent relative is defined.  Under those circumstances, a second dwellinghouse will also be relieved of capital gains tax.  Could the Minister say how many dwellings will be relieved under this subsection?  Has there been much demand for the amendment which he is now making?  Would the Minister reply with particular reference to the approximate number of second houses which will be relieved from capital gains tax under the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, by inserting a new subsection 9 (a) in section 25 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, provides for relief from capital gains tax in respect of a gain accuring to an individual on the disposal by him, on or after 6 April 1979, of a full or partial interest in a dwellinghouse which he had provided, gratituously, for an independent relative, including a dependent relative of his spouse.  The relief will be available in addition to the existing relief provided for in section 25 in respect of a gain accuring to an individual on the disposal of his only or main residence and will likewise extend to a garden or grounds not exceeding one acre.  The general rules governing the granting of the existing relief will apply also to the new relief.  No more than one dwelling house may qualify at any one time for the new relief in the case of an individual or any married couple.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the provision of a second residence for dependent relatives is rare in this country, it is anticipated that very little revenue will be lost as a result of the amendment, particularly in view of the <Col N="1592" /> indexation and tapering weight provisions of the Capital Gains Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978.  I cannot say precisely how many cases are likely to arise but it does not seem they will be extensive. Some representations have been made seeking this but I would not wish to suggest to the House or to the Deputy that there has been any widespread clamour for it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 26, before section 32, but in Part I, to insert the following section&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;32.&mdash;(1)  It is hereby declared and enacted that, for the purposes of any assessment to capital gains tax made on or after the 11th day of May, 1979, subsection (4) of section 31 of <Col N="1594" /> the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, shall not have effect and shall be deemed never to have had effect as respects a unit trust to which the provisions of subsection (5A) (inserted by the Finance Act, 1977) of that section apply.</P>
    <P>(2)  The said section 31 is hereby amended by the insertion in subsection (5) after &lsquo;the units in the unit trust shall&rsquo; of &lsquo;for that year&rsquo; and the said subsection, as so amended, is set out in the Table to this section.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TABLE</P>
    <P>(5)  If throughout a year of assessment all the assets of a unit trust are such that they are not chargeable assets or are assets in respect of which a gain would not be a chargeable gain, the units in the unit trust shall for that year be deemed not to be chargeable assets for the purposes of this Act.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for the insertion in Chapter VII of the Bill of an additional section.  Subsection (1) of the new section is designed to prevent an unintended exemption from capital gains tax being availed of by certain unit trusts and subsection (2) corrects a minor drafting flaw in section 31 (5) of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This section repeals section 15 of the 1934 Finance Act and in consequence removes the exemption from VAT on the importation of antiques. An antique was defined as something more than 100 years old and was not liable for importation duties or VAT.  This will no longer be the case.  Is there a reason for this?  It seems unnecessary. Surely we should make it easier for people who have money and <Col N="1595" /> wish to dispose of it in this way to bring genuine antiques into the country.</P>

      <P>Section 15 of the Value-Added Tax Act, 1972 amended by section 14 of the Value-Added Tax (Amendment) Act, 1978 applied general customs provisions to VAT payable on goods at importation as if VAT were a duty at customs.  Hence section 15 of the Finance Act, 1934, afforded antiques imported by non-registered persons exemption from VAT.  This created what I consider to be justifiable concern among home traders liable to VAT since VAT at the rate of 10 per cent must be paid on sales of all antiques in the State whether imported or not and of course it involved a loss of tax.  This repeal will remove the discrimination against Irish antique dealers.  The total value at importation of antiques in 1978 was estimated at about £2.5 million.  Importations by registered persons would amount to about one tenth of this sum and VAT on that would yield about £25,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Both sets of dealers are liable for VAT&mdash;(a) who imports an antique does not pay VAT on importation under the existing system but if he is registered and sells the antique he must pay VAT on the amount he receives for that antique; trader (b) buys an antique from a registered dealer on which he pays VAT, he sells it charging VAT and he submits to the State the difference between the VAT he charged and the VAT he paid, so the State ends up with the same amount of money.  But one does not pay VAT on importation and the other has to pay, when he resells, the amount of VAT minus what he paid when he bought the article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are probably spending too long on this point but if (a) is registered for VAT and he is an antique dealer and imports goods, at present he does not pay any VAT on the importation of that antique.  If, for example, he buys the antique for £100 at the point of entry and there is 10 per cent VAT to be paid, he sells it for £110 plus his profit and he submits £10 to the State.  If this section is repealed he now buys the article in England for £90; he pays £9 VAT; he sells it for £110 and submits to the State £10 minus the £9 he has already paid.  The State gets £10.  If he is registered that is the position but if he is unregistered he only pays VAT at the point of entry.  Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>A difficulty may arise in so far as one does not have to visualise a sale onwards within the State. Somebody buying an antique here could buy from a registered dealer in which event the sale would be subject to 10 per cent VAT.  Alternatively he could buy from a foreign dealer and import it and as things stand at the moment there would be no VAT payable.  In that way the Irish dealer is at a disadvantage.  The consequences of this amendment would be to put them on the same footing.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. a33a:</P>
      <P>In page 27, before section 40 to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  It is hereby declared that the exportation from the State of produce that is subject, upon such exportation, to payment of a duty imposed by the Imposition of Duties (No. 239) (Agricultural Produce) (Cattle and Milk) Order, 1979 (S.I. No. 152 of 1979), or by Imposition of Duties (No. 240) (Agricultural Produce) (Cereals and Sugar Beet) Order, 1979 (S.I. No. 153 of 1979), shall be prohibited unless, before such exportation, the amount of the duty is paid to the Revenue Commissioners or security that is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, adequate for its payment is given to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  It is hereby declared that section 15 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1966, shall in relation to the duty imposed by that section or any duty to which that section is applied by virtue of section 1 (h) of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, be construed as enabling, and as always having enabled, the Revenue Commissioners to provide by regulations for the withholding or recovery, from such persons as may be specified in the regulations, by persons specified in the regulations, of an amount equal to the amount of such duty of excise, in the manner and <Col N="1599" /> subject to the conditions so specified.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section relate to aspects of the recently imposed excise duties in the form of the 2 per cent levy on fresh milk, live cattle, cereals and sugar beet.</P>
    <P>The levy on fresh milk and cattle was applied from 1 May 1979 and that on cereals and sugar beet will take effect from 1 August 1979.  The levies were imposed by two Statutory Orders made by the Government under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, as amended, that is, the Imposition of Duties (No. 239) (Agricultural Produce) (Cattle and Milk) Order, 1979 and the Imposition of Duties (No. 240) (Agricultural Produce) (Cereals and Sugar Beet) Order, 1979). Both Orders will cease to have effect on 31 December 1979.</P>
    <P>Supplementary Statutory Regulations, setting out measures for securing and collecting the levies, have been made by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of cattle and milk under the Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Regulations, 1979.</P>
    <P>The powers conferred by the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, are sufficient to enable the levies to be imposed and to provide for most necessary supporting measures but they are not adequate to cope with the items contained in this section. Consequently these items could not have been included in the Statutory Orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain more fully exactly what powers are being conferred by this section which do not exist at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if I deal with subsections (1) and (2) that would answer the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection (1) provides that the Revenue Commissioners may refuse to allow the exportation of produce to which the excise duties apply if an exporter does not pay the required duty. Accordingly it prohibits exportation unless the duty has been paid in advance or <Col N="1600" /> Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the commissioners for its payment.  A similar control exists in respect of collection of EEC agricultural levies&mdash;section 29, Finance Act, 1978&mdash;and is also provided for in the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Bill.  Without prohibition, exports cannot be impounded and it might not be possible to prosecute non-resident exporters failing to pay the levy due.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Levy Order made under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, it could not be used to enact provisions whereby a purchaser of produce who is accountable for payment of the excise duty could withhold from the seller an amount equal to the excise duty payable; nor, where the person accountable for the duty is not the owner of the produce, could it be used to provide for recovery from the owner of an amount equal to the excise duty payable.</P>
    <P>We were advised that such provisions could be included in regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners on the basis that the validity of the provisions in the regulations could be confirmed by a suitable insertion in the Finance Bill&mdash;in other words, to remove any doubts that might exist.  Regulation 8 of the Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Regulations, 1979, made by the commissioners contains the desired provisions about entitlement to withhold or recover the amount of the levy and this subsection is being included in the Finance Bill accordingly.  This confirmation will cover the regulations which took effect from 1 May 1979.</P>
    <P>I should say that entitlement to deduct does not preclude butchers from foregoing this entitlement where sales at marts are conducted on a net of levy basis; exporters and meat factories who are in the same position as the butchers are already operating the marts' arrangements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to confirm that Regulation 8 of the Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Regulations, 1979, which relates to the withholding of money was invalid at the time it was made in the sense that it provided by order for the withholding <Col N="1601" /> of moneys although no power existed at that time when the order was promulgated for the making by order of such a requirement.  Such power did not and will not exist until such time as sub-section (2) of the amendment before the House is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in his assumption.  As I indicated, we have been advised by the Attorney General that the provisions could be included in the Regulations made by the Revenue Commissioners but the confirmation that will be contained in the Finance Bill is to remove any doubts that may have existed or have been alleged to have existed.  It would not be true to say that Regulation 8 of the Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Regulations, 1979, made by the Revenue Commissioners was made, to use the Deputy's phrase, invalidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why it is necessary to have this amendment if it was possible to withhold the moneys under the order without it?  The amendment is either necessary or not.  If it is necessary then the insertion of the provision in relation to the withholding of moneys in an order made on 30 April 1979 was invalid because no power existed at that time to insert in such an order the power to withhold moneys.  If, on the other hand, it is not necessary to have the amendment I cannot see why the time of the House is being taken up with this because it would have been possible to do what the Minister seeks to do by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that this provision confirms the validity of the provisions in the regulation.  That does not mean that there was no validity in the provisions of the regulations; it confirms their validity and makes it clear that this confirmation applies as of now and from the commencement of the regulations of 1 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that what the Minister has stated is incorrect.  This does not confirm anything.  If one looks at the wording of the proposed section one will see that it is clearly not confirmatory, <Col N="1602" /> it is an enabling measure and there is a major distinction between a confirming and enabling provision.  The proposed new section states:</P>
      <P>(2) It is hereby declared that section 15 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1966, shall, in relation to the duty imposed by that section or any duty to which that section is applied by virtue of section 1 (h) of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, be construed as enabling, and as always having enabled, the Revenue Commissioners to provide by regulations for the withholding or recovery, from such persons as may be specified in the regulations, by persons specified in the regulations, of an amount equal to the amount of such duty of excise, in the manner and subject to the conditions so specified.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is not a confirmatory matter because there would be no necessity to give powers to enable things to be done if one was merely confirming something that was always validly done.  We are being asked to enable the Minister retrospectively to do something that he did originally without power to do so. This amendment reveals that this 2 per cent agricultural levy was introduced, and provisions made for its collection from 1 May, without the power by law to do so.</P>
      <P>The amendment will not be law until 7 June and, therefore, the enabling power contained in it will not exist until then. However, levies have been collected since 1 May under a power which between 1 May and 7 June does not and will not exist.  In my view that is bordering on unconstitutional behaviour.  I do not believe it is possible to introduce retrospective legislation that has a penal effect.  By providing that it is declared that section 15 (2) of the Finance Act, 1966, shall be construed as enabling is in order but it refers to the past and is retrospective legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is saying is that it will be right as from 7 June for people to have collected and withheld money from people between 1 May and 7 June.  In other words, the power to collect that money does not exist now, will not exist <Col N="1603" /> on 7 June, but will be validated from 7 June.  It is questionable whether this is constitutional behaviour at all.  It further underlines the unfair manner in which this entire episode of the 2 per cent levy has been dealt with by the Government. The Government have had to resort to grotesquely artificial contrivances to bring this levy into being by means of orders specifically chosen so as to avoid a division in the matter in the House where Fianna Fáil Deputies might find some embarrassment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government choose to introduce a levy on agricultural produce under the provisions of section 15 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1966, when the Minister knows that that section relates solely to wine?  The Minister chose to use that power relating solely to wine to collect a levy on agricultural produce.  He had to use the global power in section 1 (h) of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, to render it possible to use the wine power to introduce a levy on other products in a manner which was never envisaged when either section 15 of the Finance Act, 1966, or section 1 (h) of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, were introduced. No Deputies, when they approved either of these Acts, envisaged or could have been expected to envisage the powers being given in relation to the collection of duties on wine being used to collect a levy from farmers in relation to cattle, milk and so on.  I am sure that if Deputies in the House in 1966 or in 1957 knew that a Government would use these provisions in this way they would not have agreed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a serious matter.  The law is being twisted to an unreasonable degree to collect an unnecessary levy.  The Government could have obtained exactly <Col N="1604" /> the same amount of money and would have avoided the inconvenience and difficulties if they had chosen, rather than to introduce the levy, not to refund the value-added tax.  The introduction of the levy was just to preserve face.  The Government said they would introduce it if the farmers did not arrive in sackcloth and ashes to accept what the Government had laid down for them in the matter of taxation.  Farmers were required to make this public confession in order that the levy would not be introduced. They were not being asked to agree to pay more taxation but to publicly accept that what the Government was doing was right.  If they did that the same amount of money would have been collected by not refunding the VAT. Because farmers did not make this public confession, the Government decided to collect the same amount of money by introducing a 2 per cent levy instead of by not refunding VAT.  All of the difficulties would have been avoided had the Government not refunded VAT and we would have avoided the necessity to resort to possibly illegal means to collect the money.  There would have been none of the disruptions of trade and none of the possibilities of increases in consumer prices which are being brought about by the levy.  The Government simply wanted the farmers to go down on their knees and accept what the Government had done and, for no other reason than that they would not, the Government decided to introduce this levy instead of not to refund VAT.</P>
    <P>This is a very bad decision by the Government.  It does no one any good. The Government would have benefited as much if they had chosen not to refund the VAT.  The farming community would have been prepared to accept that because they had no particular expectation in relation to VAT, although admittedly the Government in their election manifesto promised that they would refund VAT.  They did not say that they would refund VAT and introduce a 2 per cent levy at the same time.</P>
    <P>We are now in this situation and the Government have had to resort to these means, which are at best quasi-legal, in order to raise this money.  Are the Government satisfied that, if they have <Col N="1605" /> to prosecute somebody for failing to collect the levy between 1 May and 7 June, the prosecution will stick, in view of the fact that the power to withhold the money did not exist when the levy was introduced and was not on the Statute Book until 7 June?</P>
    <P>This amendment was published this morning and nobody had cited this amendment until today.  How was anybody supposed to know from looking at the law of the land between 1 and 29 May whether or not they were entitled to withhold these moneys?  The law as it presently stands, and as it could reasonably be anticipated to stand until such time as this amendment was circulated, is that no power to withhold the money exists because any power taken in subsection (8) of the order was not validly taken since no provision existed whereby such a power could be taken. One cannot make a law by making an order.  Anybody looking at the law as it stood yesterday is asking himself if he can or cannot collect the levy and must come to the conclusion that he does not have any legal power to collect the levy. Yet, this morning this amendment is published and the Minister presumably will tell us that if he did not collect the money yesterday he will now be prosecuted even though the law as it stood yesterday did not enable him to collect it.  That seems to be contrary to natural justice.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court have always seen fit to interpret laws which are contrary to natural justice to be unconstitutional, and I question whether the collection of the levy and the withholding of money in respect of the levy are legal at all.  I question whether it is in accordance with natural justice to prosecute farmers who have withheld the levy or butchers who have failed to collect it, taking for granted that the law as it stood at the time of the making of the order did not provide for a power in respect of withholding the money.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister's answer will be that the power in respect of withholding the money exists in the Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Order, 1979, paragraph 8.  We have already discovered that power does not exist in law for the putting of that matter <Col N="1606" /> into the order.  Therefore, as of yesterday that part of the order was not valid because power did not exist to make an order containing such a provision. Therefore, in my view, persons should not be prosecuted for having failed to collect the money.  This will not be law until 7 June next and therefore nobody should be prosecuted for failing to collect the money.</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be an example of bungling on the part of the Government. I hesitate to say that it is bungling on a scale we have not seen before, because we have seen more bungling on the part of the Government since 1 January this year than ever before and this is just a mere instance of that bungling at its worst.  This is a bad piece of retrospective legislation and I am sure that if the House were to be given a free vote most Deputies would see it my way rather than the Minister's.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to follow Deputy Bruton along the road he has been travelling.  However, if I do I have no doubt we will end up with Deputy Barry accusing me of a filibuster to prevent the remaining provisions of the Bill and the amendments being dealt with because of the time constraint.  I am trying to resist that temptation.  Deputy Bruton knows that the reason this levy was proposed by order is that there was no possibility of the Finance Bill being enacted before 1 May.  That is the reason, he knows it, nevertheless he choose for political purposes to pretend otherwise.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the power to enable the deduction of the levy to be made existed. The section confirms that power and confirms that the power always has been there.  This is not retrospective validation.  It confirms that the power had been there.  It is not retrospective legislation.  The phrase is used, &ldquo;shall be construed as enabling and as always having enabled&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the section is doing is clarifying and confirming the position.  To listen to Deputy Bruton one would think that provisions of this nature had never appeared before.  I am quite certain Deputy Bruton knows provisions of this kind appear quite frequently in Bills, for good <Col N="1607" /> reasons, and the fact that such a provision appears here does not mean that powers do not exist.  I hope people will not be misled by what Deputy Bruton has said and, as a result, find themselves in difficulties.  I am advised the power was there, this proposed section confirms it and I hope that people will not be misled by anything the Deputy has said and as a result of which they might suffer.</P>

The amendment says that the relevant section can be construed as enabling and as always having enabled such a power to be exercised.  The very fact that the second part of this amendment is introduced at all suggests that there is grave doubt on the part of the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners as to whether the acts already undertaken in relation to collection of these moneys have been valid at all.  If the power already existed this section would not have been introduced at all.  It seems that there is at best serious doubt on the part of the Minister and his advisers as to whether they had power to do what they did.  If they had power, why should they select this part of the order to confirm it&mdash;to use the Minister's word&mdash;by statute?  Why not confirm the entire order by statute?  They have chosen one part in relation to the withholding of <Col N="1610" /> moneys and they have chosen to confirm that.

      <P>Deputy Bruton is making very heavy weather of a small point for his own purposes.  That is his business, but you, Sir, will have noticed the way he has been toning down his statement in the last few moments from what he was saying earlier.  The expression relied on is &ldquo;securing and collecting the duty&rdquo;.  It is clear that that is an open-ended kind of phrase and because of that it is deemed advisable to confirm explicitly that &ldquo;deduction&rdquo; comes within the scope of the expression &ldquo;securing and collecting&rdquo;. The fact that it is being specifically and explicitly confirmed does not, as Deputy Bruton appears to think, imply that there was no power for it and that this is a device to obtain the power retrospectively.  I suspect that Deputy Bruton knows that it is not so and that he is familiar with numerous similar cases that have arisen under other Bills before the House and that in no case does that kind of expression imply that the power to do a thing was not there.  In reality it is a small technical problem and nothing else, and Deputy Bruton is exaggerating it out of all proportion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): The normal way of implementing budget proposals for taxation or for duties is to implement them by the Finance Bill which is usually introduced shortly after the budget.  There was general surprise when it appeared that it was not proposed to deal with the 2 per cent levy in the budget but that it was proposed to deal with it under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.  The short history of this levy has been that of one major bungle and that bungle has had disastrous consequences for the country.  It has, in effect, driven farmers and urban dwellers apart.  It is quite obvious from the history of this levy that the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, introduced it <Col N="1611" /> without realising its consequences or that it was a type of levy that could not be stood over.  It was unjust in its application to the farming community because it took no regard of the ability of the farmers to pay, of whether a farmer was making a profit or loss, whether he was a big or small farmer or whether he was or would ordinarily be liable for income tax.  What I am saying is borne out clearly by the fact that days after the introduction of this levy the Minister for Finance at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis abandoned about half or more than half of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): This amendment is about levies and the collection of levies.  It is all about the levy and the collection of the levy.  The Minister did not understand the implication of it and this is evidenced by the fact that he ran away from it at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis and later, in the face of  mounting opposition from the farming community, he agreed to abandon it altogether in exchange for another arrangement.  The result of that was to bring 150,000 people on to the streets of Dublin in protest against this levy&mdash;which is going to be copper-fastened by this amendment&mdash;with its appalling consequences for the economy of this country.  I leave this part of it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that not alone did the Government and the Minister not understand the effect of this but they did not know how they were going to impose it.  They did not want to impose it by a budget resolution introduced on budget day because their own backbenchers would have rebelled. <Col N="1612" /> Then, of course, the device of this 1957 Act and the 1966 Act was thought of in order to avoid a division in the House on budget day, in order to avoid the humiliation caused by Fianna Fáil backbenchers like Deputy Leonard of Monaghan who would not even wait in the House to hear the Minister announce it but got up and left.  When the Taoiseach was asked if this was a unique method of introducing this he said, &ldquo;Not at all&rdquo; and quoted precedents which were not precedents.  The Taoiseach said then that there was no trouble about it. Now we have this levy in operation since 2 May with people being expected to pay it, other people being expected to collect it, and not until the dying two hours of the Finance Bill in the Dáil are we going to have the matter regularised.  That is an appalling situation.  If it created offences, as I believe it does, then it is wrong to do so retrospectively, as we are doing here, and I think it would be unconstitutional. There is far too much bungling by this Government, far too much retrospective legislation to validate bungles.

      <P>I move amendment No. 33a:</P>
      <P>In page 28, line 28, after &ldquo;on&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the transfer of shares to charities, or on&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1615" /> This section exempts from stamp duty conveyances, transfers, or the lease of land or houses for charitable purpose in Ireland.  We accept that that is a good thing.  But I want to include in it the transfer of shares given to charities as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of the section is as Deputy Barry said.  The transfers of immovable property and of securities can, for the purpose of stamp duty, be distinguished on several grounds. Firstly, the duty is chargeable on immovable property at graduated scales rising to 6 per cent where the value of the property is over £50,000.  On the other hand, securities are liable at 1 per cent or 2 per cent depending on whether the security is Irish or foreign.  There is, therefore, less possibility of difficulty in paying the duty in the case of securities. Where the security is a Government security, the question of duty does not arise, as stamp duty is not payable on the transfer of Government stocks. Thirdly, as far as the Revenue Commissioners are aware, there has been no demand, certainly not of any significance, that transfers of securities to charities should be exempt.  Fourthly, in the case of United Kingdom securities, the gain to a charity of an exemption here would be minimal since the charity would still have to pay stamp duty in the United Kingdom on the transfer.  However, where a transfer is stamped here the payment of stamp duty is not required in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>In the light of these facts the decision was taken to confine the exemption to transfers and to leases of lands.  Further consideration of the matter in the light of Deputy Barry's amendment has not produced evidence which would appear to justify extending the exemption.  I should point out to the House also that a question of chattels or of cash being given to charity does not arise here because, of course, such transfers are not of themselves liable to stamp duty.</P>

If that means that land bonds are to be subject to stamp duty on their nominal value on transfer, it is most unfair.  As we know, many issues of land bonds are standing certainly as low as £40, and the nominal value would be £100.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33b:</P>
      <P>In page 30, before section 50, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;50&mdash;(1)  The Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  by the addition of the following subsection to section 61:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Where a person carrying on a trade or profession incurs expenses in attending courses or otherwise in furthering his knowledge in connection with that trade or profession and which is for the benefit of the community generally, the expenditure so incurred shall be deducted as an expense in computing the profits or gains to be charged to tax.&rdquo;; and</P>
      <P>(b)  by the insertion in Rule 3 of Schedule 2 of the following before &ldquo;there may be deducted&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or if a person incurs expenses in attending courses or otherwise in furthering his knowledge in connection with the office or employment and which is for the benefit of the community generally&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  This section shall apply as respects the year 1979-80 and subsequent years of assessment.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is desirable that professional people, particularly doctors, should attend courses and contribute to publications and magazines.  This would benefit the community generally and the advancement of the doctors' careers.  They should be allowed those expenses as deductible expenses for tax purposes under PAYE, under section 50 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  I would like this to be included on behalf of the doctors.  I am sure everybody agrees that it is necessary that they should continuously keep up to date and attend courses to make sure that the most modern techniques, <Col N="1618" /> knowledge and research are available to them.  No matter in what part of the world these are available they should be encouraged to go to those countries and make sure that this country has available to it a team of doctors and professional people who are absolutely up to date with their subjects. They should be encouraged to contribute to any magazine which would help them in this regard.  There are so many changes taking place in all the professions that we should do everything we can to encourage those people to keep up to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the amendment as drafted is in very wide terms and I am afraid it is sufficiently imprecise to be unworkable in practice. It would lead to thousands of appeals.  I am not criticising Deputy Barry when I say that, because it is not his job to draft sections of the Finance Bill.  I am simply saying it in relation to the amendment before us.</P>
      <P>Perhaps what is more at issue here is the question of the approach one should have to this.  In regard to the position mentioned by Deputy Barry about doctors the amendment as drafted disregards the fundamental principle of the tax code which lays down in quite strict terms the expenses which may be deducted in computing income or profits for tax purposes.  In the case of a profession or a trade only such expenses as are wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purposes of the trade or profession may be deducted in the computation of the profits or income. Therefore, so far as any expenditure incurred in attending courses or furthering knowledge in connection with a trade or profession can be shown to be laid out for the purposes of the trade or profession that expenditure can be deducted under existing law.  That would apply to the kind of example Deputy Barry gave. If it cannot be so shown then it is not incurred for the purposes of the trade or profession and is not, therefore, a legitimate deduction in the computation of the profits.  I do not think it should be made so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> In the case of a doctor who is employed the Schedule E expenses rule provides that a deduction may be allowed only in respect of money spent &ldquo;wholly, exclusively and necessarily in the performance of the duties of the office or employment&rdquo;.  If an employer considers it necessary for an employee in the course of his employment to attend a course or to further his knowledge of his employment then the employer will pay the appropriate cost for him which, of course, he will claim as a deduction in the computation of the profits of his trade.  The allowance for tax purposes of expenditure which a trader, professional person or an employee occurs in attending courses or acquiring knowledge which has some connection with his current activities and which is likely to be of use to him in his trade, profession or occupation is at issue here.  In the ordinary course of events the acquisition of further knowledge and skills is likely to generate additional profits or income in the case of a person carrying on a trade or profession and in the case of an employee is likely to lead to promotion or the securing of a better job.  While those objectives are desirable in themselves and may be for the benefit of the community in the long run they are for the personal benefit of the persons themselves and to allow special tax relief for such expenditure raises the question of whether the general body of taxpayers should be asked to subsidise such expenditure. I am afraid I must take the view that the answer to that question is in the negative.  Therefore, I am afraid I cannot accept Deputy Barry's amendment.</P>

    <P>(2) (a)  The figures referred to in the tables to subsection (1) shall be increased annually so that the amount to be used for any future taxation year is an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the amount that would have been applicable for the taxation year if no adjustment had been made under this section with respect to that year, by the ratio that the Consumer Price Index for the twelve month period ended on the 30th day of September next before that year bears to the Consumer <Col N="1622" /> Price Index for the twelve month period that ended on the 30th day of September, 1978, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the adjustments referred to in paragraph (a) shall be made by the Revenue Commissioners and published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> not later than the 1st day of December, in the year preceding that to which they are to apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>When the capital acquisitions tax was introduced in 1975 an assurance was given that the thresholds at which it would begin to apply and the bands on which one would move from a lower to a higher rate of capital acquisitions tax would be revised in line with inflation every three years.  This should have been done last year.  In that year the Minister revised the thresholds in respect of transfers to nephews, brothers and relations further out but did not revise the thresholds in respect of transfers from father to son, husband to wife, mother to son, mother to daughter&mdash;that is the transfers within the immediate family. The thresholds within the immediate family are exactly the same as they were when the tax was introduced in 1975 despite the fact that there has been massive inflation in the value of property since that date.  The value of such property does not necessarily improve the income of the person concerned.  The increases in value in some cases reflect the fact that land, as Mark Twain said, is a commodity that they have stopped making and, therefore has a certain intrinsic scarcity value.  This has put up the price of land.  It also meant in 1975 that for a transfer of land from a father to a son on death to be liable to capital acquisition tax, at average land values of about £800 an acre, a farmer would have had to have about 220 acres.  In other words, he would have to have a very substantial farm.  Now, because of inflation, because the thresholds have not been revised, except in the cases I mentioned for transfers to more distant relatives, because land is valued at £3,000 an acre, and assuming present average stocking rates, a farmer would be liable to capital acquisition tax if he had a farm of 70 acres or over.  This <Col N="1623" /> means that this tax is applying to small-and medium-sized farmers where hitherto it applied only to large farmers. That is not the result of any enactment by the Oireachtas extending the tax, it is simply the result of inflation.</P>
    <P>To my mind extending the scope of any tax, whether it be capital or income tax, by means of inflation is unjust and is a bad form of taxation.  It was for that reason we introduced this amendment which not only proposes to raise the limits for the tax and to widen the bands, but requires in future that the figures constituting the initial thresholds and the bands be revised every year in line with the consumer price index.  This provision is contained in subsection (2) of the amendment and is based on the provisions of the Canadian legislation in relation to the indexation of income tax.  The terms of the Canadian legislation are introduced in this amendment with certain modifications to make it relative to Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>I would like to illustrate the impact of the capital acquisition tax on two types of farm&mdash;one of 100 acres and the other of 200 acres.  In the case of a farm of 100 acres, one assumes that the normal stock would be worth £20,000, machinery would be worth £10,000 and the farm would be worth about £3,000 an acre.  If that 100-acre farm were transferred from father to son on death the amount of capital acquisition tax which would have to be paid would be £22,500.  On average that farm would yield an income of about half that figure in a year.  This means that the entire income from the farm for two years would be required to pay the tax.  He would have no money to live on and he would not be able to meet any expenses incurred on the farm.  Of course if inflation continues the amount of tax will be even greater.</P>
    <P>The situation is more extreme in the case of the 200-acre farm.  In that case the amount of capital acquisition tax would have to be paid is £165,000.  I am using farm management survey figures of the average income which would have to be derived from a farm of that size.  A <Col N="1624" /> sum of £165,000 represents the entire income for eight years' work on the farm. In other words, eight years' work would have to be devoted to pay the tax.  If a man with a 200-acre farm dies today, his son would have to work on the farm for the next eight years to pay that tax.  That is not an acceptable situation.</P>
    <P>It appears that this tax is being used to force such farmers to sell their land.  Forced sales of that sort are tantamount to an attack on the principle that the farmer's son should have the land.  If as a result of the sale the land was bought by another full-time farmer the situation might not be so bad.  It would be simply a case of one farmer transferring by sale to another farmer. What is happening is that more than half the land being put on the open market is not being bought by farmers, but by speculators who have other incomes apart from agriculture.  The figures I am quoting were produced by the National Economic and Social Council and show that this type of person is buying the land.</P>
    <P>Far from it being a dispersion of wealth, the capital acquisition tax may be operating to concentrate wealth in the hands of people who have incomes outside agriculture and who can afford to buy the land at sales which are likely to be forced as a result of this tax.  To my mind that is not what any Minister envisaged as being the purpose of a capital acquisition tax.  In fact, it is the reverse.  I ask the Minister to look closely at these provisions and if he cannot agree with the revision of the thresholds being proposed, perhaps he would agree to the second part of the amendment which provides for the indexation of the allowances and bands in future so that this situation cannot arise by stealth.  If it does happen it will be because of a conscious act of the Oireachtas rather than by stealth as a result of inflation.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to double the threshold for the various tables, to extend the ranges and to apply indexation to all four tables.  I will leave table 1 for the moment and will come back to it.  In the case of tables, 2, 3 and 4, the House will be aware that I <Col N="1625" /> doubled the thresholds under those tables last year.  The application of increases at the same time to the ranges raises a number of problems.  It would appear from the statements made in the White Paper issued by the previous Government in relation to capital taxation that they did not envisage adjustments other than in the thresholds.  It is my understanding that in other countries also where changes are made, it is in the thresholds not in the ranges, because you can produce fairly grave distortions if you change the ranges as well and produce anomalies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just telling the Deputy that this is so.  I could go into detail on it but we would save time if he takes my word for it.  That is why it is not done in other countries and probably why it was not envisaged by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister write to me about it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The fact is that if one wants to change the ranges as well one must engage in a total review of the whole operation of the tax.  Almost certainly, because of the substantially reduced revenue from the tax by increasing the thresholds and ranges, one would be faced with the situation that one would have to increase the rate of tax if one were to aim at getting similar revenue from the tax not to mention any increase in it.</P>
      <P>In regard to table 1, as I said before, I took the view when that Bill was going through the House and when I was in the opposite benches that the threshold under table 1 was too high.  I quote what I said at that time from the Official Report Volume 286, column 1739:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, it is my contention that the upper limit whereby no tax is payable on a gift or inheritance by a child from a parent on a sum of up to £150,000&mdash;and where the same can apply to a number of members of the family, each receiving £150,000&mdash;is going too far, even allowing for the <Col N="1626" /> difficulties that arose under the death duty code.</P>
    <P>That is the reason why I did not increase the threshold for table 1 when I doubled the threshold for the other tables last year.  It seemed to me that the threshold was too high particularly when one recalls that, if the property concerned is agricultural property and if we are dealing with a farmer, the threshold automatically becomes £¼ million.  That applies to each of the children of the disponer and to the spouse.  It will be seen that we are talking about very big money.  Further exemption in that case does not seem to me to be justified at the moment.  The limits involved are way above anything available in other countries on any comparable tax.  As far as we are concerned, even by the standards of the admittedly greatly increased value of agricultural land, the limits involved are still very high.  There is a case for saying that, until the yield from the tax increases fairly substantially, the evidence suggests that the threshold, particularly in table 1, is too high.</P>
    <P>The contention that the threshold at £150,000 or, in the case of agricultural land, £250,000, was pitched too high is borne out by the statistics which are available.  Of the gifts and inheritances totalling 2,460 on which tax has been paid up to 31 December 1978, only 38 cases or 1.54 per cent of the total fall within table 1.  Of these, only one was a case where the beneficiary was a farmer. It is not surprising when the beneficiary concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a time lag between the date that the transfer takes place and when the duty is paid?  What year are we talking about?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking about cases in which it was paid prior to or up to 31 December 1978.  There is normally no great delay because there is substantial interest running on the claims outstanding. That encourages people to pay the duty very quickly.  Only one of the cases up to 31 December 1978 was a farmer.  Having regard to the fact that the threshold in a farmer's case is £250,000, it is not too surprising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1627" /> For all practical purposes this means that the beneficiaries in class 1 are exempted from capital acquisition tax so far.  It is not unreasonable to say that the beneficiaries in class 1 can be and should be exempted to make a greater contribution. Holding the threshold as it is at present should help in that objective.  I have no desire to have the capital acquisitions tax operate in any case, and particularly in the case of class 1 beneficiaries, farmers or otherwise, so as to produce hardship.  I must point out that the figure of £150,000, and £250,000 in the case of agricultural property, relates only to a single beneficiary and that less than 5 per cent of farmers have only one child. Where there is more than one child it goes up in the case of agricultural land by £250,000 for each child.  I should also like to point out that less than 5 per cent of farmers own more than 200 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is if he divides up the land among his children which most farmers would not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but less than 5 per cent of farmers own more than 200 acres and less than 15 per cent own more than 100 acres.  The result is that up to now the number of cases where there was any liability in the case of farmers is infinitesimal.  Whatever view one may take of it, the statistics do not bear out that capital acquisitions tax in the case of farmers coming in under table 1 is operating in any way to create hardship.  There is no evidence whatever to support this.  In fact the evidence suggests that it is not really operating at all in the case of farmers under table 1.  In these circumstances I cannot accept the case made in support of the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider between now and next year the possibility of introducing indexation of these allowances on a yearly basis in line with the consumer price index?  Will he add something about indexation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to digress too much but as the Deputy knows I introduced indexation in the case of capital gains tax because in that case <Col N="1628" /> one could, without indexation, be taxed on what was called a gain when in fact it was a loss.  That principle does not apply&mdash;speaking off the top of my head&mdash;to any other form of tax.  It does not apply in the case of capital acquisitions tax because whatever inflation there may be in the value of a property which one inherits or gets by way of a gift, its value is its market value.  The tax is based on that.  It is not based on an artificial value which is really a loss.</P>
      <P>There is a problem in that the tables must be fixed on a long-term basis.  A tax that is calculated by reference to lifetime acquisitions cannot have frequent changes in the tables and certainly not on an annual basis.  If we had such changes built in automatically with indexation the administrative problems for Revenue and the taxpayer alike would be substantial.  Any amendment of values for previous years would involve reassessment for subsequent years.  A more serious side effect would be the postponement of gifts and the proliferation of avoidance mechanisms such as revocable trusts and discretionary trusts to take advantage of anticipated future table changes.</P>
      <P>The stated merit of an acquisitions tax is the fact that it has regard to the circumstances of and the ability of the tax-payer to pay.  If regular indexation were introduced it would be necessary to index all previous benefits that are aggregated with current benefits to determine the value for tax.  The rates were reviewed last year and I suggest that the result of that review is that the current effective rates of tax are such that no adjustment is called for at the present time in line with indexation.</P>
      <P>I cannot undertake to the Deputy that I would introduce indexation next year.  I can undertake to consider it, as he requested me precisely, but in saying that I can undertake to do that I do not wish to mislead him in any way.  The odds are that having considered it I will still say no to indexation, but I am prepared to say that I will give consideration to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I think it unreasonable not to honour an undertaking given in 1975 when this tax was introduced that the <Col N="1629" /> thresholds would be increased to have regard to inflation.  We know that before this tax was introduced, or at least up to 1973, there were very severe death duties payable on the death of a parent when property passed to a child.  The death duties were abolished and that was a great relief.  It removed a considerable amount of worry from parents who did not know what would happen to their property on their death.  Deputy Bruton made a very strong case when he pointed out that, having regard to inflation, a modest farm of 70 acres attracts capital acquisitions tax.  The tendency is to regard 60 or 70 acres as necessary to form a viable unit and when farms of 70 to 100 acres are attracting large demands for capital acquisitions tax the Minister should look at the matter.  The Minister pointed to a case where a person might be transferring lots of property to several children.  That might be a situation the Minister could deal with.  It could be a different kind of situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not follow the Deputy.  What does he mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I mean that there is much more property passing and one is dealing with a much wealthier individual.  I am dealing with a person with 70 acres of land, or the equivalent in other properties, and I am saying that such a person is not very wealthy according to present standards.  On that property passing to a spouse or a child, it is unreasonable that it should attract capital acquisitions tax.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the thresholds.  Deputy Bruton has put forward a very strong and well-researched case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to make.  In response to what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said, I think it would be very difficult to convince most people that somebody getting a gift or inheritance worth more than £250,000 was receiving a modest gift or inheritance. In the case of agricultural land there is no capital acquisitions tax paid up to that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, in regard to the point made <Col N="1630" /> by the Deputy about an undertaking given by the Government of which he was a member to review the thresholds, I think what he was referring to was a statement contained in a White Paper on Capital Taxation laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the previous Government in February 1974. Paragraph 122 stated:</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that in times of inflation capital taxes may over time be taking a bite of capital which represents an increase in nominal values as distinct from a real increase in asset values.  To cope with this problem the thresholds set for the new capital taxes would need to be reviewed at regular intervals.  Such a review would, however, be less necessary in the case of the threshold for liability to capital acquisitions tax by the immediate family in view of the high exemption figure proposed.</P>
    <P>I reviewed the thresholds last year. Speaking from recollection, I think it true to say that the thresholds were not reviewed after the introduction of capital acquisitions tax until last year.  I doubled the thresholds except in the case of Table 1, but it is significant that the White Paper issued by the previous Government said that the likelihood was that a review in that case would be less necessary because of the high exemption figure proposed.  As I have pointed out, when the Bill was going through I said I thought the thresholds for Table 1 were too high.  I doubled the other thresholds and, as I have already indicated to the House, I still think that the thresholds for Table 1 at £150,000 or £250,000 in the case of agricultural property do not merit review or adjustment upwards at this time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 30, Part V, before section 50, to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  The powers conferred by section 15 of the Finance Act, 1966, to collect an excise duty on Irish wine shall not be used to collect a levy or duty on any agricultural product other than wine.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Regulations, 1979, made under section 15 of the Finance Act, 1966, are hereby annulled.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to annul the 2 per cent levy.  As a number of other Deputies wish to contribute to the discussion on this amendment I do not propose to speak at length.  I just want to point out that first, the levy was unnecessary because the same revenue could have been raised without any of the aggravation if the Minister had chosen not to restore the refund in relation to value-added tax.  None of the hardship would have been caused and the same amount of money would have been collected.  So, we are not arguing about whether agriculture should pay its share but merely how a given sum of money should be raised.  By choosing to <Col N="1632" /> raise it by means of a levy the Minister has brought about a number of consequences. One is, as I think will be demonstrated later in the debate in respect of certain lines of agricultural production, that the profit already very marginal will be almost entirely eliminated.  Examples of this are summer fattening and winter fattening of beef. Profit margins here are very low and the level of capitalisation or borrowing required to sustain them is quite high.  The danger of discouraging beef production by the levy is that the factories which rely for the creation of employment on the slaughtering of beef will not have an adequate supply of cattle.  Already our slaughtering plants are working at about half capacity.  The effect of the levy could easily be further to jeopardise employment in the meat industry.  We already know this is under threat even without the levy.  I do not claim that redundancies which take place in the meat industry are solely due to anticipation of the levy but it certainly aggravates the situation by making beef production less profitable and thereby reducing the input to these factories.</P>
    <P>Secondly, levy is unfair because it is proposed to raise it whether farmers are making a profit or not.  For instance, if cattle prices fall over the summer a farmer who buys cattle in the spring and sells in the autumn is selling cattle at the end of the season, having grazed them and provided them with feed and so on, at a lower price than that for which he bought them and therefore obviously making a loss.  But he will still pay the 2 per cent levy having made a loss.  That is not a fair form of taxation for anybody. Taxation should be based on taking a share of a real profit, not taking something from people who have already had a loss.  That situation is a possibility within the terms of the levy.</P>
    <P>My third and final point is that the levy in the case of meat can, and I believe will have the effect at some times of the year of increasing the cost of living for the consumer.  It was certainly not intended to do this; it was introduced as a tax on farmers.  The farmers and those who represent them may argue that it was an unfair way of taxing them but nobody disputes that it was intended <Col N="1633" /> to be paid by farmers, not consumers.  In the case of meat it is possible at some times, depending on the supply and demand situation, that it will be paid by consumers not farmers.  If demand for meat exceeds supply and there is pressure to obtain meat the Department have no way of preventing the cost of the levy being passed on to the consumer. In that situation the consumers' demand for meat exceeds the suppliers' desire to sell and in that sort of fluid situation clearly the levy would be passed on.</P>
    <P>The only way in which one could prevent that would be by fixing consumer prices.  That is possible in the case of milk.  We already have a maximum price order for milk and milk products which makes it possible to prevent the levy being passed on to the consumer in the case of milk and any other products subject to a maximum price order at retail level.  That is not possible with meat because there is no maximum retail price order for meat and it would be impossible to introduce one even if the Minister wanted to do so in order to prevent the levy being paid by the consumer because there are so many different types of cuts of meat and different qualities that one could not fix fair prices.  If one fixed an across-the-board price per pound for meat it would be obviously unfair because certain parts of an animal are worth more than others.  Rump steak, for instance, is obviously worth more than meat from the front legs of an animal.  A uniform price per pound, therefore, would not apply fairly to both good and bad cuts.  Even for rump steak, say, there can be such variety in the quality of the meat, depending on how well it has been hung, that one could not fix a uniform price for it.  I believe it is impossible to fix a retail price for meat because of these difficulties.  I know this because the possibility was brought before me when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and it was ruled out for that reason.  It was impossible although it might have been desirable.</P>
    <P>If, therefore, a situation arises where demand for meat exceeds supply there is no way by which the Government can prevent the 2 per cent levy being passed <Col N="1634" /> on to the consumer.  There will be times in the year when that will happen; it may not happen all the time.  Certainly, it will not happen with a glut of cattle on the market.  At such a time the farmer will be paying the levy but where there is a scarcity&mdash;and there seems to be a prospect of a scarcity&mdash;the levy will undoubtedly, by operation of a normal law of supply and demand, be paid by the consumer, not the farmer.  That is not what was intended but the fact that it is likely to happen indicates how ill-conceived this taxation was.  It proves the case that some other means should have been found to tax the farming community if they were to be taxed.</P>
    <P>I have already recorded my views on how farmers should be taxed.  I do not think I should go into it in depth now but I have done so and I am quite prepared to do so again.  I certainly do not believe that this 2 per cent levy is a fair or just means of taxing farmers or anybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment the case for which was so ably made by Deputy Bruton.  I cannot understand why the Minister took this particular course.  Today the Minister has shown, whether it was to impress PAYE workers or not I do not know, that he is prepared to bring down a big stick on the farmers and make them pay the 2 per cent levy which aggravated not only the farmers but practically every section in the community.  The Minister had available the means and the way; by withholding VAT, he would receive approximately the same amount of money. I would see some sense in it, if it were a permanent fixture, but the Minister stated today that it will carry on until 31 December, 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has revenue commissioners in the airports, he has them on the bogs, he has them in the butchers' shops, he has them in the meat factories. Why should he go to such trouble for a temporary measure to obtain money, when a simple alternative was available. All his revenue commissioners had to do was to deduct VAT.  I cannot understand why he did not do this.  I am prepared to accept that the Minister, in some of his statements said to the PAYE <Col N="1635" /> people &ldquo;I shall make the farmers pay&rdquo;.  I do not know what benefit the Minister will receive from this type of attitude.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this 2 per cent levy must be described as the most irresponsible piece of legislation ever put through the House to extract money from any sector of the Community. Firstly, it bears no relation whatsoever to the farmer's ability to pay; secondly, it will undermine the confidence of those engaged in agriculture; thirdly, and most importantly, it strikes at the very core of our economy.  It is a penalising tax.</P>
    <P>The worst feature of the 2 per cent levy is that it is seeking to extract money from 55 per cent of our farmers who have under 50 acres of land.  Practically 90 per cent of those holdings are uneconomic, but, nevertheless, owners will be asked to pay somewhere in the region of £5 to £8 a week, depending on the lines of production.  I have one estate in my constituency, the Macamore Estate, with 40,000 acres, at a value of over £1 an acre for certain sections of it, and these people will have to pay somewhere in the region of £500 to £600 rates as well.  Furthermore, these taxes are chargeable irrespective of the family circumstances. Many small farmers will have to pay the tax that a PAYE man with a family, with comparable income would not pay, if PAYE were under the same conditions.</P>
    <P>This levy must be described as an attack on the intensive producer.  Though it is a short-term measure, it will, in the long-term, damage our national economy.  During the Minister's speech at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis he took the levy off pigs and off sheep&mdash;he had no other option.  He would have wiped these people out overnight, and knew that perfectly well.</P>
    <P>With regard to milk production, the 2 per cent levy represents approximately 6 per cent of the profit on this.  The value of the increased milk production is highlighted by the fact that an average gallon of milk extra going into processed cheese can result in 20 to 25 extra jobs, and this does not include haulage or packaging.  Our cow herds are of extreme importance.  It should be the good intention of any Government to try to <Col N="1636" /> increase these.  These people work a seven-day week&mdash;and we hear people talking in terms of a 45-hour week, while the majority of those people work a 75 hour week, on family farms in particular&mdash;and the Minister wants 6 per cent of their profit.  They may also have to pay a co-responsibility levy introduced by EEC, at what level we do not know.  This levy has weakened the hands of our Minister for Agriculture when he goes to the tables of Europe to negotiate prices for the Irish farmers, as far as milk is concerned.  How can he argue around those tables that a further levy, which is known as the co-responsibility levy to clear off surpluses, will not be enforced as well?  There is no doubt about it, this levy has a damaging effect on milk production.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the area where I believe the levy will do greatest damage, that is, in beef production.  I went to great trouble to try to get accurate figures.  It is not easy to get accurate figures on beef production because there are different systems, but I am prepared to put on the records of this House that the levy will account for from 12 per cent to 20 per cent of the actual profit on beef production.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention to an article last week in <i>The Farmers Journal</i> by, I presume, an experienced man by the name of John Shirley.  He wrote that 2 per cent for cattle sold since 1 May represents 100 per cent of the actual profit.  I went carefully into the figures and am not prepared to accept that, even last year, when people did not make provision for the 2 per cent levy, it would cost them up to 100 per cent.  I am prepared to state that it will take 12 per cent to 20 per cent of the profit from beef production.</P>
    <P>We have heard the Minister for Agriculture speak, at length, on the need to increase beef production.  If the Minister for Finance believes that 12 per cent of the profit on beef should go to the Exchequer, irrespective of a man's income, then he is really on the wrong track.  The Minister has stated on numerous occasions that the butchers have to pay this 2 per cent levy.  I understand he has asked the Revenue Commissioners to have this properly <Col N="1637" /> documented and they have failed.  There is no way, that I can see, whereby the Revenue Commissioners can make farmers pay this 2 per cent levy, as far as the butchers are concerned.  The majority of butchers, particularly in the provincial towns, own land; they buy in store heifers and finish them off.  Are they going to pay the 2 per cent?  They are, in my eye.  They will charge this to consumers.  The Revenue Commissioners simply cannot police this scheme to guarantee that the farmers pay it. There is no doubt in my mind that the consumers will pay.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have already been with some of those small people who kill privately for freezers.  That is not right.  They have been ordered to collect the 2 per cent levy.  People who kill a small number of beasts on behalf of freezer owners have been put in a difficult position and have been told to collect the 2 per cent levy. They do not buy the cattle but kill them on behalf of, say, nine or ten people. Many people in the city have freezers and arrange to have an animal killed for them.  It would be impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to collect the revenue in that situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister wants to collect £10 on a beast sold in the mart for £500.  Before it can be sold there must be a 30-day test costing approximately £4 and the charges for commission and haulage come to £6.  It now costs £20 in all to sell a fat beast in any mart and of that amount the Government are responsible for approximately £14.</P>
    <P>Both the previous Minister for Agriculture and the present Minister have tried to encourage the growing of cereals because it is necessary when there is a shortage to import them.  A cereal, perhaps barley, is sold to the merchant who charges 2 per cent; it is compounded and sold back to the farmer and a further 2 per cent is charged.  Milk is produced for manufacturing purposes and there is a further 2 per cent; the milk is processed into milk powder and is used to feed calves and another 2 per cent is charged.</P>
    <P>In June, 1974, as reported in Volume 274, columns 558-9 of the Official Report, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1638" /> Farmers who are not allowed to use the notional basis for this or for any other reason will be in the same position as ordinary businessmen and, therefore, have a strong case to make to be given some allowance because a large proportion of their output is exported. If they are to be treated in the same way as businessmen and industry generally some method will have to be found for actually treating them the same way, having regard to the considerable value of the export tax reliefs relating to industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister made that statement only five years ago and today he is making all kinds of arrangements to damage seriously our agricultural exports. How could a man change his views so radically in such a short period?  Any Government must seriously consider our agricultural exports, now worth approximately £1,000 million.  Whatever policies or systems are devised must increase that output.  Every 1 per cent increase in agricultural output, almost all of which will be exported, means an increase of £16 million in value of exports. With the proper policies agricultural output could be increased by between 5 per cent and 7 per cent.  I accuse the Minister of short-term action which has damaged our agricultural exports and broken the confidence of farmers.</P>

      <P>The Imposition of Duties Act of 1957 does not provide for the making of the regulations in respect of any duties imposed by order under that Act.  However, section 1 (h) of the Act permits the Government by order to</P>
      <P>apply (with or without modification) to or in respect of any duty imposed or varied under this section any statutory provision regulating the collection of or imposing penalties in relation to duties of the class to which the duty belongs;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly paragraph 11 of the Imposition of Duties (No. 239) (Agricultural Produce) (Cattle and Milk) Order, 1979, applied the provisions of section 15 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1966, suitably modified, to the duties imposed by that order and thereby authorised the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations for securing and collecting the duty.  The commissioners, by virtue of that authority, have made the Agricultural Produce (Cattle and Milk) Regulations, 1979.  Subsection (1) of this proposed new section would, if passed, deprive the commissioners of the power to make regulations under section 15 (2) (a) of the Finance Act, 1966, in respect of cereals and sugar beet, where the levy does not apply until 1 August 1979 and, while not technically invalidating existing regulations in respect of cattle and milk, would seriously prejudice their implementation. Similar power to make regulations does not seem to be available under excise law otherwise.  If subsection (2) were passed it would not only throw doubt on the validity of anything done under the regulations prior to the passing of the Finance Bill but would also <Col N="1640" /> make the collection of the duty virtually impossible since the entire mechanics of collection and accounting are embodied in the regulation and the bulk of the first payments would not be due until the last day of June.  For that reason the amendment is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Apart from the technical aspects, a few points have been raised on which I should like to comment.  One of the basic difficulties faced by Deputies Bruton and D'Arcy in dealing with this matter was that they were trying to make two cases at the one time and they made them with some degree of conviction.  Unfortunately the cases are to a great extent contradictory because the House will recall the efforts they made to tell us how much the imposition of the levy would be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>At some times of the year in respect of meat only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>They said there was no way the farmer would pay it in respect of meat and in particular that the butcher would not pay it and, therefore, the consumer would have to pay. Deputy Bruton qualified this and said it would happen in times of scarcity in supply anyway, whatever about in times of plentiful supply of meat.  Then they both went on to tell us how unfair this levy was to the farmers.  Indeed Deputy D'Arcy went on to quote figures &mdash;which he did not explain&mdash;to the effect that it would operate as taking between 12 and 20 per cent from a farmer's profits on cattle.  He has explained how the profits are calculated.  I do not know whether he is imputing a wage for the farmer in calculating the profit.  If he is, is he implying that that wage should not be taxed?</P>
      <P>In any event how can Deputy D'Arcy accuse me of taking up to 20 per cent of the farmer's profit on his cattle and, at the same time, tell us that this levy is being paid by the consumer and is not being paid by the butcher or the farmer? He cannot have it both ways.  The fact is that if the farmer is not paying the levy on cattle, then I am afraid it is because the butchers in some cases have allowed themselves to be bamboozled a little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> The fact is that exporters and meat factories are operating side by side with butchers in cattle marts.  In some cases they are competing with butchers for the same animals and the levy is being paid in respect of their transactions.  If the levy is not being paid, or at least if butchers say they cannot operate this while competing with people who are operating it and in respect of whom the levy is being collected, then some explanation is required as to why, of two people bidding against each other for the same animal in the mart, we should find that one of them can operate the levy and the other cannot.</P>
    <P>The truth of the matter is that there is a very grave scarcity of animals which is causing difficulty of supply and of course an increase in the price under the normal law of supply and demand.  But that scarcity applies whether one is bidding on behalf of a meat factory or an exporter or a butcher.  The same problem arises.  The reasons for the scarcity are reasonably well known.  Partly they relate to the weather earlier this year and partly they relate back some years to what happened and was allowed to happen to our national herd.  But I will not go into that.  The fact is that there is a scarcity of animals at the moment, that that scarcity is having a certain economic effect which applies to everybody who is trying to purchase.  To suggest on the one hand that I am crucifying farmers who are selling cattle and, at the same time, that they are not paying the levy just does not stand up. The Deputies opposite had better make up their minds as to which particular line they want to take because whichever one they are going to take can be pursued, but if they are going to take both they are only destroying any degree of credibility they might have.  Nobody could take seriously that kind of argument.</P>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that the effect of this amendment, as I have indicated, would be in practice to annul the levy, certainly as regards the operation in relation to 1 August, and to create very grave difficulty in respect of the levy operating from 1 May last.  Let us have no doubts about this.  If that were to happen the consequences would <Col N="1642" /> be simply to leave the rest of the taxpayers paying the money that should be paid under the levy.  I do not know if that if what Fine Gael are advocating.  If it is, they should make it clear.  If they are not advocating that and if they are suggesting that in effect the levy should be abolished and that the money should be collected in another way then they should make that clear.</P>

      <P>We were told from all sides, including that side of the House, that the Government were being dictated to and that we had caved in and climbed down.  I want to make it clear that we said what was going to happen; an option was given and it was not exercised and what we said would happen happened. In my view, if we had not imposed the levy from 1 May in the circumstances that arose, then the Government would justifiably have been accused of climbing down, of caving in, of surrendering.  But the fact is that we did not and I want Deputies opposite not to gloss over what actually happened when they talk glibly about collecting the money through the value added tax system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerably more became involved in this matter than the actual amount of money, important though that was.  That was not so obvious to some people earlier but it is obvious to them now.  It was not possible and would not have been credible to abandon the levy from 1 May and continue with the value-added tax arrangement for the reason I set out <Col N="1644" /> earlier.  It is one of considerable importance as far as any Government here is concerned and I do not think the Deputies opposite are wise to support even by implication the kind of threats that were being made at that time.  I know that was not their intention but to say that instead of putting on the levy we should have used the value-added tax system is saying, by implication, that we should surrender to those who said that under no circumstances would the levy be imposed.</P>

That situation was different from when it was announced in the budget in a number of ways but, in particular, in the sense that at that stage the various threats had been made that the Government, in effect, would not be allowed put on the levy.  That is what I am talking about and if the Deputies opposite are saying that I should not have put it on 1 May and should instead have used the value-added tax system, they are, by implication though not intentionally, supporting that.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is not challenging a vote; more of the bluff.  The amendment is unacceptable for the reasons I gave.  It calls, in effect, for making completely unworkable the 2 per cent levy and it does not propose how it should be replaced.  The arguments put for it did not have any regard to the circumstances in which it was imposed. The levy is operating as it was intended to operate and for the reasons which were outlined at the time.  I do not believe it is reasonable for people to say that the levy is damaging agriculture. Any tax can be described as a disincentive but the basic fact is that this is a contribution this year only by the agricultural community to a small part of the cost of the educational, advisory and research services which cost approximately £31,500,000.  That is the amount that will be paid by the general taxpayer this year while the agricultural contribution will amount to about £12,000,000 towards that cost.  I do not think that is unreasonable and, as the House is aware, it will come to an end at the end of this year when a more acceptable system is substituted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief because it is necessary for us to have a vote on this issue.  I want to put a simple question to the Minister.  A farmer who is also a businessman and spends £30,000 on capital expenditure on his farm must now pay the 2 per cent levy.  He must also repay the £30,000 to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  I should like to know why he is in the disadvantageous position in relation to his business because if he spent £30,000 on his business he could charge it against tax in the succeeding six years but, as far as his farming situation is concerned, he can charge 30 per cent, or roughly £10,000.  That is an unfair situation for <Col N="1647" /> the farming community and it cannot be defended by anybody.  Such a farmer must repay the principal and interest, the 2 per cent levy, income tax and rates. This is wrong and should not be allowed to proceed.  We must register our disapproval about this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is reminiscent of the worst days of landlordism when a person who erected two piers to hang a gate on had his rent increased by the landlord.  It reminds me of a period in the 1930s when we had the economic war and the small farmers were reduced to paupers.  In my county 70 per cent of the farming population have holdings under £20 valuation and they are now being dragged into a tax net.  Many of them will have to pay income tax and a 2 per cent levy on their milk sales.  In one co-op in my county that will amount to £600,000.  We should add to that the levy which will be put on cattle at marts, a reduction of about £10 per beast.  In <Col N="1648" /> my county more than £1 million will be taken out of the farmers' pockets.  It cannot be said that we should light bonfires welcoming this measure, this unjust, cumulative tax.  The resource and brucellosis taxes are being put on the dairy farmer.  Dairy farmers in my county go in for mixed farming and they must now carry an unbearable load.  I am surprised that the Minister for Agriculture has not come here with the same vigour he did on the Bill dealing with family planning. I would love if the Taoiseach would give him and some of the Deputies who are farmers in rural Ireland absolution to vote against this measure.  However, I do not expect that we will have the same type of spiritual guidance in this connection. We do not welcome this and must oppose it.  I am disappointed that some of those who were very vocal when we introduced a tax on farmers are now silent and slumbering.  The same vigour is not there.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann gravely concerned about the serious economic mismanagement of the country by the Government declares that this House and the people of Ireland have no confidence in the Government.</P>
      <P>I see an amendment by a member of the Government seeking to delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;expresses satisfaction at the Government's management of the economy&rdquo;. We decided to table this motion in order to give parliamentary expression to the will, as we have found it, of the Irish people.  One of the things the local and European election campaign have clearly demonstrated is that a majority of our people have no confidence in the competence or the willingness of the Government to handle our economy and many other aspects of our national life.  Indeed, I can say honestly that in my 19 years in public life I have not met in election canvassing such a feeling not only of anger and frustration against a Government but worse, and more serious, a feeling approaching despair among large sections of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are in despair mainly because they realise that because they gave Fianna Fáil a majority of 20 in the Dáil in 1977, under our democratic procedures, though they can and will register their feelings forcefully on 7 June in the European and local elections, they will not have an opportunity to remove this Government from office in the next two and a half to three years.  Any Member <Col N="1651" /> of the House who has been canvassing could not but realise that that would be the wish today of the majority of the electors.</P>
    <P>I know that this motion of no confidence, because of the 20-seat majority Fianna Fáil have, probably will not be passed here tomorrow night.  It is somewhat regrettable that the new-found selective exercise of conscience within Fianna Fáil in relation to voting will not find expression here tomorrow night. Although every Deputy on that side of the House, as on this side, knows in his heart of hearts that this Government have mismanaged seriously our national affairs, they will not give expression to that feeling by voting for this motion.</P>
    <P>In regard to this motion which expresses no confidence in the Government's ability to handle our economy, there is an obligation on a Deputy moving such a motion to justify that.  I intend to do so by covering five areas that are directly related to the economy.  They are employment, economic growth, inflation, our taxation code and industrial relations.  I will prove, not by my figures but by the Government's own figures or by impartial figures that are published on behalf of the State, that in each of those areas not only has no progress been made by the present Government over the last two years but in each and every one of those areas the situation has deteriorated seriously and the Government have undermined seriously our people's faith in parliamentary democracy.  They have done so not particularly because of their gross incompetence but because of their gross incompetence combined with their gross dishonesty.  That is fully apparent to our people at this stage.</P>
    <P>If we take the area of employment and compare the situation that Fianna Fáil inherited from the previous Government in June 1977, we will find that on that date the number of registered unemployed in this country was 108,000 and approximately 5,000 to 6,000 people were emigrating at that time.  It is proper that I say that.  The last published figure for people registered as unemployed was 103,000 and the most <Col N="1652" /> conservative estimate of emigration is 11,000 although I believe that it is far in excess of that.  Therefore, if you add the 108,000 to the 6,000 who are emigrating at that time, that is 114,000 people who could not find employment in their own country.  If we add 103,000 to the 11,000 conservative figure for emigration we find that, despite all the propaganda from the various Ministers over the last two years, the situation has not improved one iota as far as employment is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is only fair to say that in 1973-1974 the previous Government had to face one of the most severe recessions known to the western world since the 1930s. During that recession, which was world-wide and which was felt and felt badly by much stronger economies than our own, unemployment figures went up to 120,000 and inflation went to 20 per cent plus.  It is also fair and objective to say that the budget of 1977 which was introduced by the previous administration had taken effective measures to stimulate growth in our economy, to try to introduce some element of social justice into our national life and to deal with the question of inflation.  In their first year in office the present Government enjoyed many of the beneficial effects of that 1977 budget.  Fianna Fáil came to office on a wave of glittering promises that bore no relationship to the real economic and social problems facing this country.  The previous administration knew when the election would be and they could, had they so wished, have matched those promises and implemented policies that would have made the results of that election far more favourable for them.</P>
    <P>However, there is this fundamental difference which the Irish people must realise, that if Fianna Fáil are left with two choices, political expediency for their own party and Irish national interests, Fianna Fáil's political advantage and expediency will win every time.  It won the last election for them, but the cost of winning that election to Irish national interests, to Irish men, women and children is now being seen throughout this land.  Their reliance on the private sector has failed and to some extent they have admitted that it has <Col N="1653" /> failed by agreeing in one of the provisions of the national understanding that they would set up what they described as a public enterprise agency.  That, of course, is another name for a State development corporation.  For political reasons they did not choose to give it the same name.  I also doubt whether they will give it the same criteria as we would or whether it would have the same terms of reference that we had in mind in setting-up a State development corporation, but it was, nonetheless, a clear and open admission that their reliance on the private sector to provide employment had failed.</P>
    <P>Also, by disbanding the youth employment agency they acknowledged publicly that by their approach this Government had not provided and could not provide employment for our youth. The result is as I have already said as far as employment in this country is concerned. There is not one person less registered as unemployed either for benefit or assistance, and when you take into consideration the number who have lost all hope of obtaining employment in this country under this Government and have left the country, it is clear that as far as employment is concerned, the Government have failed.</P>
    <P>Another great hope for our economic advance was economic growth.  We had to sit here week after week, month after month, listening to Fianna Fáil's spokesmen, and particularly the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Deputy O'Donoghue, telling us about economic growth and how it would be achieved.  That, of course, would be linked with inflation in this year not exceeding 5 per cent and the trade unions, would naturally, have to accept no more than 5 per cent of an increase in any agreement that was reached on that front.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the record of economic growth after the lectures, both in the manifesto and since the manifesto, that we have had from the Fianna Fáil Party. Economic growth in 1977 was 5 per cent.  That 5 per cent was achieved coming out of what I have already described as one of the worst recessions the world has known, and it was achieved by virtue of the budget of 1977.  If we go to the <Col N="1654" /> year 1978 and the Fianna Fáil budget, which did pump money into our economy, which did stimulate growth somewhat, though not wisely, we get a figure at the end of that year of 5½ per cent growth.  If we consider the present year it is predicted almost unanimously by the Central Bank, the OECD and other impartial observers on economies in general, that the most we can expect or hope for is a growth rate of somewhere between 3 per cent and 4 per cent.  Therefore their performance in that area has almost halved what was being achieved when they assumed office in 1977.  That is another proven example of the so-called progress and their incompetence as far as the running of our economy is concerned.  As far as Fianna Fáil are concerned economic growth is an end in itself.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose even for a moment that the flights of fancy of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and other Ministers of a 7 per cent growth were true, what would that mean to the majority of our people?  For instance, what would it mean to the majority of our people seeking employment?  What would it mean to social welfare recipients who are lower paid because the Government have stated openly and unshamedly that as far as social development is concerned that must wait?  Therefore, economic growth and talking in terms of percentages of economic growth have very little relevance to the vast majority of our people and bear no relationship at all to the misery being experienced by tens of thousands of our citizens.  It is time Fianna Fáil woke up to one simple fact about Irish life: the poor cannot wait; over 20 per cent of them are below the poverty line and that percentage under this Government is rapidly increasing.</P>
    <P>If there is any possibility of getting a consensus for progress within this country it can be got only on the basis that economic and social development go hand in hand and that one is but a means of achieving the other.  That is not the philosophy of Fianna Fáil.  They have actively pursued policies benefiting a small, privileged, rich section of our community.  They have used the tax <Col N="1655" /> code to do so.  They have used the building industry to do so.  They have used every mechanism at their disposal to pay back the people who financed their success in 1977.  I have met many people over the last few weeks who have told me that they voted for Fianna Fáil in June 1977 and also that never have they regretted such an action so much. They were only too eager to be given an opportunity to rectify what they considered to be a grave mistake.  They cannot do so on this occasion but at least we in this party will air their sense of grievance, of anger, of frustration, in this House, using this motion as the appropriate vehicle.</P>
    <P>Our economic growth as predicted is a failure also.  I might add that the 3 per cent to 4 per cent growth rate, which is the maximum predicted by the Central Bank, the OECD and others, does not take into consideration the disastrous effects of the postal strike which has been allowed by this Government to continue for 14 weeks.  The damage that is doing to our economy, our social life, our international image is apparently of no concern to this Government.  In my opinion they have picked the Post Office workers to beat them into submission in order to try to frighten off anybody else in the public sector from submitting any claim.  I know Post Office workers; I have had a long association with them; they have never had a national strike before.  They are one of the most responsible bodies of people one could meet.  I say to the Government and the Minister that if they are planning to beat these people into the ground, to starve them, their wives and children into submission as an example to other trade unionists, they are backing the wrong horse.  I have met them and they will not be crushed. They will be reasonable, as they have proved.  They have gone on national television and said they were prepared to compromise.  I say, for decency sake, for Ireland's sake, at least let the Minister meet the people whom he employs, no more.  That gesture alone could be sufficient to bring about a settlement of this strike.  I say to the Minister: for God's sake do so because the damage this strike is inflicting on our economy will <Col N="1656" /> not be realised until some time in the future.  If this strike is allowed to continue any longer, or indeed even at this point in time, the forecasted growth figure of 3 per cent to 4 per cent will prove to have been a very optimistic figure indeed.</P>
    <P>The other area I should like to deal with is that of prices.  We heard a lot about prices from Fianna Fáil in their manifesto and again from the Minister for Economic Planning and Development. We sat here and had lectures on economics from him week after week.  In fact he was like a child who had been given catalogues of very expensive, delicate toys.  It was as if he had read all the catalogues, never for one moment imagining that he would ever own one of them.  Suddenly, bang, there was one right into his lap but all he knew about it is what he had read in the catalogue.  He knows the theory.  He will stand up here evening after evening lecturing us all &mdash;Members of the House, the press gallery and those people in the public gallery&mdash;on the theory.  God bless us, did ever a man know so little about practice? Did ever a country pay such a price for a bit of personal patronage by the Taoiseach in appointing a man with so little experience?</P>
    <P>Let us look at the question of prices. The official figure published for inflation in the period May 1977 to May 1978 was of an increase of 6 per cent.  That was what the present Government inherited; that was another achievement of the 1977 budget.  What is the figure today?  Today prices have risen by somewhere between 13 per cent and 15 per cent.  That is not taking into consideration some figures being held in abeyance.  As far as the increase in the price of oil is concerned, at the maximum, it would account for 2 per cent of that increase.  Again the Central Bank&mdash;not recognised as a radical body, or as one that makes wild, unsubstantiated statements&mdash;said that over half of the inflation increase was due to food price increases.  That, to a large extent, is due to the removal of the food subsidies. Increases in the price of foods do not affect me a lot.  If the price of food is increased by a few pence my children will not go hungry.  They will still get the <Col N="1657" /> same amount of milk, bread and the same dinner, but there are a lot of children who will be hungry.</P>
    <P>I would like to read what the achievement of the Government has been in the area of prices.  Between May 1977 and May 1978 food prices increased by 6 per cent.  That is the official figure and it now stands at between 13 per cent to 15 per cent.  This will go up because we still have applications from the ESB for very substantial increases and it has been announced, but not confirmed by the Government until after the election, that there will be CIE increases.  We have had an increase of 11p on petrol and a clear indication by the Minister that there will be a further increase which will go right through the economy.</P>
    <P>The 2 per cent farm levy which will probably be passed on to the meat trade will involve an increase of 10 per cent in the price of meat.  Before that silly act, meat was a luxury for many families who were very fortunate if they could have meat once a week.  The Government are taking on the butchers instead of the farmers because they think they are easier political pickings.  This will result in the families who can afford meat once a week having to do without it on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I would like to read some of the increases which the Government's brilliant strategy, outlined in their manifesto, has resulted in.  Bread has gone up 7p a loaf, an increase of 31 per cent; butter by 16p, an increase of 30 per cent; cheese, 22p a pound, a 28 per cent increase; beef, before the levy, 27½p a pound, an increase of 29 per cent; lamb by 42½p a pound, an increase of 48 per cent; potatoes 42½p a stone, an increase of 39 per cent; and milk 3½p a pint, an increase of 44 per cent.  There are many items on that list which are the only things some members of our Christian society can look forward to day after day, week after week.  Many of those people can only look forward to bread, butter, potatoes and milk.</P>
    <P>As far as increases in food are concerned, it has been clearly established that as far as social welfare recipients, old age pensioners, deserted wives, widows, the lower paid and people with large families, are concerned food constitutes <Col N="1658" /> 40 per cent of their total available expenditure.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the postal strike.  Let us look at the Government's achievement on strikes and compare it with promises.  One of the things the Government singled out in their manifesto was the Post Office and telecommunications.  One is reasonably entitled to assume that they knew there were long-standing problems there under successive Governments and that this area needed quick, delicate and skillful handling.  What is the record of the Government in regard to strikes in general?</P>
    <P>In 1977 the number of man-days lost on strikes was 459,000, in 1978 it was 450,000 and in 1979, up to the end of May, five months through the year, the figure is 400,000.  The vast majority of the man-hours lost in that period is in the public sector.  The Government's employees make up the vast majority of that figure.  If the performance of the Government in industrial relations had not had such serious consequences for many people, it would be laughable.</P>
    <P>We have only to compare the performance of the Minister for Labour when he was on those benches, who not only had a solution for all the current industrial problems but was able to anticipate problems and solve them.  Has there ever in any Government been such a failure? His first contribution since he assumed office was to say that he could not and would not intervene in strikes. That was the general principle he adopted when he assumed office.  His second emergence from the bunker he has gone into over the last few months, when he broke his vow of political silence, was to make some vague threat of legislation against the trade union movement.  He is silly enough and the Government are silly enough to try legislation in an area where one cannot successfully legislate.  This is an area, however, where agreement is possible, if it is clearly demonstrated that there is a concern for social justice at the top, if there is a willingness to have equity in our society, if there is political will within the Government, to use the many instruments available to them to create social justice and equity in our society.  But <Col N="1659" /> they are not there.  I believe that in their absence, agreement will be very difficult to obtain.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in their manifesto sowed the seeds at the highest level of greed, self-interest and sectional interest, and they are now stumbling from one crisis to another from the effects of the seed they sowed.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about the tax code.  When the Government came into office in June 1977 they had a tax code in which some start had been made to try to restructure it to ensure that all sections would be brought within its net and would contribute according to their ability.  The foundation was there.  I am not saying that farmer taxation, tax paid by the unemployed and other sections of the community, or even the taxation code, were perfect, because major restructuring was needed, but a start had been made. Fianna Fáil had been in office for 16 years and had not made a start.  The last administration made a start.  Fine Gael lost a number of seats because they had the courage and the sense of moral responsibility towards the nation as a whole to introduce farmer taxation.  That cost them dearly in terms of seats but it did not cost them what it is costing Fianna Fáil in terms of credibility and political integrity.  Fianna Fáil have neither. Fianna Fáil inherited a wealth tax, farmer taxation and capital gains tax. Almost immediately they came into office they abolished the wealth tax, changed the capital gains tax to make it 70 per cent ineffective, and the 2 per cent levy on farmers exposed their thinking as far as social justice was concerned. There was not the slightest element or consideration of social justice in that 2 per cent levy and this party opposed it for that reason.  We believe in social justice.  We are not and will not be selective about its implementation or its application.  A farmer's income and his ability to pay the 2 per cent levy was not taken into consideration.  It was a means of getting money from the farming community. If some of these farmers were in the PAYE sector they would not be <Col N="1660" /> liable for income tax because their incomes would not be high enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance showed determination as far as the budget, the 2 per cent levy and the farmers were concerned. Even at this moment we do not know precisely if we have the budget that was introduced.  There is still the possibility of further negotiations on many aspects of that budget.  The Minister for Finance showed the sense of purpose, determination, decision and decisiveness of a well-heeled client in a Paris hat shop as far as the PAYE taxpayer was concerned.  His answer to these people was to increase their contribution to the Exchequer by over £200 million and he gave them back £26 million in the budget, and offered an additional sum as one of the terms of acceptance of the national understanding.</P>
    <P>How many man-hours are being lost by people queuing for petrol? It is not unusual now to see a queue for petrol of half-a-mile or a quarter of a mile, often starting at 11 o'clock the night before. We accept that there are outside factors but for six weeks the Government were told by Deputies on these benches that there was an oil crisis.  We asked them to do something about it, to tell the people what the situation was.  What answer did we get? We were told day after day that there was not a crisis, that there were no difficulties and no problems.  We certainly have a problem now.  When the Government suddenly realised that what we had been telling them over the last six weeks was true what was the response of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy? He called in the oil companies and started to lay down the law in an abrasive way.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;expresses its satisfaction at the Government's management of the economy&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment which expresses the satisfaction of this House in the Government's management of the economy.  Managing the economy is not a matter of making speeches to the electorate one week before the European and local elections.  It is a serious business ensuring that there is a regular increase in jobs, a regular expansion of the economy in terms of economic growth and a curtailment of inflation. All these objectives should be achieved within the context of a democratic society, and seeking to achieve a consensus towards these objectives.  If they are not achieved, although the Government <Col N="1662" /> are managing the situation well, the fault may lie within the democratic system and in failure to get people moving as effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>The President of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Mr Harold O'Sullivan, and the other members of congress who participated with the Government in a partnership to seek an end to the Post Office strike, would disagree with Deputy Cluskey's view that the Government alone could have settled this matter, which had far wider ramifications in regard to grades and salary levels in the public service than Deputy Cluskey in his simplistic way indicated.  At all stages during this unfortunately long drawn out dispute the Government worked in complete partnership with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the leaders of that body.  It is only through such partnership that one can expect to make progress. We do not live in an arbritary society; we are not in a socialist republic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and we cannot dictate to people in this respect.  When managing the economy in a democratic society, it is essential to ensure that, by patient striving towards an understanding of what the Government are about eventually a consensus can be reached on what the aims and objectives are in respect of the improvement of our society.  It is precisely that thinking which motivated the Government and the leaders of the trade union movement to get together in the formulation of the national understanding.  The democratic choice on the part of the trade union movement as a whole was to reject that understanding, for differing reasons in the case of most of the unions.  In a democracy this must be accepted.  We must seek to take up one of the several options which are open to us and get some reasonable degree of orderly progress in the field of wage increases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the context of the undoubted difficulties that exist in the whole area of industrial relations there are positive achievements on the basic social and economic indicators that count in assessing the progress that has been made.  I <Col N="1663" /> take Deputy Cluskey on his own criteria in this respect.  On the criterion of employment there is no question but that we have achieved a situation where last year we had an all-time high in the creation of 30,000 new jobs.  The latest indication from the IDA is that a further 30,000 new jobs will be created in the current year.  As far as the private sector, derided by Deputy Cluskey, is concerned it is making a massive contribution towards the provision of jobs.  Were it not for the provision of 30,000 new jobs in 1978 and the further provision of 30,000 new jobs this year one could really be talking about a serious situation in regard to the economy.  That figure is double the figure in the last two years of Coalition Government.  We have swung the economy around in regard to job creation. To indicate the difference in approach between our total commitment towards job creation and the haphazard attitude of the Coalition Government I give a figure which shows an average loss of 4,500 jobs per year in the period 1973 to 1977.  Apart from the creation of 30,000 new jobs last year there was a net job gain between new jobs and redundancies of 17,000 jobs.  We had a net increase of 17,000 jobs and the creation of 30,000 jobs in 1978 compared to a situation in which year in year out from 1973 to 1977 there was an average job loss of 4,500 each year.  That is the kind of figure that counts. If we have no more accurate figures on matters such as the mobility of labour, the increase of young people on the labour market and emigration it is because the Coalition Government refused to take a national census for the first time since the formation of this State, an act of gross treachery as far as any real development or planning for development in our economy was concerned. If the Coalition were to be indicted for any single act it would be that for a few measly pounds the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, persuaded the Government at that time not to go forward with a national census which would yield the figures on which proper planning and economic development could take place. <Col N="1664" /> We have some basic factors at this stage without the census figures, which we will be processing shortly.  We know from the IDA the number of jobs created.  We know 30,000 jobs were created last year and that was twice the figure of the last full year of Coalition Government in 1976.  It was more than twice the number created in 1975.  We know that the figure of 30,000 will be repeated this year.  The figure of 60,000 in two years, 1978 to 1979, represents more than double the figure in the last two years of the Coalition.</P>
    <P>I will give some up to date figures which will show that this is a continuing process.  Unemployment has fallen by about 5,500 between the end of December last year to the end of March this year.  The investment indicators for 1979 are particularly buoyant and show that that figure is an on-going continuing one.  The imports of producers' capital goods, capital goods imported for the purpose of creating employment, are up by over 40 per cent in the first quarter of 1979.</P>

      <P>A useful barometer in assessing economic progress, expansion and job creation is the building and construction industry.  Cement sales&mdash;and this is the first time this figure has been given&mdash;are up by 14 per cent in volume in the first four months of 1979 compared to the first four months of last year.  That bears out our assessment of that industry, where the problem is not one of unemployment but of finding people to take on the jobs that are there. The IDA find this a growing phenomenon throughout the country.  It does not just apply to the building and construction industry but to a number of projects which the IDA have established. People are not there to take up the jobs.  There is now a situation where employment outlets are beginning to outrun job availability.</P>

      <P>The problem of prosperity, I say this non-politically, is to control expectations.  To some extent Deputy Cluskey made the same point.  There is no point in the community taking the fallacious view that because there is reasonably full employment, because we have reduced inflation as we have, because there are job opportunities, because we have the highest economic growth within the EEC and because those economic indicators are there, this means that every section of the community can go hell for leather for whatever increases it wants.</P>

      <P>The main problem of prosperity is to control it and ensure it is a prosperity that is equally shared throughout the whole community and that the basic purpose of social justice is maintained and every section of the community is treated as equitably as possible.  That is important.  That very purpose and objective will be frustrated if we have a situation where the strong can get what they like and the weak do not have the strength to push for their legitimate share of the national prosperity.</P>
      <P>Our job as a Government is to ensure that there is a balance in the distribution of national wealth and that this balance is designed to ensure that the strong do not push the weak to the ground.  The great danger in not following on the thinking behind the national understanding is that such a situation might emerge in which a strong trade union can secure what they like while the people who are unrepresented, those in the lower income categories who do not have muscle, suffer. It is our duty as a Government to ensure that they are looked after and that the balance is redressed in their favour if there is any free-for-all situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey challenged me on other points.  He had the temerity to talk about economic growth in a situation where last year our economic growth was in the region of 7-8 per cent.  That <Col N="1666" /> economic growth resulted in the employment of which I have spoken because the two matters are directly related.  Side by side with that growth we managed to reduce the inflation rate to 8 per cent last year from the all-time high figure of 21 per cent in 1975.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the sort of thing that makes the difference.  It relates to a gain in employment last year of 17,000 jobs.  The Deputy knows that it is basic economic sense and a canon of economics that growth rate and jobs are directly related.  During the period of office of the Coalition there was a growth rate of 2¾ per cent as compared with 7 per cent in 1978.  When they were in office there was an average loss of 4,500 jobs per year compared with a gain of 17,000 in 1978.  There is a simple answer to all of this.  For economic growth read more jobs.  There is a correlation between economic growth and social justice and it is nonsense for Deputy Cluskey to speak as though the two aspects can be confined to separate compartments.  They are directly related. <Col N="1667" /> Economic growth means more jobs, more jobs means a better society and a better society means more revenue for the less well-off and for the socially deprived.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cluskey was concerned with social welfare for some years and I shall give him some relevant figures.  In real terms there was a rise in old age pensions of 2.1 per cent per year from 1973-1977 when the Deputy was responsible for their disbursement.  The rise in real terms in 1978 was 6.1 per cent, an increase of 4 per cent.  The Deputy also mentioned taxation.  I see that Deputy Ryan is present in the House now.  In his two budgets in 1976 and 1977 the increase in tax allowances was of the order of 19.6 per cent of £180.  In our last two budgets, instead of £180 increase read the figure of £1,130 and for the figure of 19.6 per cent read 103 per cent in our two budgets.  These are the practical facts that cannot be denied.</P>
      <P>The most damning indictment of the previous Government was a phrase used by Deputy Ryan.  When he was trying to combat the raging inflation that existed he said, &ldquo;We were swallowed up in a sea of inflation&rdquo;.  He was right.</P>

      <Col N="1668" /> A further and serious problem remains to which I referred initially, namely, the problem of industrial relations. Unless this problem is resolved in a sane and rational manner in the months ahead no Government can succeed in managing the economy.  Fine Gael or Labour or a combination of them, or Fianna Fáil cannot succeed.  In a democracy no Government can succeed in providing full employment without getting a consensus and a partnership between the trade union movement and themselves.  It is as simple and as basic as that.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to pretend that the defeat of the national understanding was not a disappointment.  Of course it was. However, some day and somehow, and the sooner the better, this Government&mdash;because we are here for the next three years&mdash;will have to tackle the problem.  For the sake of Ireland this matter had better be tackled quickly in the months ahead because we cannot afford to wait for years.  Unless this problem is resolved in a rational and sensible manner this country is heading for very serious trouble.  It does not take a genius or an economic expert to see that if we price ourselves out of the market by inflation and increased costs as regards exports&mdash;and this would undoubtedly flow from an undisciplined approach to industrial relations&mdash;we will go down.  We can only survive through more competitive production.  We can only plan for that and achieve it within a rational environment as regards wages and prices and general and reasonable peace on the industrial relations front.</P>
    <P>I make a particular appeal for this.  I think in their hearts everybody here this evening agrees with what I have said and that congress would also agree with it as would anybody who thinks sensibly about our future.  We must agree that all other problems in our society today pale into insignificance compared with the major problem of getting a partnership going between the trade union movement and the Government, have it well-established and have the sensible and rational approach one finds in Germany, Holland and Belgium&mdash;I mention those three countries particularly, especially <Col N="1669" /> Germany and Holland&mdash;and Denmark which gives rise to this partnership between the trade union movement and the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, practical&mdash;I practise other things.  We must get into an environment where such a partnership can work, where the trade unions and the Government set down rational goals and expectations, decide, on the available evidence, economic data and social criteria what are the realisable targets over a period, agree on those targets and decide on other aspects of life such as those included in the national understanding relating to health, education, social welfare and taxation and decide what such aspects can contribute towards a legitimate and fair increase for various sections of the community.  It is only in that way that we can plan ahead and make a significant contribution to what we all really want, an economic climate in which we can have full employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Otherwise nobody can succeed.  In a modern democratic society it is becoming obvious that nobody can succeed unless there is such a partnership.  It is now clear that the nation as a whole must be persuaded to get this message.  While I am disheartened by the defeat of the national understanding we must try and try again along this road.  We must try the road of persuasion&mdash;I agree with Deputy Cluskey on that.  We must try the road of patriotism, try to get people to see that it is everybody's business to ensure that nobody takes too much but that everybody gets a reasonable share of what the nation as a whole has earned.  That is what I mean by controlling irrational expectations.  Irrational expectation is a luxury which the community cannot afford.  What is needed above all is a community sense of discipline <Col N="1670" /> and responsibility.  The strongest force in our society that can give that is the elected Government with its mandate from the people and its legitimacy from the democratic choice of the people in combination with the trade union movement. This applies not only to our society but to every democratic society where one must make progress by way of free choice and agreement.</P>

      <P>A government must have the confidence of the people if it is to be able to govern.  We are not talking in this motion about popular support for a government because a government pursuing the right policy may generate confidence but may lose popular support. We are talking here very bluntly and truly about a Government who have lost the confidence of all sections of the people.  Even those to whom the present Government pandered by the abolition of wealth tax and other handouts which they did not require have now lost confidence in the Government that gave these bonanzas.  Ireland never had such troubled waters; the pity is that there is no oil to pour on them.  The Government have a terrible responsibility for this situation and it is a responsibility that is solely theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nation's troubles stemmed primarily from widespread unrealistic expectations.  The Government argue that but those unrealistic expectations were directly and irresponsibly stimulated by the Fianna Fáil Party in their unprincipled bid for power in 1977. The mischief they then created will take five or six years to cure.  The policies since pursued by the Government of borrowing massive amounts in a once off-dash for mushroom growth that could not be sustained have generated discontent, uncertainty, unreasonable expectations.  There is strong irony in the Fianna Fáil slogan for the European Parliamentary elections when they ask to be given a strong voice in government in Europe.  They were given a strong voice in the Government of Ireland, the strongest an Irish Government ever got and all we hear of this voice now is in complaint and wailing that their critics, particularly in the media, are being unfair to them.  They complain that their <Col N="1671" /> sermons on the mountain of government are not getting the publicity they think they deserve.  People do not want preaching; they want practice from the Government and they are not getting it.</P>
    <P>Have the Government no idea what is going on, what the people are saying?  If not, they must not be engaged in the European or local elections campaign. Some of the rotten rubbish that people have flung at some of their cameras in Dublin should have brought to their attention the fact that the people are annoyed with them, that people are saying: &ldquo;For God's sake, would the Government govern or get to hell out of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government's job is to govern, not to be preaching sermons to people they have misled.</P>
    <P>In an oil crisis which is one one-fifth as bad as the oil crisis that afflicted this country and the world in 1973-74 there is now wholly unnecessary chaos, hardship, inconvenience and profiteering on a scale immensely worse than anything that happened in 1973-74. Most of this stemmed from the uncertainty of the situation, from the feeling people have that the Government are not managing their affairs properly.  Nor are they.  The Government some weeks ago took power to distribute oil supplies and it appears now that some privileged few garages can get unlimited quantities of petrol while others are being deprived of their fair share&mdash;and this, when the Government are responsible for distribution. If ever there was an occasion for rationing petrol, it exists now.  However, the Government are so incompetently handling the postal strike that even if they did decide to ration there is no way to distribute the ration coupons without inordinate delay.  Even if the Government's crass ineptitude makes the general introduction of rationing impossible at present, would they please make immediate arrangements to ensure that medical doctors, taximen and other people rendering essential public services are provided with petrol?  Could they not even do that for a comparatively small number of people in the community? Apparently not.  If they could have, they would surely have done so before now. <Col N="1672" /> We have the scandal of urgent medical treatment and operations being postponed because doctors cannot accept responsibility for the admission of patients to hospitals and for performing operations on them, when they are unable to get to treat them, should an emergency arise.  The Government do nothing about that.  It seems that even that simple task is beyond their competence.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for the worst oil shortage in Europe?  The crowd who sought power to get the country moving again.  The country was never at such a standstill since the last great war.  I have come to the Dáil tonight through streets virtually deserted&mdash;it is more like a Sunday morning than a summer evening. Who is responsible for the streets of Dublin being choked with rotten rubbish? A spokesman of Dublin Corporation stated on radio last night that it was the Government who were responsible, in not allowing them to settle the dispute. Who is responsible for four-fifths of the buses being off the road for several months?  Who is responsible for no postal services?  Who is responsible for the largely non-functioning telephone service?  Who is responsible for the city and county of Dublin in which a very grave shortage of water existed during the wettest winter on record?  The crowd who offered the young people of Ireland &ldquo;your kind of country&rdquo;.  It was not for this kind of country that the young people voted them into power.  Who is responsible for the streets of this city being pitted with potholes of unprecedented number and dimension?  A Government containing a Minister for Economic Planning and Development who said it would be better to dig holes and fill them up again than to have people unemployed.  The holes are there now and they will not even fill them up.  They wonder why anyone should lack confidence in them.  Thanks be to God that the people are sane, as is proved by the fact that they have not got confidence in the Government.  If the people were not expressing a lack of confidence in them, I should be very worried about their sanity.  They are sane and they are expressing that lack of confidence in a loud and persistent voice.</P>

      <P>I am sorry to be speaking in this vein.  I had to shoulder the responsibility of Government and of economic management of the Government without the help of any Minister for Economic Planning and Development and without all the plethora of people brought in by the Government in private appointments to the public service. I had to shoulder the responsibility of Government at a time when the country was going through, as the rest of the world was, the worst recession in 40 years.  I did not get much assistance from the Opposition at that time.  I did not look for it; I did not want it; I did not get it&mdash;to the contrary, because they conducted a most irresponsible, vindictive and false campaign.</P>
      <P>The reason people are not listening to them now is that they are now saying what we said five years ago, and they denied the truth of every word that we uttered.  How can they expect people to listen to them when they contradicted us when we spoke the truth?</P>
      <P>I do not say that a lot of the things they are now saying are wrong.  I am saying that they cannot get the people to listen because they misled them when in Opposition; they misled them on their way into Government and ever since.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not blame the Government for all our troubles.  I do deliberately and directly blame them and accuse them of making our difficulties worse than they need be and of failing to take action which is within their power to ensure that the burdens which are upon us are fairly distributed.  Their practice in government has been one of relieving the burdens of those best in a position to carry them and of throwing the burdens and the suffering on to the poorest of the poor and the less privileged. <Col N="1674" /> We are now faced with the real danger that the Irish £, which so proudly entered the EMS a couple of months ago, will soon be substantially devalued by market forces as the world outside takes fright at the sight of this country having as it does Europe's highest inflation rate, the worst industrial disputes, excessively high Government borrowing and a rapidly worsening balance of payments. This year looks like producing a deficit of over £1,000 million in trade. Already, our external reserves have fallen by over £70 million in one month. The external reserves which not so long ago were sufficient to pay for six months' imports will, by the end of the year, pay for imports for only three and a half months and if the price of oil rises in any significant way it will, in fact, pay for imports for an even shorter period, two and a half to three months.</P>
      <P>Bad as our difficulties are at present, all the signs are that they will become immeasurably worse.  From the Government, we have either silence or whinging that their sermons from the seat of Government are not receiving sufficient attention in the media and that the people who were misled by them cannot now understand why they are contradicting all they preached for the last six years.  Surely the Government of Nero is fiddling while Ireland is burning herself to death and the Government cannot even supply the water to put out the fire.  The Government are not leading; they cannot lead, as they do not know where to go.  They know that they should not be where they are at present. We recall the story of the tourist&mdash;when we had tourists&mdash;who was climbing Macgillycuddy's Reeks and asked a local farmer how to get to Dublin, and the farmer replied, &ldquo;Well, you should not be starting from here in the first place&rdquo;. That is the Government's plight at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the going was good, when they received from us&mdash;in the words of Deputy Jack Lynch, the Taoiseach&mdash;a sound economy, which he described as a sound basis on which to build, they squandered what we left them for the sake of passing popularity.  Now that the crisis is upon us, the reserves that we had so carefully hoarded to meet this <Col N="1675" /> kind of situation&mdash;which is not unusual in the world&mdash;have been mis-spent in a dash for mushroom growth which could not be sustained even if there were never the problems arising out of the Iranian situation and the advantage which the oil-producing states have taken from that situation.  I am appalled.  It sickens me.  I am so long on the scene that I take no joy in scoring political points.  I would much rather see the country ruled properly, no matter which Government were in power.  Unfortunately, the Government are incapable of ruling, incapable of giving the lead.  They have got themselves into a mess and do not know how to extricate themselves.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Phoenix Park Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): At Question Time today Deputy Belton asked a question regarding the speed of traffic passing through the Phoenix Park and suggested that steps should be taken to reduce the speed.  Let me say at the outset that I, in common with almost everyone in the country, regard the Phoenix Park with pride.  I pass through it several times a week and invariably feel admiration for those who planned the spacious, wide roads and especially those who planned the planting of the trees so far back on each side of the road.  This must be one of the finest parks in Europe and nothing I say is intended to detract from this great national amenity.</P>
      <P>I was rather alarmed to hear the Minister of State say in reply to a supplementary question that it is proposed to close the Phoenix Park to through traffic from dusk or 7 p.m., whichever is the later.  This would mean that the park would be closed to through traffic at 7 p.m. during the winter months and at later times during the summer.  This is a great shock to me, as it will be to the great many people from the northern side of the city who have been using this park as a thoroughfare into the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not quite clear from the <Col N="1676" /> Minister's reply whether he or somebody else has made an order or by-law implementing this change.  I gathered that this was not the fact.  It seems probable that a working party consisting of representatives of the local authority, the Garda, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works have reported on the matter and have recommended that the park be closed as I have stated but that by-laws have not yet been altered to bring the change into law.  If I am wrong in this assumption, perhaps the Minister would correct me.</P>
    <P>I protest about this suggestion.  The Phoenix Park is not open to what I would call commercial traffic but is open to private vehicles.  This has been the case for as long as I have been coming to Dublin.  Many years ago there was, as there is now, a gate at the Castleknock end of the main road and also a gate at the Parkgate Street end.  The latter gate was removed many years ago and since then the park has been completely open at that point.  The right of people travelling from Donegal, Northern Ireland, parts of the west, my own constituency and Meath to pass through the park has never been abused.  The Minister has said that there is a 40 mile speed limit which is obeyed and that prosecutions are brought if the limit is not observed.  I want to know why it is proposed to close the park at 7 p.m. or dusk, imposing great inconvenience on people from the north coming into or going out of the city.  This proposed closure will add further to their journey and will also cause a considerable addition to the volume of traffic on roads already overcrowded.  I refer especially to the route through Phibsboro', by the Mater Hospital and into O'Connell Street.  People travelling towards the south also avail of this road through the park, thus relieving other roads and the centre of the city of additional traffic.</P>
    <P>I do not believe there was an opportunity to make representations to the working party.  I am sure the general public were not aware of any such opportunity. Strong representations would have been made in favour of leaving the park as it is and the roads available to motorists who wanted to use them.  It is <Col N="1677" /> rather difficult to see the sense in closing the park to through traffic at dusk.  If the object is the safety of people who use the park as a park, it must be said that they are not likely to be there after dusk.  The park is clear of ordinary users when dusk comes.  If there were to be any change, it might be safer to leave the park open at this time.  If a case were made for the protection of the deer, I could understand it.  It does not make sense that the park should be open to the general public during the day but closed to vehicular traffic at night.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is probably at a disadvantage because his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, would ordinarly deal with this matter.  I would suggest that he should rethink this matter and should not give his authority to the implementation of by-laws, if these are necessary to put into effect this proposal.  If he persists, he should hold an inquiry and give people an opportunity of expressing their views. They have been using this through road for as long as they can remember and records will show how long that is.  This proposal does not make sense and will cause a great deal of inconvenience.  I strongly urge the Minister not to pursue it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the statement today the recommendations are the closing of the park to through traffic at dusk or 7 p.m., whichever is the later, the provision of roundabouts rather than traffic lights, additional speed limit signs and the closing of internal park roads.</P>
      <P>I further pressed him in the matter by asking the Minister if he was proposing to accept the recommendation that the Phoenix Park be closed to traffic at 7 p.m. and if he was aware that this would cause considerable inconvenience to people from west County Dublin and County Meath coming to Dublin and would lead to greatly increased traffic on other routes.  The Minister replied that that is what was recommended in the report.  I asked him if he proposed to accept this.  The Minister replied that he had accepted it and approved it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with what the Minister said.  It is clear from what the Minister said that the recommendation <Col N="1678" /> was that no through traffic should be allowed any more.  Presumably people may enter the park but they will not be able to get out because that is what through traffic means.  That presumably means that all the gates will be shut at 7 o'clock or at dusk and that the only entrance to the main road would be one at Parkgate Street because there is no gate there.</P>
    <P>I would like to have it clarified that that is what is meant.  If in fact it is proposed to leave two gates open then it is possible for there to be through traffic and what the Minister has said does not apply.  This should be clarified.  What exactly is meant by through traffic?  In my view the only way that what the Minister is saying could be enforced would be if all the gates were closed and it was only possible to get into the park by one gate and go back out by that same gate and no other.  That seems to be what the Minister is saying in his statement and in what he said when pressed by me for further information.</P>
    <P>I note also that roundabouts are to be provided instead of traffic lights.  The traffic lights, to my knowledge, are all at the gates of the Phoenix Park.  The only way the traffic lights could be replaced by roundabouts would be by knocking down the gates and putting roundabouts at the traffic lights which are at the gates.  One could not have a roundabout at the gates which are only the width of one vehicle at present so I cannot see how that is going to be enforced other than by knocking down the gates.  But if the gates are knocked down the Phoenix Park would not be closed to through traffic.  The recommendation seems to be riddled with contradictions.</P>
    <P>The Minister then said that there will be additional speed limits.  I want to make it clear that I have no objection to that.  But he says that internal park roads will be closed.  This is not related to dusk or 7 o'clock so presumably internal park roads are going to be closed all the time. I would like to know what internal park roads are going to be closed and how they are going to be closed and to whom they are going to be closed.  Does it mean that certain roads in the park which are now open to vehicles are going to be pedestrianised permanently?  I <Col N="1679" /> do not think that would be a good idea at all because it would only lead to crowding on the remaining roads which are not pedestrianised and to cars parking at one place because people would not be able to get to their destination in their cars which would mean that instead of being able to park at random throughout the park people would have to park in the one place and would probably end up parking on the grass verge which is something we do not want.</P>
    <P>The idea of closing the park to through traffic is so ridiculous that I find it hard to believe that the Minister could really have meant what he said.  I hope that he did not mean what he said and that he misread the recommendations in the report and that what he told the House was not fully accurate.  I await his reply.  I do not think I need to labour the point.  If the park was closed to through traffic it would mean that people from Castleknock or Dunboyne and other areas who went to pick up somebody from the train at Kingsbridge would have to go around by Chapelizod or around by the Navan Road and down Infirmary Road instead of going the obvious way which is straight through the Phoenix Park; it is the sensible way to go and it does not interfere with anyone.</P>
    <P>I know there have been a few animals killed at night but this is not so frequent an occurrence that we need to adopt this sort of stringent solution.  Through traffic of that sort is a sensible thing. Perhaps one way we could avoid such accidents happening is to ensure that the main road is better lit.  I understand that at present the lighting there is all gas lighting; it is one of those antique forms of lighting that are only being used in the Phoenix Park and nowhere else.  It may have been good enough for our Victorian ancestors who tended to move at a slower pace.  We may well be returning to the Victorian speed of movement by virtue of factors of another character in relation to oil supplies but at the moment and for the foreseeable future people will still be using motor cars and the level of light provided by gas lights is not sufficient and one of the reasons why these accidents have been taking place is that <Col N="1680" /> the lighting is not good enough.  I agree that those gas light standards are very attractive and I would not like to see them knocked down and I would not like to see gas lights done away with completely but perhaps we could supplement the gas lights with other lighting to improve the lighting in the park.  The Board of Works should bend their views to this rather than preventing people getting through the park at all at night if it is shown that lack of lighting is the problem.  If it is not lack of lighting that is the problem we should be told what is the problem.</P>
    <P>I will sit down now because I would like the Minister to have an ample opportunity to explain exactly what he intends in full detail.  It would be a good thing because people should not have this sort of thing sprung on them&mdash;they are told that this decision was made last week and the first they hear about it is now&mdash;because it creates a certain amount of apprehension.  The facts and the recommendations should be made known.  I would suggest to the Minister that the working party report on which all these recommendations were based be published.  I hope the Minister will be able to announce this evening that this report will be published and if it is a lot of the problems and the misapprehensions which might have arisen will be allayed once and for all.</P>

      <P>I told the House most of it today and there was no doubt about what I was telling the House.  In recent times there have been four parliamentary questions and representations from numerous Deputies and members of the public regarding the speed and volume of traffic through the park.  The matter has been raised on numerous occasions by many Deputies in the debate on the Vote for the Office of Public Works.  One example of the reasons behind these proposals is that 22 serious accidents were reported during 1973 to 1977 and seven of those occurred during the hours of darkness; injuries to animals, deer and cattle, occur mainly at night.  The management and control of the Phoenix Park is vested in the Commissioners of Public Works under section 2 of the Phoenix Park Act, 1925.  Under section 3 of the same Act the commissioners are required to maintain the park as a public park for the general purpose of the recreation and enjoyment of the public.</P>
      <P>The present position regarding the closure of gates in the Phoenix Park is that there are nine entrances to the Phoenix Park and all but two are closed to vehicular traffic at 11 o'clock each night.  The main entrance at Parkgate Street, which does not have a gate, and the Castleknock gate are open to vehicular traffic at all times.  What is proposed is that the main entrance and the Cabra gate will be open at all times and the remaining gates will be closed at dusk or 7 p.m., whichever is the later. That should allow for peak hour use of the park by commuter traffic.  We have still to determine exactly what time &ldquo;dusk&rdquo; shall be.</P>

The road I refer to is the Furze Road, the link towards Lucan.  That does not interfere with traffic because there is another way towards the Lucan gate.  The Furze Road is in an area which is used extensively by the deer but its closure will not cause any inconvenience to traffic.</P>

The working party were satisfied that the roads in the surrounding areas would be capable of taking the traffic that would normally go through the park at that hour.  The commissioners may make by-laws for various purposes including the following: regulating and controlling the use and enjoyment of the park by the public, prescribing the times during which the park should be open to the public and prescribing the purposes for which the park may be used.  The making of by-laws requires the approval of the Minister for Finance and when made they must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  If either House within 21 days on which that House sits after the by-law is laid before it passes a resolution annulling such by-law that by-law shall be annulled accordingly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1548" /> A disabled persons maintenance allowance is payable to a person who by reason of a disability is unable to provide for his own maintenance and whose spouse, if any, is unable to maintain him.  An infectious diseases maintenance allowance is payable to a person who by reason of undergoing treatment, or observing a precaution in relation to a specified infectious disease, is prevented from maintaining himself and his dependants.  In the case of both schemes of allowances, determination of the levels of income at which eligibility may be reached is left to the discretion of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Levels of income for eligibility for the blind welfare allowance are determined as follows: Persons not maintained in an institution who are in receipt of the maximum blind pension or the social welfare contributory old age pension may be regarded as eligible for the blind welfare allowance at the maximum rate subject to the following conditions:</P>
    <P>1.  In the case of such persons living in a family situation and who have no direct responsibility for outgoings related to the household a reduction of £1.50 per week would apply.</P>
    <P>2.  The earnings of a blind person's spouse will be taken into account in determining the extent of the supplementary allowance.</P>

I understand that the same type of ticket is issued to all persons entitled to free travel under my Department's scheme; its purpose is merely to confirm entitlement to free travel on ticket inspection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner) Padraig Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important when making air fare comparisons to compare like with like.  The Shannon-London return fare of £86 is the normal economy fare.  The corresponding London-New York return fare is £340.</P>
      <P>The normal economy fare is the regular on-demand fare used mainly by the business segment of the market which requires frequency and flexibility. However, there is also a range of promotional or excursion fares and, in the case of the Shannon-London route, a return fare as low as £58 is available to cater for tourists and other visitors.</P>
      <P>I cannot trace a return fare between London and New York at the level referred to by the Deputy.  There are a number of single fares at a level close to the £89 quoted by the Deputy but these are all subject to various conditions and restrictions which limit their availability to special categories of travellers.</P>

      <P>There are no official statistics published of job losses in manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>In its annual report for 1976, the Industrial Development Authority estimated, on the basis of the results of their annual employment surveys, that job losses in manufacturing industry in County Donegal over the four years 1973-76 amounted to 2,350.  This aggregate figure probably overstates the incidence of permanent job losses because jobs lost as a result of cyclical factors in a particular year tend to be partially or wholly recovered in subsequent years when economic and trading conditions improve.</P>

    <P>In their industrial plan for the period 1977-1980 the authority set targets for the creation of 750 new grant-aided jobs in the Innishowen area and for 850 jobs in the rest of North Donegal.  As part of their strategy for the promotion of the <Col N="1567" /> area the authority have acquired significant land holdings and are pursuing an extensive advance factory programme, details of which are being given in reply to other questions by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>(c) (d)  The Nuclear Energy Board have the statutory function of advising me on nuclear energy and matters connected therewith.  I am advised by the board that the risk at any of the UK nuclear power stations of an incident constituting significant health hazard in Ireland is extremely low. Whilst it is not necessary to develop special precautions here, close co-operation and liaison with the relevant UK regulatory agencies is maintained by the Nuclear Energy Board and contact is maintained with the British authorities to ensure that we are kept fully informed of nuclear incidents in the UK.</P>
    <P>In addition, under the relevant provisions of the Euratom Treaty, the Commission of the European Communities and a group of experts drawn from each member state examine the plans for nuclear installations.  In this context the plans for four UK nuclear power stations, Dungeness, Hartlepool, Heysham and Hinckley Point constucted since the UK acceded to the EEC have been examined and found unlikely to constitute significant health hazards to the members of the public of other member states.</P>

      <P>The information in respect of grants requested by the Deputy in so far as the years up to and including 1977 are concerned is available in the relevant annual reports of the Industrial Development Authority.  Their reports have been placed before the Houses of the Oireachtas and were made available in the Dáil Library.</P>
