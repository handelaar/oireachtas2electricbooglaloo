      <P>The Tánaiste announced in reply to a Private Notice Question on Tuesday that the parties in the bank dispute will be brought together under the chairmanship of the chairman of the Banks Joint Industrial Council.  It is said in the newspapers that the Minister for Labour has intervened in the dispute.  Is that correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech introducing this Estimate contained much valuable comment on the overall labour scene.  The carping criticism which came from the Opposition showed an approach totally out of touch with what is happening today.  I do not think they earned any kudos by their criticism.  The people are now so seriously affected by industrial unrest that they blame the establishment rather than one unit of that establishment.  There is an onus on each Member of this House to strive to bring about a better atmosphere in industrial relations in order to ward off a more damaging situation.</P>
      <P>It is pertinent to ask what is wrong. Some of the industrial unrest is caused by men who are underpaid and in many ways underprivileged, but some of it is caused by people who flaunt their wealth and seek to become richer, irrespective of how the other half lives.  Institutions such as the Labour Court have done a tremendous amount of good work.  So also have the ICTU, who recently made great efforts in regard to the national understanding. There is goodwill in many quarters but we do not seem to be able to channel that goodwill towards better industrial relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1407" /> The Minister has set up a commission to inquire into industrial relations, and I hope they will report soon.  However, I wonder if this will radically improve matters.  We must change attitudes in the various sectors to which we individually belong.  An effective review must be undertaken of our existing institutions and, if they are not working satisfactorily, we must change them.  I never believed in long-term settlements and I feel we should have more interim planning.  I would suggest the setting up of a council, composed of representatives of trade unions, the Government and the employers, to whom claims for increased wages or better conditions would be sent.  They would vet these claims and quickly issue a decision on them. Basically this is the idea behind the national understanding.</P>
    <P>If we had the sort of committee that I suggest sitting in permanent session and examining all these claims we should be much better off because very often the reason for a strike is delay in reaching a decision on a claim.</P>
    <P>The Government must be the ultimate decision-making body, but they must have regard to the global situation and that is why they sometimes appear to be stringent.  The Government must have regard to the extent to which wage increases might also increase the rate of inflation.  Today more than ever before it is essential that the people understand decisions taken by the Government and that is another area in which the type of body I have in mind could be of much benefit.  They could explain the situation to those seeking increases.  It is important that people understand that there is not much point in a wage increase as such if it is not a real increase, that is, if it does not increase purchasing power.</P>
    <P>If we are not to find ourselves in a disastrous situation in terms of inflation each sector must examine their position. What is required today more than ever is national discipline in all sectors.  It is easy to tell the factory worker that he may not have an increase in pay but we must examine the whole system in this regard and try to ensure that people at the other end of the line are not getting <Col N="1408" /> massive dividends, because big incomes at that level can be as inflationary as are excessive wage claims.  It may be said that those in receipt of dividends are much smaller in number than are factory workers, for instance, but higher standards of living must be achieved by way of the ordinary negotiating process rather than that those groups with the most muscle, whether on the factory floor or in the boardroom, win the day.</P>
    <P>We are not making progress on the industrial relations scene.  Perhaps we have contracted some of the English sickness in the area of strikes and industrial unrest generally, but I appeal to the people to reconsider the whole situation regarding strikes and go-slows.  I regard the strike weapon as being outmoded. As I said before it is tantamount to using a bow and arrow in modern warfare. The threat of strike may be effective but once a strike begins and the workers lose their incomes there develops a situation of entrenchment on both sides which can be very difficult to resolve.  Strikes can cause much hardship not only to the people concerned directly but to many others.  For instance, if one walks down Townsend Street any day he will find long queues of elderly people waiting to be paid their pensions at the offices of the Department of Social Welfare.  These good Dublin people should be able to draw their pensions in a civilised way. They should not have to submit themselves to the inconvenience and the indignity of forming long queues on a city street.  They have had to wait there in some very bad weather.  There is no blame attaching to the office.  Pensions are paid speedily there but the Post Office strike is the cause of the situation.</P>
    <P>There must be a better way of resolving all these difficulties.  I have personal knowledge of the scene regarding the corporation men in the cleansing department who are on a go-slow.  I know that these men have grievances.  Their job is not a very nice one but it should be possible, with goodwill on both sides, to resolve their grievances.  There are people in this city who have not had a refuse collection for almost three months. There is not very much that I can add to what has been said already both here <Col N="1409" /> and outside about the Post Office strike but I would appeal to all concerned to adopt a fresh approach to the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would prefer Deputies to refrain from dealing with specific cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>On the industrial relations scene in general we could do better. The weaker sections are suffering most in the present situation.  I am not denying that the various people on strike have grievances but these grievances must be resolved some day, so why not resolve them today rather than wait for another week or for another month?  The Minister in his brief outlined the procedures for negotiations, procedures that have the approval of all sides.  We are much too poor a country to allow a situation in which essential services are withdrawn for many months.  If we consider the situation in West Germany, for instance, we realise that it is possible to have industrial peace.</P>
      <P>I am confident that when the Minister is reviewing the organisation of the Labour Court he will find ways in which improvements can be made.  Perhaps we could appeal to all sections at this time to continue working on the basis of interim increases in wages pending agreement on a policy to replace the national understanding.  This would appear to be the best procedure for the moment.  The cost of industrial strife must be frightening in terms of the economy.  The people have become disenchanted, not with the Government but with the democratic system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy is on trial.  We have to take the whole thing very seriously.  Yesterday we learned with regret that the national understanding had been rejected. I do not think it is a disaster, but we have to face facts and accept the fact that it has been rejected.  This has caused grave concern throughout the country. The newspapers today in their editorial comments take the matter very seriously. <i>The Irish Press</i> has the headline &ldquo;Where do we go from here?&rdquo;  Indeed, I wonder where do we go from here unless we have a touch of realism and inspiration to get over this obstacle on the way <Col N="1410" /> to progress.  <i>The Irish Times</i> said that the term &ldquo;national understanding&rdquo; was a gauche term.  It goes on to deal in a sensible way with what happens now.  The <i>Independent</i> says &ldquo;In a country potentially well-doing....&rdquo;  Indeed, most of us are doing very well, but there are strange anomalies.</P>
    <P>As I came in this morning I saw in the window of an employment service office an advertisement offering 50 jobs for women manufacturing jeans, the type of clothes worn by younger people nowadays. Happily, the employer was able to offer £70 a week, subsidised bus services and subsidised canteen facilities.  I am delighted to note that that employer can do that, but we know very well that all employments are not as happy as that. When we talk about unemployment and we see that there is one place which offers 50 jobs right away surely we would all be far better off if the Government, the Department, the trade unions and the employers were examining the possibility of having many more industries like that in this city, because that employer shows what can be done with good management and with work of a high standard.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to refer to is the comment in the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  They ask &ldquo;Who rules?&rdquo; and say in general terms trade unions or big business.  The point is that these bodies do not rule. They are components of our society, but they do not rule.  In a democracy the Government rule.  Democracy is the best system we know of.  There is an onus therefore on everyone to realise that democracy cannot exist or prosper unless we take our share of responsibility. We should especially remember that, although those of us who have jobs may have problems also, there are many people who have not got jobs and we must always try to redress that situation.  We are not going to be able to create employment unless we show that we are capable of attracting capital, first of all, and then showing that the expertise of the Irish worker is as high as anyone else's.  What may put people off is the fact that some of our bizarre industrial unrest is certainly not conducive to good relations between the new <Col N="1411" /> employers and the workers.  I know that if the Minister could find the answer to these problems he would be a very happy man indeed, but there is no short cut to industrial peace.  It has to be achieved by every sector accepting its full share of responsibility.  I would like to see a system whereby the men and women who work on the shop floor and the management at the top would be vying with each other to show how that concern could prosper.</P>
    <P>When we talk about trade unions or the men and women who strike we also have to remember that inefficient management is very often to blame for some of the industrial unrest.  It may be because we have a tradition built up from former times where many a person in management was not trained to be in management but simply had that job because it was an old family business. We know that the Government, through their agencies, spend vast amounts of money in grants to industrial and commercial undertakings to train management to a higher standard.  Lots of firms avail of this but many firms do not or, having availed of the service, they do not learn very much.</P>
    <P>We very often have procrastination in deciding a claim for better conditions and higher wages and we sow the seeds of industrial unrest.  The Minister, in his speech, gave details of the help the Government give the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I would not grudge one penny of that money.  I think congress are trying very earnestly to improve matters on the industrial relations scene.  They tried very hard indeed and with an expertise that is commendable.  The fact that the national understanding was not accepted can be put down to many different factors.  As I mentioned earlier, I was never a believer in making long-term agreements.  Factors change so rapidly nowadays that short-term agreements would be far better, because in a year many things change and therefore a good agreement made today may not be so attractive in three months' time.</P>
    <P>This is where the unrest starts.  A man who gets an increase today is quite happy with it and takes it, but because of <Col N="1412" /> various factors he later becomes dissatisfied. Human instinct being what it is, he wants to improve his position.  If he has a small house, perhaps he wants a larger house.  If he has a small car, he wants a bigger car.  Naturally, a man with a young family wants to give his children a better education than he had, so the demand for greater income goes on all the time.  But we know very well that income of any type, whether it is dividends or, wages or salary, must be governed by what is available in the national pool.  The classic economist always refers to the national cake.  If the cake is only a small one, then each person will get only a small amount; but if it is baked much bigger, then there is more for all the people.  That may sound like a cliché nowadays but it was very sound.  It is to be hoped that certain old values, disregarded today, may soon return.</P>
    <P>The late Deputy Seán Lemass asked for old-fashioned patriotism at one time. We could do with a little of that today. We have become more sophisticated since we joined the EEC; we think differently and we are going through change.  However, the old values are still valid.  One of the old values was that we always thought of the less well off people. Today many people draw pensions from across the Channel and are badly affected by the Post Office strike. I visited one such old lady recently and she complained bitterly that because of the present trouble she could not get her pension.  I asked her how she managed to live and she said that she lived simply with the help of relatives and so on.  Why must we inflict so much suffering on people in her circumstances?  Surely with goodwill all round we could end a lot of today's industrial unrest and the sufferings brought about by it.</P>
    <P>Before we had such a Department we all thought that a Department of Labour would be a great Department.  It turned out that way, judging by the amount of work done each day by the Department of Labour.  The majority of industrial disputes, those that do not go to the Labour Court, are solved.  The shop steward is very important to industry, <Col N="1413" /> and trade unions run courses for shop stewards.  As we become more industrialised the shop steward will assume greater importance in relation to communication between the shop floor and the employers.  Because of that more facilities should be made available for the education of shop stewards to enable them to explain matters on the shop floor and to monitor the needs and grievances of the workers and have them dealt with at union-management level. The shop steward has recourse to a rights officer of the Department and I compliment the Minister on increasing the number of rights officers.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced worker representation on boards, which I welcome, but the essential thing is to deal with problems already in industry. We should have well trained personnel on the union side and on the management side to examine each claim made by a worker.  If a claim is just the shop steward should fight it to the very last but, if not, the shop steward should be in a position to explain why.  A shop steward is happier if he can accede to the requests of an aggrieved worker.  If he does not accede to the request, he loses face and popularity among the workers.  The shop steward should be given every possible facility to do his job properly because he is a very important and in some cases the most important person in industrial relations.  His counterpart in management should also be well educated in industrial and human relations. It is, essentially, human relations that are in question.  There have been terrible examples of strikes which could have been avoided had there been the right approach from both sides.  There was an incident many years ago of a genuine grievance among industrial workers in the city and the management either could not or refused to solve the problem.  This went on for seven months and then the workers decided to strike, whereupon the matter was resolved within three hours.  Workers learnt a lesson from that.  If one wanted a fast decision on a claim, one took industrial action. That has been going on for a long time and has become the norm.  Experience in recent years has shown that we must remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1414" /> The Minister in his speech mentioned that there should be some kind of control on unofficial strikes.  We must face the fact that it is very hard to prevent unofficial strikes.  In my younger days, passing a picket was unthinkable.  You just did not do it, even if the picket was unofficial.  As one grew older one realised that refusal to pass an unofficial picket could inflict untold harm on other people.  I speak with reservation when I say that we have not the blatant abuse of unofficial picketing here that they have across Channel.  We heard stories of patients being sent home from hospital because of abuse of picket power.  That has not happened here and I hope it will not, but there is always a danger if we do not get down to an examination of the industrial relations situation.  We should strive to create a situation which will make for a better standard of living of all our people, particularly taking care of the very young and the very old.</P>
    <P>I do not think I exaggerate when I say our industrial relations situation is our greatest problem.  One is tempted to go overboard on the subject, but that would not serve any useful purpose.  However, if we show our concern here in the national Parliament it may help to ease things throughout the nation.  Deputies who are also members of Dublin Corporation have been inundated with requests to do something about the dustmen's strike in the city which is causing a serious problem to many people. There must be goodwill on both sides if that and other damaging disputes are to be settled.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has an onerous task but not as difficult as his counterpart across Channel.  However, the man holding similar office in the West German Republic has an easy job even if he has to deal with many more millions of people.  People who go to the continent on holidays notice particularly the high standard of living they enjoy there.  They have their problems there but there is one thing you can say about them: they have a dedication to their work.</P>
    <P>We have had a survey on Irish attitudes to work and I am afraid it was not very flattering to us.  However, I <Col N="1415" /> have found that whether workers are in the boardroom or on the factory floor, they give of their best, despite what people say about us.  In Dublin there is one industry which has not had a serious dispute in the past ten or 15 years.  The reason is that they got down to consider their difficulties and they never let a dispute escalate into a strike.  None of their disputes has lasted more than a couple of days and they have never disrupted essential supplies.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there are many difficulties facing us as a nation, including the oil shortage, but the greatest problem we have is the unsettled state of our industrial relations.  We could be doing far better industrially if we did not look on the strike weapon as the ultimate solution to workers' grievances.  Too many people adopt the fatalistic attitude that only a strike will remedy grievances.  I do not accept that.  This morning on my way here I spoke to people on picket lines.  I asked them for ideas on how their strike could be settled, but of course I am not an adjudicator.  However, I understood from them that they want to be at work.  They seem to have become entrenched in their present position.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest a way towards possible preliminary talks in disputes before they escalate.  There should be an adjunct to the Labour Court which could examine certain industries and make suggestions for improvements so that the rewards of all involved in those industries would be greater.  We must strive to get a sense of partnership in industry between boss and worker because what is good for one is good for all &mdash;they are all in it together and the prosperity of one will bring prosperity to the other.  Nowadays we have people from shop floors on boards of directors and perhaps this might bring about improvement in the long term.</P>
    <P>We should have a look at the number of trade unions we have.  The last time I counted them there were 93 to cater for a very small work force.  It may be said that we are a very individualistic race and that is why we have so many unions. Some of the 93 would be more like friendly societies than unions.  In CIE <Col N="1416" /> there is almost a score of unions.  We have demarcation disputes, or what are popularly known as the who does what strikes.  We must have some rationalisation, but the move must come from the trade union movement.  They are the people to examine the structures and decide what they should be.</P>
    <P>There are also human problems.  A man who is the secretary of a small union may be doing very good work and he will not look with relish at the prospect of being absorbed into a bigger union. The biggest union in the country have as their slogan, &ldquo;One big union&rdquo;.  Our aim should be to have a grouped industry with one union catering for it.  This would be to the benefit of the members and it would prevent a lot of unnecessary warfare.  There would be no sniping between the members.</P>
    <P>Recently on a disastrous occasion in Limerick we saw absolute open warfare between two unions.  I do not know the merits of that case, but the outcome of that dispute was not helpful.  I know there were other factors which caused the industry to close.  The situation in the trade unions needs to be rationalised.  Effort and money are wasted in supporting too many unions.  There is more than one employers' organisation, but they are very few.  A lot of work is being done on this question at the moment.  We have had some amalgamations of unions. This is to be encouraged.  In this  of specialisation we cannot afford to have so many unions.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there would be a certain amount of rivalry between unions, but we must reduce the numbers by agreement and by amalgamation. That is why I suggest we should group our industries, for example, the brewing industry, the baking industry, and so on, with their own unions.  This would be much more effective.  Recently we saw one firm on strike putting pickets on another industry which was connected in some way with it, thereby causing further disruption.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister, the Department, the trade unions and the employers have many problems.  I suggested earlier that we should have a permanent council or body in continual session examining industries. <Col N="1417" /> Claims could be vetted quickly and decisions given.  I would look on it as an adjunct of the Labour Court.  That would enable us to make great progress.</P>
    <P>I should like to see better communications between all concerned in the industrial and commercial scene.  We should be open with one another.  The employers should realise that there is more to industry than making a profit.  I believe in free enterprise, but free enterprise has responsibilities as well as privileges.  The unions also have responsibilities as well as privileges.  The State must try to bring the two together.  The Minister is doing that to a great extent.  I hope he will succeed and that this time next year when he presents his Estimate the industrial scene will be much more peaceful than it is now, and that there will be much less suffering in this city and in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on the Estimate for the Department of Labour.  The national understanding seems to be on very rocky ground.  On the subject of strikes I should like to make some suggestions to the Minister about what he should be doing that he is not doing.  Everybody agrees we are in a chaotic state.  Over the past four or five months we have had nothing but strikes.  We have the bin men on the streets.  We have the postal and telecommunications strike.  The banks are threatening to go on strike.  We had the bus men on strike.  In practically every section we have had strikes or people threatening to go on strike.</P>
      <P>Anybody who is serious about the welfare of the country must consider the root causes of the failure of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Anybody who has travelled through this city in the past couple of days must realise that, if the bin men's strike goes on much longer, a terrible health hazard will be created.  I cannot understand why that strike has not been settled before now.  If it lasts much longer we must suggest that the Army be brought in to ensure that a health hazard is not created in the streets of Dublin.  The Minister and the Government will have to give very serious thought to this very serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> In regard to the postal and telephone strike I cannot understand why the Minister for Labour or the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has not met the people who have been on strike practically since the beginning of February. In counties like Donegal, Kerry, Mayo and Galway we have no telephones.  We have no post.  We have reached a critical stage in the life of every person in the western areas.  Sometimes I wonder do the Government realise the hardship they are causing to thousands and tens of thousands of poor people living in those areas because of the inactivity of those two Ministers.  This strike must end sooner or later.  I appeal to the Minister for Labour, who is seen to be very inactive so far as these strikes are concerned, to meet these people and try to get a fair solution for all sides.</P>
    <P>The next strike we are faced with concerns the punt and sterling.  Nobody outside Ireland seems to be interested in the punt at present.  I was talking to an Englishman last week who informed me that he had never seen a punt in his life.  I went into a foreign bank that would not even change one.  A money exchange bank offered me 50p for the punt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we cannot discuss sterling or the punt on this Estimate.  The Minister for Labour has no responsibility for that.  On strikes, when Deputies are dealing with industrial relations it is in order to mention them, but we cannot debate them.  Most of these belong to another Minister's area; some may not belong to Ministers' areas at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I was endeavouring to put things in perspective. I wished to explain what I shall talk about later on, in the short time allocated to me.  The country is well aware of its dreadful state as far as strikes are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to see what causes the present unrest.  For once, I agree with Deputy Moore who spoke earlier.  I agree that the Minister will have to look at the number of unions we have here. For every organisation or craft we <Col N="1419" /> should have one union, one boss and one craft that that union represents.  It is shocking to think that there are between 80 and 90 unions in a country as small as Ireland with a population of only 2,500,000.</P>
    <P>The unions blame employers; the employers blame the unions; both sides should put their own house in order.  The unions will have to decide that there are too many here in different industries, and come together.  If they did come together, the workers would be better represented; it would be far easier to get on with the bosses, and productivity would increase.</P>
    <P>The manpower offices are doing a tremendously good job.  The Minister for Defence, when announcing the increases for the Defence Forces, appealed to young men to join the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  He said, as I have said at different times, that we are short of young men in the armed forces at present.  Young people should be encouraged and it should be explained to them that very good wages and conditions are available to people working in the armed forces.  We have about 15,000 people working full-time in these forces, but the establishment is short.</P>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister for Labour that a recruitment drive should be carried on in all the manpower offices throughout the country.  Many constituents come to Deputies, particularly those serving in a country area, looking for work in the county council, in factories or in different State organisations. Normally, we must refer them to the manpower office, which is a good thing. The manpower offices, however, are not tapping a large source of employment. This State is ready, willing and able to employ thousands of men in the armed forces.  The Minister for Labour might take a note of this and see if this type of recruitment could be undertaken.</P>
    <P>AnCO are one of the best semi-State bodies under the Department of Labour. They are tackling a difficult problem, which needs to be tackled.  There are too many people in some crafts and not enough in others.  We must increase the number of our technical colleges and expand <Col N="1420" /> them, and expand the role of AnCO.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour recently, in the newspapers, invited Irishmen from abroad to come home and work here. We would welcome Irishmen back, but we should be tackling our own problem first.  We should be tackling the figure of nearly 100,000 on the unemployment register and finding alternative employment for these people who find themselves in the unfortunate position of being on unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  If these jobs which the Minister is talking about are available, surely some of our own unemployed could be retrained through AnCO?  They should be given priority, as far as these jobs are concerned.</P>
    <P>The fault does not lie with the people unemployed; they are not told about the alternative employment available to them if they are retrained.  We need more education in this field.  There should be notices in all the unemployment offices throughout the country, pointing out the jobs available here for people and the grants available to retrain them, if they would allow themselves to be retrained. When redundancies occur in a factory, it is easy to put oneself on the unemployment exchange register and to hope for a vacancy in a similar type of factory.  The Minister should give a lot more thought to re-employing and retraining these people in the different walks of life.</P>
    <P>It amazes me to find that the AnCO centres have no course available at which young agricultural students can learn modern forms of farming.  I suggest to the Minister that, if what I am saying is correct, he would see to it that AnCO provide courses in modern methods of beef, pig and poultry production, and even marine biology courses could be included. Such courses would be of special benefit to people in midland and western areas.  It is important that these people be properly trained.  As this century goes on only people who are trained extremely well in farming and marine biology are going to be successful in this increasingly competitive market.  A university course in marine biology covers something in the neighbourhood of three years, but perhaps six-month courses or <Col N="1421" /> even three-month courses could be arranged for small farmers in Connemara whose farms are at inlets of the sea to encourage the production of mussels, cockles and oysters and thereby increase employment.</P>
    <P>AnCO are doing a good job but they must expand further into the different trades and occupations that suit rural Ireland particularly.  It is all very fine to train bricklayers, television mechanics and so forth, but there are a lot of other types of jobs available here which cannot be filled because we lack people with the expert knowledge to fill them.  I ask the Minister to have a look at this and if there are not AnCO courses to suit the farming community to see to it that such courses are introduced. Recently I visited a sheep farm and I realised that it would be news to most of us to learn that some modern sheep farmers throughout the world are trying to arrange that all the lambs will be born at the same time of the year.  Ewes are picked which are expected to produce two or three lambs each and attempts are being made to get those ewes to lamb twice a year.</P>

      <P>I am trying to emphasise the need for specialisation as far as AnCO are concerned.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree that in giving examples occasionally I am not straying too far from the course.  The point I am making regarding AnCO is that if young men were trained in these courses they could look to a very profitable market at present.  That is all I have to say on that. I want to get that message across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a criticism of AnCO.  The ladies who are catering for the AnCO students at the different centres are not getting an adequate supplement for the full board which they supply.  The Minister probably realises that the sum they are paid for bed, breakfast and evening meal and three meals a day on Saturday and Sunday is £17 per week per student and the students are in the <Col N="1422" /> age group 16 to 18 years roughly.  In putting down a question to the Minister recently I told him that £17 per week was not adequate at this time.  If we are going to train our students properly they must be boarded in good homes and given good food.  To ensure that we must pay the landladies catering for the AnCO centres a fair sum.  I ask the Minister to look into this.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is not in order when discussing the Department of Labour to mention the terrible state in which we find ourselves on the western seaboard as far as strikes are concerned.</P>

      <P>I want to make a point about the distressful condition in which we find ourselves, particularly in north-west County Donegal at present and I suggest that the Minister for Labour must take a lot of the blame for this because of his inactivity.  We have no post, no phones and no petrol, and we are afraid of our lives that in the next couple of months we are going to have no tourists either.  Tourists cannot post letters, we have no automatic dialling and they are afraid they will get no petrol.  Therefore, the main industry in Donegal, tourism, is going to be extremely hard hit.  I cannot understand that when travelling from Donegal to Dublin I can buy as much English petrol as I want&mdash;I must apologise for doing it&mdash;at 87p a gallon and when I come to this part of the country I cannot get any petrol at all.  I do not want to dwell on the petrol situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as strikes are concerned, particularly in the west and the north-west, the four Ministers most <Col N="1423" /> responsible are the Minister for Economic Planning and Development&mdash;he has been called the Minister for disaster&mdash;the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Minister for Labour, particularly the last because he has been given the responsibility of bringing peace and harmony to the various industries throughout the length and breadth of the country.  It is not that he is afraid to talk; he is well able to do that on his own behalf, but over the last couple of months he has been remarkably silent as far as negotiations with different industries are concerned. The time is coming&mdash;as the Government will find in the next two weeks&mdash;when the people going to the polls will give the Minister for Labour and the other Ministers the answer they deserve for their inactivity throughout the entire industrial field.</P>
      <P>Finally it is not only the Minister for Labour who has to take the responsibility. It is the entire Fianna Fáil Ministerial team, particularly the four I have mentioned.  It is not so long since we saw the big slogan on the walls to the effect that Fianna Fáil would get the country moving again.  People are beginning to ask if it is moving to a full stop on the total industrial scene.  The entire nation&mdash;and certainly the entire county of Donegal&mdash;is grinding slowly to a halt. Each and every one of us eventually will have to pay for the total inactivity of the present Fianna Fáil Government and the disgraceful way in which they are running the country.</P>

      <P>It is easy enough for the Deputy opposite, like so many people when they choose, to blame everything on the Government.  No Government ever came into office with such a priority aim as this Government&mdash;the priority of creating jobs.  I was appalled when I read the following article in this morning's <i>Irish Independent:</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A National Understanding was acceptable in principle to the ITGWU as a first step towards a planned economic and social programme&mdash;<Col N="1424" /> but not at the expense of unsatisfactory terms,...</P>
    <P>The article went on:</P>
    <P>This was stated by ITGWU vice-president Mr. John Carroll at yesterday's ICTU conference on the proposed National Understanding in Dublin.  He told delegates that the terms proposed were not good enough and that his members had overwhelmingly rejected them.</P>
    <P>He said also that the Government had ridden to power on the crest of a wave of promises, including the creation of full employment.</P>
    <P>The absence of an agreed and acceptable National Understanding would not excuse the Government if it failed to go ahead with those measures which could be of value in dealing with our economic and social problems.</P>
    <P>How can we implement our policies when there is no restraint?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have spelt out that discipline is needed if they are to create jobs.  The writer of one of today's leading articles pointed out that the offer made was extremely generous in view of the economic prospects facing us because of the current oil shortage.</P>
      <P>The morale of the nation must be pretty low at the moment because of the non-acceptance of the national understanding. As the old saying goes, the darkest hour is just before the dawn; and I feel, coming from a long line of optimists, that we may well pull out of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strife going on at the moment throughout the trade union movement is a great source of worry to people unconnected with that movement, the ordinary people in the street.  One can realise the seriousness of the situation when we find that certain speakers at the delegate conference yesterday said that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have now virtually <Col N="1425" /> no right to negotiate on behalf of individual unions.  We have come a long way from when we had suffering masses of people.  Only recently a Dublin Corporation colleague of mine, Labour Councillor Tom Duffy, shocked me when he told me that he well remembered a time in Dublin when one could see a man carrying a little coffin under his arm to bury a child in Glasnevin cemetery because that man could not afford to pay for the funeral expenses.  In 1932 we had 18,000 families, numbering over 100,000 people, living from six to 14 to a room.  We had the worst slums of any city in Europe.  We have come a long way since then with our industrial growth.  I know I may be a little bit out of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The increase in prosperity in the last 50 years of what has always been known as the working class people far outweighs the wildest dreams of what James Connolly or &ldquo;Big Jim&rdquo; Larkin felt could possibly be realised.  Our people have become one of the best fed nations in Europe, if not the best fed, according to United Nations' statistics.  We have come from a poverty stricken nation to be a reasonably prosperous one.  Are we to throw all this away because we cannot agree on an ordered wage agreement in which the less well off sections of the community can get their share?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand the dilemma of the Minister and the Government in regard to people who do what are known as the dirty jobs, like dustbin clearance, <Col N="1426" /> sewerage works and so forth, who have always tended to be at the lower end of the scale.  I have always wished to see the unions agree to a minimum wage, but they will not do so.  I should like to see people recognise that there are some categories in regard to whom the unions should be able to agree among themselves that those people should get a certain sum of money because of the unpleasant nature of their work.  I believe that people on all sides of the House are deeply concerned about yesterday's decision and the majority rejection.  Is this a turning point in our economic progress?  I do not believe it is.  Will the Government be able to say that they are implementing this scheme, that the employers are implementing it and that those who are willing to avail of the national understanding can do so?  Can the Government do that while others stay out of the national understanding?</P>
    <P>A number of points about this matter were mentioned to me last night, but I did not see any of them mentioned in the newspapers today.  Some working people found themselves disagreeing fundamentally with the national understanding in regard to the right to strike. They felt that by accepting the national understanding they would not have the right to withdraw their labour.  Some suggested that there might be an employer who might try to make life very difficult for his employees when he knew they could not strike under the national understanding.  I do not know how widespread that view is.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing that the national understanding was rejected because the first time the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the employers came together with the Government in a parliamentary setting was at the press conference when the Taoiseach was able to announce that agreement had been reached.  This is the first time we saw what appeared to be a fine partnership being established.  It is a pity this has not been realised.</P>
    <P>I have been told that the wages of people in the public service are not comparable with those of people in the private sector.  I am told that certain skilled people in, say, the Office of Public <Col N="1427" /> Works, whether they be mechanics, bricklayers or whatever, will receive more working for a semi-State company or for a private builder, who may have to pay over the odds into the man's hand.  Because they are in such short supply they can literally set their own price, and I understand that this is one of the reasons there is such a shortage.  I am told that a bricklayer's wage starts at £63 in the public service while in the semi-State bodies it is £86.  I do not know how accurate those figures are, but that is what I am told.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the breakdown existing in communications between people, in some instances at management level and in others at floor level. Generally speaking we have good management/staff relations here, but in certain specific areas we do not have. One way of ascertaining if there are bad management/staff relations is to examine the labour turnover in a particular section to see if in one area over a period of, say, 20 years something of the order of 2,000 manual workers have changed, gone away or left the job to go somewhere else, and in another sector in, say, the same Department, only two or three people have left over a period of five or six years.  I have in mind a particular section in a public Department I shall not name.  The manpower service and various other agencies under the aegis of the Minister for Labour, when there are strikes taking place or when there is trouble in a firm, must ascertain what the labour turnover has been like: whether there have been good management/staff relations with a very low turnover.  Sometimes wages might even be less, and we are talking about the minimum union rates.  Everybody in this House today knows that if one wants to engage a person of certain skills, perhaps a bricklayer or somebody of that type, one must pay over the odds to get him.  In Dublin Corporation we are experiencing tremendous difficulty particularly in getting bricklayers.  These are the factors that must be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>We must examine our methods of conciliation.  So far they have worked <Col N="1428" /> very well.  I have heard so many people say &ldquo;Why rock the boat?&rdquo;  Everything to do with labour relations, the conciliation in the Labour Court and so on, has worked very successfully.  It has fallen down in a few instances only, and that but recently.  Perhaps now is the time to carry out a review, but I am not in a position to know as much as the Minister about the instances I have quoted.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important thing I have to say is that this Government have no intention of panicking.  This Government will not lose their heads.  The overall situation will be considered and reviewed.  I am aware that there is great anxiety and insecurity at present; nobody denies that.  I am satisfied that ultimately when the Taoiseach speaks to the people he will reassure them and they will feel confident about our future. I feel confident, though perhaps somewhat despondent.  However, I am not lacking in confidence for the future. At times one feels lower than at others. There is nothing we want to see more than people happy, successful and in regular employment.  I know it to be the Government view that people in steady employment, whose employment is not in jeopardy in any way, have a responsibility to those who are not in employment or to those who are in insecure employment.</P>
    <P>Already the Fine Gael spokesman, Deputy Mitchell, has said that it is the view of his party that the 15 per cent offered under the national understanding was more than the country could afford. Yet it has been rejected.  But, if more than this is sought, it will jeopardise employment in industry competing on world markets.  We are all aware of this. This is the A, B, C of any lesson in economics.  It is basic and we all know it. Nevertheless the Government feel it is people in secure employment who must show restraint.  I should like to see some of these people coming forward.  For example, I should like to hear the public service unions announce that they are in favour of this national understanding.  I think most of us here are satisfied that, if instead of having a delegate conference to decide whether or not a national agreement be accepted, we had a <Col N="1429" /> referendum put to the people, there is no doubt that it would be carried overwhelmingly.</P>
    <P>I am constantly meeting people&mdash;I am sure other Members are also&mdash;who say to me &ldquo;You have a 20-seat majority. Why don't you govern?&rdquo; I say to them &ldquo;What do you want us to do?  What should we do with our 20-seat majority? Do you want us to set up a sort of dictatorship and say we are going to do this, that or the other?&rdquo;  Let us be specific.  What do they mean?  Do they want us, as they have accused us of doing in the past, to use the jackboot?  Is that what they want?  We are a democracy, a responsible people, supposedly. I believe that basically we are, because I am confident that if this was put to people in a referendum it would be carried overwhelmingly.  Democracy works only with the consent of the people. As a Government we can set down the guidelines only.  We can only say &ldquo;These are our targets.  This is the way we have planned the growth of the economy.  This will happen only if you co-operate with us&rdquo;.  This is the only way.  Otherwise you can open up the doors, let the dictators take over and spell it out, as has been done in other totalitarian states.</P>
    <P>What frightens a lot of people is that people who are less than interested in our democratic way of life are chipping it quietly away.  I know some of these people who have gone up for election, who have been overwhelmingly defeated, perhaps gaining 150 votes in a general election.  The next thing one reads their names as certain trade union officials, not all but some of them.  How do these people get so much power when the people rejected them outright?  They then fly their names under a flag, saying what they are, for instance, the Communist Party of Ireland.  How do these people get such influence?  How are they allowed to have such influence?  To come back to ourselves, what are we doing about it?  We say to the trade unions: what are you doing about it?  The trade unions say &ldquo;This is our problem.  You are not to interfere&rdquo;.  It is the same with the Post Office Workers' Union.  The present dispute is hurting me as much as <Col N="1430" /> anybody else, and it is hurting the postmen themselves, hurting them damned hard.  I have had telephone calls from the wives of some of them.  I know that if in the morning it was put to them&mdash;indeed if it had been put to them 13 weeks ago&mdash;they would have gone back.  We are dealing with a splinter group.  If the Coalition were in power the same would apply.  I remember we had very bad strikes during the Coalition's term of office.  The then Minister for Labour Deputy M. O'Leary, was flying around the world because he did not consider there was any urgency in settling the strikes.  Now he is waving a banner in Kildare Street.  Who does he think he is kidding?</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the withholding of labour by maintenance men in Dublin Corporation.  Rubbish is piling up on our streets.  Regardless of who is in Government, if small militant groups see an opportunity coming up to election time&mdash;local, European or general&mdash;they call for a strike.  They hope that by the time the election is held, the people will be so fed up with strikes that they will throw out the Government party members.  This happened in Britain.  If we as a Government give in to this kind of blackmail we will be letting down the Opposition as much as we are letting down ourselves and the people of Ireland.  We must do things in an orderly way.  If we give in to one group, at the next election five or six unions will call strikes.  People will not want elections because they will lead to strikes.</P>
    <P>We must be aware of all these things and know what is happening to us.  We must know what we are doing.  Are we tearing ourselves asunder?  For three years we have been the leader in the European table.  Our unemployment rate has been reduced; in two years we have almost doubled the income tax allowance for a married man; we have abolished rates on houses, car tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe Deputy Horgan is as concerned as I am that a national wage agreement be made, that we have orderly negotiations, that we do not have a free for all and that, as a trade unionist in Britain said, those with the biggest snouts do not get the most out of the trough.  This is what can happen.  We have seen small militant groups, with enormous clout, holding the country up to ransom.  Usually the cry is to call out the Army to solve every situation.  If we had the Army out permanently we might as well have a military State because the Army would be doing everything.</P>
      <P>I do not believe anybody doubts the sincerity of this Government's wish to give people the dignity of a job.  I am deeply concerned about our school-leavers and university graduates who are the future of the country.  The present situation must be resolved very soon.  It is essential that agreement is reached as quickly as possible because we could witness a situation where these young people will be forced to go to other countries where their skills will be appreciated. This means we will have what is known as the brain drain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From reading the Minister's speech no one can fail to be impressed with the kind of attention that is being given to our young people whose future is in jeopardy.  If things go very badly, people in employment might not be so secure.  If factories close because of unreasonable demands, those people will be on our dole queues and will no longer pay tax. People in the public service may find one day that there is no money to meet their cheques because the kitty has run dry. Running a country is like running a business.  It must be properly managed. One can only spend what one is getting in.  One can only borrow if one has assets, if the growth rate is right.  The EEC banks may say that they have looked at our economy, that our growth rate is good, that our job creation is all right and that they would give us what we want, but we have never had the philosophy of borrowing to meet our social welfare payments.  Primarily we borrowed money to create jobs and we do not want to be burdened even further <Col N="1433" /> by servicing these loans by more borrowing. All this relates to the acceptance or non-acceptance of the national understanding. I believe the difficulties will be resolved; the alternative is unthinkable and I cannot conceive of anything other than ultimate acceptance.</P>
    <P>There are various bodies who would like the Minister to intervene in their disputes. If he does so in one case he will be required to intervene in all disputes and ultimately we will have a Minister for strikes.  The unions and working people do not want this.  My constituents have rubbish piled outside their doors and in other areas people are using their cars to take away their rubbish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Horgan has seen fit to call for a quorum. I hope he does not disagree with anything I have said.  We all want our country to continue along the road of progress and I am sorry he has interrupted me in this manner.  I hope when <Col N="1434" /> he speaks that he will be equally sincere in facing up to the problems which confront us.  I had thought he was above that kind of behaviour.</P>
      <P>In his opening speech the Minister referred to the fact that we had achieved so much in so little time with the setting up of various types of youth employment schemes.  He stated:</P>
      <P>The proposals for a national understanding which subsequently emerged provide that if a significant shortfall in these targets seems likely a special joint public and private sector employment programme will be launched up to a ceiling of 5,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>This was welcomed by the unions as a sign of the Government's intention to back up their promises with real action. These 5,000 jobs&mdash;and possibly many more&mdash;may well be in jeopardy; I do not know.  I do not want to be a Jeremiah and I remain optimistic.  The people need reassurance and they will get it.  Ultimately sense will prevail.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the proposal to set up a national hire agency.  I welcome this.  They will employ people as required and supply services to firms for appropriate fees.  The agency will take over the job sometimes carried out by small private agencies.  This is an excellent scheme, the need for which has often been mentioned in the past.  The Minister said that the problem of providing suitable work for young people demanded a many-sided response involving the co-ordination and integration of policies ranging across many areas of activity.  Of course that is so.  It is an extremely complex matter involving, among others, the Departments of Education, Social Welfare and the Environment. In the co-ordination of the efforts of the various Departments concerned great care must be taken because even in this kind of work there are certain demarcation lines.  The Public Service can be very jealous of anybody encroaching on their territory but in this case all concerned are working together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The much maligned employment action team must be congratulated on the success of their efforts.  The participation in 1978 of 6,400 young people in this <Col N="1435" /> scheme justifies the setting up of the group and the types of schemes they implement. There was reference to the work experience programme in respect of which there is a target for this year of 6,000 placements.  This represents a 100 per cent increase and is further proof of the Government's sincerity in their undertaking to work towards full employment. There has not been any deviation from that aspiration but the success or otherwise of this target will depend on the response during the coming weeks from the various sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that of the 3,000 people who were engaged in last year's work experience programme 500 have taken up permanent employment, If these young people had not been engaged in work under this programme last year they might not have been able to find the kind of jobs that they are in now.  They might have got out of the work habit and work is a habit.  One can get out of it as quickly as he can get into it.  One's confidence can be shattered by the inability to find a job.  This is another reason why this work experience programme is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to tell the Minister that in Dublin Corporation we are availing fully of all the grants available from the environment improvement scheme.  There is an excellent team of officials in our community and environment departments who are ensuring that the maximum use is made of this scheme in Dublin.  This year many grant-type schemes will be implemented. For instance, work will be carried out along the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal areas which need a big facelift. This will give young people something to do during the summer months and it provides us with the opportunity of clearing up parts of the city and parts of the country also which need attention.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that on the employment scene the increase in the manufacturing area at the end of September 1978 was 5,600 compared with September 1977.  This is quite an achievement so far as the manufacturing industry is concerned because many of these concerns are mechanised to such <Col N="1436" /> an extent now that they require only a minimum number of workers.  Some of them might provide jobs for 20, 30 or 40 people.  Naturally we are anxious to have factories that would give employment to much larger numbers but the increase of 5,600 in the work force in that area is substantial.</P>
    <P>We have been told that at the end of December last there were 7,000 more people employed than was the position at the end of 1977 and this increase was at a time when the unemployment figures were increasing in the other countries of Europe.  This was the only country in which the figures were reducing. It is worth referring to the increase of 43 per cent in the number of vacancies notified to the National Manpower Service compared with the figure for 1977.  As the Minister said, this fact should be sufficient answer to Opposition suggestions that unemployment decreases were due to emigration. However, it would be regrettable if this trend in the unemployment situation were to suffer a setback as a result of an irresponsible attitude in wage bargaining or in a failure to come to terms with what is realistic in terms of wage and salary increases.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred also to work sharing.  It will be interesting to watch for developments in this area but in a climate in which so many people appear to want all and not to wish to share with anyone what they have, this aspiration may present problems.  The trade unions have indicated their willingness to examine the prospect of work sharing, but I should like them to go further and to encourage work sharing, to work positively in this direction.  Because of the experience we had recently when we witnessed people clamouring for their own way, the work sharing concept may seem rather vague.</P>
    <P>Regarding the placement service of the National Manpower Service it is good to hear that the number of placement officers has been increased from 52 to 122.  I suggest to the Minister that he consider using some of the community information offices for this service. These offices have a direct link with the National Social Service Council.  In my <Col N="1437" /> area in Crumlin we have an office of the Department of Social Welfare so that people need not go to Aras Mhic Dhiarmada for information.  Also, I think we are unique as a community information office in that we have made the premises available to elected representatives of all political parties for the purpose of holding clinics.  I believe it would be welcomed if placement officers from the Department of Labour were to visit there once or twice a week to give information to the people in the area.  We are talking about a catchment area of 25,000 or 30,000 people.  It may in fact be more than that because people from Ballyfermot would also come in there although the Department of Labour may have their office up there.  Community information offices are something which might be looked at.</P>
    <P>I hope I have been constructive.  I hope that what I have had to say is useful.  I hope that I am right and I do not doubt the sincerity of people in this House when they say that they do not want to see this country being run into the ground by a few militants.  We have to stand together in this independent democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking on this issue one must be conscious of the disruption that has been caused to our society today by various occurrences which would seem to be the result of affluence rather than of need.  The greatest disruption in our society today is the Post Office strike.  In referring to this strike one must ask several questions.  We were not faced with disruption of this type during the Coalition period of office.  In fact, during that period the members of that union seemed to be out of communication with their leaders in relation to wage increases. They seemed to fall behind in relation to other sectors which seemed to progress.  The members of this branch of the labour movement did not seem to be properly consulted and properly looked after by the leaders of their unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask: is the same thing happening here today?  The people who are out marching on pickets have no joy in that. I have absolutely no doubt that they are not happy walking up and down on <Col N="1438" /> picket lines.  I wonder indeed are the union leaders in communion with their members and is there proper communication between the executive of these unions and the members on the ground?  Certain sectors have been underpaid and the Minister has acknowledged this.  The attempt by this Government to bring this strike to an equitable conclusion is not being reflected in certain positions being taken by people in very powerful positions in this movement.  Who is being hurt in this situation?  We are all being hurt by it. The people concerned on the ground are being hurt.  The small businessman is being hurt.  Indeed, the national economy is being hurt.  Are the union leaders being hurt?  I ask that question very seriously. Have these people who are really responsible for it got a vested interest in making sure this position continues?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy so early in his speech.  It is in order, in dealing with industrial relations, to mention strikes but not to debate them.  I would ask the Deputy to remember that rule.  There is no problem about mentioning particular strikes but to go into detail on them would not be in order and the Post Office strike is a matter for another Minister and not for the Minister for Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisJFox" hpid="Mr. Fox Mr. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express sympathy with those who are waiting for their allowances to come through, with mothers who are waiting for their children's allowances, with people who should be in receipt of communications from relatives abroad.  I hope that sanity will come back into the whole spectrum of communications here.  I would hope that some degree of objective progressive thought would be brought to bear by the people responsible in the various sectors of our industrial bodies to make sure that the national understanding, which is so comprehensive in its nature, will be given a second chance and be given an opportunity to bring this country forward on the road to full employment on which we started out so bravely when elected in 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt that the <Col N="1439" /> responsible attitude of this Government is not being understood or reciprocated by certain sections of our community. There is absolutely no doubt that the framework which we as a Government have instituted and put at the disposal of this country is not being utilised for the progressive benefit of everybody in our society.  We in this Government have initiated many measures for the opening up of employment opportunities for our school leavers, for the young people coming on to the labour market.  We have brought in industries of a very high quality.  We have created employment opportunities and educational opportunities to take advantage of these industries coming in and to give our people an opportunity that they have never had in our history before.  There are more opportunities available here today than have ever been available in the history of the island, and it is a pity that the comprehensive nature of the Government's initiatives is not being acknowledged and taken up by certain selfish sections of a small portion of the labour movement leadership who appear to be out of touch with their members on the ground.</P>
    <P>If the initiatives this Government have brought about were understood, the acceptance of them would mean a better life for everybody.  It would mean a better prospect of employment for the young people coming out of school.  It would mean a better life for the infirm, the old and for the people in work. Unless we have a total commitment to the progress of our country by everybody in it, we are going to continue to have disruption.  It is a pity that this recognition of our dependence on one another, which this Government are very much aware of, is not more widespread.  If one section of the community decides to step out of line with another, then in the complex society in which we live no legislation can say that we must do something because somebody else is being hurt.  There has to be a recognition by everybody in our society that disruptive tactics are going to have a very serious effect on people. Those originally taking the action may <Col N="1440" /> not be aware that they are hurting other people and that the disruption which is taking place in our society at the moment is hurting virtually everybody.  It is a great pity that a sense of responsibility is not being exercised by certain people who should know better.</P>
    <P>The opportunities here at the moment are unparalleled in our history.  It is our own fault if they are not grasped.  The European market for various goods is vast. There is no question now of finding markets for goods; the markets are there.  If we can produce the goods, we must do so.  We must move into line with the very best in Europe and we must have parity with European services, standards and wages.  There is no doubt that we are moving in that direction. By and large our costs are a lot less than European costs and in some cases our wages are at least of European standards and above.  So the catch-cry that wages have got to be in line with European wages is often false because very often our salary scales are in line with the best in Europe.  Very often our costs, particularly in relation to housing, are very much less than those obtaining in Europe.  So it is a very objective fact that the standard of life which we have here is in many cases better than that obtaining in many European countries.  It is a pity that this fact is not recognised and that it is not got across more clearly to our people.  There is no point in saying that one has to have a very large salary if one's housing costs and living costs are very much lower and one's large salary is going to create conditions of difficulty in other sectors.  We have a balance here that has worked very well and if we can get ourselves back to an even industrial keel, there is no doubt we can forge ahead and be European leaders and indeed world leaders.  There is a real need for a return to sanity and for a new national spirit of commitment so that our national understanding can be made to work for the benefit of all the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was with the Minister for Labour this morning at the opening of another AnCO training centre in Cookstown Industrial Estate.  It <Col N="1441" /> was a pleasure to see here the opportunities and training facilities offered to young people.  AnCO training centres are more than a half-way house between the schools, the unemployment queues and work.  A spirit of happiness permeates the centre, and hope for employment at the end.  The spirit there is somewhat different from the spirit abroad within society at the moment.  In that training centre there is an evident bond between the workers: there is hope for something at the end of what perhaps has been to many a very trying time.  I wish this industrial estate every success and I also wish the new AnCO training centre every success.</P>
      <P>AnCO gives training in many of the basic skills, such as carpentry, metalwork, driving and so on, which are required to continue to build the modern Ireland and to make progress.  It is gratifying to note that there has been increased money for AnCO from the European Social Fund to enable them perform their duties.</P>
      <P>I also wish the new centre to be established in Loughlinstown every success, and I regret that to date we have not been able to establish a centre in North Wicklow, where land is the problem.  We must continue to make every effort to obtain a suitable site so that an AnCO centre can be established in Wicklow to provide for the young people there.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the wonderful work done by the staff and management of AnCO.  It is great to think of the excellent take-up of the people who go through the AnCO courses.  While visiting the Cookstown centre I met some employers who told me that they had employed graduates from the various training centres and they were very pleased with their performance. Some of them said that they will return to AnCO for further employees.  For these reasons I should like to see the establishment of more AnCO centres throughout the country.  They are an essential part of our overall development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the general gloomy atmosphere in society one fails to see the spirit of hope and trust that is evident in the training centres.  In industrial relations <Col N="1442" /> it appears that a certain few are trying to manoeuvre things towards their way of thinking.  It is vital for us to achieve a proper spirit of co-operation between workers, unions, management and the Government if we are to develop.  We also need mutual tolerance. No sector is perfect and each sector must try to perfect itself.  It is only in this way that we can get an overall concerted approach.  It would be great if there was a spirit of co-operation, mutual tolerance and understanding within society as a whole.  At the moment various groups seem to be afraid that they will be left behind and will lose out&mdash;they are scrambling for identification.  With co-operation and tolerance, we could achieve an organised approach which would benefit all.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker, Deputy Fox, referred to the weaker sections of the community that are being caught up and are suffering from industrial disputes.  It is to be hoped that the industrial dispute referred to will soon be settled, not alone in justice to the people in the dispute but in justice to the employers and others involved. It would be relatively simple to settle a dispute at an enormous cost to another sector, but that is not on.  We are all dependent on each other and part of a chain, and when one link in the chain breaks, disharmony and suffering follow.  The widows, the old and the poorer sections of the community generally are the people who suffer most. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure that each sector progresses, that no one is left behind and that strikes must be a last resort.</P>
    <P>Present strikes are symptomatic of our present society.  Each day in the newspapers there are headlines in relation to strikes and possible strikes.  This all adds to the gloom and to lack of trust and confidence.  Different sectors feel that they must make some sort of an impact and must compete in the overall situation.</P>
    <P>What we should strive for is a cooperative spirit, an awareness by all of the problems affecting the community. We have had examples, unfortunately, of persons in management being inadequate for one reason or another, <Col N="1443" /> resulting in job losses.  Therefore, one of our aims should be to try to improve our management structure.</P>
    <P>We are inclined to speak of statistics, of numbers who are unemployed, but I often wonder whether we reflect sufficiently on the fact that each number represents an individual with his or her cares, anxieties, worries.  I wonder if we reflect sufficiently on the effects of strikes on the dependants of participants. Most people in our society like to see their neighbours doing well.  This is illustrated particularly in times of disaster. It is a pity that such feelings of neighbourly concern do not always come forward in the field of industrial relations.  I have met many people on strike, I have met their dependants, and all of them have told me they did not want such a situation&mdash;all of them would have preferred harmony in their work-place as well as in their homes.</P>
    <P>We are all anxious for full employment but there are people pursuing claims to unachievable ends to the detriment of the entire community, particularly to those out of work.  Driving recklessly towards an unattainable end not only does not help anybody but damages the entire community.  There must be realism and moderation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there must be a balanced approach in our industrial relations if we are to achieve the excellent aim of full employment.  I am glad to be a member of a party who have had the courage to set a full employment target and to do everything possible to achieve it.  At the moment, in times of great leisure from work, people cannot enjoy that leisure because of lack of security at work.  That security would lead people to greater creativity and inventiveness during leisure.  I particularly do not like to hear a man in a job say to a man who has not got a job &ldquo;You have so much time&rdquo;.  I was in a position once when I had a lot of time but I found I became completely disorganised without any form of lifestyle.  A society can thrive only when there is a good balance between work satisfaction and leisure.  I sincerely hope for a situation when all will strive towards such a balance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> Full employment is an ambitious goal for any Government.  I welcome the National Hire Agency and wish them success.  It is a novel approach to our conditions, but the setting up of the agency shows an earnestness on the part of the Government to achieve full employment.  I note that the agency will be the employers of the people on their books and that the agency will be responsible for payment of wages, social security contributions and other workers' commitments.</P>
    <P>I look forward to seeing it actively involved. I am glad the Minister is anxious to establish it at the earliest possible date.  Sometimes it takes a long time for legislation to come before the House. The Minister has decided, pending the enactment of legislation, to establish a limited company to perform the functions of the agency.  That is an excellent idea.  I look forward to seeing the National Hire Agency performing many roles and many functions.</P>
    <P>I have had many contacts with school teachers and principals.  I am glad it has become easier&mdash;I am not saying very easy; I am not saying there are not still difficulties&mdash;for young people to obtain employment.  Three or four years ago it was extremely difficult.  While the situation has eased somewhat, it has not eased sufficiently.  It is vital that our young people can get their right, the right to a job.  Some very useful schemes have been introduced by the Department of Labour, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Education to provide employment.</P>
    <P>The environmental improvement scheme which is administered by the Department of the Environment operates in conjuction with the Department of Labour.  This scheme not only offers work of a certain duration to young people, but it also enables young people to have a direct input and commitment to the improvement of their society.  Young people are idealistic. Community leaders often speak about how desirable it is to have playing fields and parkland available to the community. People see a piece of waste ground and ask why cannot the local authority tidy it up for the benefit of the community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> This is where the environmental improvement scheme comes in and plays a very important role in the employment of young people.  They can see on their very doorstep small amenities which have been created for the benefit of the community and they can look at them with pleasure and say: &ldquo;I worked to establish that, and now the community can benefit&rdquo;.  The title &ldquo;environmental improvement scheme&rdquo; is a good one.  Last year some of these schemes were curtailed or abandoned because of an industrial dispute.  I hope that will not occur this year and that communities will be able to achieve their goal and their ambition.</P>
    <P>The work experience programme is another venture by the Department of Labour.  It is useful in that it offers a young person the opportunity to gain experience of industrial life.  The gap between the classroom and the factory floor is enormous.  Teachers should be better acquainted with what happens on the floor of a local industry.  The work experience programme is a step in that direction.  Much more could be done. Very often people work in cells or in units.  Teachers try to educate and lead young people without having regard to where they will have to go to get employment.  There should be greater co-ordination between the classroom and the local industry.  This is a vital part of the education of young people.  I should like to see a greater involvement in that direction.  It is possible, but it would take a lot of organising at both levels.  I welcome the work experience programme and hope that it can be enlarged.</P>

The Council noted that growth is currently strongest in those countries with the lowest rates of inflation.

The extent to which wage rates in Britain may have influenced such bargaining is not clear, since there is no direct or regular relationship in pay rates as between the two countries.

    <P>As a contribution to the National Understanding for Economic and Social Development, the Government have indicated that they would provide for the establishment of a National Enterprise Agency as one of a number of measures to promote employment.  The functions of the proposed agency would be to establish organisational responsibility for the commercial exploitation of new development opportunities by the State where such opportunities are not being exploited by the private sector, and to provide a mechanism to ensure that commercially oriented research and development was effectively applied in the economy.  It is also envisaged that <Col N="1448" /> the agency would engage directly in manufacturing, service and trading activities either by itself or in partnership with other organisations in the public or private sector and that it would be operated on a commercial basis.  There would be appropriate representation of employer and trade union interests on its board of directors.  It is envisaged that the agency would function as a self-contained entity; hence no special problems of co-ordination between it and existing State-sponsored bodies are anticipated.  However, to the extent that the need for co-ordination arises, it will be provided for.  Finally, as to the particular areas of activity in which the agency would become involved, these would be decided upon primarily by the agency itself in the light of its own assessments of investment possibilities.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the result of the ballot on the national understanding, as there is such great merit in the proposal itself does the Minister not consider that the Government should proceed to establish the National Enterprise Agency?  Irrespective of any involvement in the national understanding package, this proposal has very considerable merit.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers consists of four sentences.  The first of these states that the rapid rail plan is not the only option for the future of suburban rail services. That is correct.  The second sentence, which quotes me as saying that the existing system could be modernised for less than a fifth of the cost of the rapid rail system, is also correct since the total cost of the rapid rail system is well in excess of £200 million, whereas the cost of modernising the existing suburban line from Howth to Bray would be £42 million or less, depending on which option is chosen.  The third sentence states that I blamed CIE for the delay in making a decision.  This is not accurate.  When asked why the Government had not yet taken a decision on the rapid rail proposal I replied that the Government had not yet received this plan for examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>

It is the sort of assumption that many people would make.  There is no proposal before the Government dealing with the entire transport system, rapid rail proposal or anything else in the Dublin area.  There has been a specific proposal relating only to the improvement of the existing rail network.</P>

      <P>The decision not to renew the term of office of the Women's Representative Committee arose from the significant duplication of roles between the committee and the Council for the Status of Women, the objectives of both of which included, <i>inter alia</i>, the preparation of submissions pressing for the implementation of the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women. Furthermore, there was also a duplication of roles with the Employment Equality Agency, which was set up in October 1977.  This body subsumed a substantial proportion of the work which, up to then, had been entrusted to the Women's Representative Committee.</P>
      <P>The question of establishing a national advisory body for women's affairs is a possibility which will be kept in mind, pending some experience of the new situation following the lapse of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1978 Annual Welfare Report of the Irish <Col N="1454" /> Centre in London does not claim that there has been an increase in emigration from Ireland in recent years in the age group mentioned by the Deputy.  In fact the statistics in the report record a decrease in the total numbers which attended the centre's welfare department and hostels during 1978 compared with 1977.  The report does, however, point out that 6.9 per cent of the applicants in 1978 were under 18 years of age compared with 5 per cent in 1977.</P>
      <P>These statistics could not be taken as an indication of the trend in emigration by age group from this country.  The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those compiled for intercensal periods by relating successive population figures to data for births and deaths in the same period.  In the absence of a census of population in 1976 recent trends in migration cannot be confirmed until the results of the census taken on 1 April 1979 become available.</P>
      <P>The Government are, of course, concerned that adequate youth employment opportunities are made available and employment policies have given priority to this objective.</P>

      <P>In 1976, Professor Dunican of the Department of Microbiology, UCG, commenced a project entitled &ldquo;The Production of Methane from Agricultural and Dairy Wastes&rdquo;.  Funds were provided under the University/Industry Co-operation Grants Scheme.  It was operated by the National Science Council at the time but has since been continued by the National Board for Science and Technology pending evaluation of various possible funding mechanisms. The purpose is to bring the skills of university researchers to bear on the many technical problems of the industrial sector.</P>
      <P>Under the UIC Scheme the board provides 75 per cent of funds required for projects and the remainder derives from firms who would hope to exploit the results of research.  The main aims of Professor Dunican's project were as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  To carry out a feasibility study, on the production of inexpensive packaged methane production plant for use with effluents from piggeries and from creameries.</P>
      <P>(2)  To carry out the research and development to test such packaged methane plants under laboratory and industrial situations.</P>
      <P>The project finished at the end of 1978 and has been most successful. Professor Dunican sees considerable opportunity for using his new digestion process throughout the country.  He sees the application in piggeries as a first, though important, step.  The development allows more methane to be obtained more quickly from organic wastes than was possible hitherto.  He is taking steps at present to get commercial applications underway.</P>
      <P>The advantages of treating animal waste for methane production are as follows: (1) energy is derived from the hydrocarbon methane; (2) pollution is reduced; (3) residues may be used as fertiliser; (4) noxious smells are removed.</P>

      <P>The proposed national understanding represents the outcome of detailed and comprehensive discussions between Government, employer and trade union representatives, and arose from the Taoiseach's call for a fresh approach to the many economic and social issues confronting the community at the present time.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the proposals have been rejected by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The reasons for rejection are diverse and appear in some respects to reflect conflicting interests among member unions.  The rejection is disappointing since the terms of the proposed understanding were designed to strike a fair balance among the differing interests involved and can only be regarded as generous given the more difficult economic climate which is emerging since these proposals were formulated.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach will meet representatives of the trade union and employer organisations to discuss the situation arising from the rejection of these proposals.</P>

      <P>This question was originally put down to the Taoiseach prior to the meeting yesterday and was transferred to the present Minister, but it is still relevant and perhaps even more relevant now.  Would the Minister agree that every effort should be made to seek to salvage certain positive factors of the national understanding?  He referred to different groups having different approaches to it, but to salvage these positive features of the national understanding, <Col N="1457" /> perhaps the Government would need to indicate whether flexibility or clarification will be their objective at the forthcoming meeting.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it would be tragic from the national interest point of view if, because of disagreement on certain features of the national understanding, the entire package was to go.  That is why I seek this information from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the importance of the matters to which the Deputy refers and, with your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like a little latitude in answering this question.  The matter was apparently so important yesterday that the acting leader of the Fine Gael Party felt he had to signal his desire to raise it today and, having signalled it and having raised it again this morning, I notice a conspicuous absence of interest not only in this matter but in the other matters which were the subject of questions by Deputies on that side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning to the point raised by Deputy O'Leary, there is, of course, a desire on the part of the Government that there should be an orderly and peaceful approach to resolving the many complex and important economic issues which are before the country at present. However, I do not see that it would be realistic or sensible to imply that further progress in this area could take the form of separate interest groups being placed in a position where they could select those elements of the proposed understanding which suited themselves but were free to reject the balance of the proposals.  The proposals contained in the national understanding were indeed a comprehensive set of proposals which emerged as a result of a very prolonged series of discussions and were designed to try to reconcile the conflicting interests and aspirations of different groups.  As is normal in a healthy democratic process, the outcome was a <Col N="1458" /> set of proposals where each party made some concessions in order to secure the understanding and support of the other parties.  Therefore, we now find ourselves in the situation where there is not going to be subscription to the overall set of proposals.  I do not feel that it would be appropriate to envisage that all of the proposals in the understanding could be implemented.  In particular I would not wish it to be felt that there could be a unilateral implementation of selected components of those proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that one could not have wholesale revision of points that have been negotiated over such a long period.  Does the Minister hold out any prospect of improvement on the tax aspect of the package as improvement in that area might gain acceptance for the other points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I think the Deputy is approaching this issue in the wrong way.  He is appearing to suggest that the Government should now unilaterally signal its willingness to alter some specific element in the proposal without any indication from the other parties that they have even the slightest willingness to proceed with such a revision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">

    <Speaker pid="MartinODonoghue" hpid="Professor O'Donoghue Professor O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that there is the basis at present for assuming anything.  We must proceed on the facts of the situation.  The facts of the situation are that a series of proposals emerged as a result of prolonged and complex discussions.  Those proposals represented a balancing of conflicting interests, I repeat, conflicting interests.  In a healthy democracy it is totally unrealistic for any group to imagine that they can unilaterally select elements of a comprehensive set of proposals which seek to take account of other members of the community and then assert their entitlement to those elements which favour their own individual situation.  To do so would be an unwise approach to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the Deputy's concern in <Col N="1459" /> the matter; indeed, I should like to digress to thank the other parties in the House for their support for the general approach.  We all recognise that it is in the interests of the community at large and, of course, we all represent the community at large and the diverse interests within that community.  Having recognised their support for it, I should say that we would be unwise to proceed further on the basis that the best remedy to yesterday's rejection by the trade union movement is to have one party&mdash;in this instance, at the Deputy's suggestion, the Government&mdash;make a unilateral improvement. I do not see any purpose in that type of approach.  What is needed is to convey to people that some of their decisions and behaviour demonstrates a lack of patriotism, a lack of social concern for the weak and under-privileged groups in our community and a lack of economic reality.  All parties in this House should use their energies and efforts to improve the situation and to remedy the lack of awareness of the factual circumstances of our present situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The collection of income tax has been held up by the Post Office <Col N="1461" /> situation.  Income tax payments into the Exchequer in the current year up to 31 March 1979 amounted to £160.125 million, a decrease of 1 per cent on the same period last year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even accepting that the Post Office dispute had some effect on the collection of income tax in the first quarter of the year, how can the Minister explain the fact that income tax receipts have decreased in the first quarter by 1 per cent whereas the budgetary projections are for an annual increase of the order of over 30 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of factors involved in this matter.  Up to 2 February 1979 the income tax receipts showed an increase of 17.3 per cent over the same period last year.  One of the factors operating, which would be expected to operate in the first quarter, is that the very large increases in income tax allowances from the 1978 Budget were operating in the first quarter as compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year when the income tax arrangements made under the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition were operating.  So one would expect a substantial drop in the first quarter because of the very large increases granted in the 1978 Budget.  There are also a number of other special factors which will not apply until after the first quarter of this year, such as the ending of the concessions given to civil servants on the changeover to PAYE, the application of PAYE to share fishermen and the discontinuance of tax relief on social insurance contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the band chosen appears to have had repercussions not anticipated at the time in view of the long-term strengthening of the British £ and that the band chosen by us invites the rather ominous prospect later this year that the Irish punt will lose even against other currencies within the present EMS system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not agree with either of the Deputy's suggestions. The fact is that the band chosen has no relevance whatsoever to the movement of sterling.  I should point out, in case it is necessary to do so, that the Irish punt has not weakened  sterling has strengthened.  In relation to the EMS currencies the Irish punt has maintained its position quite satisfactorily.  Of course, that is the object of the exercise of the EMS within the bands of the EMS.  The movement of sterling is due to other factors, but it is in relation to all the EMS currencies, not just the Irish pound.  Perhaps I should point out further that the major argument advanced for adopting the wider margins was that it would enable us to maintain the link with sterling longer than the narrower margins which we chose.  But in fact the link with sterling would have broken less than a fortnight after it was broken even if we had had the wider margins.  I suggest that the arguments which were gone into in this House as to why we should adopt the narrower <Col N="1464" /> margins still apply and the arguments put forward against that have in practice disappeared.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not possible at present to say what effect, if any, variations in the exchange rate between the Irish pound and the pound sterling will have on our rate of inflation in 1979.  The impact of such variations on prices will depend on their magnitude, their duration, and the extent to which the prices of British-produced goods and services can be passed on <Col N="1465" /> here in the face of competition from Irish and other sources.</P>
    <P>The external contribution to prices here reflects movements of the Irish pound against the currencies of all currencies with which we trade, not just sterling.  At present the effective trade-weighted exchange rate index of the Irish pound is at about the same level as at the start of this year.  Overall, therefore, the impact of recent exchange rate movements on the price level is likely to have been negligible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that a major component of our exports to Britain and other countries is of course imports and that the fall of our currency as against theirs means that the cost of these has gone up thereby compounding and adding to inflationary pressures here at home?  It is not simply enough to say that competitively we have improved our position on the British market as a result of the break with parity.  Unfortunately, there is two-way traffic here and the wide divergence growing between the punt and the pound is likely to add to our difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, the question of competitiveness arises not only in our export market to Britain but also in our home market.  In so far as British goods coming in here are dearer, they are faced with competition in many areas from Irish and indeed other imported goods.  But it is very important to bear in mind what I said: that if one wants to measure the effect of the movement in currencies one gets a far more accurate assessment of the effect here, on inflation or otherwise, by having regard to the effective trade-weighted exchange rate index.  As I have indicated, that is at about the same level as it was at the beginning of the year.  That being so, it is clear that the impact of the exchange rate movement recently on price levels here is likely to have been negligible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am correct in having heard the Minister say that it was not possible to make any estimation at present of the influence of the break in the link with sterling on inflation, would he <Col N="1466" /> accept that after the operation of the break for some period it will be possible to make such an estimation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, although one cannot take sterling in isolation.  That is the point I have been endeavouring to make clear.  One must have regard to the effect in relation to the currencies with which we trade if one wants to get the effect on our economy and that is done by the effective trade-weighted exchange rate index.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is picking out a particular quarter to which I am referring.  I am saying that the underlying trend is not upwards.  Leaving aside for a moment the question of the impact of oil prices, the indications are that the trend, as we progress in the year, will be downwards.  As far as oil prices are concerned, it is not possible to quantify the effects precisely, but one thing one can be reasonably sure of is that whatever effects are likely to occur are also likely to occur to our competitors.  Therefore, in the context in which the Deputy is speaking, our relative position will not deteriorate.</P>

      <P>Firstly, there is no contradiction whatever between what I said and what the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy said, and, secondly, I must say again that&mdash;I regret it&mdash;I must disappoint Deputy O'Leary.  The doom and gloom scenario he is envisaging later this year of a balance of payments crisis and devaluation of the Irish currency does not appear to be on.  There is no evidence for it at all.

The new exchange rate arrangements have, of course, involved a major change in the longstanding currency relationship that existed between the two countries and it was only to be expected that they would involve transitional adjustments for business and other sections of the community.

      <P>The number of oil companies is small so that to supply the information asked for would lead to the tax position of some of the companies becoming identifiable.  In the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, it would not accord with the principle of observing secrecy in relation to taxation affairs of taxpayers if the information sought were to be given.  However, the published accounts of oil companies may provide the information which the Deputy requires.</P>
      <P>As to whether companies of the type to which the Deputy referred pay what might be regarded as a fair share of tax, this is a question of concern to many countries.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is a very large distinction in principle and sometimes in practice between the Revenue Commissioners disclosing information about the affairs of an individual taxpayer and the taxpayer doing so.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Our tax incentives for industry have been generous for many years, for reasons which need no elaboration.  They have included the possibility of arrangements of the type mentioned. The availability to firms of very favourable leasing terms can, of course, be of significant benefit in facilitating industrial expansion.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not available to show the amount of tax revenue foregone by the procedure outlined in the question.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no formal proposal to introduce an EEC tax on petrol and tobacco.  The Deputy probably has in mind a reference in a Commission communication on the future financing of the Community budget to a number of possible new sources of revenue for the budget, including a Community tax on petrol and tobacco.  The communication was in the nature of a discussion document and was the subject of an initial exchange of views at a Joint Council of Foreign Affairs and Finance Ministers on 2 April. In the light of the discussion at the joint council the Commission are at present re-examining the position regarding the future financing of the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The overriding issue in the Commission communication which referred to the possibility of tax on petrol and tobacco is a suggestion that member states' contributions to the Community budget should be geared to their ability to pay.  This would involve introducing a corrective mechanism into the resources side of the budget.  Ireland would favour such a mechanism.  Discussions to date on this issue at both Council and Council <Col N="1474" /> Working Group level have concentrated on the question of introducing a mechanism.  As our attitude towards the new source of budgetary revenue for the Community would be determined largely by the Council's attitude towards a corrective mechanism, it would not be appropriate at this stage to take a position one way or the other on a tax on petrol or tobacco, or on any of the other revenue options referred to in the communication from the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he would consider the introduction of certain restrictions on bank loans for land purchase, to ensure that qualified applicants get the loans and also to slow down the spiralling price of farm land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Policy regarding bank credit is primarily a matter for the Central Bank.  In its advice to the banks for some years now, the Central Bank has given priority to lending for productive investment.  This includes lending to agriculture and is in line with national policy of encouraging agricultural development.  Regarding land purchase in particular, I am advised by the Central Bank that applications to banks for loans for the purchase of land by farmers are likely to receive preferential treatment both as regards the proportion of the purchase price advanced and the period of repayment.  Individual banks also have schemes to assist the purchase of land by smaller farmers and farmers' sons.</P>
      <P>I understand that it is the practice of the Associated Banks to be more restrictive in providing land purchase loans to non-farmers.  Some banks do not provide any credit for such purchases while others do so on stricter criteria than in the case of applications from farmers. These measures should help to avoid upward pressure on land prices arising from speculative activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Agriculture has as <Col N="1475" /> recently as 26 April indicated to the House his intention to introduce legislation regarding land policy&mdash;with particular reference to price and speculation aspects&mdash;before the end of this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite sure whether they are buying at less than half the price and neither am I sure that they are Irish entrepreneurs as the phrase is ordinarily understood.  I understand Irish farmers are involved; maybe they are entrepreneurial farmers.  I understand some Irish farmers have bought land in Great Britain cheaper than they can get it here.  The comments of the Minister for Agriculture in this regard indicate the attitude of the Government that the price of agricultural land is, in our view, too high&mdash;I would say artificially high&mdash;and the Minister indicated his intention to introduce legislation to deal with land policy generally, but in particular, to deal with questions relating to the price of land and speculation in land.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the comments of those who contributed and wish to refer to some of the points raised.  I may not cover all the points but Deputies can rest assured that any points made will be pursued and examined further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan asked what proportion of trainees get permanent jobs after completing AnCO training courses.  The proportion of trainees on regular AnCO courses is 72 per cent within three months of completion of the courses.  It shows a very substantial improvement over the position that pertained two years ago.  It is an added indicator of the improvement in the economic climate and the employment situation that exists at present.  Of the 911 AnCO sponsored first-year apprentices trained, 724 were placed in continuing apprenticeship, a placement rate of almost 80 per cent, which shows a vast improvement on the position that existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies were trying to make capital out of mythical figures that they seemed to possess. Another barometer of the success and <Col N="1486" /> effectiveness of the Government's economic and employment policies is that the figures of net passenger movements into and out of the country indicate a turn around from a net outflow in the 12 months November 1976 to October 1977 to a net inflow in the following 12 months from November 1977 to October 1978.  I wish to emphasise the importance of that.  We have returned to a position where more people are coming back to Ireland than are leaving it.  It is a worth-while barometer and is one that speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mitchell asked what safeguards exist against false redundancy claims.  The principal safeguard is the self-policing nature of the scheme.  This arises from the fact that an employer must foot a substantial percentage of each redundancy lump sum.</P>

      <P>The principal safeguard against such claims is the self-policing nature of the scheme.  This arises from the fact that an employer must foot a substantial percentage of each redundancy lump sum.  Furthermore, on each redundancy certificate the employer must complete a statutory declaration of the truth of the matter stated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond asked a pertinent question on the change in status of the NMS and on the need to consult the staff and their unions.  As the House is aware, the Green Paper envisaged a considerable expansion of functions for the National Manpower Service and the introduction of changes to equip it to fulfil its wider role.  The examination of the operation of the NMS is being made to enable it to provide the most efficient possible occupational guidance and job placement service.  I have already considered the option of reconstituting the NMS as a State body.  After meeting representatives of staff associations concerned and after much deliberation I decided that the NMS should be retained within the Department of Labour.  This decision has been conveyed to the staff associations concerned and at the same time it has been indicated that the future status of the NMS will be considered as part of the examination to be undertaken regarding the reorganisation of my Department on the lines of the recommendations of the Public Service Organisation Review Group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the staff's interest and concern about the future status of the NMS and I intend having full discussions with all staff interests before making any changes in the organisational structure.  I should like to reiterate my tribute to the substantially increased staff, the staff I have had the opportunity of augmenting by quite a number since I was appointed Minister.  They have handled an increased workload effectively and well, have made an increased <Col N="1488" /> number of placements and have attracted a greater use of their services by the public.  They have also succeeded in updating their services and are deserving of the compliments and tributes of the House.  I should like to add that in relation to my area, with the help of the NMS and the development that is taking place in the Cork area, the unemployment figure at that exchange at the beginning of May 1978 was 4,400 while the figure at the beginning of May, 1979, was 3,300.  That is another barometer of the progress that has been made and an indication of the efforts of the NMS.</P>
    <P>Deputies Desmond and Horgan referred to the exploitation of young persons which occurs in some services sectors and asked about the enforcement of the protective legislation.  Since the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act came into force Department inspectors, in the course of inspections for the enforcement of general labour legislation have, as a matter of routine, checked on the implementation of this Act.  In the majority of routine inspections no breaches of the Act were reported, a factor being that in many cases no young persons were employed.  Special inspections have been carried out in premises not subject to routine inspection and, in addition, a considerable number have been made following complaints received by my Department.  The Department also receive close co-operation from the various schools attendance officers who report on children under the school-leaving age of 15 who are in full-time employment.  Cases which come to the attention of the NMS are also reported to the inspectorate. Employers in these cases normally arrange to let the children go at once but it is true to say that any specific detailed complaint will be fully investigated by the inspectors.  I appreciate that some complaints are made in areas of small service industries scattered throughout the country in small villages and towns.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond also asked about the experience of the new provision in the Redundancy Payments Act, 1979 about time off to look for alternative employment and asked if I would monitor its outcome.  I can assure the <Col N="1489" /> Deputy that I am interested in the operation of that Act.  As I stated, that section was an innovation in the Act.  It is early days yet and the Act has not been long enough in force to provide information on how the provision is working.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the transfer of the co-ordinating role relating to the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of Women from my Department to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  Deputy Desmond inferred from this that responsibility for maternity leave legislation was also being transferred.  I should like to correct his misunderstanding in relation to that point.  In fact, I replied to questions from Deputies O'Leary and Ryan about maternity leave proposals that day and indicated to them that progress was being made.</P>
    <P>I was also asked about the off-shore safety legislation.  I should like to state that it is my wish and anxiety that this safety measure be initiated urgently.  I should like to state for the information of the House, that there are legal problems related to jurisdiction and to the Law of the Sea Conference which has not yet concluded.  I should like to assure the House that my concern is genuine and earnest to see that legislation is introduced as soon as the legal difficulties are eliminated.</P>
    <P>On the question of the acquired rights directive, I have indicated in my introduction that discussions are taking place with the ICTU and the FUE on the proposed legislation which will take the form of regulations under the Act dealing with the European Communities. Deputy Deasy sought information&mdash;I should like to state that Deputy Deasy made some very reasoned comments &mdash;on the extra assistance proposed for the emigrants advisory committee.  The Government have decided to make funds available towards the cost of employing social workers at Irish centres in Britain.  The Advisory Committee on Emigrant Services will examine the needs of the various centres and will make recommendations regarding the most appropriate deployment of the social workers to be recruited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> Deputy Deasy also raised the question of profit-sharing in industry and the possibility of operating profit sharing schemes.  He suggested that that should be explored.  I should like to tell the Deputy that financial participation of employees is one of the subjects I intend to cover in the proposed discussion document on worker participation.  I hope this will stimulate debate among the social partners on possible initiatives in this area.  It is my hope that that document will be ready at an early date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan referred to the published statistics showing that the average hours worked in certain industries were just below one hour of the legal maxima and he suggested that such individuals were breaking the law. Generally speaking, the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 provides for a normal working week for industrial workers of 48 hours, plus 12 hours weekly unlicensed overtime making a total of 60 hours.  The Shops (Conditions of Employment Act), 1938, in so far as it applies to hotel workers provides for a 56-hour normal week plus 10 hours unlicensed overtime giving a total of 66 hours.  However, industrial statistics for September 1978, produced by the CSO, showed that the highest average weekly number of industrial hours in any industry were 52.6.  That was the malting industry and, as I indicated, it is proposed to amend those Acts, to reduce the normal working week.  If Deputy Horgan gives me details of the specific case he referred to I will pursue it for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Horgan said that the failure to pick up redundancy pay on one occasion might cancel the entitlement.  A person who is drawing weekly payment and who becomes ill would normally go on disability benefit and would not lose entitlement to weekly payments which are aggregated with social welfare payments.  I will see that the case he referred to is processed and I hope we can have it sorted out to the Deputy's satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Deasy compared the employment maintenance scheme, at the rate of <Col N="1491" /> £5 per week, with the £20 payable under the British TES scheme.  The amount of money available for our scheme for the financial year 1978 was £5 million.  It was the first time such a scheme was introduced in our first budget and it was greatly appreciated as being of assistance in maintaining employment in some of the industries which had gone through a pretty traumatic time.  In areas of high intensive employment, some of the industries were very grateful for the assistance.  I am satisfied it helped to maintain employment on those sectors. For 1979, as the House is aware, the figure is £8 million, which permits a maximum of £5 per week in respect of the total payrolls of the eligible firms. The British temporary employment subsidy provides £20 a week for a portion of the work force who would otherwise become redundant.  The EEC Commission insisted that from 1 April 1978 the TES for the footwear, clothing and textile industries be restricted to not more than 70 per cent of the work force of a particular firm for six months and 50 per cent for a further six months, at the longest.  Therefore, the last British temporary employment subsidy payment must end at 31 March 1980.</P>
    <P>Deputy White said that AnCO should run courses for the agricultural community. In fact, under the Industrial Training Act of 1967, AnCO is precluded from engaging in such training for agriculture.  The Deputies will be aware that several official bodies are responsible for this training and that a new body is being set up.  Many AnCO courses are availed of by persons with an agricultural background, which contributes to general agricultural efficiency and output.</P>
    <P>Deputy White referred to AnCO lodging allowances, which was the subject of a question from him.  These are allowances paid by AnCO in respect of young trainees.  He said these were inadequate. This relates, apparently, to block release courses for apprentices, of 8 to 13 weeks' duration.  AnCO book the trainees into accommodation with approved landladies&mdash;which I think is important. AnCO pay £14 per week to the <Col N="1492" /> landlady and the trainee gets his wages, as usual.  He is required to pay £4 per week to the landlady.  This is effective from 1 January of this year.  In my opinion, this is a reasonable arrangement. The lodging allowances rates are reviewed periodically and are fixed by the council of AnCO.  There is no dissatisfaction known to AnCO at this time and it appears that these rates compare favourably with other similar rates.</P>
    <P>Deputy White said that it would be better to retain the unemployed, rather than to bring workers home from abroad.  The proposals to attract emigrants are aimed primarily at highly skilled workers, whose training would take several years.  Part of the plan is to eliminate skill shortages altogether, with further training and further education. The need is urgent; the need is immediate. It will take a considerable time to develop a scheme to train the people in the skills in short supply.  Filling all these jobs is extremely urgent and the bringing home of our skilled emigrants is justified.  We have ample evidence of the shortages of these skills creating blockages in employment for people who could do with the employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy White also referred to the local offices of the manpower service.  In that context, he referred to recruitment into the armed forces.  When the staff of National Manpower are interviewing applicants, with a view to assessing their suitability for employment, it is their practice to tell suitable applicants that there are possibilities of employment in the armed forces.  In addition, a series of career information leaflets issued by my Department contains eight separate titles relevant to occupations in the Army, Navy and Air Corps.</P>
    <P>In line with the statements issued by the Taoiseach, I regret, as do my colleagues, that the proposals in the national understanding were rejected. The Taoiseach will meet both sides to discuss the position as a result of that decision.  We should await the outcome of this meeting before making further comment.  In my introductory speech, I said that much effort had been made by all parties concerned in putting forward a reasonable good package and a new concept.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> I also made it clear that I had resisted demands made on me for legislation on strikes, pickets and the like.  My attitude to these demands is, I repeat, to hope that in this area sanity will prevail and that arrangements voluntarily agreed between employer, employee and union would be supported and allowed to operate.  This is what the country wants.</P>
    <P>I would ask what would Deputies want done with minorities who refuse to comply with the procedures which have been negotiated on their behalf?  Is it arguable that such minority groups should be given in to and agreements made with the unions thrown aside? How long could order last, in collective bargaining, if we were to take such a line?  What credibility, what authority, would trade union leaders then have?  It is a fact that under the law the actions of such minority groups have the same status, the same protection as actions taken democratically and responsibly by a trade union in pursuance of a claim on behalf of its members.  Would the House agree that minority action taken in defiance of the majority will is not democracy at work but rather the opposite? Would the House agree that the cause of democracy is not being advanced by minority actions being given the same standards under the law as are given to actions taken democratically by a trade union?  This is a phenomenon which is a dilemma for the Members of this House, who have a responsibility for legislating for the good of the people. The most welcome solution to this would be one which the trade union movement itself would devise.  I should be most happy to discuss with ICTU any facilities or give any assistance which might be required to enable them to produce a solution, which is badly needed, particularly in the interests of our young people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would thank again the Deputies who contributed to the debate on the Estimate and say that it is almost double the Estimate of two years ago for the Department, covering all the many important aspects of the Department itself and the agencies under its guidance&mdash;the whole wide area of training, <Col N="1494" /> youth employment, manpower placement, safety, industrial relations, their very conditions of employment.  I had hoped greater interest would have been shown today when there was a second day's debate on this very important subject.  I think I should take some of the Opposition to task.  One Deputy last week came in very late in the day and told the House that members of my party had boycotted the debate, but I think it is true that they were giving people on the other side of the House plenty of opportunity to speak.  Today we were the only people, with one exception, who did show interest.  I am not so sure that much of the noise made on the other side of the House had not some relevance to elections rather than to the important Estimate we were discussing.</P>

    <P>&dagger; In 1974 and 1975 the fiscal duty on motorcycles was not an excise duty, but constituted the main element of the customs duty on these goods. The figures quoted for these years, therefore, contain an element of protective duty.  The Customs Fiscal Duties were converted to excise import duties on 1 January 1976.</P>
