    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;and&rdquo; in line 11 down to and including &ldquo;education&rdquo; in line 14 and insert &ldquo;, commercial education and business and management studies, philosophical studies, studies relating to agriculture and fisheries, catering, legal studies, public administration, art and design, complementary studies and other such studies as the Council shall so decide as suitable provided outside the universities, whether professional, vocational or technical (including apprenticeship courses) and shall promote and encourage the availability of recurrent education&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to a description of the subjects which the NCEA will have guardianship over.  I am not happy with the wording in the Bill.  The words used are rather terse and narrow in concept. A wider and more liberal phraseology would better suit the Bill for the sake of future interpretation of its role and functions.  In my amendment I have attempted to make quite clear the fields which the council will interest itself in and they are so described as to leave no doubt that the council has a wide range of subjects to control.  There will be no problem about interpreting its functions in future.</P>
      <P>As regards apprenticeships I feel that the present situation where AnCO is playing a major role in the development of apprenticeships does not recognise the educational context of the apprenticeship courses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The educational content in apprenticeship courses is insufficient to ensure the educational advancement of the apprentices. Greater educational input is necessary to ensure that our society does not produce a new generation of human robots.  Therefore, there is need to ensure that the educational content receives higher priority than at present under the AnCO apprenticeship courses.  This is sufficiently serious to warrant mention in <Col N="1230" /> my amendment and I draw the Minister's specific attention to it.</P>
    <P>In replying I should be grateful if the Minister would address himself to consideration of the correct quantity and quality of the educational aspect of apprenticeship courses.  Our regional colleges and colleges of technology should play a greater role in ensuring that an apprentice, when finished his apprenticeship, has a balanced education not alone in respect of his specific career subjects but also in relation to his general educational standard.  We have an obligation to ensure that our young people completing apprenticeship courses have a standard of education affording them promotional opportunities within, say, business firms so that they will not feel in later years they are in dead-end jobs but rather that the promotional opportunities open to many other people will also be fully available to them.</P>
    <P>Therefore we have a serious obligation to ensure that the educational aspects of apprenticeship are not neglected.  It is for that reason that I specifically request that the National Council for Educational Awards have as one of their functions the apprenticeship area so that they will be able to&mdash;as the Bill says&mdash;encourage, facilitate, promote, especially &ldquo;promote&rdquo;, co-ordinate and develop education with specific reference to apprentices.  I am sure the Minister is sympathetic to the aspiration that this area be well catered for.  I am not satisfied, and I am saying specifically, that the AnCO apprenticeship schemes, as at present constituted go into the educational aspect of apprenticeship courses.  I am satisfied there is a need for the NCEA to oversee the standards of apprenticeships.  Certainly, they may consult with AnCO or with any professional or trading group in order to ensure a proper standard of apprenticeship training.</P>
    <P>There are other subjects that should be mentioned because, as the Bill is at present worded, possibly they would be excluded.  I refer specifically to philosophical studies, studies relating to agriculture and fisheries, legal studies, <Col N="1231" /> catering, public administration and art and design studies.  I have added also the words &ldquo;complementary studies&rdquo; in order to ensure that the council be fully involved in liberal subjects and all studies complementary to specialised subjects.  It would be prudent to specify these other fields of study to ensure that the responsibilities and functions of the National Council for Educational Awards are fully understood as being of a wide and liberal nature and not within the narrow concept that the wording of section 3 (1) of the Bill would seem to indicate.</P>
    <P>My amendment is a moderate one. Certainly it is not political in the narrow context of the word.  It is an amendment I suggest would benefit the NCEA and would protect them in their future interpretation of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a special plea on behalf of recurrent education. We can make many different kinds of cases for including many different kinds of specific references within the terms of reference of a body such as the NCEA.  Of all of them perhaps recurrent education needs to be underlined.  The people who could benefit from recurrent education are the forgotten people in our society and it is not often recognised that they are a very numerous group of people. In the 1971 Census there were one million Irish men and women aged between 25 and 65 who had received primary school education only.  If equality of educational opportunity is to mean anything it must surely mean something for them as well as for the school leavers of this day and age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last line of the amendment urges the council to promote and encourage the availability of recurrent education.  I would regard this as being specially relevant to the occupational, human and personal needs of this large group of people.  The problem is that, politically, they do not constitute a constituency. They do not have sufficient votes perhaps in any one constituency to elect anybody to Dáil Éireann and they are not organised in groups.  They do not have parents, like school leavers, to press <Col N="1232" /> their case for them in terms of the provision of third-level places and qualification. I would hope that the National Council for Educational Awards, by paying attention to recurrent education, as is suggested in this amendment, would make these people a very special part of their concern because they represent some of the most valuable unrealised potential in our society.  We are for ever talking about our natural resources in a context which implies that the only natural resources we have are inanimate. We should never forget that the most precious natural resources we have are the animate natural resources, the men and women of our country.  I would urge, especially in relation to recurrent education, that that group of Irish men and women be singled out for the positive attention of the Council.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson) John P. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the points made by Deputy Collins with regard to AnCO courses.  In this debate we are concerned with the National Council for Education Awards; we are not dealing specifically with the training or course content of the whole field of education.  It should be remembered that most of the apprenticeship courses are at second level.  The Department of Education are aware of the necessity to have a proper education content in the courses followed by apprentices and the Department have, in consultation with the Department of Labour, stipulated what they regard as desirable by way of general education in order to help the apprentice along the lines mentioned by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is generally agreed that the basic education, including the liberal element, is very important so that a young man or woman may be able to retrain and develop a new skill because the specific skill which may be learned may become obsolete&mdash;skills are becoming obsolete with increasing frequency nowadays&mdash; and it is for that reason that the Department of Education, in regard to the AnCO courses, have stipulated &ldquo;educational content&rdquo;.  I do not accept the contention of Deputy Collins that the courses as being pursued now are in <Col N="1233" /> danger of producing robots.  I agree that it is an important area but I submit it is not an area with which we are directly concerned now; we are not discussing that.  We are debating a national council for the making of educational awards and I have no doubt that when any area comes up for discussion and decision by the council they will be fully aware of the need for the kind of balance mentioned in the course before they approve of it and make an educational award accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made a good point when he stated that that area is very much concerned with the development of the individual in such a way that he will be able to avail of promotion opportunities later.  The balance is important.  In assessing any course the council will be fully conscious of this.  A point that struck me when listening to the Deputy is that we seem to be ambiguous when discussing this whole area generally in education circles at present.  On the one hand we have people decrying the fact that our educational system is overemphasised in the liberal area and, on the other hand, the point made&mdash;I concede it is an important one&mdash;seems to indicate that our courses in the apprenticeship and technical fields are in danger of not emphasising the liberal part well enough.  There seems to be an ambiguity about our approach; it seems that we are not quite sure what we are doing in this regard.  The NCEA will be so constituted that there is no likelihood of them ignoring the importance of the liberal content when assessing a course and deciding to make awards in an area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins may have failed to notice that some of the areas he mentioned are covered by section 3 (1).  He specifically mentioned art and design which are covered in that subsection. Deputy Horgan made a strong plea based on the last two words of the amendment and picked up the banner of recurrent education.  Deputy Horgan was referring to something that is not unrelated to a matter I dealt with earlier, how soon skills become obsolete and so on, and he spoke of the importance of recurrent education.  I agree that it is important <Col N="1234" /> but I do not think he applied the right criteria for the consideration of recurrent education when he mentioned the fact that those who want such education have votes.  I do not think that is a criteria to judge whether their needs be supplied or not.  It is slightly woolly to talk of recurrent education in this context because we are referring to courses set up with the expertise of the advisory committees, followed by a decision of the council, on specific courses.  Should those courses be courses of recurrent education for which an award is to be made they come within the competence of the NCEA.  The danger seen or the omissions referred to by the Deputies are adequately covered by section 3(1).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 30, to delete &ldquo;set by the Council or&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to the possibility of the council being allowed to set examinations as opposed to being empowered to prescribe standards.  It is my view that the council should not be an examination setting body.  The tradition has always been that the colleges, within their own staff, set the examinations or structured their examinations or academic test and an external examiner was employed to monitor standards and correct papers.  That is the proper structure. The responsibility of the NCEA should be to prescribe standards and monitor them.  The NCEA should also be empowered to grant colleges and educational institutions the right to give courses under prescribed standards.  I am convinced that the council should not be empowered to set examinations because that would be extending the scope of the council in an interfering manner.  It would impinge on the rights of the colleges in the examination area.  I would be sorry to see regional and other colleges being deprived of the freedom to set their own examinations and the freedom to have a cross-fertilisation of <Col N="1235" /> ideas between their own staff and external examiners.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the work of the college is important from the point of view of the academic staff who can feel involved in the affairs of the college specifically in relation to monitoring the academic courses and seeing the fruition of a year's work in the context of examinations, in relation to having the freedom to structure and set examinations and having the freedom to involve extern examiners in the work of the college.  It is important from the staff point of view and from the educational point of view that there should be the cross-fertilisation of ideas between the staff of a college and extern examiners from other colleges.  This cross-fertilisation of ideas will help to unify standards generally throughout the system and this is an important aspect in the academic life of any college.  To give power to the National Council for Educational Awards is wrong; it is a retrograde step which I oppose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins' contention is that the National Council for Educational Awards should not be an examining body.  The Deputy outlined the procedure which obtains at present, namely that the council do the monitoring and the institutions set the examinations. As I mentioned earlier, we are not interfering with the existing system.  The words &ldquo;set by the Council or&rdquo; which the amendment wants to exclude is simply our safety net for the council to cover any eventuality where it might be necessary for the council actually to set the examination.  I do not envisage any great use of that power but it is my firmly held belief that that power must be there to cover all eventualities in the case of examining pupils who have either finished part of their course or are doing their final courses in either certificate, diploma or degree areas.</P>

      <P>In page 5, to delete lines 4 to 27 and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  one shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick,</P>
      <P>(b)  one shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Governing Body of the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin,</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" /> (l)  six shall be so appointed on the recommendation of the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is no simple solution to the question of representation or to the make-up of the council.  Any system proposed either by the Minister, Deputy Horgan or myself would be open to criticism.  On looking at the Minister's amendment I felt that it did not guarantee a broad spectrum of representation on the council and because of that I moved what I consider to be a better approach to the question of representation.</P>
    <P>It is of particular importance that the student body be given representation on the National Council for Educational Awards.  All of us, especially politicians, are aware of the vociferous opinions of students on a large number of issues.  I am impressed with their openness and frankness and with their contribution to the general ongoing educational debates. I do not always agree with what they say but that could not be expected of me.  I am thankful to the Union of Students in Ireland for their statistical data which is published on occasion and is sometimes handed to me for my information.  They provide a very valuable on-the-spot service for politicians.</P>
    <P>At this point we should recognise legally the role that the Union of Students in Ireland play in the evolution of educational policies.  It is time that they had a <i>de jure</i> right to be on governmental bodies.  We have an opportunity in this legislation to acknowledge their contribution. I have found that their absence from the board of management of the Regional Technical College in Waterford, of which I am a member, has created a vacuum for the board and has possibly created a feeling among students that their voices are not being heard at board level.  On occasion that may be the case.  The Minister and the Government have an obligation to ensure where possible participation by the Union of Students in Ireland on all policy establishing bodies such as the National Council for Educational Awards.  I am not sure if they are represented on the present council but <Col N="1238" /> we have an opportunity here to give legal recognition to the part they play especially in the non-university sector.</P>
    <P>I have tried otherwise to give a broad spectrum of representation to the various universities, to the NIHE and the board of the National College of Art and Design and I have made specific reference to four representatives of the boards of management of the regional technical colleges which are the premier colleges needing the drive to ensure that there is non-university technical education in the State.  They should have a solid presence on the council and the four others should be representative of the boards of governing bodies of other colleges and institutions to which this Bill applies.  I am also giving the Minister six nominees.  I have not attempted to change the number of the members of the council.  I have merely tried to change the composition in the representation of the various interested sectors which I feel should be on the council.  I am not happy with the Minister's breakdown of representation.  It is too general and, in some cases, unfair.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that I do not have an unanswerable case.  Possibly my proposition is open to criticism, but it will ensure a broader spectrum of representation and that no sector of the colleges involved will have predominance in the affairs of the council. I have chosen a diffused representation rather than a concentrated representation as regards any one sector.  I feel that my approach is more justifiable than the one the Minister is proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to confine my remarks to the question of student representation and not to go into the arguments we had on Second Stage to any great degree.  As Deputy Collins has said, any carve-up is bound, indeed almost guaranteed, to create more dissatisfied than satisfied people and in this respect, at any rate, the Minister has my sympathy.  However, on Second Stage when we were talking about the appropriate proportion of representation, we were discussing the whole concept of <Col N="1239" /> whether these people should be regarded as representing the interests which have nominated them.  The Minister seemed to be trying to plough a lonely furrow beside the original NCEA concept, which one might argue was the higher education concept as well, which was that even though these people came from these institutions or organisations they did not in any democratic sense represent them on the council or authority concerned.  We are now having a procedure which is in a sense a mixture. The people to be appointed by the Minister will not be appointed by him out of the air, so to speak, but will be appointed by him on the nomination of bodies.  I argue strongly that it is difficult to see how people who owe their position on the NCEA partly to their nomination by a body or institution and partly to their appointment by the Minister could fail to act in that kind of democratic representative sense.  On occasion this might lead to decisions being taken in which institutional interests rather than the overall interests of higher education or the NCEA might predominate. However, we will have to work that out as we go along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the representation of students, if the Minister is going to stand by the principle that he is introducing into this Bill, namely that of his appointing persons who have been nominated by organisations, certainly the Union of Students of Ireland would be a more than appropriate body for such nominations. For too long education in this country has been dominated by the providers of education.  There has been no really effective voice for the consumers of education, and the students are by definition the consumers of our educational services.  This may well be why in some instances the consumers of our educational services have been more extreme in their comments than was politic.  The simple reason is that, if you are excluded from representation in the controlling body of a service which affects you very closely, not unnaturally you are going to have a considerable degree of natural and justifiable frustration <Col N="1240" /> added to whatever other grievances you may have at any time.</P>
    <P>It may be that the Minister is proposing to include among his own nominees such a representative of the student movement in the third level technological sector.  If that is the case one must welcome it, but of course subject to certain qualifications.  The first qualification is that it refers to just this Minister, perhaps in respect of this council, and obviously this does not bind either him in relation to a subsequent council or any subsequent Minister.  The second reservation is that it reduces the already rather small number of nominated places that the Minister has totally in his free gift.  The development of technological higher education is important and, given our Irish propensity for institutional warfare, the Minister should not tie his hands too closely.  If anything I would be prepared to underwrite a slightly higher proportion of ministerial nominees than he has given himself in this Bill, all the more so if he is proposing to use one of his personal nominations to ensure representation by students on the council. If he is going to do this it will be a very poor second best, but it will at least be second best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Collins, in speaking to his own amendment, wants a <i>de jure</i> right for students on the council.  My contention right through has been that section 5 (1) is about the most representative council that I can get.  I take the point made by Deputy Horgan that the inclusion or exclusion of people very often offends more people than it pleases in this context.  As the Deputies know, under section 5 (1) (a) and 5 (1) (g) the Minister has power to appoint a student. Referring to the plea by both Deputy Collins and Deputy Horgan on behalf of the students, I agree with them totally that it was&mdash;to use a horrible modern &ldquo;in&rdquo; word&mdash;an input in education that was sadly lacking for a long time and that it is a feature of the educational scene now for nearly two decades that students are anxious to discuss both the structures of education in their institutions and the courses and the content of <Col N="1241" /> courses.  In this they have benefited education even when, as Deputy Collins said, one could not accept <i>in toto</i> their ideas.  The very fact that they were there advancing ideas made for more interest in third level education and also made people assess their own ideas and adjust them on occasion.  Even if adjustment did not take place, the very exercise was good for the institution.  The concern of Deputy Collins, and to a lesser extent of Deputy Horgan, for it being stipulated in the section that students should be appointed is unnecessary.  It is quite obvious that provision is made in the section for the possibility of appointing a student under section (5) (1) (a) and 5 (1) (g).  With regard to the RTCs, it is also true that the section, as it stands without the amendment, levels the possibility open of appointment of people who are involved in the RTC.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan rightly remarked that we discussed earlier the whole idea of membership of the council.  I still contend that as members of the council they are there with a specific function of assessing and making academic awards in the non-university, the technological sector mainly.  I do not see any great difficulty in a member divesting himself of his own vested interests in order to give himself to the particular and specific business of the National Council for Education Awards.  In fact, there are very busy people who are doing this quite regularly, people who may be members of various councils and committees. They have to wear different hats and they find no difficulty in doing so.</P>
      <P>The RTCs as of now are providing courses which were assessed and which are being awarded by council awards. This will mean that we will have to designate them under section 1 and if they are designated under section 1 any or all of them under section 20 may have representation.  Section 5 (1) (g) and section 5 (1) (a) come into play in that instance as well as what I mentioned already in the context of students.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 5, to insert &ldquo;management&rdquo;, before &ldquo;staff&rdquo; in line 31.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan put forward this amendment on the Committee Stage but there was a misnumbering of lines.  It appeared to propose that the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; should be inserted before &ldquo;professions&rdquo;. I promised to consider this on the Report Stage.  The amendment meets the point made by Deputy Horgan that the management of the institutions to which the Act applies should be considered for membership of the council as well as staff and students.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the generous spirit in which the Minister accepted the arguments I made on Committee Stage, so generous indeed that I believe the amendment is virtually the same as the one I introduced at that point.  It was an important point to make and one which had to be explicitly put into the Bill.  Under the Vocational Education Act, for example, we now have very broad based managements for many of our regional technical colleges. It is important and valuable that people who are asked to give of their time and energies in this very valuable educational work by becoming members of the boards of management of particular institutions should be encouraged by the belief that that commitment can be rewarded at national level as well as at regional or local level by at least the possibility of appointment to the National Council for Educational Awards.  It may be that people who are appointed locally, from industry or from the trade unions, to regional technical college management boards may develop over a time an expertise in and a commitment to technological education which they had not even suspected at the time they accepted the invitation.  It is very appropriate that this kind of expertise should be rewarded, as least potentially, <Col N="1243" /> by making them eligible for nomination to the council.</P>

      <P>I should like some clarification from the Minister.  The paragraph involved reads &ldquo;any of the professions or the staff and students of any institution&rdquo;.  I understand that the staff could mean the employees of the educational institutions involved.  Do I understand the word &ldquo;management&rdquo; to be a separate word?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It means, therefore, members of the board of management. Does it mean members of the college council, which is a theoretically more important policy-making arm of, for instance, the regional technical colleges? The Minister knows that the technical colleges have a board of management and a college council.  Is he including members of the college council as potential members of the NCEA council?</P>
      <P>I support the amendment in its broader concept rather than its narrower concept.  The definition of &ldquo;staff&rdquo; in section 1 is: &ldquo;staff means academic staff or administrative staff&rdquo;.  It is open to appoint either a member of the academic or a member of the administrative staff.</P>

      <P>Possibly.  What does &ldquo;administrative staff&rdquo; mean?  Has it a clear definition?  Does it mean the principal of the college or the senior clerical officer of the college?  I admit that I am going into the realms of theory rather than practice.  Does it mean the maintenance staff?  Would the maintenance staff be eligible for membership of the council?  Would the porters be eligible <Col N="1244" /> for membership of the council?  I recall Paddy Keogh who was a porter in Earlsfort Terrace and who, on retirement, was awarded an honorary degree. He was revered in the office and perhaps knew more about the running of the college than did many a professor.  I should not like us to exclude anybody from representation on the NCEA. Perhaps the Minister would clarify a couple of points.  First, does &ldquo;management&rdquo; mean board of management and/or college council?  Secondly, does the word &ldquo;staff&rdquo; include staff other than the principal of the college or senior clerical officers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the point about the college, if the Deputy refers to subsection (1) (a) of section 5, he will find that members of college councils in regional technical colleges would qualify for appointment to the council.  I would draw the Deputy's attention also to subsection (2) of section 5 where the spectrum or the extent of interest is defined as including industry, agriculture, fisheries, commerce or any of the professions or the staff and students of any institution to which the legislation applies. The college council people are covered potentially in those sectors.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete line 20.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am seeking here to include as potential members of the council people who are resident outside the State.  In educational terms it would be most unfortunate to exclude persons of standing from membership of the NCEA simply because they happen to live in the Six Counties, in England, on the Continent of Europe or in America.  Section 7 provides that a person shall not be eligible for membership of the council if he is for the time <Col N="1246" /> being not ordinarily resident in the State. This is a most unfortunate policy to adopt.  Politically, it is negative and counter-productive.  My amendment seeks to delete the provision in this regard.  In amendment No. 7 I am seeking to have removed from the Bill the provision in subsection (5) of section 8 which reads that:</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Council and any other member thereof may be removed from membership of the Council by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Subsection (6) provides for the removal from membership of the council of a person who ceases to be ordinarily resident in the State.  That is a wrong approach on the part of the Minister.  Not only will a person be precluded from membership by reason of his being resident north of the Border but even if the chairman or a member of the council who is living in the Republic moves, in the interest of the advancement of his career, to one of the educational institutions in the Six Counties, say Queen's University, he ceases to be a member of the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well but in effect the Minister is providing for a situation in which a brilliant man who happened to be on the council but who might go to Queen's as a professor of education would cease to be a member of the council.  The Minister would be depriving the council of that man's service. Both educationally and politically such an approach is wrong.  We on this side of the House are most anxious to involve people from the Six Counties, as well as people from England, the Continent <Col N="1247" /> and America, in education here but for the moment I shall confine myself to the Six Counties dimension of the question. Surely we must rate as one of our highest priorities the matter of close Border co-operation.  I cannot think of a better opportunity for this House to encourage North-South dialogue and co-operation than to allow for the possibility of eminent men living in the Six Counties, being on a premier academic council such as the NCEA.  I am at a complete loss to know why the Minister is excluding people living in Northern Ireland from membership of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And the Minister is able to be a member of the Government. Indeed, even if he were living in Belfast he could be a member of the Government. But why is the Minister excluding a person who may be a professor of education in Queen's University from membership of the council simply because he does not reside in the State? When I moved my amendment on Committee Stage the Minister was happy to refer to two Acts passed by the previous Government which I supported and which have the same provision.  One was the Unfair Dismissals Act which would be an interpretation of the law as it stands in the Republic. That is an interpretation Act rather than an Act which has for its function the creation of new policies.  There is an important difference.</P>
      <P>But here we have an education Act dealing with the overall development of the non-university sector which gives us an ideal opportunity to involve in Irish education affairs, people who happen to live in Northern Ireland and who are just as good Irishmen as we are.  The Minister is depriving such people of the opportunity of becoming involved in Irish education and of possibly contributing to an all-Ireland education policy.  That is a concept which we have not even begun to discuss in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have two separate education policies, one here in the Republic and the <Col N="1248" /> other in Northern Ireland, obviously based on the British model, and that is fair enough.  I am not aware of any attempt by any Government to seek to begin to evolve an all-Ireland education policy.  I am not aware of any deep involvement by the Department of Education with their Northern Ireland counterparts which could be the beginning of ensuring the overall long-term development of an all-Ireland education policy.  I am not aware of any great North-South dialogue on education problems in general.  We seem to be happy to limp along in the Republic on our own without any consultation with Northern Ireland and without any involvement or dialogue with our Northern Ireland counterparts.  I am simply appalled that Mr. John Wilson, a man from the North&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am appalled that that gentleman in his distinguished position, and given the opportunities of his distinguished office, has included in this Bill a provision to exclude from membership of the National Council of Educational Awards eminent people in the educational field who are living in Northern Ireland.  I am shocked and appalled that the man from the North would do such a thing.  It is a slur on the people living in the Republic.  It is a slur on the Minister who prides himself on being an Ulsterman to have in this Bill a clause providing that a person cannot be a member of the NCEA if he does not live in the State.  To put it another way: if a person happens to live in Northern Ireland he can have no part in the deliberations of the NCEA.  I am deeply disappointed in the Minister.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that the Minister would be making a greater contribution to the evolution of an education policy if he were to take a more liberal and far-seeing attitude to membership of the council.  If one looks at the function of the council, their importance in the long-term evolution of policy in the non-university sector and if one looks at the potential for development in Europe we have much to learn from our counterparts there, leaving aside the national problem of Northern Ireland.  Surely if any Minister could have the services of an eminent educationalist from Britain or Germany or France he should have the right to appoint him to the council.  But this is not so.  The provisions of the NCEA Bill exclude any person who is not living in the State and that is inherently wrong.  It is an appalling political error on the part of the Minister to have such a provision in the Bill and I would ask him, leaving party political considerations aside, to remove this clause from the Bill for the sake of education, for the sake of the council, for the sake of our commitment to an extrovert education policy, but most of all we have in this Bill an opportunity to have a dialogue between people living in Northern Ireland and people in the South.  We have an ideal opportunity of involving in educational affairs in the South the wisdom and knowledge of people who live in the North.  I am pleading with the Minister to allow such a service for the council, to allow a cross-Border dialogue in educational matters, to allow of the facility to harness the wealth of educational experience in the North&mdash;and that is part <Col N="1250" /> of Irish education&mdash;and to allow of the use of that knowledge for the council.  I deeply regret that the Minister has seen fit to exclude from membership of the council those who do not live in this State.  I expected more of the Minister and his Government.  If this provision is left in the Bill it will be a political error of great magnitude.  It may have repercussions in Northern Ireland from the point of view of cross-Border co-operation, but mostly it is a reflection of the negative attitude of the Minister to the potential contribution of people living in Northern Ireland in the affairs of the NCEA.</P>
      <P>I make one last plea to the Minister to remove the provision.  There is no need for it.  If he wants to have the service of any person on the council he should not be constrained by such a silly clause as that in section 7 (a) or in section 8 (6) (a).  There is no need for such a provision. It is negative; indeed, I would go so far as to say it is anti-Northern Ireland and it is anti-reunification of this country. I beg of the Minister to withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have always heard that northerners tend to discriminate against other northerners and here is an ironic twist on that sad and ancient truth.  I am really puzzled by the Minister's hard line on this issue.  In earlier discussions on this point he told us that there was no objection or obstacle to people from the North being included on the boards of studies where their expertise and qualifications will be valuable.  If there is no objection to people from the North other than the part in which the Minister resides, and one or two other parts also, being on boards of studies, by extension what conceivable objection can there be to having them on the council of the institute itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must make it plain to us today whether the decision to take this line is based on any alleged constitutional or legal difficulty relating to the appointment of people from the North to the NCEA or whether it is purely and simply a policy decision by him.  If it is a policy decision by him, it is negative.  It need not have been made <Col N="1251" /> and having been made it creates a situation that is all the more difficult to undo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a fairly extensive discussion on this point on the earlier Stages of the Bill and I think we went through the arguments carefully.  I am not one to accept the kind of formal international type of terminology about North-South dialogue.  I am an Ulsterman and hardly a month goes by that I am not in the Six Counties part of Ulster.  I had the privilege of going to school for a short while in Belfast and I also attended McGee College in Derry under the very enlightened President Finnegan.  At that time there were great hopes of developing contacts between Donegal and Derry as Derry was the natural kind of capital for the whole area of Donegal.  We know that political decisions which were resented by all sides in the Six Counties took the possibility of development as a university institution away from Derry and placed it in Coleraine.  I have nothing but goodwill for the development of Coleraine, but I still think that this development should have taken place in the city of Derry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan in his brief remarks at the end of the long speech by Deputy Collins asked whether there were any kind of legal or constitutional overtones in this.  If the Deputy examines the Acts before the Republic of Ireland Act he will see there was the use of different terminology. I want to emphasise very strongly what I emphasised on earlier Stages of this Bill, namely, that the real expertise of members of the boards of studies was very important for the successful functioning of the NCEA.  In so far as the development of technology is concerned, the structuring of courses, innovations and so on would be best known to people who would serve on the boards of studies.  I pointed out at that time that this expertise all along the line was available to us through the boards of studies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Collins talked about the two systems developing in this country, one in the six counties of north-east Ireland and the other in the south and that is <Col N="1252" /> something that I regret as an Ulsterman. As the House knows, this was as a result of political developments.  I do not believe that there was any educationalist in the North or South who desired this to come about, as the system of education had been developed on the basis of one country up to the unfortunate time our country was partitioned.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of contacts between my Department and the Department in the six counties of north-east Ireland and it is my wish that these contacts be developed and kept up.  I think that people from further south in the country are inclined to look at the matter as if it were fossilised in some way.  We must reflect that many people from the Six Counties come to third level and even to second level schools in the south of Ireland. Some people, particularly those from the three Ulster counties and from other counties also, go to higher institutions&mdash;to technological institutions in particular&mdash;in Belfast or elsewhere. One can have an idea about two nations rigidly separated, of two administrations that do not impinge on each other; but when I amble down the road from Swanlinbar the whole thing looks like a farce to me.</P>

      <P>When the Deputy was shocked and appalled I could not help thinking that his face belied the depth of emotion he was expressing regarding this particular provision in the Bill.  I may be wrong but he did not seem to me to be a Member suffering from <i>Angst</i> out of <Col N="1253" /> which he could not get for several weeks. He also mentioned the other element of the EEC.  The Department of Education are aware of the advantages of studying the technological sector in EEC countries. This year I had the privilege of visiting a technological, third level university in Holland and also of visiting one of their higher technical schools.  The Dutch Government and particularly the Dutch Ministers for Education were very helpful and made all kinds of arrangements for myself and officials to study in some depth the institutions we visited. We are aware of the advantages of knowing what the educational scene is in the technological area in the EEC.  We are studying the EEC and taking whatever advantage we can of their system in order to improve our own. There is no question of our discriminating against anyone from the EEC, whether from Britain or any of the others, and there is no question of discrimination against people from the Six Counties.</P>

      <P>As I said on the Second Stage, the real weight of expertise in the boards of studies available to us is the most important part of this exercise and we are not excluded by this Bill from availing of this expertise.  Earlier in the debate I think the possibility was mentioned of the use of members from the Six Counties on the actual council and in so far as we have been dealing with many institutions and organisations that are pressing for membership it is a little surprising that Deputies have said that they would like members of the council to be representative of institutions.  Very pertinently Deputy Horgan said that it was a minefield where letting one group in very often satisfied that group and offended several other groups.  The wider you cast the net the more people you have clamouring for representation, and this makes the task even more difficult. Having considered the whole debate and my own predilection and fully conscious that other Acts already cited in the <Col N="1254" /> House have these words&mdash;Acts for which I was not responsible&mdash;on balance, I shall accept the amendment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete lines 55 and 56.</P>
      <P>This relates to a board of study making a recommendation to the council.  In making a recommendation to the council, the Minister is proposing, in the Bill, to allow the board of studies to recommend standards required and proposed for admission to such courses, under the jurisdiction of the council, which is wrong.  It is a very subtle move by the Minister to change entry requirements to colleges and institutions in the non-university sector, and to begin to restrict entrance to this sector, possibly on economic grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I explained that the entrance requirements, certainly for the RTCs, were three-fold&mdash;first, what was equivalent to a moderate leaving certificate result, combined with an interview by members of the staff of the Department concerned within the college and further combined with an aptitude test.  I suggested that that model for entrance to a regional college was mature and sophisticated and said that the universities would do well to consider that model, as opposed to their own points system, which I maintain is not necessarily the best model for entrance to a university.  Entrance to the non-university sector colleges should be open-ended rather than closed.  That does not mean that the places available in the non-university sector colleges and institutions are expandable <i>ad infinitum;</i> they are not, as the Minister will agree. Perhaps the Minister might propose an omnibus terminology for these non-university sector colleges and institutions. The regional colleges, certainly, are very conscious of the need to relate places available in colleges to employment potential.  That has been their unashamed approach to this question and it is a sound approach, backed up, of <Col N="1256" /> course, with the availability of subjects for recurrent education.</P>
    <P>This whole question of availability of places is becoming a serious problem in the university sector.  Already we have proposals to reduce the number of medical places, to come more in line with the needs of a developing society.  On the other hand, recently we have been made aware of the dreadful bottleneck caused by lack of certain technological graduates.  The Minister has had to make certain moneys available for what are, in effect, crash courses.  That is the reality of life here at present.  The HEA have the overriding function in relation to the co-ordination of places in the university sector, which it is tackling in the context of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into it in depth.  I am merely comparing the question of standards which determine the availability of places, in the wider context.  I shall confine myself to the non-university sector.  There has been a mature attempt in the non-university colleges to provide sufficient places to do two things&mdash;first, to ensure, as much as possible, that the graduate will obtain employment, which is reasonable; secondly to ensure that the needs of the economy are met.  There is a rather successful attempt at balancing these two needs.  The college management make the assessment of the academic staff, perhaps through the academic council advising the board of management, governing body, or whatever, which is reflected in the decision of the governing body, or board of management, to offer so many places.  This is, broadly, a successful approach to the problem of places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> We are now witnessing a subtle attempt by the Minister to change that approach, to give to the NCEA through the recommendations of the board of studies the right to set down arbitrary standards and so to change the whole basis of the entrance policy of these colleges and institutions.  I oppose such a change in attitude by the Minister; I would oppose a change in attitude by the National Council for Educational Awards.  I suggest that the present entrance policy is mature and is seen to be obviously successful; it should be continued. I am dubious about the reasons given for paragraph (f) of section 9 (4). Obviously the council will implement the standards and will dictate to the regional and technological colleges that they must have these standards.  Slowly but surely we shall see a policy based on purely budgetary considerations; the National Council for Educational Awards will slowly but surely force up the entrance requirements to be somewhat equivalent or akin to those for the university sector.</P>
    <P>I maintain that this will be based on budgetary considerations and will be complicated by the fact that the higher educational grant system will be modified perhaps in the White Paper or as a general election policy next year, and that the right to higher education grants will not be based so much on the results of the leaving certificate or matriculation as on the rights of entrance to the degree and diploma-type courses, whether in the university or non-university sector.  There will be a corrective move educationally to recognise the need to give grants on a broader spectrum in relation to courses being undertaken by students and the grants will be based on the right of entry to the course rather than the number of honours gained in the leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>That will be a change in criterion and an advance on the present position where some students, whose families are not well off and who are pursuing third level courses, are not entitled to higher education grants.  That change will be met with a negative change to ensure <Col N="1258" /> that entrance into the non-university sector colleges will be forcibly controlled by the NCEA on economic grounds.</P>
    <P>The Minister will attempt to refute my allegations and I will not be able to prove them here today, but time will prove which of us is right.  In my view the recommendation powers given to the boards of study will manifest themselves up to the NCEA which will say to the various colleges &ldquo;either you have those entrance standards or else&rdquo;.  That will be a complete change of policy from the present position where the academic staff control entrance policy.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong to deprive colleges, through the boards of management down to the academic councils, down to the heads of departments, of the right of setting their own entrance standards and policy.  This is an unnecessary interference with academic independence. This was an introduction of a system which came about, perhaps unplanned, when the RTCs were established but it was beneficial.  I contend that the responsibility given to the colleges was used wisely and was very beneficial from the point of view of the <i>esprit de corps</i> existing in those colleges. They are pleased with their independence in relation to the policy for entrance and with their right to set their examinations and have them examined by external examiners.  These are important things in the life of a college and should be preserved, encouraged and protected where they are seen to be successful.</P>
    <P>What we have in this Bill is a very subtle attempt to take from the colleges the right to set their own standards for entrance to the various departments of study.  I regret this and consider it unnecessary because the staff on the ground are aware of the academic needs for each course.  They are also aware of the need to ensure that no potential student is drawn into the system who is not capable of completing the course.  It is very important that the academic staff be given independence of thought and administration in this area.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to omit section (f).</P>

      <P>Having listened to Deputy Collins' contribution on this amendment, I am near despair.  How anybody could have spent the time on Second Reading, Committee Stage, and <Col N="1260" /> Report Stage, up to this, and have such a total lack of understanding of the functions of the NCEA and of this part of the Bill, I cannot understand.  I want to refer in passing to the Deputy's statement that the NCEA on economic grounds would make some decisions in future.  Not since I came to this House have I heard a more stupid suggestion than that.  In the context of what the council is, nobody who made any kind of study of the Bill could come out with a whopper like that. It bears no relation to the functions of the council.  It is a disgrace to have made such a suggestion in the House.  If the Deputy had read the Bill or had given any thought to it he would not have made a statement like that.</P>
      <P>That is not the only thing that angers me.  Deputy Collins misread this section. He had talked for a considerable length of time on his own amendment about something that is not in the section.  If he reads the section he will see that what is being talked about is boards of studies and the standard required for admission to particular courses.  Deputy Collins spent his time talking about standards for admission to institutions, which is a different thing altogether.  I contend that the council and their board of studies would be in total dereliction of duty and cruel and unjust to potential students of institutions if they did not tell them the kind of equipment they should have before they embarked on a course which was being assessed and awarded by the NCEA.  I have never listened to anything as superficial as the contribution on this amendment by Deputy Collins.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan, who spoke briefly on it, was aware of the misreading of the section by Deputy Collins when he said &ldquo;if its effects are what Deputy Collins says its effects might be&rdquo;.  Deputy Horgan knew perfectly well that Deputy Collins was off beam on this section.  The amendment is totally unacceptable.</P>

There is something sinister in this apparently innocuous provision.  It may be used for controlling entrance and the number attending the non-university colleges.  My argument is that it is wrong to deprive the academic staff of colleges of the right to control entrance requirements.  It is unnecessary interference in a system that is seen to be successful.</P>

    <P>Question: &ldquo;That the words proposed <Col N="1262" /> to be deleted stand&rdquo;, put and declared carried.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 8, lines 4 to 7, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in line 4 down to and including &ldquo;(if any)&rdquo; in line 7 and insert &ldquo;shall have regard to standards applying nationally and internationally and shall not recommend a standard which is lower.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I use this amendment to give me an opportunity to discuss the general wording in the Bill on the definition of standards. Section 9 (4) (g) reads:</P>
      <P>Provided that a board of studies in making recommendations under this subsection in relation to the standard required or proposed for admission to a course for, or for the conferring, granting or giving of a degree, diploma, certificate or other educational award, shall have regard to any corresponding standard required by a university in the State and shall not recommend a standard which is lower than such a standard (if any).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to the use of the words &ldquo;shall have regard to any corresponding standard required by a university in the State&rdquo;.  We discussed this matter on Second and Committee Stages and I am merely putting down the amendment to repeat my opinion on the use of these words.  There may be some courses which have no corresponding courses in the universities.  In any event, the courses on offer may vary.  Many of the courses on offer in the non-university sector are a radical departure from courses on offer in our universities.  I suggest the use of the words &ldquo;shall have regard to standards applying nationally and internationally and shall not recommend a standard which is lower.&rdquo;.  The council should look at the standards applying nationally in a university or those applicable to a professional or trade institute and then look abroad for comparable <Col N="1263" /> standards.  It should then say that there are standards available for a particular course in Ireland, in America or in Europe but the standards used in, for example, France are the ones we would like to see in Ireland.  Based on a logical thorough examination of the situation they should set the standards.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not attach much importance to the use of words.  When one reads Alice in Wonderland one has to look at the words on a number of occasions and then decide how to interpret them.  It is important in wording a Bill to have words which are most suitable to the Bill.  I am convinced that the use of the words &ldquo;nationally&rdquo; and &ldquo;internationally&rdquo; are a better choice of words than those in the Bill.  It would be wiser to have them because they have a wider interpretation and they are more meaningful in the context of the NCEA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We went fully into this point when we were dealing with the Bill on Committee Stage.  I went to some considerable length to indicate why the word was used at all in the context.  Like the medieval philosophers I started off by saying why it was not there.  I did not mean in any way that the university ethos would be superimposed on this very important third level area.  I pointed out to the House that the only reason for its use was to indicate the type of prestige award that we were aiming at and which in the <i>ad hoc</i> situation we had achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of standards is a difficult one.  I made use of the adjective analogous in the context to make it clear to the House and, through the House to everybody dealing with the council, that we were in no way importing a different ethos into this domain.  This is something we should be aware of.  We are inclined to speak of the technological and university sector as being strictly dichotomous but it is not.  While in many European countries one will not find technological faculties or departments in the old universities, in Ireland we have a considerable technological section in all the universities and in the university <Col N="1264" /> colleges.  It is for that reason that I want to insist that in this area and with this council we are in a different position and a different council and are in no way indicating that the university will dictate its ethos in this sphere.</P>
    <P>The reference to universities in this State could be regarded as a little restrictive but only if we look at it in the terms in which Deputy Collins looked at it&mdash;in specifics.  I said originally that we were not interested in the specifics of it; we were just indicating the type of standard and prestige we want for this totally distinct and individual award given by the NCEA.  In an earlier part of the debate Deputy Horgan referred to the reference in the CNAA in Britain.  The wording used is:</P>
    <P>ensuring that the degrees, diplomas, certificates and other academic awards and distinctions granted and conferred by the Council in the subjects assigned to the Committee are comparable in standard to awards granted and conferred by universities.</P>
    <P>The fact that it is in this charter is no reason why it should be in this Bill.  I mentioned it to indicate to the House that &ldquo;by universities&rdquo; are the two words used.  It is simply in the same field and with the same objective that it is used in connection with the CNAA.  I do not need to add any more to what I have said.  The universities in the State are recognised internationally and consequently the idea of international recognition is, at least as we say it in Irish, intuigthe from the use of the words &ldquo;university in the State&rdquo;.  All the universities on the island are recognised internationally as are their achievements and standards.</P>

      <P>The Minister has a small doubt as to the use of the words &ldquo;university in the State&rdquo;.  I think he would prefer &ldquo;standard required by a university&rdquo;.  That is what I gathered from <Col N="1265" /> what he said.  It would be a better use of words and would be better than taking the narrow definition.  We must look at the Bill in specific terms as well as in general terms.  The word &ldquo;universities&rdquo; or &ldquo;university&rdquo; would have been a better choice than &ldquo;university in the State&rdquo; which is extremely narrow.</P>
      <P>The Minister is very committed to the binary system and therefore to the evolution of the non-university sector.  I would have thought he would have been happy to use a different phraseology in the context of the Bill.  My amendment is more logical and would lead to a wider interpretation by the council in relation to standards.  Now they will only be allowed to look at standards applicable to a university in the State.  The importation of the university ethos which the Minister said is not happening is happening. The comparisons allowed to the council in respect of standards under this section are confined to standards applicable to a university in the State.  That is a fact whether considered generally or specifically.  The only comparisons the council may make are those with a university in the State.  That is not what was intended originally and certainly is not desirable because it is too narrow.  I would suggest that the word &ldquo;universities&rdquo; would be a better substitution for the words &ldquo;a university in the State&rdquo;.  If the Minister is not favourably disposed to my use of the words &ldquo;nationally and internationally&rdquo;, I suggest that he propose some amendment now eliminating the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;, merely leaving the word &ldquo;university&rdquo; as a general comparison.</P>

I am eliminating subsection (3) (c) of the section as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording of section 10 gives the impression that the director has a pre-eminence in the Bill and has a superior standing to that of the council.  I was somewhat taken aback when we were discussing the question of residency that the Minister stated that the real powerhouse of the Bill lay in the boards of studies.  The real powerhouse of this Bill is and should be the council.  They should be the pre-eminent arm because they constitute the policy-making body; nobody else, no other board of studies should have pre-eminence over them. The wording of the section gives the impression that the director is the bossman, the big chief, is the person around whom revolves the future of the council and the direction the council will take.  That is wrong.  The director is an employee of the council.  He is paid a salary, has certain functions to carry out under the council and under the council's direction. He is merely an employee and should be <Col N="1267" /> seen to be such under this section.  The wording of the Bill clearly gives pre-eminence to the director, his functions, his duty, position, potential, dictatorial powers not alone in section 10 but elsewhere.  That is wrong and I feel it will damage the standing of the council and the relative freedom its members feel they should have under the Bill.</P>

      <P>I think we have gone over this ground already.  The case has been made, of course, of the importance of the director's post.  In his various contributions on the matter Deputy Collins seemed to be of the opinion that the director was being given too much power.  The director, in his capacity as the chief officer of the council, has an obligation to put suggestions before the council.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that, while I am adhering to the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the very fact that the council have to consider suggestions or proposals does not in any way bind the council.  The council are at liberty to assess, discuss, debate, accept or reject what comes from the director.  This being so, the whiphand is that of the council all the time.  I see no danger whatsoever to the integrity, independence or freedom of action of the council in their having to consider what comes before them from the director so long as the right to accept, reject or modify rests with the council.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;(1)  The Council shall appoint a Registrar whose functions shall be to establish and maintain all the records, minutes, decisions and correspondance of the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The appointment of the Registrar shall be on such terms and <Col N="1268" /> conditions as the Council shall decide, and he or she shall be an officer of the Council and may be removed only by a special resolution of the Council.</P>
    <P>(3)  The Registrar may resign his office by giving six months' notice in writing to the Council.</P>
    <P>(4)  The Registrar shall have the right to be present at all meetings of the council and any such other meetings as the Registrar shall see fit.</P>
    <P>(5)  The Registrar shall convene meetings of the Council.</P>
    <P>(6)  The Registrar shall maintain a register of awards made by the Council&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I consider this amendment of great importance to the Bill.  We are here establishing a National Council for Educational Awards which will have the responsibility of the non-university sector, the standards and the granting of awards, indeed the overall co-ordination of the sector.  Such a body, with award-giving powers, should have a registrar which office should be a protected office under the Bill.  It should have its legal position quite clearly stated in the Bill, with its functions and duties being clearly set out.  To my mind the omission from this Bill of the office of registrar is a major one.  Nevertheless it is an omission which can be rectified now and, if done, will improve considerably the quality of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There should be a registrar whose function should be to establish and maintain all records, minutes, decisions and correspondence of the council.  That is extremely important.  The director is the chief officer who has many functions and duties to carry out.  The present incumbent of the office does trojan work. The burden of the director's work should be kept within certain limits.  He should be removed from the function of keeping records of awards made and decisions taken by the council.  The keeping of records is of vital importance in an institution responsible for the awarding of degrees, certificates and diplomas and, <Col N="1269" /> therefore, should be the responsibility of a special person.  There are registrars in our universities, which is as it should be, but the council, which will be carrying out similar functions to the universities in that it will be awarding degrees, certificates and diplomas, will not have a registrar.  I suggest that the Minister reconsider his decision and create the separate office of registrar to the council.</P>

      <P>We discussed this matter earlier.  It is interesting to note that the original advertisement for the appointment of the director mentioned the functions of registrar in connection with the director.  However, that does not mean that in the future the council will not have a registrar.  I should like to tell the House that there are eight authorised posts of assistant registrar.  If the Deputy reads section 11 (1) he will see that there is provision for the council to appoint such members of staff as it thinks fit, subject to the sanction of the Ministers for Education and the Public Service.  In order to remove some of the fears mentioned by Deputy Collins about lack of provision in this area, I should like to mention that that subsection covers all posts.  It means that there is power in the Bill to appoint a registrar, if the council wishes and if that appointment is approved by the Ministers concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the motives behind Deputy Collins's amendment which is a perfectly valid one.  The Minister's approach is ironic in that he says that there is no problem at all about the council appointing a registrar in its own good time, but the position of registrar is important.  For that reason it would be no harm to write such an appointment into the Bill, as suggested.  I am also aware that there are eight assistant registrars operating within the NCEA.  It is faintly ludicrous to have eight assistants to a person who does not exist because, as far as I am aware, the NCEA does not have a registrar at present. Is it intended to appoint a registrar?</P>

      <P>I accept the existence of the assistant registrars and that the council may create the position of registrar in its general functions, but that should not be left to the discretion of the council.  Generally speaking, that is a protected office and the functions and duties of a registrar should be specified in the Bill.  It should be seen to be a statutory office as is the office of director. It is important that the office of registrar is established from the outset to safeguard the records of the council and co-ordinate the safe-keeping of correspondence, minutes of council meetings, council decisions and awards.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 11, after line 44, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Where an order under this section is proposed to be made, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In the amendment I am seeking to ensure that any order which the Minister revokes or amends is brought before the House.  An original order is brought before the House and it would be only proper parliamentary procedure to insert a provision whereby an amended or revoked order is also brought before the House.  Earlier in the Bill there is a mechanism whereby an order must come before the House.  An order whereby the Minister designates a new college or school as being an institute to which this Bill applies, or any amendment to that order, should come before the House. That is good parliamentary procedure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>An order under section 20 will entail consultation with the council by the Minister; it will involve consultation with any other Minister concerned, and finally it will entail consultation with the Minister for the Public Service. This means that two and sometimes three or more&mdash;depending on the areas of interest&mdash;responsible bodies will have to be consulted.  Indeed, the higher educational authority might have to be consulted as well, on occasion.  There is sufficient onus on the Minister to consult to obviate the necessity of the procedure envisaged by Deputy Collins's amendment. Provision is made for a resolution of the House in connection with other orders but in this matter it would not be necessary to bring it before the House.  It will not help in speeding up the process. For that reason the amendment is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins referred to the provision for this procedure elsewhere in the Bill.  In section 20 there is no way that the order affects the work or functions of the council.  It is simply connected with designating another institution which would come under the council.  There is a fundamental difference in what the ministerial order does in the two cases. Under the procedure in section 20 there is no need to come before the House as suggested in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>When we spoke on Committee Stage I said that while I supported the thought behind Deputy Collins's amendment, it was perhaps a little heavy for the situation envisaged.  It is important that orders made under this section should be laid before the House in a negative sense, that is, providing that the order should take effect unless a resolution disallowing or disapproving of it is passed by either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made much of the consultation process that must be gone through before an order is made but it only means effectively that after consultation only two people have an effective right to say yes or no, in this case the Minister for Education, and in staffing or financial matters the Minister for the Public Service.  The Minister argued <Col N="1272" /> that such a process of consultation could not involve such a degree of irresponsibility that he would make an order which would need to be challenged in the House.  Will the Minister accept that there is responsibility on this side of the House also?  If the Minister were prepared to consider between now and sending the Bill to the Seanad the possibility of putting in a negative order section which would require him to put down an order and have the order pass into law automatically, unless a disapproving motion were passed in either House, that would meet the point. Whatever our views about the merits of the cases involved it is open to the Minister under this Bill to designate an institution after such consultation without the consent of the institution concerned.  In the extremely unlikely situation of that arising, it should be open to Members of the House to decide whether the institution concerned has a case and whether that case ought to be answered by the Minister in the House. The Members of the House should have the freedom to put down a disapproving motion to any such order made by the Minister.  Will the Minister think about this again before he steers the Bill through the Seanad?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that section 20 does not affect in essence the functions of the council.  I accept that there is a difference between this and the order which the Minister has to make under section 3.  An order designating a school, college or institute of education will not be made every day, but when the Minister wants to designate a new college it is only right that he should come before the House with an order.  At least the procedure should be accepted that where a Minister designates a new educational institute or college as being an institute or college to which this Bill applies, it is good parliamentary procedure to come before the House with such an order or with any amendment to such an order.  It at least recognises the Parliament in relation to major matters.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider my amendment as it is <Col N="1273" /> non-political and is merely to ensure good parliamentary procedure.</P>

      <P>In page 13, line 3, to delete &ldquo;Director and such number of other members&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;such number of members&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for amendment No. 13 is primarily to exclude the director from being a member of boards of studies. The director has a vast amount of work to do without being a member of what will be numerous boards of studies inquiring into a vast variety of subjects possibly at similar times.  The second reason is that the director is himself a member of the council and will, with the other members of the council, be considering the report of a board of studies. He should, therefore, have an open mind about the matter especially because he is director.  I take it that members of the council will still be eligible to be members of boards of studies simply because some of them may have some specialised knowledge of a field of study and certainly they should quite properly be members of boards of study.  I accept that, but the director is in a peculiar situation in that he is chief executive of the council and he should be slightly removed from the boards of study and from the general problems that arise.  He should be able to take an outside look at the problems as they arise and give his independent opinion about matters.  His freedom will be somewhat curtailed if he <Col N="1274" /> is forced to be a member of boards of studies.  He should be left back up in the council so as to be able to look into the procedures and be involved in the consideration of various problems at council level.  He should be slightly removed from the boards of studies.  I ask the Minister to agree to this amendment.</P>

      <P>I would prefer my own formula to that of Deputy Collins.  There is not a great deal of difference between them except that my amendment No. 15 is a clarificatory amendment which is designed for the avoidance of doubt, to make sure that the director would have the right to attend meetings of boards of studies if he should so wish.  We have introduced a bad principle into the Bill by making the director a member of the council.  That is fundamentally wrong and it is unnecessary.  Not only is he a member of the council with all that it entails, not only is he director with all the responsibility that that entails, but he is also, the Minister has reminded the House, the registrar.  He is going to be the Fionn Mac Cumhaill of Irish educational administration.</P>

      <P>Just as the president of University College is <i>ex officio</i> a member of all the boards of studies, we thought that to incorporate into the Bill this power for the director would help him to see that the council's policy with regard to the boards of studies would be followed through.  Also he would be a kind of link man, thus making for more efficiency in the assessing of courses and the decision to make awards for them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan made the point earlier in this debate that pressure was very heavy on the director.  He made that point again today and I accept it, but it is important that the potential of acting on the boards of studies should be there.  I did agree on an earlier stage that he could not possibly attend all the meetings but the fact that his office would be aware of what the boards of studies are doing is important for the proper functioning of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>The objectives which the International Energy Agency had in designating October of this year as Energy Conservation Month were not primarily related to the introduction of new policies or measures during that month.  As far as this country is concerned major energy conservation policies or measures had already been introduced or announced.  These included measures relating to insulation of buildings, diversification of heating fuels, efficiency of industrial and commercial boilers and equipment and a broad programme of economies in the public service.  The principal objectives for Energy Conservation Month were to stimulate public awareness of the need for energy conservation, to highlight the extent to which industrial nations are co-operating in the conservation of energy and to plan events or introduce programmes emphasising conservation.</P>
      <P>My Department arranged for a publicity campaign in the press, radio and television aimed at the saving of energy in the home.  Copies of a booklet entitled &ldquo;Energy Management for the Householder&rdquo; prepared for my Department by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards are available to householders through hardware stores and ESB showrooms.  My Department organised a conference on energy conservation in the dairy industry which had an international panel of speakers.  The National Board of Science and Technology, in co-operation with the EEC, have held a seminar on energy systems analysis, which highlighted work currently in hands on an international co-operative basis which can make an important contribution to policy decisions in the energy field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In pursuance of the leading role in energy conservation which I assigned to them some months ago, the Institute for industrial Research and Standards have commenced a major new programme including <Col N="1277" /> an extended programme for boiler testing on a national basis, the building energy advisory service and the public building energy management service.</P>
    <P>Apart from these matters in which my Department have taken the initiative or have been actively concerned, they have acted as a clearing house, and issued press announcements, on a large programme of events planned by various bodies.  Earlier this year 400 circular letters were sent to organisations catering for commercial, industrial, educational, residents/tenants associations and other interests throughout the country bringing to their notice the objects of Energy Conservation Month and exhorting them to undertake events with the emphasis on the objectives set out by the IEA.  My Department were advised of more than 40 events which have been organised by various groups throughout the country and have assisted in the provision of speakers and other arrangements.  As examples of the varying nature of the functions which have been organised, there was a two-day course for architects at UCD, a month-long exhibition on energy conservation by the ESB at their Fleet Street, Dublin showrooms, a series of seminars organised by Bord Fáilte for the hotel and catering industry, country committees of agriculture organised appropriate events and various chambers of commerce organised exhibitions or seminars.</P>
    <P>I myself, and Ministers and other Ministers of State, have to the extent possible, opened or attended functions organised as part of these programmes and have spoken on the general subject of energy conservation or on particular aspects of it.</P>

      <P>I could not put a figure on it but I have already outlined a very extensive list of items and activities of the Department during the month.  If the Deputy wishes I can submit to him a full list of the events which took place during the month.  It would be totally impossible to put a figure on it because of the involvement of ministerial time and various organisations such as the IIRS and the ESB.</P>

The objectives as set down by the IEA were to provide an international focus for national efforts in energy conservations, to underline the extent to which states are co-operating to conserve energy and to give states the opportunities to plan energy conservation events for the month.  In all of these three the Government were more than successful.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy in relation to his reply to a question on 12 July 1979, the number of civil and public service Departments in which he is satisfied that there is now continuous supervision to ensure (a) that space heating does not exceed 18ºC; (b) active conservation of electricity; (c) more scrupulous servicing of boilers than was formerly the case; (d) more regular maintenance and tuning of vehicles; (e) a change from larger to smaller vehicles; and if he will give examples of this activity to fortify his reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>All Departments have been asked by the Office of Public Works to designate conservation officers for each building which they occupy. Their function is to ensure that appropriate conservation measures are carried out and maintained including ensuring that temperatures are kept down to 18ºC, wherever practicable.  In addition, it will be the job of the conservation officer to inspect thermostats, see that they are not altered and to oversee the reduced use of electricity.  I would add for the Deputy's information also that during the heating off-season, all plant was given a special overhaul by OPW personnel so that it would operate at maximum efficiency at the start of the heating season.  The Office of Public Works have stepped up their already high standard of maintenance and servicing of all heating plant and boilers <Col N="1282" /> and will continue with this improved servicing.</P>
      <P>The OPW carry out frequent and detailed maintenance and service of all their vehicles and they take their vehicles out of operation at intervals for complete overhaul.  Other Departments have undertaken to take similar action and to substitute the use of public transport for private transport wherever feasible.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been requested by the Department of the Environment to review their energy conservation activities and to advise that Department of the outcome.  State-sponsored bodies have re-assessed their needs for energy with a view to reducing their consumption and they are all aware of the necessity to maximise the efficiency of their energy utilisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give a single concrete instance of, for example, a positive directive in any Department to the effect that boiler servicing is to take place on a regular but more frequent basis than before?  Is there one Department with standing instructions to that effect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, all Departments. In April the Minister wrote to all Government Departments seeking their co-operation and the co-operation also of all State bodies under the aegis of the various Departments in reviving and strengthening conservation programmes and listing some obvious conservation measures such as limiting space heating, boiler servicing, proper maintenance and tuning of vehicles, switching off unnecessary lights, switching to smaller vehicles, planning services and seeking advice from advisory services on ways of saving energy in specific areas.  Called for also was stricter enforcement of <Col N="1283" /> speed limits and parking regulations while the importance of fuel economy on farms was stressed too.  That directive was sent to all Ministers with the request that copies be sent to the various semi-State bodies under their control.  The Departments have acted on the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>After all that talk I am still waiting for a concrete example of a stepped-up servicing schedule for boilers or for the tuning of vehicles.  Is there a single Department that the Minister can instance that have given a written instruction to their maintenance officer regarding the more frequent tuning of vehicles?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At least two of the directors have had considerable involvement in different facets of oil trading and three others have varying degrees of experience in relation to oil.  It is, of course, necessary to have a combination of other business <Col N="1285" /> skills and expertise on the board. Specific oil expertise can be acquired as necessary among personnel recruited for key positions.</P>
    <P>The corporation have been in existence for a very short period and have not yet recruited any permanent staff. Services necessary to assist the board in their initial work are being obtained on a consultancy basis and through secondment arrangements with other bodies. Such arrangements are, of course, matters within the competence of the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that I do not intend a reflection of any kind on the members of what seems to me to be a board comprised of very fine people but would the Minister agree that there is not on the board any one person who is visibly and extremely experienced in the oil business?  I know that they are people with experience in businesses that have a good deal to do with oil consumption but that is different from experience in the oil business as such.  If there is any member with this kind of experience, perhaps the Minister would let us know which one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the composition of the board. One member has had 15 years' experience with the ESB in the field of purchasing oil.  Another member has had a career in oil down through the years, first, with one of the five oil companies and afterwards in a company of his own. The secretary of the Department has had considerable experience in negotiating with major international oil companies as a result of which he has established a very significant working relationship with a variety of people in the oil business.  The chairman of the board has a knowledge of the oil business so far as aircraft fuels are concerned.  Since his <Col N="1286" /> appointment in the Department, Mr. Garvey has been engaged to a considerable extent in energy matters. However, I am reluctant to name the various members in this way.  Suffice is to say that right across the board there has been experience in oil matters.  I am sure that Deputy Kelly is very happy also with the success of the board so far.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply to a previous Dáil Question by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 17 July 1979, column 2624 Dáil Debates, setting out some detail the provisions of international conventions and procedures governing the dumping of radioactive waste in international waters.</P>
      <P>In accordance with these procedures the NEA advised this country in advance of the UK operation in July indicating that, after examination, they considered the operation to be in conformity with the provisions of the mechanism.  The Nuclear Energy Board confirmed to my Department that the proposals were within the guidelines and procedures recommended within the framework of the mechanism.</P>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board have advised me that the dumping site involved, which was assessed under agreed procedures as to suitability, is about 370 miles south-west of Mizen Head, County Cork and is, in fact, approximately equidistant from Ireland, Spain, France and Britain.  It has an average depth of some 2.8 miles and the risk of a hazard arising from dumping at the site is negligible. The water in the site area is so structured and the waste packages so designed that the likelihood of tidal drift aided by Atlantic prevailing winds carrying the materials disposed of on the seabed at a depth of 2.8 miles is remote.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will detail the progress made to date towards the establishment of the public inquiry into the proposal for a nuclear power station at Carnsore and the fixing of its terms of reference, and, if in the event of inquiries taking place, the Government propose to consider themselves bound by the findings of the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question must be viewed in the context of the various processes involved in assessing the nuclear proposal.  Last February I announced that the Government had taken a decision in relation to the further consideration of the proposed ESB nuclear generating station at Carnsore Point County Wexford.  This decision was taken against the background that, as well as coal and indigenous resources, nuclear power is seen by many governments as one of the main alternatives to oil which ought to be considered to meet the growing energy needs of the world economy.  The uncertainty about continuing supplies of imported oil in sufficient quantity reinforces the need to consider every realistic option.  The sequence of events likely to enable the Government to review fully the ESB nuclear proposal will probably be as follows: first, the Government authorised the ESB to proceed with completion of the preparatory process of planning the project to the stage where they will have available complete draft specifications; secondly, the Government <Col N="1289" /> set up an inter-departmental committee, comprising representatives at senior level of relevant Government Departments.  The committee's broad terms of reference are to assess in detail all relevant aspects of the ESB's nuclear proposal and to report to me.  These terms of reference include an assessment from the environmental, energy and financial viewpoints and investigation of energy demand forecasts and alternative means of meeting this demand.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the Government propose to introduce special legislation dealing with the building of nuclear power stations in this country and providing, in particular, for the setting up of a special tribunal to hold a single comprehensive inquiry, in public, into all aspects of the ESB project; fourthly, it is intended that the report of the inter-departmental committee will be published in good time so that it will be available for consideration in the course of the hearings of the tribunal; fifthly, the tribunal's report will then be published; sixthly, the results of the various processes mentioned above will then be given careful consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>The inter-departmental committee have been meeting since March last. While it is my intention that the committee report to me as soon as possible, I appreciate that before doing so, they must await the outcome of the investigations into the incident in the Harrisburg Nuclear Plant, which may not be available until early in the new year.</P>
      <P>While the terms of the proposed legislation have not yet been settled, it is intended that the proposed public inquiry will permit consideration of the environmental and planning aspects of the project presently covered by the Planning Acts and the Water Pollution Act and also such matters as health, economics, safety and security.  The House will, of course, have an opportunity to debate fully the proposed legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The holding of the public inquiry will ensure that those concerned will have an appropriate forum to express their views and opinions whatever they may be. <Col N="1290" /> Publishing of the reports of the inter-departmental committee and of the Tribunal, will, I hope, provide the public with an objective and accurate assessment of the issues involved.</P>

      <P>That is interesting news.  I must not be taken as being remiss on this until I have had a chance to think about it.  Is it envisaged that in relation to the inquiry there is going to be a special statutory provision in this individual context to replace the ordinary planning laws?  Is it the case that the planning decision, and the decisions on the other aspects of the matter, are going to be made not by the planning authority but by this <i>ad hoc</i> statutory authority?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While the terms of the proposed legislation have not yet been settled, it is intended that the proposed public inquiry will permit consideration of the environmental and planning aspects of the project presently covered by the Planning Acts and the Water Pollution Act and also such matters as health, economics, safety and security.

      <P>Would the Minister of State be a little more explicit as far as the holding of a public inquiry is concerned, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister said that he would not be bound by any recommendation or views arising from the inquiry?  If the Minister were honest he should describe it purely as a seminar because that is all it is going to be.  Would the Minister not have this issue decided by a referendum as was done in Austria and in other countries of Europe?  I take it from the Minister's reply that the planning permission powers are to be taken from the Wexford County Council.  Will the Minister say in what way, if any, the Wexford County Council will be involved because the people in south Wexford are the people who will be at risk and most concerned?</P>

      <P>In relation to the first point raised by the Deputy, the Minister never said that he would not be bound.  He said he would not be necessarily bound by all the findings in matters of detail.  It was never said that the Government would not be bound by the findings of the tribunal.  Obviously the Government will be setting up a tribunal and it would be inappropriate if the Government were to disregard the basic findings of the tribunal but there could be details and the Government would not necessarily be bound in those cases.</P>

The complaint up to now has been that if there was only an oral hearing before a planning board this would not go into such matters as the safety, economics and security of the proposed plant in Carnsore.  The Government have gone further than required.  Seeing and agreeing to the legitimate points being made by those who have legitimate fears about the construction of a nuclear plant, the Government decided to have a full public inquiry into all aspects of the construction of the plant rather than merely the planning aspects and I have answered these points in this House on a number of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question is related to reports in some Irish daily newspapers of 27 July 1979 in which reference is made to the report of British Nuclear Fuels Limited for the year 1978 which stated that in that year about ten tonnes of uranium were discharged into the Irish Sea from the Windscale Works in Cumbria.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that liquid effluents contaminated by small amounts of radioactive substances are discharged into the Irish Sea from the Windscale Works in Cumbria operated by British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  These discharges are made in accordance with authorisations issued by the UK authorities which limit the total quantities and specific substances which may be discharged.</P>
      <P>I am further advised that the discharges into the Irish Sea in 1978 were within the limits specified in the relevant authorisations.  According to the report of British Nuclear Fuels Limited about ten tonnes of uranium were so discharged during 1978.  The Nuclear Energy Board are satisfied that this represents an insignificantly small quantity of radioactivity which constitutes no hazards to this country.  It is trivial compared with the naturally occurring level of uranium in the Irish Sea.  As uranium is a natural constituent of our rocks, soils and waters all rivers entering the Irish Sea will contain some small quantities of uranium.  The board are also satisfied that small quantities of uranium discharged in the effluents from Windscale during previous years have never been of any significance.</P>
      <P>Representatives of my Department or of the Nuclear Energy Board have no legal authority to carry out an inspection of any installation outside this country. The Windscale Works are, however, subject to strict regulation and control by the UK authorities with whom close co-operation is maintained by the Nuclear Energy Board particularly on safety related matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the absence of a more specific reference by the Deputy I have assumed that he is referring to a newspaper article of 3 October 1979. This article refers to a study carried out on the incidence of myeloid leukaemia after doctors in a group practice centred on Lytham St. Anne's had noted that they had diagnosed 12 cases of myeloid leukaemia over a six-year period.  A team from Manchester University checked in the local cancer registry statistics and found that comparing the period 1965-70 with that from 1971-76 the incidence of myeloid leukaemia had apparently increased. There was, however, insufficient data to show whether this increase was statistically significant.  Similar data for the rest of the UK either locally or nationally were not available to the team.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that, although it has been established that certain toxic chemicals or over-exposure to ionizing radiation are causes of myeloid leukaemia, no direct evidence of either of these causes has been adduced for the apparent increase in the Lancashire area recorded by the researchers of the Manchester University team.</P>
      <P>Research into the causes of cancer including any effects of ionizing radiation has been undertaken over many years and is continuing in many countries, including Ireland.  This work has led, <i>inter alia</i>, to the establishment of radiation dose limits which, if observed, will reduce the probability of the induction of cancer or other health hazards to negligible levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discharges from Windscale and other similar installations in the UK are strictly controlled so as to ensure that no member of the population should be exposed <Col N="1298" /> to radiation doses approaching the above mentioned limits and, as I have indicated to the Dáil on many previous occasions, the Nuclear Energy Board keep in close touch with the appropriate UK authorities and keep me and my Department fully informed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the reply of the Minister not indicative of the attitude that says, for example, that because Newton had not formulated his famous law, the law of gravity did not exist beforehand?  Is the Minister not aware that there is constant and growing discharge of radioactive waste into the Irish Sea and that the effect inevitably will be calamitous, particularly in view of the recent decision of the British Government to build 20 more nuclear reactors?  Will the Minister say what steps he will take to ensure that his Department carry out their responsibility on behalf of the Irish people to make sure they are not being contaminated by radioactive discharge which will be disastrous for them?  What is the point in the Minister calling black white?</P>

There is co-operation between the two nations and that is quite right.  All of us would be concerned if there was a high radiation level in the Irish Sea.  The concern does not exist exclusively on the other side of the House.  We live in this country too.  I live right along the <Col N="1299" /> coastline.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to rural houses to which the scheme referred to in the question applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ESB have informed me that over 99 per cent of rural houses, excluding those of recent construction, have now been connected to the supply, and that <Col N="1300" /> the remaining such houses have already been offered supply at least once on subsidised terms.  Since their introduction in 1946, almost £100 million has been spent on rural electrification schemes.</P>
    <P>Quotations by the ESB for connection to the supply including newly constructed dwellings take into account the fact that the ESB pay the first £115 of the connection cost together with half of the amount by which the connection cost exceeds £850.  A scheme of deferred payments also operates whereby connection costs may be spread over a five-year period.  The Deputy will realise, of course, that it is the electricity consumer who is, in fact, financing these reductions in the full connection cost.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the Council of Agriculture Ministers of the EEC are considering proposals for the stimulation of agriculture in the less favoured areas of the west of Ireland. One of the proposals envisages the provision of finance towards the improvement of the electricity supply in the areas mentioned.</P>

      <P>As regards existing houses, subsidised rural electrification <Col N="1301" /> goes back to 1946, as the Deputy knows.  The 1971-75 rural electrification scheme, which is now completed, was designed to give every unconnected rural householder at the time a further and final opportunity&mdash;they had already received a number of opportunities&mdash;to obtain a supply on subsidised terms.</P>

      <P>In 1976 a Bill was brought in by the then Government&mdash; fair play to them&mdash;allocating a further capital contribution of £300,000 for those still outstanding for connection.  That scheme is now nearly completed.  As regards new houses, I accept the Deputy's point that there is quite considerable cost involved for people building new houses sometimes on sites which, despite the advice of the ESB, people decide to use when they find they cannot get a different site although the site they acquire is very far from the ESB supply.  It was for that reason that the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, got the co-operation of the ESB for a further scheme which I mentioned providing that the first £115 of the connection cost would be met together with half the amount over £850, together with deferred payments over five years.  I accept that it is still a problem for many people, including some constituents of my own.  We hope that the scheme of the Agriculture Ministers will come through early in the new year and if the Deputy wishes to put down another question, say next February, I shall try to get some information for him then.</P>

      <P>The Minister might not be able to answer it then because he might not be here.  Would the Minister, since he is aware from his own profession that houses have a way of changing hands, agree that if somebody had been offered a connection in 1976 and sold his house&mdash;it could have been sold twice since&mdash;it is unfair to penalise the present owner of the house when he applies for <Col N="1302" /> connection and ask him to pay an outlandish sum?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if, following his recent meeting <Col N="1304" /> with the independent coal operators concerning the distribution of coal in the Dublin area, he has under consideration any plans to end the monopoly of coal distribution enjoyed by Coal Distributors Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>Regarding possible abuse by Coal Distributors of their position as sole importers of coal in the Dublin area a number of investigations have been held into the supply and distribution of coal in the years since the reorganisation of the coal trade in 1973, the most recent occasion being earlier this year.  These investigations did not confirm that difficulties in supplying the market can be attributed to abuses of the company's position.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I consider that the position would be improved if other interests became involved in the importation of coal and I hope that every encouragement will be given to people who may have plans of this kind in mind.</P>
      <P>I understand that in the course of the summer Coal Distributors Ltd. became concerned at the incidence of unpaid COD accounts due to the postal strike and the rate at which orders for coal were being placed at a time of year when demand was traditionally very quiet.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the collection of unpaid COD accounts by eliminating orders for small quantities and in an attempt to slow down orders which exceeded the company's ability to supply the company decided to introduce a minimum COD order of a half tonne in mid-June. The restriction was still retained after the postal strike ended in the hope that it would have an impact on the delivery position.  As the Deputies will know, the company suspended the taking of new orders to facilitate clearance of a substantial backlog of deliveries.  They have now resumed the taking of orders and have informed me that orders of less than a half tonne will be accepted but, in order to ensure a fair distribution of available stocks, this quantity will be the upper limit on all orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the retail and wholesale prices <Col N="1305" /> charged by Coal Distributors Ltd. are subject to control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that a situation in which a company which in fact is a virtual monopoly is nevertheless enabled to change its trading practice in the manner he outlined, to introduce a cash on delivery system for people who are only interested or only able or willing to seek small quantities of coal is, in effect, a hidden price increase because it means that such people have to pay the money months earlier than somebody who is awaiting delivery for five or six months? In his view, is that just and satisfactory and does it require the approval of the Prices Commission?  The Minister expressed the hope that others might become involved in this and suggested that every encouragement should be given to people contemplating this.  I should like to know from whom he expects that encouragement to come? What had he in mind when he made that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy seems to be under a misapprehension.  The situation is that Coal Distributors Limited are the sole importers but not the sole distributors within the Dublin region.  In fact, that company distribute only 40 per cent of the coal in the Dublin area.  The remaining 60 per cent is distributed by bellmen who get their supplies from Coal Distributors Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We met them on that point.  Obviously, the question of additional facilities at the port would be of some benefit.  Generally, the Government would like to encourage other private sector people into the importing business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it acceptable to the Minister, his Department and the NPC, or are they interested or concerned, that a situation exists where cash with an order <Col N="1306" /> is insisted upon for those who only have a storage space for up to half a ton of coal while large companies and those able to order tons of coal can retain their money until the order is delivered, perhaps months later?

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That must have come into force in the last week.  Does the Minister consider it just or satisfactory that a company that has the virtual monopoly of coal distribution in the city of Dublin is entitled, apparently, to make its own rules as it goes along?  I am sure the company has the best will in the world in this case but is the Minister satisfied with a situation where we have to look forward to whatever decision the board of that company makes tomorrow to know whether or not the people of the city and adjoining counties will have fuel this winter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he is satisfied that the present trading arrangements for fuel merchants will allow consumers, particularly those on low incomes, to obtain an adequate supply of fuel for the coming winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Demand for coal has been exceptionally heavy this year and it has been suggested that some consumers may have purchased stocks in excess of their likely winter requirements.  Up to the end of October the estimated total quantity of coal imported into the country was substantially in excess of imports for the whole of 1978.  The coal merchants had, in general, planned to meet a demand about 50 per cent higher than last year.  I have been informed by them that consignments from America and Poland expected during the coming months should prove adequate to meet demand.  However, it has been difficult for the trade, in the face of the exceptional demand, to maintain a constant rate of supply because of production difficulties at American mines and railroad congestion there which have disrupted shipping schedules.  Problems have also arisen because of the abnormally high slack content of some shipments of American coal.</P>
      <P>The information available to me at this time suggests that coal stocks in the hands of consumers and the trade together with planned imports until the end of the winter should in the aggregate be sufficient to meet normal requirements and to offset a shortfall in heating oil supplies of somewhat greater proportions than would be expected in the light of the immediate oil situation.  There are, however, a number of factors which could distort this position.  If it is a fact that some customers have already purchased more coal than they will need this winter then, to that extent, some of this year's additional imports may be hoarded.  For a variety of reasons the stocks and delivery position is not uniform throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> Demand from now on will be materially influenced by the weather conditions. While the immediate oil situation has shown an improvement, the supply-demand balance is delicate and, therefore, vulnerable to unforeseen events.  For these reasons I have been keeping the coal supply situation under constant surveillance and my Department have maintained close contact with coal traders in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have informed me that availability of machine turf to the domestic market this winter will be about the same as last year, but this is unlikely to meet demand.  While the maximum possible output of briquettes from existing production facilities is expected to be achieved, this also is likely to be less than demand.  A new briquette factory is under construction and further production capacity is also planned. These will not, of course, contribute to supplies this winter but they will assist the position from 1980-81 onwards.</P>
    <P>As regards oil, the Deputy will be aware that I have authorised oil suppliers to make an initial delivery of 1,000 litres of heating oil for each domestic customer.  Here again I have been keeping the situation under close review and there have been continuous consultations between my Department and representatives of the trade.  Information available from these consultations and the fact that the National Petroleum Corporation has been able to make arrangements for a substantial purchase of gas-diesel oil, indicate some improvement in our general supply position.  I am now giving active consideration to the possibility of authorising a second delivery of 1,000 litres for domestic consumers to commence as soon as the oil companies facilities permit.</P>
    <P>I understand from the bottled gas companies that they have been preparing to meet a reasonable increase in demand for LPG over the coming winter.</P>
    <P>As regards the position of lower income groups, I understand that the Minister for Social Welfare has dealt with a number of questions from the Deputy relating to fuel arrangements.  If <Col N="1309" /> major difficulties which are specifically related to the non-availability of supplies come to my notice I will make every effort to alleviate the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to coal stocks, I should like to know how the Minister obtains his information?  Are requests made to the company or do the Department make investigations?  Is it based on the mere acceptance of the word of those involved commercially?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This system has developed over the years by checking with ports and shipping and the building up of contacts with the companies. There is a continuous supply of information from the companies to the Department and that information is checked through shipping and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>A series of meetings were held in August with the various importers of coal and the figure quoted was checked against the shipping arrangements and the planned shipping programme.  As I mentioned, the companies experienced some difficulties because of the situation in American mines and railroad congestion in that country.  Because of that some of the shipping schedules have slipped back but we are expected to import 50 per cent more than last year.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the projects outlined in Derryfada, Mountdillon, Athlone and Bangor Bog should proceed as rapidly as possible.  The question of the opening up of the bogs is a matter for the Department of the Environment.  Under the local improvement scheme a considerable <Col N="1311" /> additional sum of money was put into the Estimate for 1979.  I understand that it amounted to £1 million more than for 1978.  There is also a scheme run by the Department of the Gaeltacht under which grants are available of up to 100 per cent towards the cost of repairing and improving minor access roads and roads serving bogs in Gaeltacht areas.  We have one scheme in our own Department but it is merely for the roads into the small turf burning electricity generating stations at Gweedore, Milltown Malbay and Cahirciveen.  We do not have any funds in our Department for the projects mentioned by the Deputy which come under the Department of the Environment where an extra £1 million has been provided this year.</P>

    <Title>National Council for Education Awards Bill, 1978: Fifth Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the end of the Dáil debate on the setting up on a statutory basis of the National Council for Education Awards and brings to an end the question of the comprehensive system for education at the third level. We are firmly establishing a binary system of third level education and the NCEA are being empowered on a statutory basis to co-ordinate and develop non-university third level.  To the extent that the council are being established on a statutory basis, I welcome the present position in so far as it resolves their <i>ad hoc</i> position and it firmly establishes them as a statutory body.  That is as it should be and the council will have my good wishes in their deliberations in the coming years.</P>
      <P>I expressed doubts about the binary system and stated clearly that I am basically in favour of the unitary or comprehensive system for the third level sector, especially in the context of a country as small as Ireland.  I questioned the position of the HEA in the third level non-university sector.  The Bill has not adequately covered their role in this sector and in my view they are being left out in the cold.  That is unfortunate and unnecessary. I am aware of reservations held by many people in the non-university sector about the university bias of the HEA.  I do not consider that to be a major obstacle because, if necessary, the composition of the HEA could have been changed to allow for the non-university sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that in the coming years the HEA will have the close contacts with the NCEA the Minister said.  I am apprehensive about the amount of consultation in relation to evolving policy.  I do not believe the provisions of section 16 in relation to the HEA financing <Col N="1357" /> the NCEA.  I do not believe that is the same as the NCEA having an input into the policy-making function of the HEA.  Therefore, I have serious reservations about the attitude the Minister is taking to the NCEA <i>vis-à-vis</i> their relationship with the HEA.</P>
    <P>I criticised the composition of the council.  I said it should have been wider, that the Union of Students in Ireland should have been specifically mentioned in section 5 and that they should be allowed <i>de jure</i> to be elected to the council. I regret the Minister has not tackled this aspect.  I appreciate that it would be difficult to satisfy everybody when the composition of the council was being decided but we can only hope that the council as composed in the Bill will work equitably and that the Minister will ensure that all interests in the non-university sector will be represented on the council.</P>
    <P>I said, too, that the question of apprenticeships was not adequately dealt with and that other subjects should have been specifically mentioned in section 3. The Minister put too narrow a section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The position of the director of the council, as specified in section 10, is not satisfactory.  The Bill gives too much emphasis to the role of director as opposed to the role of the council.  It should have been clearly specified that the director has a subsidiary role to play <i>vis-à-vis</i> the council and that the council are the supreme moving force under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Lastly, in my opinion we should have a register.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for accepting the amendment about the residency clause for members of the council.  He did so in a generous spirit.  That was a wise thing to do and I thank him for his generosity.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House.  We have spoken at length on this Bill and have given it a comprehensive examination. We have agreed to differ on a number of points.</P>
    <P>I wish the council well in their deliberations.  I am sure the non-university <Col N="1358" /> sector, which can only be looked upon as the most important developing sector of third level education, has a great future and, under proper and wise council guidance from the council, will be a dynamic force in our education system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are sending the Bill from this House and we send it with the good wishes of myself and of the Labour Party.  There are flaws in this Bill and we have spent a great deal of time arguing about them since we started this lengthy debate, but I do not believe that any of them attack the core and substance of the Bill in any serious way, that is, the establishment of a statutory basis of the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
      <P>It is perhaps a reflection on the way in which we do our business nowadays and on the way in which events tend to overtake institutions which have grown a bit creaky in the joints that we are setting up in this Bill on a statutory basis an organisation which has been in existence for a number of years.  I am reminded of the famous character in Myles na gCopaleen's novel <i>At Swim Two Birds</i> who was born at the age of 20.  The difference between that character and the NCEA is that Myles na gCopaleen's character had a memory but without an experience to fill it, whereas in the case of the NCEA there is already ample experience. One might almost say that it is a rare occasion when so many children attend the marriage of their parents.</P>
      <P>I hope that this Bill may prove the end of a phase during which we have referred to the technological sector of education as the non-university sector.  I have never been in favour of negative definitions and I am reminded of the parable of the not unblack dog who chased the not unwhite sheep across the not ungreen field. With this Bill on a statutory basis, I hope that technological education will come into its own.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Dáil agus go háirithe leis na <Col N="1359" /> Teachtaí a bhí liom, mar a dearfá, nuair nach raibh siad i mo choinne, i rith na díospóireachta.  Tá an diospóireacht anois beagnach thart agus an Bille beagnach rite sa Dáil.  Dúirt mé nuair a thosnaigh mé anseo gurb í an fhorbairt is tábhachtaí ón Acht 1908 i leith, is é sin an tAcht a bhunaigh Ollscoil Náisiúnta na hÉireann.  Níor chuala mé aon rud ó shin a chuirfeadh mise ar a chontráracht de thuairim sa Teach seo.  Tá sé anathábhachtach ar fad go mbeadh forbairt ar an teicneolaíocht sa tír agus chuile dhuine a chabhraigh liom anseo, tá buíochas ag gabháil dó.</P>
      <P>Mar gheall ar an mBille féin agus an chomhairle, ní dóigh liom go mbeidh aon rud cumhang-aigeantach ag baint leis. Dúradh sa díospóireacht go mbeadh an chontúirt ann da mba rud é go raibh béim rómhór ar gnéithe teichniúla amháin, go mbeadh robots á gcruthú againn san chuid sin den oideachas.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon rud san Bhille seo go mbeadh an claonadh sin air.</P>
      <P>Luaigh an Teachta Collins an córas dáaicme nó an binary system agus an córas cuimsitheach.  Dúirt mise i bhfad ó shín gurb í an fhealsúnacht atá agam mar gheall air sin ná go mbeadh an dá chóras ag druidim le chéile, nach mbeadh córas amháin ag teacht crosta ar an gcóras eile.  Sin mo thuairim go fóill agus sin an aidhm agus an cuspóir atá agam.</P>

Dúirt an Teachta Collins nach mbeadh a dhóthain tionchair ag Údáras Um Ard Oideachas ar an gcomhairle nua.  Tá fhios ag chuile dhuine agus ag chuile Theachta sa Dáil agus ag chuile dhuine a bhfuil baint aige le cúrsaí polaitíochta go bhfuil ana-thábhacht ar fad ag baint leis an geilleagar, agus tá fhios againn go mbeidh an tUdarás Um Ard Oideachas ag tabhairt an airgid don chomhairle agus beidh ar an Údáras Um Ard Oideachas mar sin súil ghéar a choinneáil ar an gcomhairle, agus bíodh an Teachta seo sásta go mbeidh tionchar <Col N="1360" /> maith ag an Údarás ar an gcomhairle.</P>
    <P>I rith na díospóireachta bhíomar ag caint ar na mic léinn.  Theaspáin mise don Teach agus don Teachta a bhí ag caint go bhfuil cumhacht ag an Aire iad a chur ar an gcomhairle, agus dúirt mé gur gné freachnairceach den oideachas sa tír seo agus i dtíortha eile go bhfuil na mic léinn ag cur suime ní amháin i riarachán sna hollscoileanna ach freisin sna hábhair atá á múineadh iontu.  Is maith an rud sin agus tá fhios agam go mbeadh siad in inimhe comhairle a thabhairt don CNCO chun é d'fhorbairt.</P>
    <P>Tá fhios agam nach bhfuil an Teachta Collins sásta leis an méid atá sa Bhille mar ceapann sé gur cóir an Comhairle Oiliúna a bheith luaite ann agus ceapann sé gur cóir go mbeadh baint níos mó ag an gcomhairle leis an gComhairle Oiliúna. Mar do mhinigh mé i rith na díospóireachta, tá mise sásta go bhfuil ár ndóthain againn sa Bhille seo mar gheall ar na cáilíochtaí, agus is comhairle um cháilíochtaí atá i gceist againn anseo.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar na cumhachtaí atá ag an gcomhairle féin, tá se so-léite sa Bhille go bhfuil an cumhacht iomlán ag an gcomhairle.  Dá bhrí sin, aon seirbhíseach atá ag an gcomhairle, tá sé go díreach faoin gcomhairle, agus ní féidir le haoinne&mdash;an duine is tábhachtaí de na seirbhísí go dtí an duine is lú des na seirbhísí&mdash;aon rud a dhéanamh gan toiliú na comhairle.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an Teachta Horgan, cé go raibh díospóireacht againn anseo agus leasúcháin agus rl, nach raibh croí an Bhille faoi ionsaí anseo; admhaím sín agus tá me buíoch de na Teachtaí mar gheall air sin.  Is beartas reachtúil é seo agus is dóigh liom go rachaidh sé chun socair na teicneolaíochta agus chun socair na tíre.</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `the Act of 1977' means the European Assembly Elections Act, 1977;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments extend to the European institutions what already exists in regard to our parliamentary institutions in the way of preclusion from membership or employment on central or regional boards of any member of the European Assembly.

I take it that the words &ldquo;European Economic Community, the <Col N="1362" /> European Coal and Steel Community and the European Automic Energy Community&rdquo; as far as the EEC are concerned mean that this Bill, out to 12 miles, covers what is under the ocean as well as the fish in the sea and so on.</P>

      <P>What we are talking about here is up to a 12 mile radius.  If that is the case it means that anything under the sea belongs to the Irish people.  The thought strikes me that when the Minister is negotiating at a future date he will be talking about a 12 mile exclusive limit under something similar.  Am I right in thinking that there is a 12 mile limit and this is why the Minister brought in these amendments?</P>

      <P>&ldquo; `the Salmon Conservancy Fund' means the fund described in section 49 of the Principal Act;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment to define the term &ldquo;Salmon Conservancy Fund&rdquo;. It was used in sections 20 and 52 and was designed for the purposes of section 52 only.

      <P>&ldquo; `strokehaul' means any weighted instrument or device which may be used, whether with a rod and line or otherwise, to foul-hook fish;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I came under a lot of pressure and had a lot of representations and advice from people genuinely concerned with conservation and the need to strengthen the law in regard to conservation to define strokehaul.  There had been a number of cases where there was a legal flaw in the strokehauling offence, which is deplorable and to be condemned, in that there was no definition of strokehauling. On the technical legal flaw arising out of existing legislation many offenders were getting away.  Lawyers were raising points on a technical basis.  My advice is that a lack of definition of strokehaul was the problem and we are now defining it for the first time.  I am told by those enforcing it that this should help substantially in successful prosecutions for strokehauling fish.</P>

      <P>At present there is no definition.  We are trying to introduce a definition.  I agree with the Deputy that it may not be fully satisfactory but if we have a specific weighted thing written into the Bill it would be unsatisfactory. The amendment states that it is &ldquo;any weighted instrument or device which may be used, whether with a rod and line or otherwise, to foul-hook fish&rdquo;.  By reason of the fact that there was no definition, court cases against offenders as regards this totally illegal fishing were being successfully defended.  We are making a start and will see how it goes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My concern is that the average angler legitimately fishing for trout, salmon or other fish who applies a weight, as is usual in some instances, for example, a small portion of lead, could be charged under this section as having used a weighted instrument or device for legitimate fishing purposes.  That is why I asked whether the Minister might be prepared to specify the weight, beyond half an ounce, one ounce or whatever. The weight could affect legitimate anglers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy.  This is very important.  We would be making a big mistake if we did not define some kind of weight.  What the Minister said is that anyone who uses any weight on the line can be prosecuted. Strokehaul means any weighted instrument and that means that anybody using anything on the line could be hauled before the courts.  This is what Deputy Treacy is concerned about and rightly so.  Perhaps it should be defined more clearly on Report Stage.  We are not disagreeing with the Minister but we should like a clearer definition.</P>

We are talking here, first, about strokehauling, secondly, about a weighted instrument or device and finally about foul-hooking fish.  The whole amendment is subject to the final phrase &ldquo;to foul-hook fish&rdquo; which puts it into the illegal category as against what both Deputies have been talking about here&mdash;the legal or legitimate category.

      <P>In page 6, lines 19 to 25, to delete subsection (2).</P>
      <P>This amendment, if adopted, would mean the deletion <i>in toto</i> of subsection (2).  Therefore, my main amendment is amendment No. 11 which reads:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), paragraph (g), lines 7 to 11, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;but this paragraph&rdquo; in line 7 down to and including &ldquo;Act&rdquo; in line 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for putting down these amendments is that for the past two decades the Inland Fisheries Trust have been the only body carrying out research on sea angling and sports fisheries.  Most <Col N="1366" /> of the fish species concerned are of little or no commercial value to the overall annual catch of professional fishermen. However, to judge by statistics supplied by, say, Bord Fáilte, marine sports fisheries make a very definite and worth-while contribution to the State's economy.  I understand that some £4.6 million were garnered from this source in the form of tourist revenue in 1977.  If the new board are precluded from carrying out such research it seems to me it is unlikely that their essential work will be continued or be undertaken to the same degree and in as satisfactory a manner as we would all desire.</P>
    <P>Naturally, commercial species such as herring, mackerel, cod and so on would have precedence over non-commercial species.  The investigation of a sea angling development programme, as suggested in the Bill, as a function of the board makes little sense if the fishery authority are not allowed to engage in their own research in this important area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my tabling this amendment was to bring again to the Minister's notice the importance of sea angling sports to our tourist revenue, something of growing importance, and to ensure that it is adequately provided for in the Bill.  That was the reason also for my adverting to this on Second Reading.  This amendment is tabled to afford the Minister an opportunity of doing as I have proposed here&mdash;ensuring that the excellent revenue&mdash;raising area of sea fisheries is adequately protected.  I think it would be the wish of tourist bodies generally and all those engaged in industry that this be done.  I trust the Minister will see his way to accepting my amendment in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, replying to the Second Stage debate on 23 October 1979, at column 486 of the Official Report said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that so far as sea angling is concerned there is no intention in regard to this Bill to remove sea angling in any way in terms of research, development and management, <Col N="1367" /> from the responsibility of the new Inland Fisheries Authority.</P>
    <P>So far so good.  What Deputy Treacy is endeavouring to ensure, quite rightly, is that the research undertaken by the new central board will not be in relation only to lakes and rivers but possibly also restocking and conservation, enabling our tourist revenue to be protected.  Deputy Treacy quoted a figure of some £4 million.  When I was speaking in this debate I stated&mdash;and I honestly believe&mdash;that £4 million is a drop in the ocean only by comparison with what we could be doing in sea angling were it properly promoted and advertised.  But we cannot undertake these projects unless there is also undertaken a lot of research to establish that the different species are available to sea anglers.  I think Deputy Treacy is endeavouring to ensure that these people's interests will be looked after, not merely as regards the fish but in relation to research also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take fully the points made by Deputies Treacy and White.  In fact it was because of their interventions on Second Stage that I introduced amendment No. 12 which I think meets the substance of what Deputy Treacy has in mind in his amendments 5 and 11. In effect what we are doing in amendment No. 12 is to retain the existing research situation as far as the Inland Fisheries Trust are concerned.  The Inland Fisheries Trust would be subsumed by the new central board organisation but any work being done by them at present will continue to be done by the new central board.  I think the wording of amendment No. 12 meets the views expressed by both Deputies, in that research being carried out by the trust prior to their dissolution will continue.  They have done a lot of very valuable work&mdash;and I should like to take this opportunity of saying so&mdash;in regard to sea fish.  That is also written into amendment No. 12.  That work has to be respected and continued. Therefore, the present sea fish angling research work being carried out by the trust will be carried into the new situation.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister speak in those terms.  I will concede that his amendment No. 12 very largely meets my wishes in the matter. But I should like to be thoroughly assured that the wonderful experience, research and expertise built up by the Inland Fisheries Trust in this vital area of angling sports fisheries over a long number of years will continue to be availed of and be utilised by the central board.  It would be a tragedy were that lore of information and expertise to be lost to us.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Inland Fisheries Board is about to be subsumed into the Central Board.  The talent is there; the information is there; the experts are there. If the Minister can assure me that that great lore of experience and expertise in this area will be utilised to the full in the future, I shall be satisfied that amendment No. 12 very largely meets this situation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy can be absolutely assured on that aspect.  I have tremendous admiration for the work done by the Inland Fisheries Trust, precisely in this area of sea angling, in particular, and the whole investigation into stocks of sea angling and tourism benefits and the amazing benefits that arise generally from their work and their excellent research facilities.  I can assure the Deputy that there was never any intention of interfering, in any way, with that development.  The intention was always to make more progress in this precise area.  A legislative drafting omission was raised by both Deputies and by some others on Second Stage and I immediately saw that there could be a wrong interpretation and this amendment rectifies the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 16 and 17, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv) appoint a Scientific and Technical Committee to advise, monitor and assess the scientific and technical policies of the Central and Regional Boards,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reasoning here is that, as outlined in my Second Reading speech, the board of the central fisheries authority will, of necessity, represent both commercial fishing and angling interests throughout the country.  As much of the work of the new central authority will be of a highly technical nature, an advisory committee of technical people could and should play a valuable role in terms of: firstly, <Col N="1371" /> advising on the formulation of a work schedule; secondly, monitoring the progress of technical research and development programmes; thirdly, assessing the quality of the work in progress.  Such a committee would necessarily be composed of representatives from major bodies with executive and professional responsibilities in the fisheries field.  A similar committee is already active in relation to the water resources division of An Foras Forbartha and the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards, where they perform a useful role in the areas outlined above and also have acted as an important link group in the interdepartmental studies that have gone on from time to time.  A similar committee in the inland fishery authority context would provide a useful liaison between fishery pollution control and drainage interests. I leave my point with the Minister on that basis at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Treacy on this and feel that the Minister will also agree.  What we want is to leave this section as wide as possible.  If we confine the central board's position and do not clearly allow them a widening of role, we shall be making a big mistake. On Committee Stage, the Minister might include the very important words &ldquo;scientific and technical committee&rdquo;.  Everyone realises that we need more and more research and technical laboratories to look at the reasons for, for example, the shortage of salmon in our rivers, leaving out the drift-net position altogether, purely from research.  I have talked about hybrids or a very special type of cattle, and we all agree that a very special type of fish can be produced with the right technical know-how.  This wording is very important indeed.  I would like to see far more use being made of our hatcheries, that they should be provided with much more money, time and energy for their research and that the hatcheries should be the most modern in Europe.  If we have not got the technical and scientific know-how, we are wasting our time over this Bill.  It is <Col N="1372" /> very important not to curtail but to enlarge the technical side to give the central board as much power and as much money as they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputies suggest in the amendment.  It is fundamental to have proper advice and monitoring in regard to the scientific and technical policy of the central and regional boards.  I disagree that it is necessary to write this into the legislation. I do not like to have superfluous sections or language in legislation.  Section 7, as it stands, gives the widest possible functions to the central board and I hope that they will be engaged in the sort of work that the Deputies have spoken about.  Paragraph (g) says:</P>
      <P>The Central Board may, as regards any fishery carry out such research or experimental work as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions.</P>
      <P>It cannot be wider than that.  They have complete authority to engage in the type of work of which Deputies have spoken. If we pin them down by setting up an additional committee we would be muddying the waters in terms of administration. We are setting up a central board having under them seven regional boards.  Let us appoint the best people at every level and let them get on with the job.  It is not necessary to put this into the legislation and I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 17 and 18, to insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv) encourage, promote and develop angling for salmon, trout, coarse fish and sea fish, and for the purposes of any or all of these kinds of angling provide such facilities and amenities as the Central Board thinks fit,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> My reason for this amendment is that the functions of development, promotion and research are presently being carried out within the Inland Fisheries Trust by a small co-ordinated team of highlyspecialised people working on a country at large basis.  This concentrated effort will lose its effectiveness and economy if broken up into regional effort.  The work is being carried out in 17 counties.  As stated by the Minister, we can see that the primary function of the regional board should be the protection and regulation of fisheries and the issue of commercial licences and the central board's functions should be to co-ordinate and direct regions and to carry out development, research and promotion on a national scale.  As the Bill stands, that will not be the position.  To allocate the development and promotional functions to the regional boards will cause overlapping and duplication of effort and it will also mean dilution of staff in respect of that main effort.  Administration costs alone will be unnecessarily high and wasteful of limited resources which should be concentrated as much as possible on staff engaged in development protection.  It would regionalise a function which could be fulfilled on a national basis both effectively and economically.  I hope the Minister will see the reason behind my amendment and will find it possible to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>More consideration should be given to the definition of what is meant here.  At present subsection 3 (a) of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>Species of fish as are specified in the authorisaion.</P>
      <P>Nowhere in the Bill is there a definition of this authorisation.  The type of fish should be defined here.  At the beginning of this debate we were talking about the 12-mile back zone plus the rivers and lakes, along with the problems encountered in regard to pollution, hatcheries, research and so on.  It is important to define here what exactly the Bill covers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> Is the Minister satisfied with it as it stands?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what Deputies are seeking to do, but from my experience with inland fisheries problems I realise that the regional aspect is very important.  The problems and the answers vary enormously in different regions.  To have an over-centralised approach would be a mistake.  The purpose of this section is to put the primary responsibility on a regional basis.  I go along with Deputy Treacy and Deputy White that there must be a central coordinating board.  However, I would like to place the responsibility for initiative and for proposals at local level.  The amendment seeks to transfer from the regional boards to the central board a function in regard to development, promotion, direction and so on of fisheries, and I do not agree with that. The central board will now be there with the sort of expertise which the Inland Fisheries Trust have and Deputy Treacy is seeking to incorporate in the amendment that they, in effect, should have the primary function.  I feel that it should be the other way round.  The regional boards should have the primary function because they know the regional facts and the necessities of each area and the central board or authority should handle it from there.  I know that there is another point of view which suggests that we could have a flying squad system throughout the country.  Looking at the situation in Ireland, there is no question that the various regions and catchment areas of rivers all have different complaints, problems, solutions and answers. You cannot equate the Suir with the Shannon or the Finn with the Maigue or the Feale.  It is much better in this area to pin responsibility down on a region and let us have an overall central board coordinating it so that regions do not get out of hand and go crazy in regard to administration.  I would like to see the balance titled towards the regions rather than towards a central board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will doubtless be aware that there is abroad a very <Col N="1375" /> strong feeling that things should be more centralised.  I know it is not possible now. I agree also that it was the very definite desire of the Inland Fisheries Commission when they reported that there should be one unified board rather than the regions which we are now establishing in this section.  Quite obviously there were reasons for that.  It would ensure a united mobile staff, automatic co-ordination and effort in planning, execution and development of the protection work involved, and all would be done under the aegis of a central board.  I feel that my amendment will do much to allay their anxiety.  The Bill as it stands may create the possibility of non-cooperation to a large extent, or friction or even conflict between one regional board and another and indeed with the central board.  This danger can well be compounded by the wording of section 7 where it limits the powers of the central board to direct the activities of regional boards, and I quote:</P>
      <P>where it considers it necessary so to do....</P>
      <P>In practice that could mean that there would be no clear line of authority from the central board to the regions and that the control might be occasionally spasmodic or continuous and depending on the views taken from time to time.  I have tabled this amendment to avoid the situation where there-would be lack of co-operation and hindrance to staff mobility, to the overall achievement of a united protection and development team and to the adoption of a comprehensive and balanced plan of operation.  It is not possible now to have this unified force to which I have referred, but the amendment which I have tabled would do much to create the kind of liaison, goodwill and co-operation so necessary in order to make this Bill work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Having in mind different people of different interests, there are two lines of thought here.  One is of a central board with full powers and the regional boards under that central board as envisaged here in the Bill.  I am not against what is in the Bill.  Indeed, I <Col N="1376" /> favour it as long as the Minister can give the House some kind of guarantee, as I am sure he will, that there will be full co-operation between the central board and the regional boards.</P>
      <P>As far as the regional boards are concerned, it would be a great pity if the local people had not some say in the fishing in their area and it is only right that the local people, as envisaged in this Bill, would be elected properly and that the right people with the right knowledge would be on the regional boards and their chairman in turn would be sitting on the central board.  All the money should be paid to the central board who should have their headquarters in Galway and who should be responsible for full technical administration, for full research and for administration generally.  With regard to the regional boards, we are talking about protection, seeing that the licences are paid and so on.  The important thing here is to see that we define clearly the different functions of the two boards.</P>
      <P>Regarding the central board, last week a few people asked me if, for example, it would be possible for people in my area in the west to move back to Dublin.  I am sure that people living in Dublin have contacted the Minister to ask if it would be possible to leave Dublin to go back to Galway or elsewhere in the west.  At this time people who want to go back to the west of Ireland should be given the opportunity to go back.  Alternatively, people working in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in the west who want to go back to Dublin should be given the option of doing so.  It is not pleasant to be compelled to go to Galway when other people are prepared to go there.  I am not saying that some of our head researchers should be replaced by people of lesser knowledge, but I think the Minister takes my point and I hope he will give the people who are working in the Inland Fisheries Trust and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry every opportunity to live where they want to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to define the functions of each board.  The central board are the <Col N="1377" /> head board and they are the body who will be handling the money, doing research and looking after the technical side of things.  The regional boards will deal with local problems and local people and will bring their local knowledge up to the central office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a difficult matter for someone seeking to bring in a completely new structure and define functions. I am against over-definition of functions here.  Under section 7 we have given a very full, open mandate to the central board.  The section covers the whole area of development, research and education.  You cannot get more than that and the central board have that function.  The regional boards will work to the central board, each preparing their own development fishery plans related to their own areas.  This is very important.  I can think of no area of development more unsuited to overcentralisation than fisheries because the problems of Lough Sheelin are totally different from the problems of the Shannon estuary and are totally different from the problems of Donegal and the problems of the Slaney. One can go around Ireland and see the variations and the situations.  It would be foolish to over-define.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the point made by Deputy Treacy and I know that there are people who are worried about the aspect of losing the expertise which might be there but that expertise will be available to the central board.  It will be available to them for translation to specific problems in any particular regional board area.  This is the way I envisage the matter working out.  What we have in the Inland Fisheries Trust will be subsumed by the central board and will then be available to each of the regional boards as the problems arise in each particular area.  If one started to define the matter one could add to the confusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed this at great length with all the organisations involved.  I feel very strongly that the best way in which this new system will work is on the administration aspect rather than over-definition in the legal sense.  I believe that <Col N="1378" /> ultimately what will count in how well this works will be the calibre of the management personnel we will appoint at both central board level and at regional level and the calibre also of the people who are elected to the boards and who will be on the central board.</P>
    <P>This will depend largely on administration. Up to this in inland fisheries development there has been a lack of co-ordinated administration to ensure that management, development and conservation of stocks was done in an ordered manner.  Under this Bill we can now do this in an ordered manner. We should not tie down whatever administration we establish by an over-definition, an over-compartmentalisation, of regional boards and the central board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to indicate to me that he is completely satisfied that the central board envisaged in the Bill will be in a position to stimulate and co-ordinate the efforts of the regional boards, that there is not any likelihood of friction, lack of co-operation, of certain regional boards going their own way and doing their own thing.  I am all for centralisation as such but one requires at the top centralised authority which will percolate down to every aspect of the regional boards.</P>
      <P>We need to ensure that there will not be conflict and that there will be co-operation. My amendment is designed to provide that kind of liaison between regional boards.  If the Minister is completely happy that this co-ordinated effort and many others as well that I desire will be there, fair enough.  Many people who have a positive interest in this area are concerned that, in the manner in which regional boards are included in this Bill, they may not feel a duty and a responsibility to the central board in relation to many aspects of activity.  If the Minister is happy that the centralised authority is there I will leave the matter as it is.  I would like him to comment again on possible co-operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to give Deputy Treacy that assurance because I <Col N="1379" /> feel very strongly that this has to be an interlocking arrangement between the central board and the seven regional boards.  We have written that into the Bill by ensuring that seven of the 11 members of the central board will be the chairmen of the regional boards.  Each chairman of each regional board will go on to the central board and then there will be four ministerial appointees.  That will ensure interlocking which I feel is very important.</P>
      <P>I agree with a lot of what Deputy Treacy has said and I can appreciate the worries he has in this matter.  I believe it is much better to do it that way rather than as he suggests in the amendment, &ldquo;as the central board thinks fit&rdquo;.  It is better not to put that in.  It is better to do it the way I mentioned.  As we have the seven regional chairmen out of the 11 members on the board in effect what Deputy Treacy suggests will be done in practice.  It is better to do it that way and preserve the regional aspect as well.</P>

      <P>I hope, provided we get a proper professional management situation into the protection and development of inland fisheries, that they will be able to deal with them.  We will now have for the first time some sort of professionalism in the management of the situation which was never there.  In those old fashioned boards, going back over the years, when people were recruited on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis there was no organisation.  This will improve that situation.  I envisage us having a situation, rather like the county management system, where first-class people are appointed as chief executive officers of each of the boards and the central board also with top-class people appointed independently, building up their own structure of responsibility to do the job properly.  When that is linked in with the <Col N="1380" /> regional boards, represented largely on the central board, with a chairman from each of the regional boards on the central board, I hope that common sense, good administration and professional approach will work out.  I do not see the need to write it all into the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), paragraph (c), to delete all words from and including &ldquo;The Central Board&rdquo; in line 31, down to and including &ldquo;contain&rdquo; in line 54 and substitute: &ldquo;The Central Board shall at intervals of five years prepare and submit to the Minister for his consideration a research and development plan and programmes prepared under this section may contain&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very clear, specific amendment but nevertheless a very important one.  It seeks to ensure that the central board would at intervals of five years rather than at intervals of one year as provided for in the Bill, submit to the Minister for his consideration, a research and development plan.  It must be obvious to anyone in this modern age that to expect a new and important body of this kind to work on an annual basis is unfair and unrealistic and is bound to impede planning and programming.  In embarking on a worth while plan of any kind, a number of years are required for an effective carrying out of that plan.  Therefore, to expect the board to do their work on a long-term basis but to report annually is to stultify them.  Therefore, I trust that the Minister will see the reasonableness of the case I am making.  Most boards work to a plan of five years&mdash;some boards even work to plans of ten years. A one-year programme is neither feasible <Col N="1381" /> nor realistic.  It is not fair to expect this board to execute a meaningful programme on an annual basis since much of their work must depend on progress during the year and also on submissions from the seven regional boards we are establishing.  Approval of the longer term programme, incorporating ministerial policy with the agreement of the central and regional boards, would enable the central board to plan on a long-term basis and would allow them time for discussion and agreement on overall policy between the Minister and the central board.  In addition, it would obviate the need for repeated requests for ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust are used to working on a ten-year plan basis.  More or less the same personnel will be involved largely now in spearheading the programme of this central board, but they will not be helped in their work if they must begin to operate on a one-year planning basis.  For all practical purposes, then, I trust that the Minister will be able to extend the period of time beyond one year and to specify that the board operate on a five-year basis.  Four years would be the minimum period that I would regard as being reasonable and practicable.</P>
    <P>The Inland Fisheries Trust found from their vast experience down through the years that it was impossible to undertake fisheries development on a yearly basis and they negotiated and costed on the basis of a ten-year development plan but working through on an annual programme.  This approach proved successful, as I am sure the same sort of approach would prove successful also for this new board.  On the basis of the ten-year programme, targets were achieved and, in many instances, surpassed.  In these times, when we have such major changes and fluctuations in regard to prices, costings and so on a one-year plan is ridiculous.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cape Clear Ferry Service.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject to which I will address myself is one for which an Adjournment Debate here is ideally <Col N="1384" /> suited.  I got the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to raise the question of the adequacy of the ferryboat service to Cape Clear because no reasonable, levelheaded person who looks at that service at present in relation to the needs of the island community and of the people who visit that island could believe that it is adequate.  This is an inadequacy which reflects on several administrations and not only on this one and I am not making party political points about this.</P>
      <P>The situation on Oileán Cleéire is, if not exactly unique, unique in Munster. The island community there, quite apart from being a Gaeltacht community, has a unique attraction for visitors both from the area and from abroad.  It is also a place where many students go to learn Irish during the summer months.  It is my contention and it is the belief of many people who have to use the service that it has become so outmoded now as to be severely inadequate to meet the demands that are put upon it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I got an answer from the Minister to a written question I put down about the structure and background and history of the ferryboat service.  Even a casual reading of these figures and of the reply given to me by the Minister will show how inadequate this service is.  The boat concerned&mdash;and it is a fine boat so far as it goes&mdash;was acquired for this service in March 1958, over 20 years ago. It is not necessarily true to say that a boat's life span is 20 years or less but for us to pretend that the needs and demands of the situation now are the same as they were 20 years ago is manifestly ridiculous.  It cost just under £10,000 in 1958.  There is no present estimate of its value, but it is clear that the amount that has to be spent on the maintenance of a boat goes up as it grows older.  It is certainly true in relation to the Cape Clear boat.  In 1976 £5,362 was spent on maintenance. In 1978, two years later, that was more than doubled to £12,314.  It is inevitable that any boat of this age which is undergoing the fairly punishing work schedule that it has to today will increasingly cost so much in maintenance <Col N="1385" /> that a point comes at which it is better to replace it and perhaps pension it off to some slightly less strenuous occupation than to go on repairing it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of reasons why the present boat is inadequate for the job that it is being asked to do.  One of them is quite simply that it is not big enough. The Minister informed me that the certificate that the boat carries in relation to its fitness for passengers relates to between 26 and 32 passengers on one certificate and 40 passengers on another certificate.  Nobody who has ever been on that boat in the summer months can accept for a moment that a maximum of 40 passengers is ideal for the kind of traffic that that boat is asked to take.  I have never counted the numbers of people I have seen on the boat from time to time but I suspect that on occasion it is only due to the kind-heartedness of the boat's crew that some members of families and maybe children have not been stranded on the island overnight.</P>
    <P>This service should be able to be carried out in all reasonable weather conditions and in all foreseeable conditions as to demands made by passengers and so on.  What is needed is a boat capable of carrying a maximum&mdash;and I stress a maximum&mdash;of at least twice the number that the present boat certificate is for, something between 80 and 100 people.</P>
    <P>Another reason that the boat is inadequate for the present service is that it is too slow.  It was acquired in 1958 at a time when we were all rather more leisurely.  Its maximum speed is eight knots and the cruising speed is six to eight knots.  This effectively means that it cannot do two full rounds of the journey in each day and this sharply reduces its adequacies as a ferry service.  A bigger boat that went faster would be a much better proposition for the island and for all the people who visit the island.</P>
    <P>The other reason that a bigger and faster boat would be better is because the present ferryboat is vulnerable to extreme weather conditions simply on account of its size.  I asked the Minister <Col N="1386" /> how many journeys had been cancelled in the past year owing to weather conditions and he was not able to supply me with this information.  I do not believe that he was trying to conceal the information; perhaps it was not just possible to get the information together in the available time.  But we have only to look at the weather we had in the last few days and at the weather we had in November 1978 to see that a small boat is infinitely more vulnerable to bad weather conditions in terms of forced cancellation of passengers than a bigger more seaworthy boat would be.</P>
    <P>While part of my argument has been that the ferryboat has been inadequate for the convenience and comfort of the many more casual visitors to the island during the summer, the other problem is that it is a severe imposition on the islanders if they and the people who visit them cannot use the service during the winter months.  It is during the winter months that the weather conditions are most severe and this problem in relation to the size and seaworthiness of the vessel in particular conditions comes into play.  The Minister informed me this afternoon that the service is actually losing money at the moment.  It lost £9,000 in 1976, £17,000 in 1977 and £88,000 in 1978.  At the very least if we had a bigger boat that could accommodate all the passengers who want to go on it it would alleviate the problem.  I do not know if the Minister has ever been to the end of the pier in Baltimore and seen the scrum that ensues on very many occasions during the summer for the few available places on the boat when it is leaving.  It should be possible to have a higher turnover if not a reduction in the losses, because I believe&mdash;and the Minister will accept it&mdash;that this has to be maintained as a social service at least as much as an economic service.  For the same volume of loss a much better service would be provided.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of this that is not widely noted is that the attractiveness of Cape Clear as a resort and as a place to visit and become immersed in Irish culture, music and so on has a direct <Col N="1387" /> economic influence not only on the island itself but on the island's hinterland, and by that I mean everywhere effectively west from Skibbereen which benefits to some degree from the attractiveness of Oileán Cléire.  Therefore, any improvement which is carried out to this ferryboat service will not only benefit the island and the people who visit it but will also benefit a comparatively wide hinterland.</P>
    <P>I suspect the problem of freight, which is also real given the size of the present boat, would be substantially alleviated if a bigger, faster and roomier boat were provided.  There were just under 12,000 passengers carried on the service in 1978.  In 1977, 9,290 passengers were carried and in 1976, 10,302 passengers were carried.  If we compare the 1978 figures with the 1976 figures we will see that there has only been a 20 per cent increase in two years&mdash;that is a 10 per cent per year.  I am prepared to bet that the potential for an increase in the service is very much more substantial than that modest amount.  If the Minister can see his way to doing something about the matter he will be doing not only the islanders a service but he will be doing the cause of the Gaeltacht a service and he will be doing the cause of the economic regeneration of that part of the country a service.  Perhaps in collaboration with Bord Fáilte or the EEC the necessary capital funds may be obtained to re-equip the service.</P>
    <P>I can think of few more clearly identified policy options which present such a reasonable case for the EEC Regional Development Fund.  It is a specific object that will cost a specific amount of money and it will have a virtually immeasurable effect on the quality of life and the wellbeing of the people in one of the areas of the country that certainly needs regional development.</P>
    <P>I think we can count on the Minister's goodwill in this area.  I know money is short; it has never been plentiful in the past five or six years.  I emphasise to the Minister the urgency of doing something sensible and far-reaching about this service as soon as he can.  He will have the <Col N="1388" /> support of Deputies in my party if he manages to do so.</P>

    <P>Enrolment in the Coast Life-Saving Service, which is a voluntary service, is not advertised in the media, but is usually arranged at each station through the local No. 1 man, subject to approval by the district superintendent and my Department.  In the case of the appointments of Nos. 1 and 2 men, however, who are in charge of the company and equipment, the superintendent can arrange for notification of the vacancies to be displayed in the local rocket house, the post office, the local employment exchange and the Garda barracks.

      <P>Because of the very serious decline in our salmon stocks in recent years, I introduced in 1979 additional stringent salmon conservation measures aimed at facilitating the escape of greater numbers of salmon to the spawning beds in freshwater.  These measures are designed to benefit the salmon stocks in all our inland and coastal waters including the River Liffey. In addition, the upper reaches of the Liffey catchment are restocked with eyed salmon ova on a regular basis by the Electricity Supply Board.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the objectives which the Deputy has in mind but I am informed that there are very considerable constraints in relation to this proposal.</P>
      <P>The provision of port facilities required to meet the Deputy's suggestion is primarily a matter for the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The board have informed me that they spent a considerable number of years in bringing about a situation in which a specialised coal terminal to cater for all imports would be accepted by the trade.  Such a terminal now exists and it could not be replaced without an expenditure of from £4 million to £5 million.  The terminal has a capacity in excess of present needs and berth occupancy at the coal quay is very substantially below capacity.</P>
      <P>The board have indicated that they are prepared to discuss with the trade, if they so desire, the enhancement of existing facilities, but the board would be opposed to the refragmentation of coal trade at the port particularly while existing facilities are underutilised.</P>

      <P>The presence of hydrocarbons in the Porcupine Basin was established during drilling in both 1978 and 1979.  These discoveries will encourage further drilling. We can, in my view, be hopeful that the presence of hydrocarbons in commercial quantities will be established as a result, but it is of course impossible to make any predictions in this respect.</P>

      <P>As already intimated to the Deputy in reply to a question from him on 1 November, the discussions which I recently had with Polish Ministers related to the general prospects on coal supplies but no agreement was concluded in regard to supplies. Coal imports from Poland have for many years been arranged in negotiations between the Polish State trading agency and the Irish companies who import coal.  This would be the normal framework through which any additional supplies for the trade would be processed.  It would be premature at this stage to speculate on the possibilities of long-term arrangements for increased supplies from Poland.</P>

      <P>Allowances payable to the widows of military service pensioners are increased annually from 1 July each year in line with the level of increases granted to public service pensioners generally.  An interim increase of 5.5 per cent has been granted to these widows from 1 July 1979 and has been paid.  Further amounts, sufficient to bring the total increase from 1 July 1979 up to 21.8 per cent, will be paid shortly.</P>
      <P>The pensions of widows of Army officers, and other ranks, paid under the contributory widows and orphans schemes are reviewed on 1 July each year to bring them into line with pay increases granted to serving personnel in the proceeding 12 months.  These widows have been granted from July 1979 an increase of the order of 10 per cent with effect from 1978 and this, together with substantial arrears, has been paid.  They are due a further 9 per cent also payable from 1 July 1979 and this will be paid as soon as the necessary Defence Force (Pensions) Scheme has been made.</P>

The file is at present with the inspector with a view to certifying for payment of the grants allocated if the work has been satisfactorily completed. Delay in this case was due to problems associated with the payment of <Col N="1342" /> a previous reconstruction grant for the house and to the question being raised by the applicant as to whether he would seek a disabled person's grant from the county council or else proceed with his applications for grants from my Department.</P>

    <P>* Following negotiation on foot of claim on behalf of local authority and health board craftsmen, a special increase amounting to £10.17 at most points of the scale and a reduction of the scale by one increment was sanctioned in respect of such workers with effect from 1 April 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if it is Government policy to allow a local authority to purchase houses built by the private sector for allocation by the local authority to people on the housing waiting list, and if so, if the finance required is obtained from the capital housing construction budget of the local authority or from its housing maintenance budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic aim of the Government's housing policy is to ensure that, as far as the resources of the economy permit, every family can obtain a dwelling of good standard located in an acceptable environment at a price or rent they can afford.  A secondary aim is to encourage owner occupation.  The national programme is geared at present to produce between 23,000 and 27,000 new dwellings a year.</P>
      <P>The private housing sector is encouraged by various subventions from public funds to provide as many as possible of the required dwellings.  The local authority housing programme is geared to meet the housing needs of persons and families who are not in a position to build, purchase or rent suitable private accommodation for themselves.</P>
      <P>Housing construction by local authorities is intended to be additional to the maximum output which can be encouraged from the private sector.  It is planned, designed and built to specific standards to meet the ascertained needs of applicants on approved waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Dwellings are built in locations and to plans chosen to meet these needs appropriately.</P>
      <P>The programme provides an important source of well spread and steady employment additional to the work force engaged in the private housing sector.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are, therefore, required to construct their new dwellings themselves, or to have them designed and built to the approved standards, normally on the basis of open competitive tendering.</P>
      <P>Occasionally, and in exceptional circumstances, authorities may propose the acquisition of individual existing private dwellings to meet some special requirement. Such proposals are considered by me on their merits.</P>
      <P>All dwellings provided by local authorities for allocation to approved applicants on their waiting lists are financed from the local authority housing capital allocations which are made annually to each housing authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald) Eugene (Gene) Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the setting up of the Joint Labour Committee for agricultural workers on 26 August 1976, the Labour Court have made five employment regulation orders governing the wages and other conditions of employment of agricultural workers, based on proposals received from the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dates for variations of pay and conditions of agricultural workers, as <Col N="1346" /> determined by these orders, are independent of national agreements or the national understanding.  The dates of implementing of wage increases under national agreements or the national understanding vary considerably as between different categories of workers.  In the circumstances it is not possible to make a direct comparison between the operative dates of pay increases being granted to agricultural workers and the dates of implementation of pay increases applicable to the generality of other workers.  It might be noted, however, that the employment regulation order made on 1 November 1979, and effective from 5 November 1979, provides for the implementation of the second phase of the national understanding six months after the date of implementation of the first phase; the national understanding provides for the payment of the second phase after a nine months' interval.</P>
    <P>Details of the operative dates, the statutory rates of pay and the hours of work provided for under those orders are as follows:</P>

      <P>I am aware of the local concern about the delay in the acceptance of a tender for the erection of a new vocational school at Donegal town.  It is, however, a matter for the County Donegal Vocational Education Committee, in the first instance, to select a suitable tender for the project.  There is a difficulty in this regard in that two firms whose tenders <Col N="1355" /> were acceptable have withdrawn them and the vocational education committee are now in the position of having to consider the other tenders.  I have had a discussion with a deputation from the VEC on the matter and I hope it will be possible soon to approve of the commencement of the work under an acceptable tender.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy on national resources has been set out and related to the broader context of economic and social development in the various plans published by the Government since coming to office.  The publication to which the Deputy refers constitutes, I believe, a valuable contribution to thinking on the use of our resources and is being examined in my Department as part of the continuous process of reassessing policy in the area.  Any changes in policy that may be found desirable will be provided for in future planning documents.</P>
