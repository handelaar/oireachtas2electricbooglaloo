      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is proposed to produce a White Paper on the Arts in Ireland, and the role of the State in relation to the Arts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I have been in correspondence with An Chomhairle Ealaíon concerning a five-year plan for the Arts.  The council are drawing up a draft plan which, it is hoped, will form a basis for discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the discussion, to which the Taoiseach refers, be a discussion in this House or a discussion between his Department and the Arts Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A discussion, as requested by the Arts Council, would be between myself and other Minister specifically designated.  It might be useful if they attended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think that a discussion involving other Members of this House might be of benefit in assisting the deliberations of the Arts Council and the Taoiseach in the five-year programme?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>One could look at it both ways.  It might be of benefit and it might be a disservice.  I cannot say, but it is a matter for the Government in the end to make up their minds about policy of this nature.  Obviously it would be a subject for discussion in the House afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if a copy of the memorandum on the question of nuclear power to be submitted by the French Government to the EEC Energy Ministers following approval of the EEC Heads of Government and State on 21 June will be placed in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the reason the referendum publications on adoption were supplied to Fine Gael on the evening before the referendum and the total cost of all publicity material commissioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a supplementary delivery of 80,000 leaflets at the request of Fine Gael.  The first delivery of 100,000 leaflets was effected on Friday, 29 June and a further 47,000 had also been supplied.  The total cost of all the leaflets and of the relevant press, radio and television publicity commissioned by the Government Information Services was £90,000 approximately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Taoiseach not agree that the cause of the delay was that the first consignment of the leaflets in question were not ordered until 26 June?  Is the Taoiseach also aware that those of us who were able to get the <Col N="1773" /> leaflets on Thursday, 28 June had to collect them in the basement of Government Buildings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They were ordered earlier than 28 June.  They were ordered on 26 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> I said Tuesday, 26 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite right in saying that.  The three political parties were informed on Thursday, 28 June that they were available for collection from the Government Information Services.  That was at 11.30 that morning. The Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party collected theirs but the Fine Gael Party asked that they be delivered to their respective headquarters and to points of collection around the country.  Some Fine Gael Deputies, including Deputy Fitzpatrick and five or six others, took delivery of the leaflets themselves.  As well as that, members of the Government took consignments of the leaflets and delivered them at collection points in different parts of the country for use by Fine Gael.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Would the Taoiseach not agree that it was very bad management, to say the least of it, not to order those leaflets until 26 June for a referendum which was due to be held on 5 July?  Am I not right in saying that in the first instance the leaflets were delivered to Fianna Fáil headquarters and the Fine Gael Party were invited to collect them there?  Is the Taoiseach not aware that when we questioned the reasonableness of that we were told we could collect them at the Taoiseach's Department when many of our Deputies had gone home?  The Taoiseach was then asked to have them delivered.</P>

      <P>This is a statement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is it not a fact that the <Col N="1774" /> Taoiseach then offered to have them delivered on Friday to the various constituency headquarters so that they could be distributed on the Sunday morning but that that was not done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only places to which the leaflets were distributed were the Fine Gael headquarters in Mount Street, the Fine Gael offices in Leinster House and to a number of points for collection by Fine Gael Deputies in different parts of the country.  In every other case, in the case of Labour and Fianna Fáil, the leaflets were collected where they were said to be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe a million leaflets were published.  Has the Taoiseach any idea how many of those were distributed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not details of that.  I believe the bulk of them were collected by Fianna Fáil.  The Labour Party took about 47,000&mdash;I am not quite accurate about this&mdash;and Fine Gael had 100,000 delivered and a further 40,000 were either delivered or collected by Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> In view of the Taoiseach's allegation of Fianna Fáil collecting their leaflets, is he aware&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Taoiseach aware that in Cavan town Fianna Fáil had only a few leaflets and would not have been able to hand out any if they had not got them from Fine Gael?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that when we asked if they could be delivered no contrary suggestion was made?  We were awaiting and expecting a delivery and when we checked after discussion in <Col N="1775" /> this House we found the leaflets for Fine Gael were not available until 4.45 p.m.  It was only after that the question arose of trying to retrieve the error made in failing to deliver them to us, to let us know they were to be collected or to have them available for us before 4.45 p.m. because Fianna Fáil had collected all that were available&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <P>We cannot have a debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Statements have been made that are completely at variance with the facts.  In any case it is rather silly to pursue this nit-picking operation. The fact was that all three political parties were telephoned at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday, 28 June.  Those contacted in the political parties were the Fine Gael Chief Whip, the General Secretary of Fine Gael, Deputy Barry Desmond of the Labour Party, and the General Secretary of Fianna Fáil.  All except Fine Gael agreed to collect the leaflets as suggested to them.  Only Fine Gael objected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is not entitled to mislead the House and the country on what happened in this case. We asked that they be delivered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael refused to collect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We waited for them to be delivered because we understood they were being delivered.  It was only when we inquired why they had not been delivered that we were told they were not there and would not be there until 4.45 p.m.  Those are the facts and the Taoiseach should not mislead the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask why the Government waited until 26 June to order leaflets for the referenda on 5 July?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Other arrangements were made for publicity through radio, television and press.  It was felt that a concentrated campaign over the weekend before the referenda would be the most effective way of alerting the public, particularly having regard to the very recent local and European elections. In so far as there might have been criticism of the numbers who voted, I think the main reason was that most people regarded the outcome as a foregone conclusion in the referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say if the decision to delay printing of the leaflets until 26 June was a decision taken unilaterally by the Government or did they consult the two Opposition parties who supported the referenda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if any of the leaflets on the university and adoption referenda were distributed by the Government Information Services other than to the political parties; the number of leaflets so distributed; and the method of distribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaflets on the Seanad representation referendum were distributed to the political parties only. No requests for the leaflets were received from any other organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some 250,000 leaflets about the adoption referendum were given to the adoption <Col N="1777" /> societies.  Of those 200,000 for the Adoptive Parents' Association were collected from the Government Information Services by a representative of that association. The remaining 50,000 leaflets were sent by train to the Cork Adoptive Parents' Association.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not agree that the result of the referenda in terms of turn-out might have been more satisfactory if somebody, presumably from the Government Information Services, had not broadcast an appeal on the evening of polling day urging people to go out the following day to vote?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There were advertisements the whole week before that.  The <Col N="1778" /> Deputy did not mention that.  I might add that Fianna Fáil were the only party who spent money themselves on advertisements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if a total figure for emigration is available for the years 1977 and 1978 in the light of a recent Central Bank report indicating emigration of 11,000 in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration compiled for intercensal periods by relating successive population figures to data for births and deaths in the same period.  When the results of the 1979 Census of Population become available it will be possible to derive the <Col N="1779" /> net migration figures for the intercensal period 1971 to 1979.</P>
      <P>Figures for net passenger movement by sea and air in the 12-month periods ending in February are used by the Central Statistics Office to provide a crude indicator of the annual trend in net migration.  These data have, in the past, shown the correct direction of the net migration flows in intercensal periods and have provided an indication of its general order of magnitude.  The net outward passenger movement by sea and air for the 12-month period ending in February 1978 was 11,000.  Presumably this is the figure referred to in the annual report of the Central Bank for 1978.</P>
      <P>Figures for the net passenger movement by sea and air, excluding Cork Airport, for the 12-month period ending February 1979 show a net inward passenger movement of 10,400.  Figures for the year ended February 1978, again excluding Cork Airport, show a net outward passenger movement of 10,300.  As a crude indicator of the annual trend in net migration, these figures indicate a change from a net emigration in the order of 11,000 in the year ended February 1978 to a net immigration in the order of 11,000 in the year ended February 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state why the month of February was chosen rather than, say, the month of January? Is it because the month of February is more suitable for his purposes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>February was chosen as the normal month for such comparison. One of the reasons is fairly obvious, namely, that the Christmas period is clearly over by then.  Looking at the figures for a number of years it would appear that February is a fairly suitable period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that distortions sometimes occur?  For example, an event like a football match can have a significant effect on the net figures.  Would something like this possibly account for the apparent net inflow in a period when even the Government would hardly claim that their efforts <Col N="1780" /> have been so successful as to lead to large-scale net immigration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that from time to time events may affect the monthly situation but the figures have shown a consistent trend on the February basis. In this particular event the net inward movement has been of the order of 11,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the figures will change on a month-to-month basis but during the years February has been regarded as a reasonably accurate indicator of change.  The only full and accurate way of dealing with this is to have a census taken but we know that there was not a census within the time concerned. However, we have had a census since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <Col N="1781" /> The total number of salmon caught during the 1978 season was 360,389.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we are approaching the end of the salmon season surely the Minister has some indication of how well or how badly the industry has been faring this year compared with last year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The main indication I have is that there is a larger escapement of fish up to the spawning grounds by reason of the measures we have adopted to control salmon fishing.  I shall have more definitive figures on that very shortly.  In view of the Deputy's interest I shall appraise him of the full picture as soon as all the facts and figures are available and that should be within the next month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the question I am statutorily precluded from altering the length of the fishing season that has been settled for this year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if I could change them, I would not change them because I am acting on the advice given to me by Deputy Deasy, among others, to ensure that there would be proper regulations in respect of salmon fishing this year in order to allow for a greater escapement of salmon to spawning grounds upstream. This policy has been successful this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement regarding myself is untrue.  All I have advocated <Col N="1782" /> is that illegal salmon fishing be stopped.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that for many weeks past there has been wholesale poaching of salmon in the form of drift-netting at sea along the west coast?  To my knoweldge there have not been apprehensions or prosecutions in respect of these offences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be interested to hear that more than £100,000 worth of illegal nets has been confiscated mainly on the south-west, the-west and the north-west coast, and that a substantial number of prosecutions are pending. Two naval vessels have been engaged whole-time on this operation, dealing primarily with illegal fishing and in addition the full co-operation of the Garda has been forthcoming with the officers of the boards of conservators.  Never before in the history of the State has there been such an all-out drive conducted against illegal salmon fishing.  The Deputy is well aware of that.  He knows that I am making up for the defects in policy and in attitude during the four years of Coalition Government in this respect in particular.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1784" /> Particulars of passenger licences issued under the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1932, for the year 1979 and of the conditions attaching thereto are contained in two statements which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Within the past two years, 11 applications by private operators for new passenger licences under the Road Transport Act, 1932, have been refused on the grounds that existing services by CIE or by licensed private operators were adequate. There have been no refusals of applications for renewal of existing passenger licences.</P>
    <P>The duty of administering the provisions of the Road Transport Act, 1932 has been entrusted by the Oireachtas to the Minister for Tourism and Transport and the Minister must exercise this function in a just and equitable manner.  I do not consider that there would be any justification for providing for an appeal to an independent arbitrator as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <P>4.  This licence does not confer on the licensee any right to use any private road or other private property without the permission of the owner thereof, or to use any road, street, strand, or shopping place, in contravention of any requirement, restriction, or prohibition imposed by the Minister for the Environment, or the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, or any other authority duly empowered to make such requirement, restriction, or prohibition.</P>
    <P>5.  While this licence is in force the terminal points or one of them, or the route or any part of the route, of the service in respect of which the licence is granted may be altered by the Minister for Tourism and Transport from time to time by notice to the licensee in writing and this licence shall be read subject to any such alteration;</P>
    <P>Provided that any alteration of the service in respect of either of the terminal points of route, or both, rendered necessary by circumstances of a temporary character not likely to exceed 21 consecutive days in duration, or by an unforeseen occurrence, may be made on the direction of, and within the limits imposed by, the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána or other authority duly empowered, and shall be deemed to have been incorporated in this licence for the period of the necessity.</P>
    <P>6.  The licensee shall, subject to the conditions of this licence, run the vehicles for the complete distance over the route between the terminal points authorised by or under this licence and shall not on any occasion whatsoever run a service short or in excess of the said distance without having first applied for and obtained from the Minister for Tourism and Transport another passenger licence in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 1932, and the Road Transport Regulations, 1932, appropriate to the service over such shorter or longer distance.</P>
    <P>7.  A schedule of the actual fares which are being charged on the service in respect of which this licence is granted shall be displayed conspicuously in every vehicle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport if it is proposed to include the suburban rail line from Balbriggan to Howth junction in the first phase of the electrification of the suburban rail line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Prior to the public announcement in the matter, CIE were officially informed on 31 May last that the Government had approved of the electrification of the Dublin suburban rail services from Howth to Bray.  I understand from CIE that preliminary work on the project has begun.</P>
      <P>The capital provision for CIE in the 1979 Public Capital Programme is £15 million.  In so far as this provision may not be sufficient to cover expenditure in 1979 on the electrification project, additional capital moneys can be made available by way of Exchequer capital advances or by other borrowings by CIE under section 2 of the Transport Act, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards expenditure arising in 1980 and subsequent years, appropriate <Col N="1791" /> provision will be made in the Public Capital Programme for these years.</P>
    <P>There are no proposals for the electrification of the line from Howth Junction to Balbriggan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister regard it as coincidental that the local elections took place on 7 June and that after two years CIE were informed on 31 May of the Government's approval of this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not regard that as coincidental.  This involved a matter which was very costly and which had to be considered very carefully by the Government.  We reached a decision on it finally.  Deputy Quinn alleged here that we would never accept the proposals but he has been proved wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that if it had not been for my lobbying this scheme would still be a proposal and that, effectively, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development would have squashed it?  In view of the fact that the matter was under consideration for two years should not some preliminary provision have been made in this year's Estimate in this regard?  Can the Minister indicate when he intends bringing before the House a supplementary estimate for the capital sums required?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, his lobbying had nothing to do with the decision. Indeed, as I have said, he alleged that we would never decide in favour of this project. After the very careful consideration that was necessary in respect of a matter which involved so much money, we reached a decision to give the go-ahead to the project.  As I have pointed out there is provision in this regard for CIE but if that provision is found to be inadequate, additional capital moneys could be made available by way of Exchequer capital advances or by other borrowings by CIE in accordance with section 2 of the Transport Act, 1974.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Having reluctantly decided to give the go-ahead to CIE, can the Minister assure the House that there will be no shortage of capital funds for this project since the local elections are over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>

      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle to take Questions Nos. 16 to 22, inclusive, and 27 together.</P>
      <P>Following an initial study of the report by the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group, the Government have decided to accept in principle the two basic recommendations in it, that is, to create two State-sponsored bodies to run the telecommunications and postal services and to appoint an interim board at the earliest possible date for the telecommunications service.  The Government have also decided to appoint an interim board for the postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1794" /> Copies of the review group's report were presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on Monday evening, 2 July, before it was published on 3 July.  As the Government decisions on the report were of interest to the country at large, they were released through the media so that they would be given the widest possible publicity.</P>
    <P>Staff unions and associations have been informed of the Government decisions. Discussions will commence as soon as possible with them about practical arrangements affecting them during the period when the interim boards will function.  A green Paper setting out proposals for the legislation and the arrangements which will govern the activities of the new statutory bodies will be published later.  It will be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and will provide a basis for public discussion and for consultation with staff unions and other interested bodies.  When these discussions and consultations have taken place a draft Bill containing legislative proposals will be introduced.</P>
    <P>No agreement has been entered into with any private concern at home or abroad regarding any aspect of the proposals for re-organisation of my Department.  Specific provision was not made in the current year's Estimate for expenditure on implementing re-organisation proposals that might arise when the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group furnished their report.  A Supplementary Estimate will be introduced later in the year should the need for one arise.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that it was last Tuesday, 3 July, before any of us got a copy of the report whereas it was published in the newspapers of the same date?  The Minister said that it was released on Monday, 2 July.  How in the name of God did the Minister expect us to know the details of the proposals on that Monday when there was a post <Col N="1795" /> strike?  Is the Minister aware that a number of reports in the previous week's newspapers gave the bones of the proposals with great accuracy?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Detailed statistics on the matters referred to are not available. It is believed, however, that at present the quantity of active ingredients in the volume of chemical pesticides used is about 1,500 tonnes.  The basic plant nutrients contained in the artificial fertilisers used in food growing in the 1977-78 season amounted to approximately 230,000 tonnes of nitrogen (N), 76,000 tonnes of phosphorus (P) and 170,000 tonnes of potash (K).</P>
      <P>As regards regulations on the use of chemicals in agricultural production I shall, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, circulate with the Official Report a list of the main legislation involved.</P>
      <P>While I have certain control functions relating to such matters as pesticide chemical residues in fruit and vegetables and the use of antibiotics in animal feeding stuffs the question of consumer safety is primarily a matter for the Minister for Health.</P>

    <P>Following is the list referred to: Poisons Act, 1961; Poisons Act, 1961 (Paraquat) Regulations, 1975; European Communities (Pesticide Residues) (Fruit and Vegetables) Regulations, 1979; Animal Remedies Act, 1956; Animal Remedies (Control of Oestrogenic Substances) Regulations, 1962; Animal and Poultry Compound Feeding Stuffs (Control of Antibiotics) Regulations, 1972; Animal Remedies (Control <Col N="1805" /> of Chloramphenicol) Regulations, 1974; European Communities (Feeding Stuffs) (Additives) Regulations, 1974 and 1979.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter that requires a good deal of vigilance.  In the context of our relatively small use of pesticides and substances of that kind the element of danger from it is small.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister began his reply by saying that the figures requested were not easily available.  In view of the increasing promotion of chemicals and all kinds of artificial compounds in food products, would the Minister agree that regulations and detailed monitoring by his Department are essential if public health is to be protected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be almost impossible to work out a simple regulation that would give effective control over the abuse of substances of this kind having regard to the wide diversity of the usage to which various substances are put.  In the case of antibiotic preparations for use in bovine mastitis, there are regulations within the creameries and milk intake points supervising the quantities or traces of these residues in milk because they have a detrimental effect.  This factor is carefully supervised.  The quantities or residual pesticides and injurious substances of that kind in Irish food products is less than it is in any other country within the EEC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 34 together.  The Council of Ministers, at their session of 18 to 22 June, decided on Community agricultural prices for the 1979-80 season and on certain related measures. The general level of Community agricultural prices other than for milk was raised by 1.5 per cent.  The co-responsibility levy on milk, which the Commission had proposed to increase substantially will continue at its present level.  The MCAs of Germany and the Benelux countries are to be reduced by 1 percentage point in the case of Germany and half a percentage point in the case of the Benelux countries, except for the dairy sector.  The UK and French representative rates are being devalued by 5 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. This will reduce the MCAs for the UK and France by 5.7 and 1.6 percentage points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council agreed to continue the derogation which I secured last year whereby intervention for beef in Ireland will not be suspended while our prices are below 85 per cent of the guide price. The Council also noted a formal commitment by the Commission to provide supplies of beef from intervention stocks specially for use in manufacture of canned and cooked products.  This should eliminate the difficulties which our beef canning industry has been experiencing. <Col N="1809" /> With a view to improving the relationship between the export refunds for live cattle and beef, which currently favours live exports, it was agreed at my request that the Commission would examine these urgently.</P>
    <P>The intervention buying-in prices for Irish beef are also being increased by approximately 3 per cent, which with the increase of 1.5 per cent already mentioned would mean an overall increase in the buying-in prices of about 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed to increase the Community contribution on consumption subsidies for better which in Ireland's case will mean an increased FEOGA contribution of about 6½p per pound.  Subject to adjustment for recent cost increases this is being passed on to the consumer.  The Community support for UK butter consumption will of course also help to strengthen the market there for Irish butter.  National aids for processing of butter and milk powders are being suspended.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Council agreed to make decisions on the new common organisation of the market for sheepmeat by 31 October next and on the Commission's current structural proposals (including proposed new measures for the west of Ireland) by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the overall &ldquo;price-package&rdquo; was, in all the circumstances, quite a satisfactory one for Ireland.  The package as a whole can be expected to increase farm income in this country by about £23 million in a full year.  The package contains substantial benefits for both farmers and consumers. It will also help considerably the further development of our beef processing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the price package could hardly be described as satisfactory from the point of view of farmers?  Would he not agree that, while farmers have received an increase in prices of 1½ per cent, the costs they have to incur in the course of production have increased by approximately 10 per cent, or ten times that amount?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1810" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. Gibbons Mr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do say that the price package, as it stands, has been a satisfactory arrangement for Irish farmers in general.  The House must be well aware that there is a serious structural over-supply in the dairy sector especially, and also in the sugar sector. There is a condition of some difficulty too in the beef sector.  In all these circumstances, in my opinion, it would be extreme folly to have increases greater than those obtained.  Indeed, it is worth saying that the increases which have been obtained by this country over the past five years or so&mdash;the actual increases in units of account&mdash;were very, very small.</P>
      <P>The bigger increases that have come to Irish farmers during that period derived to a very large extent from successive devaluations of our green currency which cannot now be devalued since our MCA level is at zero at present. The range available for further improvements in prices, such as we have become accustomed to&mdash;let us acknowledge that&mdash;derived almost totally from devaluations in the green currency, such as the devaluation of 6 per cent that came last year, and 1½ per cent in the intervening period between sometime early this year and the price fixing which has just been obtained.  I cannot go along with Deputy Bruton's assertion that it was an unsatisfactory package.  The most unsatisfactory situation Irish agriculture could possibly contemplate would be the imposition on the common agricultural policy of intolerable strains.  The strains on that policy at present are very difficult to sustain.</P>

      <P>Members of the House were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Pat Kerrigan on Wednesday last.  He led a distinguished public life and was very active in local and national affairs.  While he was a member of this House for a brief number of years only, he was already well known to us as Lord Mayor of Cork and as a member of the Seanad from 1973 to 1977.  He was a dedicated trade unionist and equally dedicated in promoting in public <Col N="1830" /> life the interests of those whom he represented.  I can personally say of him, representing my own constituency as he did, that he was a completely fair and forthright political opponent.  It was most regrettable that ill-health overtook him so soon after his election to Dáil Éireann, but the fortitude with which he bore his grave illness was an inspiration to all those who came in contact with him.</P>

I should like to inquire whether outoffice, yard or garden standing alone will be considered within that definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo;.  It appears to me that it would.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I can understand an improvement grant being given for improvements carried out to the dwelling-house but my difficulty is that &ldquo;house&rdquo; is stated to include &ldquo;any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith&rdquo;.  That subsection goes on to state that: &ldquo;house&rdquo; includes any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling and &ldquo;housing&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly. I could understand the second part of the definition if the first portion was omitted but, as I see it, a derelict outoffice and a bit of a garden with it falls within the definition of a &ldquo;house&rdquo; under the Bill.  Does the Minister agree with that proposition and if so will he tell us why he is anxious to include an outoffice on its own within the definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>

The purpose of the change is to make it possible to give grants for chalets on islands, for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): That is a laudable thing to have in mind and provide for, but in my view, if the definition simply stated that &ldquo;house&rdquo; includes any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling and &ldquo;housing&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly, that would be wide enough to cover the intentions of the Minister.  It baffles me why the Minister is seeking to include in the definition section any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith.  Why does the Minister want to include that?  I could understand it if the Minister turned the definition around to read: &ldquo;a house shall include any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling and any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto and usually enjoyed therewith&rdquo;.  The definition gets a hold of the outoffice, yard or garden first and regards them as a &ldquo;house&rdquo; and goes on to state that any building used or capable of being used as a dwelling shall be described as a &ldquo;house&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is another example of reaching back into a former Act and lifting a definition.  The fact that a definition was used in a previous Act does not mean that it is correct.  It may have been used when, perhaps, there was a less vigilant Opposition than at present.  I deplore the practice of lifting a definition from another Act and plonking it into this Bill. I do not know why the Minister is anxious to regard a farmyard situate a mile from a dwelling-house as a &ldquo;house&rdquo; in this Bill.  That is what he is doing.  Cattle rearing sheds or piggeries situate miles from a farmer's dwelling-house, whether suitable for conversion to dwellinghouses or not, will still be defined as a &ldquo;house&rdquo; within the meaning of the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>A piggery a distance <Col N="1833" /> from the house would not be &ldquo;appurtenant thereto&rdquo;.

The slight amendment in the definition is being made to make it possible to give grants for chalets on some islands.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am not objecting to giving grants for chalets on islands and I am not introducing this as evidence that I intend prolonging the debate on Committee Stage.  The definition of &ldquo;house&rdquo; is broken into two sections.  It includes</P>
      <P>any outoffice, yard, garden or other land appurtenant thereto or usually enjoyed therewith. </P>
      <P>There is not a word in that about a dwelling or about it being suitable for a dwelling or being near a dwelling.  The definition goes on:</P>
      <P>and any building or part of a building used or suitable for use as a dwelling and &ldquo;housing&rdquo; shall be construed accordingly; </P>
      <P>The words that appear after &ldquo;and&rdquo; make sense and would cover anything that one would want to convert into a house or a chalet, but that has nothing to do with the words before &ldquo;and&rdquo;.  The words before &ldquo;and&rdquo; seek to include every outhouse, office, dwelling, yard, piggery or cattle house in the definition of &ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. I know that the Minister will lean heavily on the fact that this definition has been in operation for 13 years and the fact that it appeared in the Housing Act, 1966 and has done no harm.  We should not ask ourselves whether it appeared in the Housing Act of 1966, but whether it makes sense, and when we are putting through a Bill we should not perpetuate nonsense but should try to improve on what was in previous Bills.</P>

If there is a doubt we will have to put down an amendment here to include insulation such as double glazing and the conversion of a central heating system from oil to solid fuel.  That would be far more effective than any nice talk that the Minister will have at a social function.

Having regard to the next 20 years in relation to the general question of cost and supply of energy, surely the Minister in respect of the definition of a house should recognise that energy conservation is included in the phrase &ldquo;improving a dwelling&rdquo;, and he should be free to indicate to the House that improvement includes improving the standards of energy conservation irrespective of what difficulties may arise in the administration of the grants scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

Would the Minister not consider it a good public relations exercise to write in energy conservation into this definition in this year when the conservation of energy is so important?  In all seriousness I suggest that the Minister write those few words in on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): If the Minister is going to do a bit of steamrolling, surely it is every bit as necessary as private water supply. The Minister might equally exclude private water supply and private sewerage.  Surely to goodness they would be regarded as reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering the house more suitable for human habitation.  They are beyond doubt.  Water and sewerage are there and are built into our ordinary way of life.  But, as of now, there might be some doubt as to energy conservation.  I would respectfully urge on the Minister that the spelling out of energy conservation is more necessary than the writing in of water and sewerage which ordinary civilised living demands.  On the other hand, energy conservation is something that could be done without in normal circumstances but is necessary because of the energy conditions obtaining throughout the world at present.  The Minister would not be losing any face. This is probably a definition taken from some Act when oil was for nothing and coal could be had for the taking.  But the whole situation has changed.</P>

Our housing stock is getting older, costs are rising and people are deferring carrying out such work, something I regard as very serious.  If it were included it would act as a protection and leave people feeling happier, because we have seen the tragic consequences of such defective installations.

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I think I am correct in saying that the Bill as a whole will come into operation on its becoming law after signature by the President, or on such other day or days as the Minister may, by ministerial order, bring it into operation. Apparently for some years past the Minister, his predecessors and his Department were operating in anticipation <Col N="1840" /> of this Bill.  As the Bill was originally drafted each section which dealt with grants or benefits conferred over the years was stated to come into operation as from the date on which those grants and so on commenced.</P>
      <P>I accept the amendment.  I agree it is a much clearer and less cumbersome way of validating these grants and so on, these acts done by the Minister and his predecessors, than the system of doing so by nine amendments, as was previousy intended.  It makes it absolutely clear now that the Bill is for future use, as from the date on which it comes into operation and anything included in it is intended for use in the future and not retrospectively.</P>
      <P>The Minister's amendment is a good one and tidies up the Bill considerably.  It puts beyond doubt that the Bill, as now introduced, is the Minister's thinking on housing subsidies and grants in general, that it is intended for future use and, as far as the Minister is concerned, for the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>There are actually ten amendments altogether.  Amendment No. 32 provides that the different provisions of the Bill can be brought into operation on such day or days as may be fixed by order of the Minister.  It is largely consequential on amendment No. 31.  Certain sections can be brought into operation on the passing of the Act. It is intended that other sections which require regulations to be made will be brought into operation as soon as possible thereafter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters I should like to refer to.  The section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent <Col N="1841" /> of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for the Public Service and subject to such regulations as may be made by the Minister for the purposes of this section, authorise designated housing authorities to discharge on his behalf the function of paying grants of one or more, as may be specified in the regulations, of the kinds of grants that the Minister is empowered to pay under the Principal Act or this Act. </P>
    <P>The Minister's Department have been paying the grants in a lot of areas.  It is right that one body should be responsible, but that body should be the local authority.  The most competent body to deal with housing grants and the payment of those grants are the local authority.  With regard to grants for Dublin city, the delay of an inspector from the Department going out to inspect the premises is inordinate.  When one is dealing with a local authority with regard to the purchase of a house an inspector is out within a week to inspect the house.  I believe that local authorities are best able to deal with housing grants. The Minister's Department would be better off if they delegated this role to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I know of a case of a man waiting for five months for an inspector from the Minister's Department to inspect his house for a repairs grant.  This man is operating on a bridging loan because the corporation will not pass his loan until the necessary improvements are carried out.  If this was under the local authority that inspection would be carried out within a week or ten days.  When we are talking about tidying up legislation and making it more effective, we should give responsibility to local authorities.</P>
    <P>We are always talking about devolution and giving more responsibility to other bodies.  This is not happening in relation to this Bill.  The Minister is not giving responsibility to local authorities. If he did it would be in the best interest of the people looking for grants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be possible in the future to have more devolution under this Bill.  On the introduction of the <Col N="1842" /> £1,000 grant payable by my Department and the £600 improvement there was such an upsurge of applications that it would not have been possible for individual local authorities to cope with it initially.  It is better to wait until we see how it works.  It is possible in the future to have more devolution of this under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We should now make the decision to devolve totally to the local authorities.  When the Minister says there was an upsurge in the grants I believe that local authorities are equipped to deal with those.  They are more capable of dealing with any upsurges than some of the Government Departments. This is why I favour devolution.  I would like to see it inserted into this Bill that it is the local authorities who control all this.  If that is not done we are getting back to the situation where we are not sure if the Department of the Environment are doing it or the local authority are doing it.  I urge the Minister to look at this again.</P>
      <P>Our experience of local authorities is that they respond if upsurges occur. With regard to the grants for improvements there is a very long delay at times and this should not happen.  It stops people from getting on with the work because inspectors will not inspect the work.  The Minister should be able to say that it is his intention to do something about this next year if he will not agree to do it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily understand the reluctance of the Minister and the Government generally to cede to local housing authorities the right of making housing grants and determining the level of the grants since they come from the Central Fund.  This section refers only to the administration of housing grants and obviously retains to central government the right to determine the grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am baffled by the Minister's comment that there was an upsurge of response to the £1,000 grant and that local authorities would not have been able to cope.  My experience of this matter is that the people who were unable to cope were the centralised Government Departments.  No centralised administration <Col N="1843" /> could readily cope with this matter. We have also had very bad experience in the last three or four years in relation to direct communication.  There have been breakdowns in communications of one kind or another, whether by industrial go-slows, telecommunications disputes or technical faults.  The Minister must know from the backbenchers in his party how difficult it is to get through to various Government Departments.  I am not being specific here about the Custom House or O'Connell Bridge House.  I am talking about the overload we are putting on central Government because central Government feel they must administer this kind of system.</P>
    <P>Surely we could recognise the principle of devolution by giving to local authorities the right to administer those grants while the Minister retains for himself and for future Ministers sufficient discretion in relation to how that administration is to take place and how the allocation of money is to take place? People who live in parts of the country where they are not on STD have great difficulty in trying to chase up a grant when it is coming from any Government Department.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister's thinking is in relation to the devolution of power to local authorities.  With regard to housing the local authorities have the staff, the experience and the commitment of the local public representatives to do the job properly.  If the local authorities were given power in relation to the matters in this section it would reinforce their role in the local government system.  I would also like the Minister to specify why the Minister for the Public Service is being included in this section and why his permission is being sought.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The theme of this Bill is flexibility.  It is the first time that the principle of devolution has been recognised in this way in any Bill.  In this instance there is provision for more devolution in the future and that may be the best thing to do as time goes on.  As I said, it is better to see what will be the experience.  Admittedly there have been <Col N="1844" /> delays but I would point out the following facts: the number of reconstruction and improvement grants approved in 1976 was 13,000, in 1977 it was 11,000 and in 1978 the applications numbered 38,530.  In order to counteract the delays referred to by Deputy O'Brien, more staff have been recruited and this is where the Department of the Public Service become involved.</P>
      <P>That was a sizeable upsurge, whether at local authority level or in the Department of the Environment.  I have no doubt that problems were created for local authorities.  This is the first time recognition has been given to devolution in those matters and the Bill makes it possible and feasible to do this in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am glad to see this section written into the Bill but I should like more evidence that it will be used by the Minister.  The Minister said that this is the first time that devolution of this nature has ever been recognised in a Bill. He was careful to use that expression.  If he had said anything else he would not have been correct because it was his predecessor who introduced this system of devolution as a pilot system in Meath, and I think in Longford and Westmeath also, as far back as 1973.  That is why subsection (4) deeming it to have come into operation on 14 May 1973 was first written into the Bill.  It is now being removed from it and the retrospective portion is being validated by the Minister's amendment.</P>
      <P>I am told that the pilot system worked very well in Meath.  It is too bad the Minister saw fit to depart from it.  I am not surprised it worked well because it cut out a lot of duplication.  There is a crazy situation obtaining at the moment. When a person applies to a local authority for an SDA loan and then to the Department for a grant his house is inspected on at least two occasions, perhaps three, first by a local engineer in respect of the SDA loan and then by someone from Dublin or some other county for the purpose of the grant application. Thus, there is a duplication of inspection and of expenses and this should be cut out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1845" /> I think the Minister backed a loser when he said that due to the upsurge of applications in respect of the £1,000 grant it was necessary to cut out devolution in order to speed up matters.  Having regard to the conditions necessary to qualify for the £1,000 grant, the Minister could not have thought of a better way of slowing up the scheme than to cut out the devolution initiated by his predecessor. One of the qualifications for the £1,000 grant was that a person had not built a house before and that had to be checked.  Somebody based in the Custom House in Dublin would not be in a position to know whether a person in Belmullet was building a house for the first time.  The best method of checking an application like that would be through the rate collector in Belmullet, a person who knows the locality and who could interview the applicant if necessary. In many cases it would not be necessary because the rate collector would know the local conditions and could clear the application immediately. Therefore, the Minister's argument that the reason for cutting out devolution was to speed up grants is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>Much lip service is given to the principle of decentralisation.  I understand that the Government have made a public statement that they intend to decentralise Government Departments over the next few years and in that way conserve energy by making it unnecessary for buses to travel in their hundreds to Dublin every weekend to take civil servants home.  Here is an excellent way of showing our good faith in regard to decentralisation by continuing the practice started by the Minister's predecessor in entrusting the administration of these grants to local authorities.</P>
    <P>There is an excellent argument to be made for this.  In every county council there is a housing administrative unit and I venture to suggest that in some counties they are not working to full capacity.  These units have been administering supplementary housing grants for a number of years and they administer housing loans all the time. The necessary machinery and skills are available.  Each county has its own housing engineers.  It is absurd and unjustifiable <Col N="1846" /> that this work should be duplicated.  In many counties the staff are not working to full capacity and even where they are it would not be difficult to supplement the staff to bring it up to necessary strength to do more work.</P>
    <P>While that is happening, down the country people are being left without grants for unnecessarily long periods. This section in the Custom House is clogged with work.  They have far too much to do.  The expense of administering housing in general is doubled in many cases by two salaries having to be paid instead of one and by reason of travelling expenses having to be paid from Dublin to Glangevlin, for instance, a distance of about 125 miles instead of having to pay these expenses only in respect of journeys from Cavan to Glangevlin, a distance of about 40 miles. That is the type of absurd situation that exists.  I am glad, therefore, that the Minister is recognising the wisdom of his predecessor in introducing this pilot operation and I hope sincerely that he will give the House an assurance that this move is not merely a cosmetic exercise but that it will be put to work in the immediate future as an earnest of the Government's belief in decentralisation and also for the convenience of house builders and of applicants for grants and for the purpose of speeding up the housing drive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be as brief as possible since I do not think anybody here has any interest in delaying the processing of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the principle of devolution. It is a concept which, as the House knows, this party advocate strongly, but I do not understand the reason for the provision in subsection (1) for the Minister to act with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister of the Public Service.  This is a section dealing with the devolution of the administration of housing grants.  While the Minister has seen fit to assume powers to devolve to local housing authorities certain administrative matters he has tied his own hands by providing that first he must seek the consent of two separate Government Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Public Service <Col N="1847" /> are not the most successful personnel section in the country at the moment and, frankly, I shudder to think that a scheme for the devolution of administration&mdash;and we are talking here only about administration&mdash;could be held up by a delay in obtaining the consent of the Minister for the Public Service. I fail to see the relevance or the need for this clause.  I fear that for reasons unrelated totally to the provisions of this Bill or to the objectives that a Minister may consider desirable in terms of housing grants, the Department of the Public Service could issue some kind of bar, withholding consent and invoking some section of the 1979 Act to uphold their position.  What is involved here is a dangerous ceding of power to central government in the name of devolution in respect of local housing administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Any devolution or any extension of devolution must involve necessarily extra staff in the public service, whether at urban or county council level and that situation, obviously, must involve the Minister for the Public Service. It should be remembered, too, that because of the derating of domestic dwellings, 60 per cent or even a little more comes from the Exchequer. However, the point is that devolution involves additional staff in the public service. It is possible that, as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggests, there are in some areas people who are under-worked but in the event of additional staff being required the Minister for the Public Service would have to be consulted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick exaggerated a good deal the question of duplication.  It is not often that there is a situation in which separate inspections are carried out by an inspector from my Department in respect of an SDA loan and the £1,000 grant.  When one considers that of the 19,300 houses built in the private sector last year only 3,379 carried SDA loans, it will be realised that the element of duplication was not very marked.  In addition, only a small percentage of reconstructions attract grants at local level under the SDA scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of decentralisation was <Col N="1848" /> mentioned also.  This is a concept with which there seems to be general agreement. The only question is that of timing. I am in favour of decentralisation, too, and as proof of my intent in this respect, part of my Department is in the process of decentralisation, the first time that any part of this Department has been decentralised.</P>

      <P>There is much talk of devolution and of the cost involved in this process but up to a short time ago these grants were administered by local authorities.  In other words, the machinery for this work is in existence but the mistake was in bringing this work back to the Department.  The time to have made the decision was when the decision was being made to give the responsibility to one body or another. That was when the responsibility should have gone to the local authorities.  If the people in the Department, instead of trying to grab all the power for themselves, had realised the work that local authorities were doing in the area of housing, the situation might have been otherwise.  We are not talking of something new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If people wish to develop their houses they should be able to deal with their housing authority, who are the local authority.  Even at this stage the Minister is dragging his feet on this matter. Would he be prepared to reconsider the situation especially now that the Department of the Public Service seem to <Col N="1849" /> dominate everything and to be watching prudently every penny that is spent, whereas if they were really prudent they would refer the matter back to the local authorities?  I am sure that some local authorities have slack that could be taken up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about the eradication of duplication.  The only way to eradicate duplication is to give the powers to local authorities.  The Minister and the Department will still decide the conditions of grants and the amounts paid.

      <P>Consultation would take place only on the principle, not on individual cases.  Deputy O'Brien referred to devolution in Dublin and Cork cities. This would lead to duplication all along the line.  Dublin Corporation prepared grant applications only.  They were approved by my Department and there was an inspection at corporation level and an inspection at Departmental level, so there was duplication under that scheme.  With regard to the devolution that took place in Longford, Westmeath and Meath, there was not the same kind of duplication because the local authorities were responsible for all aspects of the matter.  No one is disputing the principle of devolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I referred to the abuses of duplicating work by having inspections by two engineers, one for loans and one for grants.  In reply, the Minister stated that only 3,779 persons availed of SDA loans in 1978.  I thought that that was a sizeable number.  I also thought that the Minister thought it was a sizeable number because the last time I heard him talking about it he was boasting how useful the SDA loan was and how many people were still using it.  I agree that the number is not as high as it should be.  The reason for this is that the price of a house has doubled from about £11,000 on 1 January 1977 to about £22,000 at the present time.  Surely the Minister is not basing his argument against duplication on his intention to operate the small dwellings loans with the same ceilings for incomes and loans as at present.</P>
      <P>Before we dispose of this Bill I am very hopeful that we will have an announcement from the Minister that he intends to double the grants and income ceilings because it will take that to restore any sort of a relationship between the loans and the cost of building a house.  In that realistic state of affairs, the number of 3,779 will be doubled and the Minister will have the duplication that I am talking about. Even if there are only 3,779 applications, each of those houses will be inspected by a county council engineer for the purpose of the loan and by an environmental engineer, residing either in Dublin or in some other county, for the purpose of the grant.  That situation cannot be justified.  I join with the other Deputies in saying that if our discussion on this section persuades the Minister to work the system introduced by Deputy Tully our time will not have been wasted.  If the public knew about this wilful waste the Minister would have no option but to operate without delay the section which he is now writing into the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three sections to this now, assuming that section 4 has been cleared in the general amendment that we took first of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am worried about the interpretation of subsection (2).  This applies to a body which represents or promotes the formation of co-operative groups of voluntary associations which have as an object the provision of houses.  My concern is that we seem to lack a sufficiently adequate definition of what a voluntary housing association or group might constitute.  I am not raising this as a contentious matter but for the purposes of clarification.  I would like everyone to be clear how groups which may be formed as a result of this might interpret it.  I would hope that the Minister would make it quite clear that the body, which is the first and <Col N="1853" /> indeed the only one that I am aware of that has received a grant from the Government, would be given, among other things, the task of preliminary vetting or giving the stamp of approval to voluntary housing associations.  I am referring to NABCo.  We need some clarification in this area because my experience of voluntary housing associations is that they get quite chaotic and that the failure of one housing association is the albatross around the neck of half a dozen subsequent associations which try to get off the ground.  So perhaps the Minister might clarify that.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to make is in relation to the grant that was actually paid by the Government.  It is really a very small amount of money.  I am wondering what sort of performance the Government and the Minister for the Environment expect to get for a grant of £6,000 to NABCo.  I know it is the first time that this grant has been given and it has been a regretfully long time in coming but really, in this day and age, to talk of a housing target of 25,000 houses per year and then to give a grant to the voluntary housing section of £6,000, which is about one third of the cost of an average house, is a bit unrealistic.  I wonder if the whole thing is not in the nature of a token grant to an association for which I have a lot of respect and considerable knowledge and experience of over many years.</P>
    <P>What commitment is there next year to the continuation of this grant?  What kind of guarantees do NABCo have if they start a programme that they will be able to sustain it over a number of years?  The Minister is tied to a year-to-year budgetary system but in the context of the money we are talking about he should be quite capable of clearly indicating to NABCo, or indeed any other associations who might subsequently qualify for a grant, that they will be guaranteed funds of a minimum of so much over a certain period of time so that that organisation can make progress.  The Minister, in his speech at the opening of the Liberties co-operative recently, went a long way towards accepting and agreeing with the support <Col N="1854" /> for the third arm of the housing movement, the voluntary housing movement. That was a positive advance and I welcome his speech at that opening because, for the first time, it gave official recognition to the positive contribution that can be made by the voluntary housing movement.</P>
    <P>I am just wondering now if the Minister really thinks that £6,000 is enough and if he has any plans for increasing it.  Have there been guarantees given to NABCo to ensure them some sort of continuity in January 1980?</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): Deputy Quinn has dealt with some of the matters I wanted to deal with and I will be glad if the Minister will tell us how many of these housing co-operatives there are in the country.  What is the extent of the work they are doing?  What type of grant has been paid to them to date?  How many grants have been paid?  It seems that the system of paying grants goes back to the beginning of this year.  I would be grateful if the Minister would give us as much information as he has about these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this, too.  It is a step in the right direction because NABCo have, over the years, tried to get some sort of grant from the Department. While £6,000 is small it is a start and it is welcome, but it obviously can be improved upon.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he will look into it to see what further improvements can be made.</P>
      <P>These voluntary housing groups, particularly NABCo, have been fighting an uphill battle.  They are the cinderella of the housing area.  They are without any real guidance.  As well as giving grants the Department should be able to give expert advice because they require this type of help.</P>
      <P>I would like to see the Minister encouraging other voluntary housing bodies to set up in other areas.  He should set up a committee or committees to see what can be done in this area because I believe that there is a lot of valuable expertise about; there are many people who want to help in the housing area but there is no guiding force.  If the Department of the Environment were to set up a pilot unit to see what could be done to organise various housing aid societies it would be a big step forward.</P>
      <P>In relation to old houses we should allow voluntary housing co-operatives to renovate them and let them to married couples who are in need of housing.  That is an area which is worthy of consideration. There are a number of people who would give their time but they need a sense of direction.  The Department could give this and could give expertise. We must be aware of our existing housing stock and of what we can do to preserve it.  Sizeable grants would need to be made to enable people to buy and restore derelict property.  The principle has been set for grants for voluntary housing organisations.  Once a precedent is established it is easy to get things moving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not be narrow in our approach and leave it all to NABCo but should tap the expertise available. There are a number of professional <Col N="1856" /> people who are willing to come into these housing aid societies to work, develop and improve the lot of people.  I commend the section.  It is a good one.  I would ask the Minister to initiate within his Department a more positive approach in the whole area of voluntary housing help.  If he does that it will be a worthwhile exercise particularly in large urban areas where there is a serious housing problem and a lot of property which is run down.  The Minister could exercise powers to take over such property and make it habitable, thus providing valuable housing for people in need and improving valuable housing stock.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), paragraph (c), line 43, after &ldquo;with,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that a moiety of the grant shall be paid when the house has been roofed subject to the condition that the house shall be completed in accordance with any condition subject to which the certificate of reasonable value was granted,&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>As the Bill is drafted and under current practice the £1,000 grant is not paid to an applicant until the house is completed and until he has taken possession of the house and is residing there.  When this grant was first mooted, prior to the 1977 General Election, it was promised as a grant that would facilitate house builders in providing the necessary deposit for a loan.  It was stated at the time of the manifesto and of the campaign that it would virtually provide the deposit for the house.  Like many other things that were said at the time of the manifesto, it may not have been written in black or white into the manifesto but it was certainly spoken about as the deposit money.  That was the promise that was made and the understanding on which this part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto was sold from door to door by the party canvassers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully appreciate that £1,000 would not now pay a deposit, because the gap <Col N="1857" /> between available loan finance and the cost of a house has doubled if not trebled.  The amount the house builder now has to find is much more than £1,000.  It may very well go to £7,000 if he has to rely on the SDA loan.  If he is lucky enough to get a building society loan he still has to provide a few thousand pounds.  While the £1,000 would not provide the deposit it is more necessary than ever because, if the person does secure a loan, he has to do something in the nature of a door to door collection to find the balance necessary to build the house.</P>
    <P>It is unreasonable that this grant, or subsidy as it is now called, should not be paid to the house purchaser until the sale of the house is completed or until the house is built.  In the old days grants were not as high as £1,000 but they were every bit as valuable as the £1,000 grant is now.  Half of the grant was paid when the roof was put on the house and the other half was paid when the house was completed and occupied.  That is what I want the Minister to do.  He will still have control over the applicant to ensure that he builds the house in accordance with the conditions attached to the certificate of reasonable value and to ensure that he takes up possession of the house as his residence.  If the applicant does not do both of those things he will not qualify for the remainder of the grant.  It is unlikely that a person would go through the performance of applying for a grant, build a house to the roof, collect £500 and then decide that he would not complete the house or reside in it.  That is the argument I make in favour of this amendment.</P>
    <P>It is a reasonable amendment.  I hasten to add that putting the amendment in where it is may not be acceptable to the Parliamentary Draftsmen, but the drafting of it shows clearly what we have in mind.  If the Minister accepts the amendment in principle he can instruct the Parliamentary Draftsman to amend section 4 so as to meet the thinking behind the amendment.  It was never more necessary that house builders and house purchasers should have access to whatever finance is available to them for <Col N="1858" /> housing purposes and to have it at the earliest possible moment.  It would enable them to get bridging finance and to pay something towards the deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole purpose of any grant is to aid people.  This grant of £1,000 was announced and heralded as something magnificent and fantastic.  It was to solve the financial problems of all newly-married couples who were buying their house for the first time.  Time has disillusioned many people about that.  If a grant is to mean anything, it should mean aid while the house is being built. People have to make deposits and pay as they go along.  It is easier to hold up a bank now than to get a loan from a bank.  Serious consideration should be given to giving a moiety at the roofing stage, and it should be half the grant, £500.</P>
      <P>The size of this grant must now be questioned.  When does the Minister propose to double it, given the fact that house prices have gone up by 50 per cent?  The Minister must consider increasing the grant to £1,500 and giving it as the houses are being built.  The irony is that the grant is not paid until the person is living in the house, not when the house is completed and the legal documents are signed.  A loose curtain hanging on the window will not do. The house is inspected to ensure that it is furnished.</P>
      <P>I know people who could not go into the house because they had not got the price of the furniture.  They could not get the grant because they were not living in the house.  It is a Catch 22 situation. This baffles me.  Grants should aid people and not obstruct them.  The Minister should consider this amendment very seriously because cash is so tight.  People have to borrow to move into their houses at very high interest rates.  We now read in the papers that they will not be able to borrow.  The gloss has gone off the £1,000 grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If we are serious about helping people to provide their own homes, we must provide them with <Col N="1859" /> the correct financial aid when they need it rather than having them running to the banks for an extra £1,000 at colossal interest rates which they cannot afford. They are up to their necks in debt and, obviously, this can cause serious problems for young married couples. This incentive while the house is being built would alleviate the terrible financial strain now being imposed on young couples who are trying to purchase their homes for the first time.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to examine this amendment.  This procedure was in operation before, and it operated successfully.  Surely the Exchequer does not want to hold back these grants to accumulate interest.  Let us aid people who want to purchase their homes and get off the local authority waiting lists.  We should give these people every incentive to purchase their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the case made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy O'Brien.  I can vouch for what they said from my own experience in my constituency.  People have serious problems when they cannot get part of the grant during the course of the construction of the house.  As a result, they have to borrow money to pay the expenses which are being incurred all the time.  If they are building the house themselves, they have to buy material. Others have to make interim payments to the people who are building the house, and nothing is coming in.  This amendment will provide money at the time when it is needed, when the house is in course of construction and has reached the roofing stage, and the bills are coming in.  There would be money to enable some of the bills to be paid and reduce the high level of debt young couples have to undertake in the course of building a house.  Usually this is the biggest investment they will make in their lives and they should be given help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I endorse what has been said about the fact that it is very hard to get money from the credit institutions.  In fact, it is almost impossible.  This heightens the case made by the two Deputies for giving some money while the house is being <Col N="1860" /> constructed to reduce the amount of reliance and the period of reliance by people building houses on banks and other institutions for credit.  In view of the fact that this procedure operated previously, I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting this eminently reasonable amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to listen to people criticising the amount of the £1,000 grant and saying it has faded into complete insignificance because of the cost of housing and, at the same time, saying it is significant enough to be broken up and paid in two parts.</P>
      <P>There are two main reasons why I cannot accept this amendment.  The first is that under the scheme the applicant has to occupy the house on completion. In the event of payment of an instalment and subsequent failure to comply with this condition, and also the CRV condition, the instalment of the grant would have to be refunded.  Past experience has shown there were great practical difficulties in securing a refund, even when an undertaking was given by an applicant before the instalment was paid.</P>
      <P>Payments of instalments of State new house grants was discontinued by the National Coalition Government on 1 January 1976.  The main reasons for the decision at that time were administrative savings and the possibility that the applicant would not comply with the requirement, introduced at the time, that he should occupy the house on completion. In July 1976 my predecessor reintroduced instalments, provided an undertaking was received from the applicant that he would occupy the new house.  However, later a number of cases arose where the undertaking was not honoured, and it is still proving most difficult to recover the instalments which were paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason I cannot accept this amendment is that provision for payment of instalments on either a mandatory or an optional basis would increase administrative costs substantially, and tend to increase delays&mdash;they have been mentioned here today&mdash;in dealing with housing grant applications.  In order to assist applicants grants may be paid <Col N="1861" /> directly to a bank account.  This facility is being used to a considerable extent by applicants for the purpose of obtaining credit while the house is being built.  It is being used very widely.  Whether or not the banks have money they are willing to give credit facilities to people who have approval for the £1,000 and make the necessary arrangements to have that £1,000 paid into the bank account when it becomes due.  It is possible to draw in advance of the £1,000 grant in that way.  To comply with what is involved in this amendment would lead to greater administrative costs and a lot more delay in connection with the payment of grants and the processing of applications. Where people fail to comply with any undertaking given the question of refunds is always very difficult.  My experience has led me to this belief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it hard to accept the Minister's reasons for refusing to accept our amendment.  We put it down because of the high cost of housing and the financial constraints on those anxious to purchase houses.  While the paying of the grant in two parts would be administratively costly we must consider how necessary it is to assist people buying homes of their own. We have heard about people falling down in their commitments and the difficulties involved in recouping the instalments paid, but I am sure it is possible to get a hold on the property involved so that such people cannot opt out of their obligations.  I was surprised that the Minister put forward so many excuses. It has already been proved possible to operate such a scheme.  A similar scheme operated some years ago but was discontinued because people fell down on their commitments.  However, the fact that a person breaks the law in some manner does not mean that what one is trying to achieve is wrong.  That is a negative approach which should not be entertained.  The Minister's attitude is regrettable particulary in view of the severe increase in house prices and the strain being experienced by young people in an effort to save a deposit.  To state that such people would have credit in the bank is all very well, but it should <Col N="1862" /> be remembered that they must pay a very high rate of interest for that credit. We should be making every effort to help young people avoid going to the banks for such credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, I should like to tell the Deputy that if instalments were to be paid it would mean 10,500 further inspections.  That gives the Deputy some idea of what is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but surely that is not a valid reason for rejecting our amendment.  It is always possible to put forward a dozen excuses if one does not want to do a certain thing and what the Minister has stated is just another excuse for not adopting our amendment.  It is not a valid reason.  We should be investigating the reasons for introducing such a system.  There is a need to adopt our suggestion because of the steep increase in the price of houses and the fact that many young people are in financial trouble in their efforts to get a home of their own.  I came across a case of a person who was earning £65 a week but had to meet repayments of £50 a week.  I accept that the wife-to-be of that person is working and that her income was taken into consideration in the loan application but after marriage she may lose her job or become pregnant with the result that that couple will find it impossible to live.  The Minister should be more generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about the section but the way the regulations should be drafted to implement the terms of the section.  The Minister should recognise the validity, in some instances, of the case put forward by the Fine Gael Members.  I welcomed the tidying up of the administration in relation to grants two years ago because I was of the opinion that the moiety payment was not a good system.  It involved extra administration. The £1,000 grant introduced by the Minister and the tidying up of the regulations were good but I was not aware at the time of a provision requiring occupation of the house.  That has been counter-productive and has <Col N="1863" /> taken away the benefit of having it as an incentive to the builder to get off a site quickly.  If the incentive is for the person to get into the house to get the grant as distinct from the builder completing it in order to get a certificate of completion, then efforts to get the builder to complete the contract are removed.  This is like the retention money that is normally held on a construction contract which ceases on occupation to be a retention sum and becomes something in relation to the occupation of the house rather than to the construction of it.  In drawing up regulations the Minister should look at paragraph (d) which relates to the occupation of the house.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that acceptance of the amendment would involve 10,500 extra inspections but that is assuming that they would all be done from Dublin and that they all had to be paid half and half.  In the case of houses that cost on average between £16,000 and £17,000 the grant, unfortunately, is no longer the critical element of finance it used to be.  When the grant system was administered by Deputy Blaney those grants were quite considerable relative to the construction cost.  Therefore, partial payments made a lot of sense.  In all honesty they do not make the same kind of fiscal sense now if one is talking about a contract figure of £17,000 and a sum of £1,000, whether one gets it in two parts or not.  The role of that grant in facilitating bridging finance or the cash flow in a contract is limited in relation to such houses but it would not be limited in relation to the 3,500 applicants who build houses with SDA loans.  For those people the grant of £1,000 is in addition to amounts of £7,000 or £9,000 they would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to propose on Report Stage the addition of a new subsection to this section which will have regard to this matter.  If the Minister saw fit, in a system of devolution of the administration of these grants to local authorities, to give to such authorities the right to decide that in certain areas they could phase-pay these grants, then the benefit of what the Fine Gael Deputies are proposing would be applied in local conditions.  It would remove <Col N="1864" /> from the Minister's concern the legitimate arguments of over-administration and increased administrative costs if he conceded to local authorities a system of general administration of housing grants and then said to them that, subject to various constraints and safeguards, they could make part-payments to housing applicants as the construction proceeds.  We would then genuinely have the best of both worlds &mdash;a centralised system of administration requiring a moiety payment of 50 per cent or more than two payments, which poses real administrative problems for central government, and a devolved system of local administration which would give to a local housing administration the right to decide to make part payments.</P>
    <P>That gives the kind of flexibility which would come from devolution of the administration of housing finance.  This is the essence of what this section would enable the Minister to do.  We are simply talking about a section under which the regulations will be drawn up but not specifically about regulations.  The Minister should give himself power to allow a phased payment of the grant.  The Minister and subsequent Ministers should have the right to introduce a phased payment if it is deemed to be a useful way of paying the grant.  If we link section 4 with section 2 we are talking about the possibility of devolving housing grant administration in the most effective way and about spreading the money in the most efficient fashion so that the bridging loan horrors that Deputy O'Brien refers to can be reduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am disappointed at the Minister's attitude towards this amendment, which was put down in good faith to try to improve the section and alleviate the lot of housebuilders and house purchasers.  The Minister told us that the National Coalition Government ceased the payment of grants by instalments on 1 January 1976 but that they restored the payment of grants by instalment six months later, having had six months' experience of paying the grant in one sum subject to an undertaking <Col N="1865" /> from the applicant to complete the house and to take up residence.  There is nothing wrong with resuming that practice at the moment.  The Minister said that it would involve about 10,000 more inspections.  That is an argument for the attitude we took up on section 2 in relation to devolving the administration of housing subsidies to local authorities.  It appears that 10,000 inspections were carried out during the year and that some of those were duplicated.  The Minister also based some of his argument against this amendment on the grounds that past experience had shown that some applicants who undertook to complete a house and to take up residence if they were paid a moiety of the grant and, in default of completing the house and taking up residence, undertook to refund the moiety of the grant paid to them failed in their obligations. How many people since this system was resumed in 1976 received a moiety of the grant on an undertaking to complete the house and take up residence or in default to refund the money and failed in their obligations to do that?  What amount of money has the State lost in that respect?  The Minister should tell us that, because he said on a number of occasions that experience had shown that people did not honour their obligations and that it was difficult to recover funds. We are speaking here about the £1,000 grant as if it were static, as if there was no intention to increase it.  I hope that the Minister will tell us, before we leave the section, that he has planned to increase this grant substantially.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I hope that the grant that we are asking to have paid in two moieties will be more than £1,000 and will be much more useful to the applicant. The gap between the availability of finance and the cost of a house is very wide at the moment.  A man gets a loan of £9,000 under the SDA scheme and <Col N="1866" /> the very cheapest house he can buy will cost £16,000, which is £5,000 below the national average.  There is a gap of £7,000 and while the £1,000 grant has been devoured it will at least reduce the gap to £6,000 at a time when every little counts for an applicant who must bridge the gap between the loan and the cost of the house.</P>
      <P>The Minister's argument about a duplication of inspections is invalid because he can devolve that on local authorities.  Will the Minister give the numbers who have defaulted and the cost of the State?  I would stress that the gap between the available loan and the cost of the house is so wide now that every opportunity should be taken to help the house builder by making whatever is coming to him available at the earliest possible time.  I would like the Minister to tell us how many people have defaulted and how much it has cost the State?</P>

    <P>In page 4, subsection (2), paragraph (f), line 50, to delete &ldquo;the grant is paid&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a grant <Col N="1867" /> was paid prior to the passing of this Act&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>We want to substitute the words &ldquo;a grant was paid prior to the passing of this Act&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;the grant is paid&rdquo;.  If those words are not inserted we would be fearful that financial considerations could be taken into account henceforth&mdash;in other words, that family circumstances and earnings would be taken into consideration.  As it is, that is not the case, but to protect that situation in the future we would like to see those words written in.  I know the Minister said he had no intention of putting financial constraints on this grant.  But if those words are inserted that would satisfy us on this side of the House that there was not any intention in the future of putting such constraints on grants. That is important because it was the policy of the present Government not to do so.  We should like to see it copperfastened in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  We would all be satisfied that something at least was being done to ensure that in future there would not be financial constraints on grant applicants.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I must oppose these amendments.  First of all I should say that in 1976 the previous Government restricted eligibility for State new house grants payable by the Department in respect of persons qualifying for supplementary grants.  In January 1977 valuation limits were applied to reconstruction grants.  On 27 June here in the House I intervened during Deputy O'Brien's contribution on the Second Reading debate and said that the purpose of section 4, subsection (2) (f) was to enable the restrictions imposed by the previous Government to be validated.  I regret that on that occasion I misled the House on that point.  I am now legally advised that such validation is not necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of subsection (2) of sections 4 and 5 is to enable certain important elements of State new house and house improvement grant schemes to be applied or varied by regulation as occasion demands.  Because of the frequency <Col N="1868" /> of changes in grants this type of flexible approach is necessary.  Under subsection (2), for example, grants could be increased fairly readily without recourse to amending legislation.  On the other hand, section 4 (2) (f) and section 5 (2) (e) would enable a means test to be applied.  I am not planning the introduction of a means test at present but we cannot anticipate developments which could necessitate such a test in the future.  It is intended to incorporate in regulations the main features of grant schemes.  During the past 25 years it was not the practice to make regulations relating to grants.  The details about grants were set out in the Housing Acts and in explanatory memoranda issued by my Department.  Therefore I feel that section 4 (2) (f) and section 5 (2) (e) should remain unaltered.  I regret I cannot accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I am pleased the Minister availed of this opportunity to clarify his statement in the House on 27 June on the Second Reading of this Bill.  On that occasion both Deputy O'Brien and I referred to paragraph (f) of section 4 (2), when we said that, in our opinion, it looked like the re-introduction of a means test.  On that occasion, during Deputy O'Brien's contribution, the Minister intervened to say that he had no proposals to impose a means test, that he was merely validating something done by the Coalition Government.  I admit quite frankly that the National Coalition Government did restrict housing grants to people who were entitled to supplementary grants.  That is a fact and cannot be denied.  But the difference between us and the Minister is that the Minister got into power on an undertaking that he would abolish the means test and that a person buying a house for the first time would receive a grant of £1,000.  That was a nice, simple promise, a very easy argument to put over&mdash;£1,000 grant for all new house buyers without any ties or means test at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now in the first Housing Bill introduced by the Minister he writes in, in black and white, machinery to operate a means test.  Is the Minister not ashamed <Col N="1869" /> of doing that within two years of promising to abolish that means test?  Within two years of a nice, simple promise of a grant of £1,000 for every first time house buyer, he comes along with proposals to introduce a means test that he and his party so often denounced.  I looked for my copy of the Fianna Fáil manifesto when coming in here today.  It is a document so sought after now by everybody, except the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, it is difficult to lay hands on.  I must have loaned it to somebody and have not got it readily available.  It is a fact that there was a promise made of £1,000 grant for all first time house owners and I do not think there was any reference to a means test.  Certainly the slogan was: Vote Fianna Fáil, you pay no rates; vote Fianna Fáil, you will get £1,000 for your house; vote Fianna Fáil, you will pay no tax on your car.  Those were the nice promises glibly made in May and June of 1977, made with considerable success, sucess to the tune of 84 Deputies.</P>
    <P>I want to know why the Minister is introducing this provision in the Bill, which he first appeared to think was something to validate the mischief and doings of his predecessor but which he clearly knows now is not the case. Rather it is simply and solely a device to impose a means test on applicants for housing grants, not to introduce it by way of a Bill in this House but by ministerial regulations which will come before the House, if the Minister has his way, on a take it or leave it basis.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): When I put down this amendment with Deputy O'Brien I did so in my innocence&mdash;and I am not saying that the Minister made the statement knowing it to have been incorrect or to mislead the House&mdash; on the basis of the statement by the Minister that this was merely to validate previous grants subject to a means test.  This amendment would make sure that from the passing of the Bill it would not be possible for the Minister to introduce a means test. The Government manifesto before the last election, which the Deputy from Roscommon said is an historic document, said there would be no means test. I am asking the Minister to honour the Government's commitment not to have a means test.  The Taoiseach and many of the Ministers said that there would be no means test.</P>
      <P>I make no apology for making the type of speech I have made.  It highlights the deception used by the Minister and his party to get into power and their speedy retreat from their promises made in the manifesto at the first opportunity they got by introducing a Housing Bill in the House.  The decent thing for the Minister to do would be to delete paragraph (f) on Report Stage if it is really his intention not to introduce a means test.  When the Minister can justify departing from the manifesto he can come back to the House with a Bill, which can be debated in a more leisurely atmosphere when we are not so near an adjournment.  We could then argue the rights and wrongs of the means test and we could be told what the means test was.  We are not being told that now.</P>

      <P>We want in our amendment to add the words &ldquo;a grant was paid prior to the passing of this Act&rdquo; to paragraph (f).  This would mean that from the time of the passing of this Bill no means test could be introduced unless the Minister came into the House with a motion requesting that a means test be introduced.  If the Government intend doing this by regulation this is a back-door method of legislation to which I am opposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that this paragraph was inserted to validate actions taken by the Coalition Government.  This amendment is very relevant to a means test and to the fact that the Government now contemplate having a means test on the £1,000 grant.  This means they are now running away from their promises because the cupboard is bare.  I am surprised that the Minister will not accept this amendment, particularly when we consider what he said to me last week.  If we did not put down this amendment we would have been hoodwinked into thinking that there was no intention of introducing a means test.  We have, as a responsible opposition, to oppose this.  If a political party get into power on particular promises and within a short period want to renege on them it behoves a responsible opposition to show up this type of irresponsibility. This is our intention now that we have the facts at this late hour.  When we put down the amendment we did not feel we would be arguing like this.  We now find that there will be a means test on those grants.  We must reject any type of means test.  The Minister may say that there was a means test under the Coalition Government but we did not say <Col N="1872" /> before the election that we would not have a means test.  The Government did and that is why we have to oppose this very strongly.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that he has no plans at the moment to introduce a means test but that in this type of legislation, because of the frequent changes in grants, it is necessary to have a certain degree of flexibility in the approach to the matter.  This is particularly necessary when the changes will be made by regulations.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte on 12 June last inquired from the Minister if he would accept that the £1,000 grant scheme, as outlined in the manifesto, was most unfair because of the method of grant-aiding the building of houses.  He asked if the Minister had any plans for the introduction of a means test for grants.  It was quite clear from the way his question was framed that he was in favour of a means test for the grant.  The Minister stated in reply that he had no plans at present to revise that scheme.  I would like to confirm that there are no plans at present for the introduction of a means test.  One cannot anticipate developments in the years ahead which could necessitate such a means test being introduced. This is the place to make provision for it.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has no plans for the introduction of a means test he should withdraw paragraph (f) of subsection (2) of this section.  That would allay all our fears.  Once that paragraph remains in the Bill and once a means test can be introduced by regulation it comes before the House and it cannot be amended.  It will be laid before the House and it is either accepted or rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view that is not good enough. The Minister has indicated he has no plans, but other Ministers may have plans to put some ceiling income on the £1,000 grant.  If the Minister is not prepared to withdraw paragraph (f) on Report Stage we will have to pursue our <Col N="1873" /> amendment because we would not be satisfied with an undertaking that there would not be an increase.  We could not accept this in any circumstances from a Government who said two years ago there would be no means test.  Now they are building into legislation a mechanism whereby, by regulations, by the back <Col N="1874" /> door, there will be a means test.  If the Minister is not prepared to withdraw paragraph (f) we will have to pursue our amendment.</P>

      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I intend making my points on this section item by item and the first point relates to the amount of the grant. In this Bill the Minister is being innovative in the sense that he is asking the House for a blank cheque.  He is asking the House for authority to bring in from time to time, regulations which will decide the amount of the grant, which is now called a subsidy, payable to house builders.</P>
      <P>At the moment only one grant of £1,000 is payable.  The £1,000 grant was introduced in July 1977 and it replaced many other grants.  It replaced a grant of more than £300 which was payable in certain cases.  For those applicants it meant an increase of £700.  It also replaced a grant payable to small and not so small farmers of up to £900 and meant an increase of only £100.  Since I January 1977 the average price of a house for which loans were granted by building societies was £11,000.  A similar house, according to statistics supplied by the Minister, now costs £22,000.</P>

As the amount of the grant can also be increased at any time by regulation, it is not necessary to change the Bill in this regard.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider changing the condition relating to occupation?  I have come across a number of cases where there was hardship, and nothing can be done. Just because somebody breaks an agreement or does not live up to the terms of the agreement all sorts of regulations are made to penalise a lot of people just <Col N="1878" /> because a few have violated an agreement. That should not be the spirit of legislation.  It should ensure that when we are giving something it is made available as quickly as possible&mdash;in this case as soon as the house is built.  I would ask the Minister to amend this on Report Stage to provide that grants should be paid when houses are completed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I raised what I consider to be a substantial point about the grant in relation to the price of houses having regard to the increase in the cost of building and so on since 1977.  I pointed out that the Minister is innovating here in so far as he is asking that he be given for the first time, a blank cheque in the from of power to make regulations adjusting the grant up or down as he thinks fit.  One would have expected that, in the light of the new departure, the Minister would have been more forthcoming with that.  Indeed normally he would have come in here with a Bill fixing the grant at £1,000, £750, £1,500 or £2,000.  That would be the Bill and we would have an opportunity of discussing the adequacy or otherwise of the grants.  I would make my case about the inadequacy of the present grant of £1,000.  The Minister, in a one-minute speech contemptuously says that it is not necessary to deal with that Bill now and that it will be dealt with by regulations.  Indeed the House and the country could be pardoned for resisting regulations and resisting them as much as they possibly could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's behaviour just now seems to me to be an excellent reason why we should not delegate to the executive, in the person of Ministers, the power to legislate for us and that is what we are doing here, and certainly the Minister has done no good service to the principle of legislating by regulations in the way that he has dealt with a point that was made by myself and Deputy O'Brien.  Indeed the Minister's behaviour justifies a tougher line by the Opposition in regard to this measure if we are to discharge our obligations to the country as a parliamentary opposition.  This is the first time since housing acts ever came before this House that we have had this method and when we avail of the <Col N="1879" /> method to discuss the adequacy of grants and try to get from the Minister some expression of intent as to the future, he contemptuously says it does not concern him and that he will do this by regulations in his own good time.  It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>If this is the beginning of a drift from legislation in this House towards bringing in here a <i>fait accompli</i> to be steamrolled the rest of the way by 84 Deputies without any opportunity of amending the regulation then we have a duty to perform and that is to resist this sort of thing.  This Bill was brought in with an armful of other Bills a fortnight ago and we were expected to pass the whole lot of them in two days.  This Bill and three contentious agricultural Bills, a tourist Bill, a B &amp; I Bill and a dangerous substances Bill, to mention but a few, were expected to be dealt with in a very short time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other points I want to make <Col N="1880" /> on this section.  Some of them are substantial and some are less than substantial. The next thing I want to deal with is section 4 (1) (b).  It relates to a person who builds a house the foundations of which are or were completed on or after 27 May 1977.  That was intended to provide that the foundations must not have been laid or completed earlier than 27 May 1977.  I doubt in fact that it says that because I believe that if foundations were completed on 1 May they were also in a completed state on 27 May.  It is subject to argument and there should be some better way of drafting it.  It would probably be better to say that the foundations were completed not before 27 May.  It would be better drafting and it would put it beyond doubt.  So, instead of what is there, I suggest that it should be that foundations were completed not before 27 May.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I have dealt with the amount of the grant.  The Minister has undertaken to consider payments of grants by moieties.</P>
      <P>There is one thing I want to say about the occupation of a house.  People can build as many houses as they like and sell them.  As long as they do not occupy them they still qualify for the grant.  That is strange.  Under the regulations at present, in order to qualify for a grant, the applicant must not have previously built a house for his own occupation.  He can build as many houses as he likes and so long as he does not occupy any of them he is entitled to the grant.</P>
      <P>Section 4 (2) (e) states:</P>
      <P>A requirement that a person to whom the grant is paid or the spouse of such person, either separately or with each other, has not previously purchased or built for his or their own occupation another house. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two people could build a house for their own occupation and live in it for several years.  That house would have been built <Col N="1881" /> jointly.  One of them could get married and the married couple could apply for a grant.  They would qualify because the previous house would not have been built by either of them solely and would not have been built by the married couple. I do not know if that is the intention. If a person builds a house he does not qualify for a grant.  If he jointly builds a house with his spouse he does not qualify for a second grant, but if he has built a house with another person, other than a spouse, he would qualify for the grant if he applied as the spouse of somebody else, or a widowed person who got a grant with his or her spouse would be entitled to another grant.  I make this as a drafting point.  It is a loophole.  I do not know what the intention is.  I do not know if I have made myself clear.  If the Minister can see any substance in what I am saying I will be glad if he will look at the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>I dealt previously with the means test. I can only denounce the Minister's silent proposals in the strongest possible way. He intends to introduce a means test but he is not saying anything about it.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) (g) states:</P>
    <P>... requirements in relation to the payment of any other grant or subsidy in respect of the house under any enactment (including this Act).</P>
    <P>What is involved in that?  In my absence an amendment was moved to section 4 (4) which the Minister accepted.  I am glad the Minister accepted it because it is better drafting and more flexible to say that it would be more reasonable to build a new house than that it would be less expensive to build a new house.  It is a more reasonable approach to someone who suffers the calamity of his house being burned.</P>
    <P>The Minister's behaviour is absolutely disgraceful in refusing to discuss the level of grants while at the same time asking for a blank cheque to churn them out in his own good time.  That is not good enough.  In future I will resist as much as I did in the past proposals to legislate by regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the point <Col N="1882" /> made by the Deputy about the regulations, I clarified for Deputy O'Brien the fact that any increase in the grants from time to time could be done by way of regulation.  I also said the same applied to the question of occupancy of a house with regard to the grant.  It was not necessary to include it in the Bill as it could be done by regulation.  I do not see how that was a high-handed approach by me.  The level of grants will be reviewed from time to time and changes made if necessary.  It will be done by regulation.  The regulation will be placed before the House for 21 days and the House can annul it if they see fit during that time.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 4 (1) (b) and the question of the foundations and 27 May, we will have a look at that between now and Report Stage and may be able to improve it.  With regard to sections 4 (2) (e), when a person purchases a house or builds it jointly with another person who is not their spouse, for example, brother or sister, this would not debar either of the parties who wish to apply subsequently for the £1,000 grant.  One of the conditions of payment is that the applicant must occupy the house as his normal place of residence on a year round basis.  In a case where one of such parties needed a house of their own, for example, on marriage, it would be wrong to refuse them payment of the grant.</P>
      <P>We are aware of difficulties which arise in cases where a person is separated from his or her spouse and one of the parties wishes to purchase or build another dwelling.  There is a sympathetic attitude towards such cases if they claim the grant in respect of a new dwelling they are occupying.  Evidence is sought, for example, legal documentation relating to the separation and so on. Such applicants are treated sympathetically.</P>
      <P>With regard to section 4 (2) (g) the only reason for this is to prevent a person getting grants from two Departments for a house, the Department of the Environment and the Department of the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The House recognises Deputy Fitzpatrick's legal expertise in spotting what might be considered to be drafting difficulties.  I should like to raise three possible additions to this section which the Minister may like to consider. Two relate specifically to the voluntary housing movement.  The third is a phased payment facility which will apply to all.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to take power to do two things, first, to have a differential grant for voluntary housing associations recognised under section 3. If a voluntary housing association applied to build ten houses, they would get ten grants plus one, or plus two.  There would be the same provision in the drafting of the grant regulations as there was in the old utility section where there was an extra 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The principle I am putting forward in essence is that if a group of people come together to build houses under the voluntary housing system, and in normal circumstances they are entitled to ten housing grants because they are building ten houses, their efforts should be further assisted by saying: &ldquo;If you come together in that form and agree in a <i>bona fide</i> association under section 3, we will give you an extra grant.  We will top it up.&rdquo;  If the legal power to do that already exists in the Principal Act, my proposal is redundant.  If not, perhaps an additional subsection would meet the case.</P>
      <P>The second point I should like to make is that if a voluntary housing association apply for a grant the Minister and the housing authorities should be able to deal with the application on a group basis.  There should not be ten separate applications and ten separate investigations.  Money given to voluntary housing associations should be so structured that they can qualify for a single grant and the £10,000&mdash;using the £1,000 grant as an example&mdash;can be paid in one cheque or in three phased payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I am trying to do is fairly evident. <Col N="1884" /> I am trying to ensure that the Minister has sufficient power in this Bill to build into the regulations specific incentives to get people together in voluntary housing associations.  The incentive would take two forms: an additional grant or a bonus grant relating to the number of applicants, and recognition that a single application could be made for the group and dealt with as a single application.  The payment would be made in one or two parts instead of ten separate cheques.</P>
    <P>My experience in the south county Dublin area is that in the past there was a great deal of paper work resulting from people having to fill in ten, 15, or 20 separate applications.  I could draft an amendment for Report Stage.  If the Minister has not the power to do this he might consider between now and Report Stage taking that power to do it by regulation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Under sections 12 and 45 of the 1966 Act there is provision to assist these people by way of special loans and periodic contributions.  It is not possible to make a capital grant available on the lines the Deputy mentioned.  They get special treatment with regard to the acquisition of sites and the cost of sites. They are treated in a very special way, and rightly so.  There is also help for them under the low rise mortgage scheme.  There are ways of assisting them other than making an extra grant or a capital grant available to them.  So it is possible to assist them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really chasing the principle of incentives for voluntary housing associations to be formed and, if they are formed, to benefit from extra cash by way of subsidy or capital grant. If the Minister says he has that power in section 12 of the 1966 Act, fair enough. I am not so sure he has.  That deals with extra moneys paid on top of the grants to which people are now entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue relates to the administration of the payment of the grant. That involves two things, first, accepting the principle that a joint application for grants can be made.  By definition a voluntary housing association will not have a full-time secretariat like a <Col N="1885" /> building company.  They should not have to go through the process of having to make a number of applications for exactly the same number of houses.  The Minister has the safety net of the regulations he will draft.  Some provision should be made for a joint application for grants and the joint payment of those grants in one lump sum or part thereof.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In my constituency there is a large trust, the Iveagh Trust.  In the great majority of the flats the rents are controlled and, as a result, they have run into a great deal of serious financial trouble.  We got some assistance from the corporation for them.  There should be more flexibility here.  Where we have existing housing stock like that, they should not be tied in to the normal grant situation.  A number of those flats are old and require complete renovation, bathrooms, and so on.  The grants they get for improvement are not adequate for that type of development.</P>
      <P>There is a great need to retain and improve our existing housing stocks.  A vast trust like the Iveagh Trust must be funded from central Government.  We must look at this realisticly and protect that property from decay.  They had to cut back on the painting of the complex because of the cost.  This leads to a gradual deterioration of a good solid property in the centre city area.</P>
      <P>Given that the Minister wants to make regulations here, there and everywhere in this Bill, there should be flexibility for a trust like that to make an application to the Department of the Environment for certain work such as an overall paint job.  The inspectors can inspect it and look at the books and the financial structures of the trust and say: &ldquo;This is an area which requires a generous grant.&rdquo;  That would be money well spent.  Any money we spend on the preservation of our housing stock&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion criticising the recent increase in CIE fares which vary between 15 and 20 per cent.  In doing so I do not wish to adopt a destructive critical attitude but I hope to bring about a note of reasonableness and initiate a constructive debate.  Last week-end I read the debate which took place on Tuesday last and also the content <Col N="1887" /> of similar debates here when Fianna Fáil were in Opposition.  In my view the contributions then were in general the most chidlish imaginable.  They demanded that the increases should not be imposed and that the deficit which CIE were incurring be offset by the introduction of an additional subvention from the Exchequer.  The Government argued that that would be unfair because it would impose additional taxation on the taxpayer.  We had a tug-o'-war over which system to adopt, whether to charge higher fares on the buses and trains or to mulct taxpayers to a greater degree by seeking additional money from State funds.  It is my view that those suggestions are not worthy of a debate here.  We should be asking ourselves what we can do to make CIE a paying proposition or how can we greatly reduce the deficit that company incur annually?</P>
      <P>According to the March report of the National Prices Commission from a deficit of £2 million in the late sixties it is estimated that the 1979 deficit will amount to about £36 million.  If one is to judge by recent Government announcements it appears that the deficit, according to financial correspondents of one of the national newspapers, will be in the region of £50 million.  I hope the Minister of State will tell the House if there is any substance in that statement. In my view there is some substance in it particularly when one considers the major increases that have taken place in the price of oil.  That is a colossal deficit for a semi-State body.  I can never understand why there are so many different ways of describing that concern. It is described as a semi-State body, a State-sponsored body and a nationalised industry.  Obviously, it is a nationalised industry because CIE are no different from British Rail which is generally accepted as being a nationalised concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report I referred to, the National Prices Commission were critical of CIE management and their policies.  That report expressed the view that CIE do not appear to have any policies to offer as to how the deficit can be reduced.  It is obvious that there are certain sections of CIE which could be <Col N="1888" /> run by private enterprise on a more profitable basis.  Those services could be run without any diminution in the quality of the service provided by CIE.  I cannot understand why such a service is not put in the hands of private enterprise.  I do not know why private enterprise is not given the opportunity of competing with CIE in providing such a service.  Such competition would to a certain extent be unique in the road passenger section of the company.  Some of CIE's present operations offer an outstanding opportunity for the initiation of such a programme where private enterprise would complete against the State-sponsored company.  It is inconceivable, for example, that the Dublin city bus service can lose as much as £5½ million, as is estimated for 1979. In my view, a private set of operators could run that lucrative service at a good profit.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, there are some contributory factors to CIE's problem with regard to the bus service in Dublin, the main one being the traffic congestion being experienced in Dublin.  We should at least experiment by allowing these private operators to compete whether by tender or by merely giving them the franchise on certain routes.  There is no reason why CIE should remain in the road haulage business which is very lucrative, as they appear to be able to make only a very small profit.  Many road haulage operators can make an outstandingly good living from the limited runs they can make and the limited business they are allowed to carry because of the restrictions put on the various licences.  It seems that private operators given the same opportunities as CIE would be able to do the business in a far more efficient manner.</P>
    <P>I agree that the railway system presents major difficulties and is the section of CIE which incurs the greatest proportion of losses.  The 1977 annual report of CIE states that 82 per cent of their losses were incurred on the railways. How can we offset the £29 million loss which is estimated for 1979?  It will not be easy.  Railway systems through the world are run at a loss.  I do not know of any example where a railway is making a profit.  We have the same problem here <Col N="1889" /> in this regard as do Britain and other countries in western Europe.  I have no ready solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>Railways are an emotional subject for many people.  As children we were excited by trains and railways and they still exist, so we would hate to see them going.  They have a tremendous attraction although it is plain that they are not a viable proposition.  A previous Fianna Fáil administration felt that by doing away with a lot of the provincial lines the railways could be made profitable. Between 1958 and the late 1960s something like 700 miles of railway lines were closed down.  I remember the late President Childers, who was then Minister for Transport and Power, saying that by doing this we would eliminate CIE's losses so that CIE could be run on a profitable basis.  He was wide of the mark.  The recent figures indicate that the very opposite is the case.  Cutting off more and more sections of our railways is obviously not the answer.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement last Wednesday night said that we had two options open to us, one was to increase the fares and the other to cut back on services.  We are asking tonight that this idea should not be promoted any longer. The answer is not to increase the fares, or to eliminate the railways or to cut back on provincial bus services.  We should expand the service and if that expansion has to include an interest from the private sector, let us have it.  Let us have a transport system which the public can be proud of and which the public can utilise, which will not be a millstone around the taxpayers' necks as is the case presently.</P>
    <P>I note a distinct lack of imagination, of new ideas and of initiative in the whole set-up of CIE as in some other State bodies, although I doubt if any of the others are as bad as CIE.  It was suggested in previous debates that the involvement of the private sector should be considered.  I get a feeling that Deputies are afraid to push the point to its natural conclusion or to have the matter debated openly because they are afraid of vested interests in the public sector taking offence, and they are afraid of losing popularity.  It is our duty to <Col N="1890" /> pursue all possible avenues, in an effort to see that the taxpayers are not milked to the tune of £50 million this year and probably more next year.</P>
    <P>Over the years new schemes were advocated and brought into operation to cure all the ills in the railway and bus services.  There were new faster trains and more efficient streamlined bus services. Some of these were marginally successful but overall we still end up with a major deficit.  Despite the success or partial success of some of these schemes the deficit keeps increasing.  We were told three or four years ago that with the help of a new productivity scheme we could expect losses to decrease.  The productivity scheme was brought in and the Minister has reported that it was a success and had helped in saving money.  If it saves money we have not seen the results because the deficit is going up and up.</P>
    <P>I would like a clear definition as to what productivity means.  We seem to get lost in jargon like this all too often and the masses do not understand what it is all about.  I have come to the conclusion along with many others that it is another big word used to fob people off. CIE are employing something like 3,000 fewer people now than they were in 1976 but the deficit has gone up by many millions of pounds in the interim.  I fail to see the advantages of this greatly increased productivity.  I do not know what proposals CIE have put to the Department regarding their intentions or efforts to cut back on losses and to bring about a smaller annual deficit.  Would the Minister tell us of their proposals?  I did not come in here to harangue the Minister but to make an objective and I hope a helpful contribution.  I am putting forward my views and I would like an honest assessment of the whole situation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Earlier I spoke about the Dublin city bus services which are operating at such an enormous loss, £5,500,000.  I am told by private bus operators&mdash;and there are 34 of them registered in the country&mdash;that they would be delighted to get their hands on such a service because they are convinced they could make an enormous profit.  I suppose the more money anybody can make in the <Col N="1891" /> private sector the better, but they are not demanding that they get a free hand in this.  They say&mdash;and I think it a very reasonable demand&mdash;they are willing to enter into free competition with CIE, that they would be willing to tender for some or any of the routes involved in Dublin city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin-Central):</i> Certainly they would not tender for the non-lucrative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, what is termed as being lucrative or non-lucrative?  I shall come back to the Minister on that in a few moments when I think he would be smiling on the other side of his cheek. But they are willing to tender with CIE on any of these routes in Dublin, or throughout the country, where CIE at present operate.  I call that a reasonable offer and I think any citizen or taxpayer would so regard it.  If their tender was accepted that would be money into the coffers of the State&mdash;obviously if they are tendering they can be charged a certain fee&mdash;and that will go towards relieving the losses in other sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious from the figures published by the prices commission in their report of March this year and also in the report of 1972 &mdash; which is referred to as occasional paper No. 4: CIE rates and fares&mdash;that CIE's competitiveness is steadily decreasing.  In that event private enterprise should be allowed in.  What recent efforts have been made to help CIE run the Dublin buses where major traffic congestion is involved?  Obviously it is a severe setback&mdash;buses which should cross the city in half an hour may take two to two and a half hours because of traffic jams and inadequate traffic arrangements. There have been proposals over the years for specific laneways to be reserved for buses and the essential services, such as police, ambulances, doctors and so on, thereby eliminating present delays which, economically, must be extremely damaging to CIE's profit-making ambitions.  I should like the Minister to reply to this point: have there been any suggestions that the inner city be devoid of motor traffic, of private cars?  I know these proposals are quite drastic but, unless something is done, the <Col N="1892" /> present situation will continue to deteriorate.  There have been talks on long-term plans for new roadways, toll bridges, such as were dealt with in a recent Bill in the House, to alleviate traffic. But all of these proposals will not be implemented for many years.  Having observed the build-up and congestion that has arisen in the last five or six years, knowing that it will be at least that time again before anything is done, and perhaps longer, we must implement some drastic proposals to deal with what is a drastic problem at present.  For instance, I should like the Minister for Labour to tell us how many man-hours are lost in Dublin, and indeed in other major provincial towns, through people being held up in traffic jams?  What does it cost the economy?  What does it cost various businessess?  What does it cost the nation in terms of people having to be treated for heart attacks, strokes and high blood pressure through the frustration of being delayed unnecessarily?  Obviously all of these things must hold back our industrial development.  Certainly they interfere with out health record and productivity because people cannot work efficiently sitting inside the cab of a lorry or a bus for hours on end when that vehicle should be in transit.</P>
    <P>Therefore these problems are so pressing we cannot wait for long-term, grandiose plans for new bridges, new tunnels, new underground railway systems or anything else.  Something must be done in the interim.  I welcomed the announcement by the Minister some weeks ago that the present Government would see to it that the railway line from Bray to Howth was electrified, speeding up the rail system through the city area.  That would be a tremendous boon and take quite a few commuters off the roads. This is one angle only.  Obviously there are a number of other matters which need to be examined.</P>
    <P>Earlier the Minister said of CIE that they would retain the lucrative runs but he did not think the private operators would want the non-lucrative ones.  They have them; the 34 operators to whom I referred have nothing else; they have the left-overs, the runs CIE have refused to operate because, to use the Minister's own words, they are non-lucrative.  CIE <Col N="1893" /> could not make them pay.  That was the only reason those 34 operators were given licences to use those runs.  That is why I maintain: what would these people not do if they had the lucrative runs? I know some of these private bus operators.  They have an association called PAMBO.  They have been lobbying in recent years to be given some of the business, or an opportunity to compete with or tender for some of the business at present the sole preserve of CIE. These people are making an outstanding living on the runs CIE would not operate.  Therefore I ask the question: what would they do if they had the runs at present being operated by CIE?  I am sure they would be making a very handsome profit.  If the system was operated by way of tender the State could recoup a large proportion of the profit these operators are presently making.  And it is not that they use cheap labour or underhand methods.  There are some of these private bus operators in my constituency. Probably they are more efficient than CIE; they give better value for money and that is what the public wants.  We should examine that aspect.</P>
    <P>I did not come in here to harangue the Minister.  Rather I came in to make constructive suggestions.  I hope my statement has been wholly constructive.  I should like the Minister and the Minister of State to take cognisance of the facts I have pointed out, because the taxpayer cannot be expected to continue to hand out £50 million this year, £60 million next year when the job could be done by private operators at a much lesser cost to the taxpayer.  That is not an unreasonable request.  State-sponsored bodies were set up to service areas where private enterprise could not be profit-making. In the present situation CIE are not profit-making.  Even on an experimental basis they should hand some portion of their franchise to the private sector and ascertain whether the State can be saved substantial sums of money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Dublin South-Central) Thomas J. (Dublin South-Central) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Dublin South-Central):</i> I appreciate Deputy Deasy's suggestion but am afraid he is suggesting simplistic solutions to a very complicated matter. <Col N="1894" /> If any Government could overcome our public transport problems along the lines suggested by the Deputy, I am convinced previous Governments would have adopted those solutions.  However, I will make sure his suggestions are given due consideration.</P>
      <P>Despite what Deputy Deasy said, this is an abstract motion which states: &ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the recent increases in CIE fares approved by the Government&rdquo;.  It does not give any solution to the problem or state how CIE will manage their financial problems. The Minister said he would be coming into this House for an additional subvention of £10 million on top of the £35 million paid last year to CIE.  In his speech the Minister explained that the purpose of the application was to secure increased revenue for CIE so as to contain, as far as practicable, the board's subvention requirements for 1979 within the subvention provision of £35 million provided in the Estimates for the Department of Tourism and Transport.</P>
      <P>With this object in mind increases ranging on average from 15 per cent to 20 per cent were proposed in an application which was submitted by CIE to the Department in February 1979.  This application was designed to meet in some way increases in costs, particularly in respect of labour and materials, which had arisen since the board last made application for increased fares in February 1978.</P>
      <P>The application to the National Prices Commission showed additional costs totalling £16.4 million of which £10.35 million, or 63 per cent, was for wages and other labour costs and the balance for increased costs of materials and increased depreciation and financial charges.  The National Prices Commission in examining the application applied to the CIE proposals their strict criteria for assessing the costs allowable for price increases.  In their report they indicated that of the total costs claimed by CIE £14.76 million was allowable and could qualify to be met by increases in fares.  CIE were not seeking to recover the full amount of allowable costs since the anticipated revenue yield from the fares and rates increases will amount to only about £11.6 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1895" /> Therefore, on the basis of the costs shown in the CIE application, the increases in fares and rates are more than justified.  Moreover, CIE's costs have continued to escalate and it is now apparent that CIE's original projections will be substantially exceeded in 1979 due primarily to large increases in labour and oil costs and the adverse effects on revenue of industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>The Government, having considered carefully the observations of the National Prices Commission, the deteriorating financial position of CIE and the implications of this for the Exchequer, decided that CIE should be permitted to implement the increases in fares and rates, with however the important exceptions that there should be no increases in the fares of fare-paying school children.  Even with the recent increases in fares and rates the £35 million subvention for 1979 will now be seriously inadequate.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows how the National Prices Commission operate would not consider them a generous body.  They apply strict criteria as regards price increases and very seldom will they allow the full increases sought by the private sector.  On this occasion, they closely examined the structure of CIE.  As I said, £10.35 million was set aside for wages and salaries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright asked the Minister to withdraw these increases.  Let us follow that to its logical conclusion.  Are we to single out the employees of CIE from employees in other semi-State bodies or in the private sector?  Are we saying they are not entitled to the increases in salaries and wages which were negotiated with their unions or allowed by the Labour Court?  I believe the employees of CIE are entitled to the same standard of salaries as those in other sectors of the community.  We cannot hope to have a good and efficient company or service if we underpay staff. As this motion does not say how this additional money will be found, I take it that it is the policy of Fine Gael that those employees should not enjoy the same increases as are enjoyed by other sections of the community.  On the other <Col N="1896" /> hand Fine Gael might suggest that this money be provided by way of subvention.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will be coming into this House very shortly for an additional £10 million, which will mean a total subvention for CIE of £45 million. This will not bridge the gap completely because there will still be a deficit.  If the money sought by CIE is to be met by subvention, we will have to introduce additional taxation.  Does this mean Opposition Deputies will agree that we increase taxation, indirect taxation, to recover the amount necessary to defray the costs incurred by CIE?  When tax increases to defray the cost of social services were introduced in the last budget Opposition Deputies decried them.</P>
    <P>These are the facts we must consider when we discuss a motion like this. Whether we like it or not the facts of economic life are that costs in every company are rising.  As long as we are in this House we will have increased costs in certain services, and CIE are no exception. That does not mean that I believe CIE should not be told to carry out a thorough examination to minimise these expenses, because in my view a very big subvention could mitigate against the proper and efficient working of that company.</P>
    <P>Other factors contributed to these increases, such as the increase in oil prices. Sundry expenses amounting to enormous sums have to be met by CIE. Nobody claims that the increased price of oil has not had a considerable effect on the financial accounts of the company over that period.  This has to be met whether we like it or not.  On several occasions I have heard Deputy Quinn complain here about the rolling stock of CIE.  Certain depreciations and replacements have to be taken into consideration and these factors also militate against CIE being able to balance their accounts now and down through the years.  These factors&mdash;wages, running costs, the price of oil, and depreciation &mdash; bring about the type of situation we see in the accounts of CIE.</P>
    <P>We are making a practical approach to this matter.  CIE are partly a commercial and partly a social service, and we must look at them in that light.  There are <Col N="1897" /> commercial aspects of the company which it would be unfair to ask the Exchequer to carry.  They have a social obligation to the country and from that aspect of the question we must consider where a subvention is appropriate.  For anyone to come into this House and to say that the entire increase should be met out of the subvention is ludicrous and such a suggestion could not be sustained by any Government.  If we move into that situation it would mean that every increase in the company's costs would have to be met out of the Exchequer and any Government would find themselves in an intolerable position in a short time.</P>
    <P>CIE are operating under difficult conditions. I remember when they were making money on public transport in Dublin, but over the years there has been a considerable decline in their profitability.  They moved into a loss situation and now in public transport in Dublin they are sustaining a considerable loss, a loss of practically £10 million.  This has been brought about by various factors.  One is the congestion in which CIE transport has to operate in Dublin today.  I am speaking about Dublin, but I am convinced that the same type of congestion and losses are being suffered by CIE in large cities and towns throughout the country.  A solution to this problem is not easy.  Undoubtly anyone travelling through Dublin can see how the problem arises. Many buses are held up for half or three-quarters of an hour.  This is a considerable expense on the company and is militating against the whole concept of public transport and against encouraging people to use public transport.</P>
    <P>I am not saying for one moment that economies should not be effected.  Of course, they should.  Deputy Deasy mentioned the productivity agreements reached a few years ago and the reorganisation system introduced into CIE.  He said they did not seem to be reflected in the accounts.  It is true to some extent that they have not been reflected in their entirety.  However, so far as CIE are concerned, when a re-organisation scheme is introduced and when the age of retirement and various <Col N="1898" /> such matters come into question, there is a considerable loss financially because of redundancy payments and early retirements.  The full effect of this re-organisation may not be seen at this time but it should appear favourably in the accounts in the coming years.  I hope that that will be so, but the redundancy payments and early retirements are substantial in the company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy said also that we should allow more and more of private enterprise to take over and move into the whole field of public transport.  I am not altogether sure about this because there are various elements which need deep consideration before any Government could embark on such a decision.  If CIE could get the proper climate and perhaps operate within a proper system in our cities they could do a good job.  Unfortunately, many problems will have to be sorted out eventually, especially labour problems.  The public have become disenchanted to some degree but we must ensure that the situation improves.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how any Government could go beyond the generous subventions which the Government are making on this occasion.  We will bring a Bill into the House seeking an additional £10 million.  This will not cover the entire moneys which will be necessary to bridge the gap and a deficit will still be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin South-Central):</i> It is a Supplementary Estimate.  If we were to absorb the total costs which CIE are incurring, without any increase in fars or rates, we would be talking about something in the region of £55 million to £60 million.  The Minister for Finance must look after the finances of the country and, in order to pay out a subvention like that, the only way he could possibly raise it would be at the expense of the taxpayers and the weaker sections of the community.  It would have to be raised in taxes.  It could well militate against making provision for the weaker sections of the community such as old age pensioners, social welfare recipients and such people.</P>
      <P>In the broad sense the decision which the Government have taken here in asking the public to pay a reasonable amount requires the taxpayers to contribute their share towards the social aspect of CIE, something which we would be increasing this year.  Last year the subvention to CIE was £35 million. This year there will be provision for an additional £10 million, an increase of practically 30 per cent.  It would be too much to expect any Government to go beyond that and to come back and ask the Exchequer to increase the amount of revenue which it gets from the taxpayers in general.  We must pass on the increases being sought by CIE.  I believe CIE can do a reasonable job, given the conditions.  We must consider how the mobility of public transport can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is early in the year to predict accurately the size of the final deficit on CIE's activities for 1979, the Minister will shortly seek Dáil approval for a Supplementary Estimate of £10 million for CIE.  This £10 million is additional to the existing subvention provision of £35 <Col N="1900" /> million and even the total provision of £45 million will still leave a significant gap between revenue and expenditure which will have to be bridged.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious situation in the light of the resources available from the Exchequer towards meeting such unforeseen demands.  It is proposed to have a critical assessment of CIE's financial situation to see what remedial measures should be adopted and how savings might be achieved.  There will be an examination of the whole field of expenditure of CIE.  Pending this examination the provision of £10 million in the proposed Supplementary Estimate, together with the board's temporary borrowings and the yield from the increased fares and rates, will enable CIE to maintain services and meet the board's commitments. In the light of the situation depicted, increases of between 15 per cent and 20 per cent cannot be regarded as unreasonable.  There have been no increases in the fares of fare-paying school children, while the increases in urban and town fares will be on a tapering scale so that the impact on higher fare values will be minimised.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that the users of public transport are being asked to bear only part of the additional costs being incurred by CIE.  In fact, the increase in fares and rates will yield less than half of the total additional costs at present estimated. It is unreasonable to argue that it would be equitable to place the total burden of the extra costs on the shoulders of the taxpayer who is already paying a very substantial amount towards the cost of CIE's services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn said last week that the Government were not making any progress towards the formulation of a proper policy.  Both he and Deputy Enright mentioned the subject of energy conservation and took this as a basis for arguing against the introduction of the recent increase in CIE fares.  Their suggestion seemed to be that if there were no increases in fares there would be greater use of public transport and that this would bring about a saving in oil imports.</P>
    <P>Of course, it would be desirable if car owners could be persuaded to leave their cars at home and to use public transport. <Col N="1901" /> This would not only improve CIE's revenue directly by increasing passenger numbers but would also relieve traffic congestion which is responsible for many of the problems which beset public transport in urban areas.  As everyone knows, traffic congestion means long delays in traffic jams, so that buses cannot keep to schedules and the overall efficiency and reliability of the services are seriously affected.</P>
    <P>I think, however, it is true to say that the growth in the use of private cars did not come about because of increases in public transport fares.  Most people now aspire to owning a car because of the great convenience and freedom of movement which private cars permit.  The increase in car ownership is a sign of the greater affluence of society in general, and to the extent that a great number of people can enjoy the benefits of private motoring, this development must be welcomed.  People like to be able to exercise a freedom of choice and the extent to which people still continue to bring their cars into the overcrowded city centre demonstrates how much they value this freedom.  The long petrol queues which formed during the recent period of petrol shortage also illustrates the values which the motorist places on retaining the use of his private car.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances it is unlikely that the recent increase in fares will have a significant effect on the degree of utilisation of private cars.  To take an example, the regular user of CIE's Dublin city services who avails of the monthly commuter ticket will now have to pay £2 extra for his monthly ticket, an increase of 15 per cent.  Having regard to the cost involved in the purchase and running of a car, it seems highly unlikely that payment of an extra £2 a month could be a significant factor in a decision to switch from public to private transport.</P>
    <P>In theory, of course, a sharp reduction in private cars in city areas could be secured by very severe restrictions on parking or similar controls, but such measures would not be readily acceptable to the public.  It may be, of course, that the energy crisis will itself bring about an involuntary restriction on private motoring.  This did happen during the recent petrol shortage and public <Col N="1902" /> transport benefited as a result.  However, with the easing of the petrol supply situation, the volume of car traffic again increased.</P>
    <P>I am not denying that there is some resistance to increase in CIE fares and that this can bring about a reduction in the numbers which would otherwise use public transport.  However, as in the case of other commodities and services, it is only logical that the charges for public transport should increase when the costs of labour and materials increase.  As has already been made clear, the users of public transport are being asked to bear only part of the increased costs incurred by CIE.</P>
    <P>We would all like to see the day when we could keep private transport out of Dublin city.  This would solve many problems.  I should like to see some dialogue between residents' associations throughout the country on the subject of pooling cars for travelling into city areas.  This would contribute considerably to the efficiency of CIE and would be a major contribution to the conservation of energy, which is a major factor in our economic life.  We must aim at reducing traffic in Dublin and other major centres.  We cannot continue to allow the congestion which prevails at present and unpopular decisions will probably have to be taken by some Government in an effort to alleviate this problem.  We realise the effect of traffic congestion on the operations of CIE and on their financial situation.</P>
    <P>We have set up a Transport Consultative Commission whose terms of reference cover the whole field of public transport throughout the country.  The Minister has been conscious of the difficulties encountered in the larger cities and has directed the Commission to pay immediate attention to possible solutions which would relieve the situation in Dublin.  We expect the report of the Commission very shortly.  They sought recommendation from the public on this matter.  The setting up of the Commission, together with the decision to electrify the Howth-Bray line, shows the Government's concern about public transport.  No country can survive socially or economically without a proper public transport system.</P>
    <Col N="1903" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion, though my reasons for doing so are different from those of Deputy Deasy.  The granting of this increase does not in any way enhance the future prospects of CIE.  The contrary is the case.  CIE have looked for an easy way out and there is nothing to show that CIE management have any idea of modern marketing.</P>
      <P>I will not deny that CIE need more money and for that reason I welcome the Minister's promise of a further £10 million subvention. It is of vital importance that the State ensure that we have a first class transport system.  In most countries, as Deputy Deasy has said, railway systems do not pay.  They will never prove to be self-sufficient and subventions will be necessary.  I do not agree that this 15 to 20 per cent increase is the right way of assisting CIE to get in revenue; on the contrary.  At a time when the country is looking for a means of conserving energy, a glorious opportunity is being lost by granting this increase.</P>
      <P>The only way for a transport system to get in revenue is to attract business, to have their trains and buses packed to capacity and their road freight service should be in a position to compete with private companies.  I can assure the Minister that there is no better way to scare off people from travelling than by granting very substantial increases like the present one.  Take a train from Limerick, Cork, or Waterford, with seating accommodation for 500 people; if you have a return fare of £7 and 300 people travel on that train you make £2,100.  Take the same train and increase your fare to £9.  Naturally you are going to have a decrease in the number of passengers; you will have 250 passengers and that will give you something in the region of £2,200.  Rather than expect the taxpayer to pay, as I would not expect him to pay, there should be good management within CIE.  If they have accommodation for 500 people and charge a fare around £6 and that train is filled, they get £3,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, what the Minister is doing is <Col N="1904" /> giving a licence to CIE to turn people from using their services.  That is exactly what has been happening.  The only way CIE can get people to travel on their services is by making their fares attractive enough to get the people to leave their cars behind and to avail of their services. That is the best and the only way; by doing that, you are not expecting the taxpayer to pay&mdash;you are getting the money directly from the people who use the excellent service that CIE are providing.  CIE need to attract more people on to their trains and buses by reducing their fares rather than increasing them.</P>
    <P>We have one Minister&mdash;whether hypocritically or not, I do not know &mdash;stating that we must conserve our fuel resources.  The Minister a few moments ago in his remarks said we had had a petrol crisis.  I assure the Minister for Tourism and Transport that we have a petrol crisis.  On my way from Limerick there were two garages open the whole way up; the cars were in a three-mile-long queue at each.  That is what is happening. The Minister has a glorious opportunity of trying in some way to answer that appeal of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy to conserve fuel resources.  By not allowing that increase to CIE, he had a glorious opportunity to tell CIE to utilise their services to the maximum thereby helping both CIE and the Minister, who is shedding crocodile tears, as far as I can see, for the conservation of fuel resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that CIE must pay good wages.  They must give a decent standard of living to their employees.  That is only to be expected. They must meet the increased labour costs.  The workers of CIE, you can take it from me, are very demoralised and frustrated when they see their company's management taking the easy way out&mdash;instead of trying to attract people and traffic to their services&mdash;by just looking for a substantial increase.  By doing so, they scare off those who might keep these people in employment.  That is what the workers are concerned about&mdash;the mismanagement that can take place inside this company.  There is no doubt that CIE, like all transport systems throughout the world, must get subventions.  This is a social as <Col N="1905" /> well as a commercial service and because of that there must be continued subventions. Nevertheless, there is something seriously wrong at the top, as far as CIE are concerned.  Of course, like all organisations, there are many good people and there is good management, but not at top level.</P>
    <P>If you had a public sworn inquiry into the operations of CIE, the first people to welcome that would be the operators of CIE.  I have seen the railway system being sabotaged by the current management. They deliberately and wilfully ran services at a time completely unsuitable to the people who would be travelling. They expended thousands of pounds on renovating stations.  They installed cranes at enormous expense.  At the end of the year they showed a colossal expense in the running of that line.  Consequently, nobody could justify the keeping open of the line.  No deputation could go to the Minister or to CIE and say: &ldquo;That could be a viable service; keep it open; we need it.&rdquo;  Figures were put before the Minister, these resulted, because of deliberate sabotage by the management, in closing down lines.  They were not concerned about the worker who was displaced because of the closure.  That did not worry them.  This is the same management.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting at which £600 million of merchandise was purchased by CIE and I heard the assistant general manager at the time state that if we did not operate that merchandise &ldquo;Let it go up the sidings to rust&rdquo;.  That is the type of management we have.  Of course, there are some good people in that concern and they are very worried themselves as management but they are not given the money; their expertise or qualifications are not allowed to enter into it.  There are those who are anxious to take the easy way out.  The people who use the trains and buses and the workers are the sufferers, the workers who are being put on the road, who are being displaced and transferred around the country because of the sabotage that took place within CIE.</P>
    <P>With proper management the position could be otherwise.  We could not expect CIE would ever pay, because no national rail or transport system has <Col N="1906" /> ever paid, but there is need for first class management.  I sincerely suggest that if the Minister wants expertise, people to run CIE, he should go to the workforce and allow them the promotion which can only be gained by an exclusive section of CIE.  A worker may be promoted only as far as inspector; he ends there.  All the good things that have happened in CIE, things represented to the Minister as modernisation, productivity and so on, have come from suggestions of the workers and nobody else.  I can assure the Minister of that; I know.  I am saddened that the Minister should fall into the trap of allowing this increase when all that is needed, as I have suggested, was the promotion of more business.  In a transport business the best way to make it pay is to have maximum utilisation of resources.</P>

      <P>I shall conclude now.  I only want to say that if the Minister had refused to sanction that increase and had, as I said, encouraged people to use trains and buses, it would have been a better policy.  There should also be greater co-operation between semi-State bodies.  I am sorry my time is so short because I could go on much longer.  The Minister should encourage the ESB, the Post Office and other such bodies to transport their goods by rail rather than use the roads themselves.  This would greatly help CIE by providing traffic for them.  I ask the Minister to consider what I have suggested.</P>

      <P>I have listened with interest to this debate.  I am glad to have had the opportunity of moving the motion on 3 July and of replying to the debate on it today.  I listened to and I have read the speech of the Minister for Tourism and Transport and I also listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzpatrick, and it occurred to me, and I believe that I am correct in stating that at this point of time the Government have absolutely no policy in regard to transport.  That is most regrettable.  We have all listened with tremendous interest to the Minister for Industry, Commerce <Col N="1907" /> and Energy speaking about conserving energy on numerous occasions and we are all endeavouring to heed and act on his advice.  Without question, the country is at present having an energy crisis.  We are not unique because this is not confined to European countries; America and all countries are suffering an energy crisis.  The energy situation is getting worse rather than better.  The situation regarding oil and petrol supplies is likely to become worse rather than better.  Oil and petrol are scarce resources and all the statistical information with which we are furnished indicates that they are becoming scarce. Therefore, the duty devolves on the Minister of State at the Department to try to ensure that as many people as possible are encouraged to use public transport.  That is also the duty of the Minister for Transport and Tourism&mdash;to ensure that maximum use is made of buses and trains.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister read with interest the CIE statement following the recent petrol crisis that there had been a 25 per cent increase in the use of public transport.  This was a major improvement. I might add that this increase came after the National Prices Commission had recommended an increase in fares: the matter was before the Government. The business began to improve and there was this 25 per cent increase. Unfortunately then, the Government decided to increase fares by 15 to 20 per cent.  That was a retrograde step, a disasterous step.  To have such an increase in the use of public transport was of major significance.  The CIE spokesman also stated that as far as he could ascertain there was a 25 per cent reduction in private transport.  In a situation when people are moving to public transport it is absolutely essential to try to encourage them.  Instead, the Government decided to increase fares by 15 to 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to encourage people to move away from using private cars and to use public transport.  How do we get people to move towards public transport?  We have to provide an efficient, comfortable and economic service.  The efficiency at <Col N="1908" /> times leaves a lot to be desired.  I use public transport quite a lot in travelling around the country and I find that the national train service runs very late at times.  Many of the trains are five, 10, 20 minutes and half an hour late.  This is a very serious matter and helps people to move away from using trains and buses. I can excuse buses travelling late and arriving late in Dublin but there is no excuse for trains on the main railway lines arriving late.  CIE will have to make certain that their trains run on time and if they are not on time the reason must be given.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that a comfortable service is provided.  Our trains and buses are not comfortable.  The trains in the winter are either too hot or too cold.  The heating system in even the largest of our trains appears to be inefficient and not working properly.  We must ensure that a sufficient amount of heating is provided in our trains.  Our trains must be properly cleaned.  CIE fall down in this respect.  We must ensure that the meals provided are reasonably priced and of good quality.  The standard of meals provided on our mainline trains is of reasonably good quality.  The people on those trains providing the meals work under difficult circumstances.  The services provided by CIE must be reasonably priced.</P>
    <P>I believe people were satisfied with the price charged by CIE but this latest increase of 15 to 20 per cent is enormous. If the fares had gone up by 3 per cent or 5 per cent there would have been a reaction from people who are regularly using public transport but it would not have been as bad as in the case of the present increases.  Many working men coming into Dublin every day and going around the country use buses or trains.  An increase of 5 per cent or 7 per cent would be in line with the proposed increase they are likely to get under the National Wage Agreement.  The present increase in CIE fares is far in excess of anything that they are likely to get under the National Wage Agreement.  People using public transport to get to and from work, those on small wages, those who will not be greatly affected by income tax allowances or by the abolition of car tax, will have to pay an increase of 15 <Col N="1909" /> per cent to 20 per cent in their fares. They will suffer a drop of approximately 10 per cent in their standard of living in regard to this item of expenditure.</P>
    <P>The people who are badly affected by the increase in CIE fares will probably decide they will not pay those increased fares and will decide to buy a car.  A large number of our cars are imported. The parts for them are also imported and every gallon of petrol those people use in their cars is imported.  All this affects our balance of payments.  The Government had a unique opportunity to encourage people to use public transport.</P>
    <P>We have a serious oil crisis and we must deplore the recent increases in CIE fares approved by the Government.  We call on the Government to provide the additional revenue so that people will not have to meet those increased fares.  The oil crisis will become worse if people move away from the use of public transport and use private transport.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> The Minister said that the aim of the Government was to reduce traffic congestion in Dublin city.  The Government, by allowing those further increases in public transport, will increase traffic congestion in Dublin city, Cork city, Limerick city and every reasonably sized town in the country.  People will depend less and less on public transport because if traffic congestion becomes any worse than it is the services will be running late and they will become less efficient.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be wise to withdraw the increases which have been granted to CIE.  He is hitting CIE too hard at the moment.  Mistakes were made in the past with regard to CIE. Some railway services coming into Dublin were closed down as well as many others throughout the country.  If those services were retained this would have helped.  I believe it is wrong to grant those huge increases to CIE and the House should deplore those increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>What concerns me regarding this section is that the Minister has not indicated that there is to be a change in the amount of grant payable. However, he says that he can make such a change by way of regulation but I do not regard that as satisfactory.  Any piece of legislation could be strung together by way of numerous meaningless phrases but that is not what Parliament is about.  Legislation should not involve backdoor politics.  It should involve a Minister coming before the House with proposals either for new legislation or to amend legislation.  This whole Bill seems to hinge on the Minister making changes later by way of regulation. This means that a regulation is laid before the House and that we have no option but to accept it.  I consider this to be a departure from parliamentary procedure.  Therefore, we must consider this whole matter seriously.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had indicated clearly that there would be a substantial increase in the grant, the situation would be different, but all he has said is that the level of grant would be reviewed.  That is meaningless, because anything can be reviewed at any time without any action being taken on it.  I accept that perhaps the Minister is controlled by other Minister in relation to any change in the grant, but we should have had a clear indication as to what is intended in this regard.  I am surprised that a Government with such a majority would use the tactic of making changes of this nature by way of regulation or by way of order. We should be very careful in this respect because we might be witnessing the first step in the diminution of democratic politics.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that, were we to allow this type of development now, it might be accepted practice for the future.  However, if the Minister is to proceed in this way he at least owes it to the House to state clearly the type of grant he has in mind.  The whole situation is vague so far.  Any proposal that involves a significant change should be brought before the House for debate and the Opposition given the opportunity of seeking to amend it.  Though at the end of the day the proposed amendments may be rejected by the Government, at least they would have been thrashed out in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only way to have good legislation is to give all sides of the House a part to play in the final form of that legislation. Usually useful and reasoned amendments from the Opposition are accepted <Col N="1913" /> by a Minister.  Earlier today the Minister accepted an amendment that was tabled by Deputy Fitzpatrick and I thought the Minister had put his name to it also in order to overcome a technicality. Because of the Government majority we would not have any opportunity of changing a regulation introduced by a Minister.  If the Minister is insisting on regulations he should give us his views on grants for new houses.  Instead of giving us his views he keeps telling us that the matter will be reviewed.  Have the Department any new ideas on grants for new houses in view of the escalating costs?  I am disappointed that the Minister has not given us his views on the matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quinn made a point about voluntary bodies like NABCo.  In view of the provisions of sections 12 and 45 of the Housing Act, 1966, relating to special assistance to voluntary bodies, and section 11 of this Bill concerning low-rise mortgages, the amendments recommended by Deputy Quinn are not necessary.  I assure him that my Department will continue to facilitate non-profit organisations in regard to multiple applications and prompt inspections.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien referred to the making of regulations and the changing of grant schemes by regulations.  It is not undemocratic to do so and the Bill provides for the making of such regulations from time to time.  I should like to remind Deputy O'Brien that changes were made in grants to handicapped persons in 1975.  In 1976 certain income restrictions were made by the then Government, and changes were made in 1977.  These changes were not even made by regulation; they were just announced. I should also like to point out to Deputy O'Brien that regulations will be placed before the House for 21 days and the House will have the power to annul them.  Any changes that are necessary can be made from time to time by way of regulation rather than by the introduction of a new Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The Minister should have referred to 1972, a year in which some changes were made.  Section 4 gives the Minister the power to make grants in respect of new houses.  So far he has not replied to our criticism of the present standard of housing grants.  I think I made the case clearly that the present grant of £1,000 is inadequate, having regard to the drastic increase in the cost of houses since 1977.  I have argued the matter in detail.  It is on the record of the House and I do not propose to argued the matter again.  However, the Minister should have replied to my contribution. If the Minister was treating the House seriously he would at least have given us his views on the present level of grants and he would have told us what his intentions were when he comes to fix the grant, as now he must under this section. He has brushed aside the contributions criticising the level of grants and he has brushed aside the debate.  Worse than that, he has told us that it is his intention to make a major speech on this topic.</P>
      <P>The Minister is seeking powers to make these grants but will not tell us whether he thinks the present grants are adequate, inadequate or excessive.  He will not even tell us whether he intends to increase the grants.  He is not treating the House as it should be treated, especially when he is asking for a blank cheque. When one asks for a blank cheque one usually gives an indication of what one intends to do with it.  The Minister may be fighting a losing battle with another Minister.  It may be that he is not a free agent or that he is making a case to the Government and awaiting the decision of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other day the building societies deferred for a month a decision on mortgage interest rates.  If they increase their interest rates, as people think they will, the position will worsen.  This section could have been passed long ago if the Minister had talked to us and told us what he thinks of the present housing grants.  He has not said they are adequate. I do not think he wants to go on record as a Minister for the Environment as saying that the present grants are adequate <Col N="1915" /> but he has not said that he proposes to increase them.  I can only conclude that he is in the stranglehold of the Minister for Finance or of the Government and that he is not a free agent.  We are entitled to know.  If this was the ordinary way of fixing the level of housing grants or housing subsidies, then it would not be so extraordinary but here we are invited for the first time, to depart from the traditional way of fixing house grants by legislation and to hand that authority over to the Minister to exercise by regulation.</P>
    <P>In no circumstances are we entitled to more generous treatment from the Minister than when dealing with housing grants.  But the House has been insulted and it comes very badly from a Government that can sit there smugly, at present at any rate, with 84 Deputies behind them to steamroll this through the House.  But that is all the more reason why, in the interest of democracy, we should have a more frank approach from the Minister and it is all the more reason why he should be prepared to discuss housing grants, because this is largely what this Bill is about and we cannot provoke the Minister to get up and discuss housing grants.  I suppose we will have a repetition of this when we move on to section 5 dealing with improvement grants.  I cannot put it any stronger than that.</P>
    <P>If we vote against the section it will be said that we are voting against housing grants.  But what grants are we voting against?  We do not know.  It is a section which is difficult to vote against because we are being told that it is providing for housing grants.  It is providing for unknown grants and if the Minister were even to say that he would be substantially increasing the grants then we would know where we were going but we are asked to vote blindfolded in favour of this Bill and to trust in the Minister's goodness and generosity.  It is not good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is saying that we are departing from the <Col N="1916" /> traditional system.  We are departing from the traditional system when we look at the years from 1973 to 1977. During that period private new house prices and earnings more than doubled. Grants were restricted during the same period.  Fewer people were able to get grants because of those restrictions. There was not a mention of a regulation. It was just done.</P>
      <P>This year, with regard to grants, provision was made for £30 million for new houses compared with less than £5 million in grants made available in 1977 by the National Coalition Government. That is certainly a departure from tradition. Under this Bill we are making provision to improve grants by regulation. The regulations will be placed before the House for 21 days and if Deputy Fitzpatrick or the House are dissatisfied with any changes contained in those regulations they are free to have them annulled by this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick can continue to criticise me because I will not disclose when we are going to make a further increase in grants available and because we have said it is under review and that in due course when increases are made it will be done by regulation placed before this House.  What was done during the period of the Coalition Government was done without even a semblance of a regulation but just an announcement of restrictions of existing grants.  That is the position as far as I am concerned. Regulations will be made and placed before this House.</P>

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> We are getting on with the debate now and if we prod the Minister <Col N="1918" /> on for another while we may get him to talk about grants.  At any rate the cost of houses has jumped dramatically since the Minister's grant was introduced.  But for many people it was not an increase of £1,000; for some people it was, but for many people it was much less.  That is the atmosphere in which we come in here with a Government which said in their manifesto that it would be easier to buy a house and cheaper to keep it.  The grants were fixed at 1977 price which are very nearly half of what they are now, and I cannot get the Minister to talk about housing grants.  I have provoked him into talking about house prices.  It is the Minister's fault and nobody else's if this debate is developing as it is developing because the Minister has made no effort to accommodate the House; he has made no effort to be frank with the House; he had made no effort to convey to the House his thinking or the thinking of his Government on housing grants and yet he expects to get this section through and he knows he can because of his majority.  That is a bad day for democracy and for Ireland and it is not a great day for the Minister and his party.</P>

      <P>This section is going to be agreed because the Minister has the guns, but in regard to his reference to the two points I made, I will have to check this out.  However, I accept in good faith the points that have been made by the Minister in relation to the two sections in the Housing Act, 1966.  I would prefer to see them amended and brought up to date should that be necessary.  Perhaps the passage of time between now and the autumn when we take the Report Stage of this Bill will enable us to look at it and we can deal with it then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important sections.  It deals with improvement grants.  It is not what it says but what it does not say that worries me and this side of the House.  In relation to:</P>
      <P>Regulations under this section may, in particular, but without prejudice to the generality of <i>subsection (1)</i> of this section, make provision in relation to all or any one or more of the following: </P>
      <P>(a) the amount of a grant,</P>
      <P>we must get back to the nitty gritty of the amount of grant.  Again we will have the old chestnut that this will be decided by way of regulation.  I am not satisfied about that.  I intend to challenge this right along the line.  It is not the way to do business. Unfortunately we are left with no alternative but to challenge it.</P>
      <P>The grant for the improvement of houses was £400 and was raised to £600.  There was a lot of ambiguity and sleight of hand done at that time.  The Department of the Environment is raising the grant to £600.  One who is contemplating house improvements will say &ldquo;that is £600 and we can get £200 from the local authority.  They will raise the ante and it will be another £600.  That is £1,200.&rdquo;  That is how it looked to the ordinary man in the street.  To me it appeared that we would get a grant of £1,200 but, when we looked at it, it was raised from £400 to £600.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A grant of £600 today is not a grant in the real sense to people contemplating a sizeable improvement on their homes. I would have thought that £1,200 was what would be contemplated but this was not so.  This is the gobbledegook which we had to bear with in the early days of this Government, the promises that they made before the last election, the lack of action on these promises since they came into office and the double talk which followed them.  If we speak about the amount of grant we must speak in terms of a meaningful grant.  We speak about requirements in <Col N="1920" /> relation to the suitability of the house concerned for improvement.  Surely any house that is in need of improvement should qualify for a grant.  We should not be speaking about suitability but if it is in need of repair or upkeep it behoves any Government to ensure that the grants are forthcoming.</P>
    <P>As regards occupation of the house, unless one is keeping livestock in the house I assume that a house is where people live and if they are or if it is set out in flats we should be able to pay grants.  These are conditions which impede people from getting grants. Regarding requirements in relation to the type and purpose of the improvement works, if one does a sizeable paint job on a house one is improving and preserving one's property.  One could look for a grant for that.</P>
    <P>If one gets a grant, one will not get another one for a number of years.  It is not a question of being able to nip in and claim a grant every other year.  I do not see why we have all these requirements and regulations.  We should give special consideration to housing in the inner city which is old stock and may be run down. There is an inter-departmental committee on inner city problems.  They could look at housing in the inner city and say: &ldquo;This is what we recommend for this; this is what is wanted&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As regards:</P>
    <P>(e)  requirements in relation to the financial and family circumstances of the person to whom the grant is paid, and</P>
    <P>(f)  requirements in relation to the payment of any other grant or subsidy in respect of the house under any enactment (including this Act). </P>
    <P>we are delving into the realm of what they have got.  Given the amount of money we are speaking about, to start putting on these constraints is niggling. If we can encourage people to improve their property, in the long term that is a very sound investment for the State. They will not always be there and the house will pass on in reasonably good condition.  Surely that is what we must be thinking about.  We must ensure that the housing stock is maintained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1921" /> In the centre of Amsterdam they get large grants for historical dwellings.  In Holland they also get income tax rebates for house improvements.  We should be thinking in terms of improving our city and making it a brighter and more pleasant place, instead of it being run down because people are not getting the type of assistance they require.  As time passes older people tend to live there.  There are constraints on those people and they are not getting the assistance they require. There is a vast area where flexibility is necessary.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (3) provides:</P>
    <P>A grant shall not be paid under this section unless the house the subject of the grant, upon completion of the works concerned, complies with such conditions, if any, as may be determined by the Minister from time to time for the purposes of this section in relation to standards of construction of houses and the provision of water, sewerage and other services therein. </P>
    <P>That goes without saying.  We are writing it in as a constraint.</P>
    <P>This morning I mentioned grants for rewiring houses.  We must take a long hard look at this and at grants in general, and not put a moratorium on when grants are available.  If essential works are necessary for health or safety, they must be carried out without having a moratorium of seven or ten years.  If a person gets a grant for rewiring he will not look for another grant for 20 years possibly.  In an older city many houses are in need of rewiring and maintenance. Because grants are not forthcoming, people put them on the long finger.  To date we have been fortunate in not having any major fire catastrophe.  We are living on borrowed time and on our luck if we carry on without rewiring.  A rewiring grant should be given to every householder the Department feel should qualify.  The Department can ask for an ESB report and no doubt it will be forthcoming.  If the ESB say the owners should have their houses rewired they should automatically qualify for a grant.</P>
    <P>We saw advertisements in the papers about converting to solid fuel heating. The impression I got was that there was <Col N="1922" /> no problem, that the grant would be forthcoming, and that it was independent of any other grant in the previous year.  Now it appears that is not so.  It appears that if you got a grant two years ago you would not get one now.  I thought the type of advertising I saw was dishonest.  This is the type of information which comes out from the Department and misleads public representatives.</P>
    <P>This new grant will have constraints on it.  The Minister has promised to make a statement.  He should be quite clear in his mind as to exactly what he intends to do.  It seems to me that he is the servant of others and has to wait on their decision.  The Minister should be able to stand up here tonight or tomorrow morning and say, &ldquo;This is the situation vis-à-vis this particular grant and this is how it will operate.  I will do this, and this is what will happen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago there were advertisements in the paper.  The Minister should know exactly where he stands once an advertisement appears in the papers. There should be no ambiguity, but there is ambiguity and the Minister wants more time.  He is either master of his own Department or he is not.  If he is master of his own Department, and this statement appeared in the public press a couple of weeks ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants are relevant. It appears there has been an about turn on this issue.  We should look at the problem in relation to giving grants for certain work in houses.  For example, wiring has caused problems in many houses and we are all aware that serious accidents can occur if wiring is not attended to.  We know that such work is put off by many people because grants are not available for it.  I thought grants would be made available for the installation of solid fuel central heating but we must await the passage of this legislation before we know the Minister's attitude in this regard.  The fact that we must await the passage of this legislation baffles me because the Minister is the person with the responsibility for grants.  The Minister should make that statement before we conclude this debate so that <Col N="1924" /> we can be given an opportunity of tabling amendments for Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to raise the question of grants for housing trusts.  I am aware that certain facilities are available for such trusts but we must bear in mind that in cases up to 500 flats are cared for by those organisations.  I am aware of a housing trust in my area who were given an estimate of £38,000 to do some paintwork.  That trust deferred doing that because they were not in a position to pay the money.  A great majority of the flats under the control of that trust are subject to controlled rents with the result that the rents cannot be increased. However, the trust are anxious to preserve that property.  In such cases it should be possible to obtain substantial grants from such funds to maintain that property.  The trust concerned provide good housing and it is ridiculous to talk about giving them £600 towards the cost of redecorating.  We should be thinking of giving the people who occupy those flats their own toilets, a bath or shower. At present they must use common toilets and do not have any baths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection we must always bear in mind what it would cost to replace such housing.  The cost would be astronomical.  The trust I am concerned about is a non-profit making body but it can no longer survive without State help. I should also like to mention a hostel for men in my area.  Some years ago this hostel was threatened with closure but as a result of representation made by local public representatives Dublin Corporation made a grant available to allow it continue in operation.  That hostel could be made into a reasonable home for such men.  However, work cannot be carried out there without the aid of a substanial grant from the Department. Those who reside in that hostel if the building was closed down tomorrow would have to be housed by the local authority or the State.  The voluntary organisation responsible for the running of it, like all voluntary concerns, do not get the support they deserve from the State.  It is time we ensured that voluntary concerns are given all the support and help they need.  There is no difficulty about checking the accounts of such concerns.  I hope this is not left to the last <Col N="1925" /> minute because too often the last minute is too late.</P>
    <P>Section 5 does not deal adequately with the question of grants.  A £600 grant is no good in developing rundown housing stock.  The development of local authority houses and flats is a good type of investment but we do not seem to realise that.  I must ask the Minister to be flexible and generous in this instance.  By doing so we will be acting in a prudent manner and we will get a good financial return for our money.  We will not have to spend such large amounts of money on developing and building on virgin land.  We should develop our existing housing stock so that people can live in decent accommodation.  We are talking about conserving housing stock but we tend not to look at the amount of money we pay out.  We think nothing of handing out £14,000 for a new dwelling but we will not spend £2,000 to rehabilitate an old dwelling.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at this whole area and to exercise prudent generosity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> This section allows the Minister to make grants to persons carrying out improvement works on a house.  In section 1 improvement works are defined as including:</P>
      <P>...the provision and installation of a private water supply or private sewerage facilities in the house and any works carried out to the house (whether for the purpose of extending, enlarging, improving, repairing or converting it) that, in the opinion of the Minister, are reasonably necessary for the purpose of rendering the house more suitable for human habitation, but does not include decoration; </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may make a grant for improvement works within that defination. When we were discussing the defination section we invited the Minister to enlarge on that definition by including energy conservation works.  The Minister took the view that an amendment was not necessary and that the definition was wide enough to cover energy conservation works or improvements.  I am concerned that the Minister is not obliged to <Col N="1926" /> make a grant for improvement works. The Minister may make a grant for such works but he or his successor might make the case that he was only bound to give the grants spelled out in the definition section.  It is important that we at least know the Minister's thinking on the improvement works in respect of which he intends to make a grant.</P>
    <P>On section 1 the Minister stated, when pressed, that he proposed to make a statement in regard to this matter in the near future.  When questioned as to whether he would make a statement before the Report Stage of the Bill he stated that perhaps he would but that, if he did not, he might make it in the Seanad.  In view of the Minister's attitude to new house grants in section 4 I must again complain that this is not the way to treat a house in relation to section 5.</P>
    <P>The Minister says in relation to the definition of improvement works that there has been so much talk about it and so many inquiries that he intends to clarify the position in a few days.  I am again coerced into saying that there is no better place in which to clarify the position than in the Dáil during the debate on section 5, which deals precisely with improvement works.  I hope the Minister will see fit to tell us what he means by improvement works, because for the time being his opinion is important in relation to the passage of this Bill.  If the Minister is asking the authority of the House to regulate housing grants by regulations he should be forthcoming with the House and should tell us exactly what he understands by improvement works.  Various statements have been made about them.  We understood that, for example, a person who wanted to install a fireplace in a house would get a grant irrespective of whether he had received another grant for reconstruction work in the recent past.  The Minister should tell us whether that is still the position and should clarify the position in general in regard to conservation works on a house.  That is the least we can expect.</P>
    <P>This section also enables the Minister to fix the amount of an improvement works grant.  When the Minister took office the grant was £400, £200 payable <Col N="1927" /> by the State and £200 payable by the housing authority.  Admittedly at the time there was some form of means test in the form of valuations which excluded large houses.  The Minister has increased that grant by 50 per cent.  The maximum improvement works grant is now £600. The £200 payable by the housing authority was abolished; therefore the net increase was £200.  I invite the Minister to agree that a grant of £400 for reconstruction on 5 July 1977 was much more valuable than a grant of £600 would be now.  The cost of improvement works and reconstruction has increased by more than 50 per cent since 1977.</P>
    <P>I share the views expressed by Deputy O'Brien that people should be encouraged to undertake reconstruction or improvement works.  In so doing we are improving our housing stock, prolonging its life, resulting in less money being spent on new houses in these difficult times.  I should like the Minister to comment on that.  I invite him also to tell us what are his proposals in regard to the maximum amount of the improvement works grant, he proposes fixing under section 5 (2) (a).</P>
    <P>I believe that the Minister abolished such means tests as were operative in regard to reconstruction grants when he assumed office.  I note that in this section, as in section 4, he is assuming the necessary authority to re-impose a means test for these grants.  I wonder why he is doing so, when he intends to do so and what is his thinking on it.  The House is entitled to a clear statement from the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that the Minister is skating round the edges and hedging from a candid debate on grants in general.  Certainly he hedged and refused to be drawn into any debate on new house grants, something about which I was very disappointed.  The Minister did himself less than justice in that respect when he refused point blank to be drawn into a discussion on new housing grants.  On this section&mdash;dealing with improvement works grants&mdash;I want him to tell us what he thinks about the <Col N="1928" /> present rate of grants which have been increased by only 50 per cent since he assumed office.  I want to know if he intends increasing those grants further and, if so, to what extent.  I want to be told by the Minister what exactly he has in mind in regard to the means test for which he is paving the way in paragraph (e) of subsection (2).</P>
    <P>I should be glad to hear the Minister comment on all of those points that occur to me under this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien asked me to be flexible, generous and prudent. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a flexible, legal framework within which we can change grant schemes by regulations which will be before this House for 21 days and be annulled if the House so decides.  This Bill takes us away from the rigid conditions which could be set out in legislation and makes provision for flexbility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to being generous, as Deputy O'Brien asked me to be, I am sure he appreciates that a very generous scheme of grants for house improvements, installation of piped water and sewerage services, the adaptation of houses for physically handicapped or severely mentally-handicapped persons, was introduced by this Government in 1977.  In January 1977 reconstruction grants had been restricted to houses with low valuations.  It is incorrect to say that the reconstruction or improvement grants were increased only from £400 to £600 at the end of that year.  The valuation restrictions ensured that very many people got only the £200 Department grant; they did not get the supplementary grant.  These valuation limits were so restrictive that if one lived in the countryside outside an urban or corporation area, provided the valuation of one's house was over £10&mdash;which is not an excessive valuation by any standard &mdash;one did not get a supplementary grant or a State grant from 1 January 1977. With regard to the restriction in urban districts the valuation limit was £15 which, in such an area, is not an excessively high one.  In a county borough, such as Dublin or Cork, it was £20. Therefore, very many people did not get <Col N="1929" /> any reconstruction grants.  Since the end of 1977 they all qualify for the £600 based on a valuation of £90 or over. Surely that was treating people very generously.</P>
    <P>I have explained already the flexibility of the provisions of this Bill to deal with such matters by regulations instead of making announcements, restricting eligibility, and making them available to fewer people, such as happened on 1 January 1977.</P>
    <P>In regard to expenditure on these improvement grants, I might say that in 1977 barely £2 million was expended. The new scheme of grants about which we have been talking&mdash;the £600 scheme&mdash;is so popular that the total expenditure this year will amount to approximately £17 million.  A total of 37,550 applications for these improvement grants were submitted to my Department in 1978.  This proves that the people who are availing of them consider them to be reasonably generous when it is borne in mind that most of them had no grants at all available to them for improvements after 1 January 1977 until we came into office.  Indeed the lucky people who came under the £10 valuation&mdash;for instance, in rural areas&mdash;got the £200, plus a further £200 under the supplementary scheme.</P>
    <P>More than once today reference was made to the question of energy conservation. This Bill enables me to make a grant available for energy conservation. In future the principal features of grant schemes will be set out by way of regulation which will be before this House for 21 days.  That is more satisfactory than the changes announced since 1972, if we must go back to then.  All the changes since 1972 were announced without any Bill or regulations.  Deputies Fitzpatrick and O'Brien should get away from this bluffing exercise in which they seem to be engaging.  This is a fairer and more democratic system of implementing the changes that will come about from time to time for the improvement of the grants schemes.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat also that I intend making a definitive statement on grants for energy conservation for housing within a few days.  Let me say <Col N="1930" /> categorically that the details of the statement have not been finalised as yet but will be in a day or two, when I shall make the announcement.  Deputy Fitzpatrick remarked on the fact that I would not do so during the course of discussion on this Bill.  Whether I do so here or in the Senate will be dependent on the duration of this debate.</P>
    <P>Apart from the house improvement grants other vastly improved grants were made available.  For example, before the end of 1977 a sewerage grant amounted to £25 and a water installation grant amounted to £100.  Since then the sewerage grant has been increased to £150 and the water installation grant to £200, a total of £350.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is correct. Deputy O'Brien spoke about the inner city.  I will deal with that under amendment No. 18 which covers specific areas. He also spoke about the limitation period between grants.  Up to the end of 1977 it was 15 years and since then it has been reduced to ten years.</P>
      <P>With regard to the accusation of advertising, I did not advertise anything about conservation grants.  I answered parliamentary questions in this House on 14 June after the European and local elections, but I can assure the Deputy that within a matter of days an advertisement will appear to ensure that people will know exactly who is entitled to these conservation grants and the amounts they are entitled to.</P>
      <P>Any changes made in the new house grants will be improvements on the present system, not a limitation of the existing system as we had on 1 January 1977.  When these improvements are made by regulation, that regulation will be before before this House for 21 days to be annulled if the House so decides. These changes will not just be the subject of statements being issued; they will be done under this legislation by way of regulation.</P>

      <P>A number of points come under this section.  Let us deal with the principle of grants generally and try to clarify some of the points raised.  Again we are talking about enacting legislation rather than a specific grant scheme. During the Second Stage debate the Minister may recall that I raised the whole question of conservation grants generally and specific renovation grants for certain areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to his own amendment on section 14 but this is the section which deals with this matter. However, if the Minister wants to defer discussion of this matter until section 14, that is all right.  Is the Minister in a position tonight to talk about such a scheme of grants?  Is he in a position to refer to section 5 (3) which states:</P>
      <P>... the works concerned, complies with such conditions, if any, as may be determined by the Minister from time to time for the purposes of this section in relation to standards of construction of houses and the provision of water, sewerage and other services therein. </P>
      <P>The reality is that unless the Minister can clarify that position precisely, because of existing bye-laws, any programme of renovation or conservation in the urban areas where it is required, particularly in the county borough of Dublin, would be negated. This would apply to any grant scheme that might be introduced, for example, to refurbish houses in Deputy O'Brien's constituency in the inner city.</P>
      <P>To qualify for a grant, would standards and conditions of completion of construction work be independent of building bye-law regulations in a particular instance?  I am not talking about the old bye-laws, I am talking about the new building regulations because the bye-laws are no longer in operation since 1 July.  If one wants to use the UK system of standards of refurbishing, who will be involved in consultations in determining what the five or ten point standards will be?  Perhaps the Minister could deal with this technicality, because we are dealing with enabling legislation in this section.</P>

      <P>Improvement grants relate to section 5 and generally do not have anything to do with building regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Normal practice is that in order to qualify for any of these grants one must get bye-law permission.  I am speaking specifically from Dublin experience where there were bye-law regulations and there are now national building regulations.  Frequently someone who does not need planning permission to get a grant will not get bye-law permission.  The administration of bye-law permission in Dublin Corporation is extremely cumbersome and very slow and is often hit and miss, a bit like the CRV system.  Therefore, it can be very difficult and frustrating for the ordinary person to get a simple grant to build a bathroom or kitchen extension.</P>
      <P>I am asking these questions in the context of the general question I raised about the system of rehabilitation grants for older house.  How does the Minister propose to apply section 5 (3) to such a system, on the assumption that he has such a system of grants in mind?  Maybe I am taking too much for granted. Perhaps I should ask the Minister if he is in a position at this stage to comment specifically on the matters I raised on the Second Stage dealing with rehabilitation grants and, specifically if he is in a position to positively respond to the suggestion made by the joint housing conference sponsored by the Department and the RIAI?  I am not thinking of this solely from a Dublin point of view but having regard to the fact that a study was carried out in Waterford.</P>
      <P>Presumably the conditions of the grants will apply under section 5.  The non-generality of it would be picked up under section 14 because it would be confined to certain areas.  Will the conditions of construction standards be independent of building bye-law regulations?</P>

      <P>When I asked the Minister to be generous he said that when we were in government we were less than generous.  If one carried out a cost analysis on the value of the relative moneys at that time one would say it was not generous.  I am not making any case for what happened.  I did not agree with certain regulations, but £600 for a grant is not being generous in this day and age.  If the Minister believes that that is generous, heaven help us for the future of housing stock in this city.  If we have to depend on this kind of benevolence or lack of it for housing then we are all in trouble.</P>
      <P>The Minister made the point that by regulation all that can happen is improvement. If he goes back to when we moved an amendment to ensure that there would be no means test after this Bill would be passed, he will remember that he rejected that amendment.  All the Minister has in view is a means test for this £1,000 grant.  I am not convinced that &ldquo;by regulation&rdquo; is the way to do anything.  If the Minister wants to announce some goodies or an improvement of grants he does not have to do it by regulation.  He can state at some after-dinner party or political function that he is giving an additional increase in the grant or whatever he is giving.</P>
      <P>The idea of regulation is subterfuge to bring in legislation here that he knows he would not get before the House easily.  If it is laid before the House it can be annulled or passed.  With the situation here it will not be annulled if that side of the House want it to be passed, but it does not give this side of the House the opportunity to make amendments.  When the Minister stands up here and makes magnanimous gestures saying that all that he can do is improve the lot of people, one is more than suspicious of it.  I am suspicious of it.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that the idea of regulation is to get stuff in that would not normally get through the House.  To announce good news is done easily enough and everybody accepts it.  The idea of this is not to introduce good news, as I said earlier in this section.  That is not the good news. The Minister is being a bit naive when he is trying to pull the wool over our eyes, saying that all he wants to do by regulation is to introduce good news.  We cannot accept that.  I am not prepared to accept it and I will challenge it right through the whole legislation.  It is not what we want.  If the Minister puts it down by regulation he is not giving this side of the house the opportunity to debate it.  If it is good news, as he said it was, why not bring it before this House? We would welcome good news any day of the week.  This side of the House will support any increases in grants.  As an Opposition we might advocate a little more&mdash;that would be right and natural&mdash;but we would welcome it.  Do not be afraid, if he brings in good news to us we will not throw it back in his face.  We will be kind and generous to him.  But that is not what is going to happen, unfortunately.  I regret that what will happen is that the little bits will be slipped in here and there.</P>

      <P>You, Sir, were giving me a little help a few moments ago.  I must reject the Minister's point when he said he was bringing in this good news. If I could believe that, I would love it and accept it, but I cannot and the Minister knows it is not true.  It is like &ldquo;by order&rdquo;.  Anything like that is done only to limit debate and the powers of this Parliament, and that is regrettable.  I have said it today, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will say that I am repetitive, but what we are being repetitive about is very important.  We on this side of the House must be careful and watch <Col N="1936" /> legislation going through.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick said earlier today, we were thrown a pile of legislation a couple of weeks ago to get through in three or four days.  If we were naive and a bad Opposition not terribly concerned about the welfare of the people who put us here, we would have parcelled it all up and gone on our holidays two weeks ago. Because we are a responsible Opposition concerned about welfare we want to examine it and it is imperative that we examine line by line this very contentious legislation.  We have not even started into it yet.  We are not even at the tapes, as it were.  When we come to the controversial stuff the balloon will go up and one will see red faces&mdash;not on this side of the House but on the far side and the benevolent brothers will be running from them.

        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Since you, Sir, came into the Chair you have complained about repetition.  There has been a certain amount of repetition in this debate.  Section after section, the Minister has refused repeatedly to discuss the Bill or to discuss housing grants for new houses or reconstruction, which is what this Bill is all about.  That is why this debate has become so difficult.  It is not possible to have a meaningful debate with the Minister in his present frame of mind. He disagreed with me when I said that housing reconstruction grants have improved by 50 per cent since he came into office.  In support of that contention he said that there was a means test on housing reconstruction grants down to £10 valuation throughout the country, £15 in urban areas and £20 in county boroughs.  He has increased the grant from £400 to £600 for people who previously qualified for the full grant and to people who did not receive a grant at all he is giving £600.  It is correct to say that the very well off have fared better <Col N="1937" /> under this Minister.

      <P>Faoi mar atá ráite agam cheana, tá beartaithe agam an chéad toghchán d'Údarás na Gaeltachta a chur ar siúl roimh dheireadh na bliana seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é an cuspóir atá agam ná go mbeidh an toghchán ann i mí na Nollag agus go mbunófar an tUdarás i dtús na bliana seo chugainn.  Dá réir sin tá fógra maith á thabhairt agam anois d'iarrthóirí sa toghchán.  Sula bhféadfar dul ar aghaidh leis na socruithe don toghchán, áfach, beidh rialacháin le déanamh agam. Leagfaidh mé dréacht de na rialacháin sin faoi bhráid gach Tí den Oireachtas <Col N="1812" /> agus iarrfaidh mé ar gach Teach rún a rith ag ceadú an dréachta.  Cé nach bhfuil sé riachtanach an dréacht a leagan faoi bhráid na Dála roimh shos an tsamhraidh, bhí dóchas agam go bhféadfainn é sin a dhéanamh ach níl sé ullamh go fóill.</P>
    <P>Is amhlaidh ba mhian leis an Dréachtóir Parlaiminte go bhfaighfí comhairle ó shaineolaithe sa Roinn Comhshaoil sula nglanfadh sé an dréacht.  Le tamall anuas bhí brú mór oibre ar na saineolaithe sin leis na socruithe do na toghcháin áitiúla, an toghchán do Thionól na hEorpa agus na reifrinn agus ní raibh deis acu comhairle a thabhairt chomh tapaidh agus ba mhaith linn uile.  Ní miste a lua nach bhfuil aon fhreagracht ar an Aire Comhshaoil sa ghnó seo.</P>
    <P>A luaithe a thiocfaidh an Dáil le chéile tar éis an tsamhraidh beidh mé ag súil le comhoibriú ó Theachtaí chun an rún cuí a rith.</P>

Offaly County Council sought approval to payment not of a gratuity but of a formal annual allowance for this officer.  This was refused by my Department as annual allowances for this type of work are allowed only where the officer in question holds a specific office for the discharge of these duties.  The local authority were informed, however, that it was open to them to submit a proposal for payment of a gratuity in this case.  To date no such proposal has been submitted to my Department.

      <P>In 1974 the then manager of Longford and Cadamstown National Schools indicated that there was full agreement to the closure of these schools and their amalgamation with a suitably extended school in Kinnitty.  Plans for the extension and adaptation of the school at Kinnitty have been submitted and a grant towards the cost has been sanctioned. Plans for the amalgamation have now reached an advanced stage and it does <Col N="1826" /> not appear that any useful purpose would be served by further consultation.</P>
