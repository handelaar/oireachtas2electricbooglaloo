    <P>
      <Col N="1349" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That the Minister for Agriculture be authorised to charge and levy and have paid to him a levy as respects&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  milk received from a herd for processing,</P>
    <P>(b)  any bovine animal which is slaughtered, and</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion proposes a levy on milk received from a herd for processing and a levy of £3 for any bovine animal which is slaughtered and any bovine animal exported from the State.  This is an unfair and iniquitous form of taxation.  This form of taxation does not take into account the ability of the farmer to pay it, especially the small farmer.  In that regard I consider it to be most unfair and unjust. This tax could be imposed on a small farmer with ten or 12 acres of land, a man with eight or ten children, a man with only four or five cattle for sale.  A small farmer in the west entitled to the dole could find himself with very little money after paying this tax.  I have heard Deputy Killilea raving and ranting about the small farmer being the backbone of the country.  Does the Deputy think it right that the Minister should impose this type of taxation on the small farmer?  He knows that cattle paid badly because of the harsh winter and that £3 could be 50 per cent of the profit of a small farmer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that last winter was very harsh and that farmers had to feed cattle for the whole year.  If the Deputy knows anything about farming he knows as well as I do that £3 could be 50 per cent of the profit of a small farmer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>This tax could also be unjust as far as the consumer is concerned. I believe in one broadly based tax, such as income tax, which takes into consideration the ability of the farmer to pay.  That tax cannot be argued against. We would have to admit that it was a fair and just tax and the farmers are prepared to pay their fair part of taxation. When, under Deputy Clinton as Minister for Agriculture, we increased farmers' income from £250 million to £790 million in six years we had no hesitation in imposing tax on farmers over £75 valuation; we imposed a national figure of £60.  Members of the party now in power went around before the last general election and told people that if elected they would scrap the income tax for farmers, that they were the farmers' friends.  Many farmers fell for those false promises.  Now instead of paying one tax as they were then paying they are being called upon to pay five or six taxes altogether.  The subsidy has been removed from rates; farmers down as low as £40 valuation are being brought into the tax net.  The notional figure has been increased to £125; the subsidy has been taken off artificial manure; we have the 2 per cent levy and the Government are talking about a £15 per acre resource tax.</P>
      <P>A Fianna Fáil county councillor and member of the Westmeath County Committee of Agriculture proposed a resolution two months ago condemning this and blaming some of the new Dublin-based economists who had come into the Fianna Fáil party for imposing it on the Cabinet.  The Minister may smile but those were the words used at a meeting of the Westmeath County Committee of Agriculture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister means; I am talking about some of the newly-found city economists who claim to know all about agriculture and who introduced this type of taxation and forced it on the Cabinet.  I do not know if the Minister supported it but we are surprised that he did not object to it. He does not seem to have done that.  The 2 per cent tax and the £3 per head on cattle, especially if demand exceeds supply on the home market, may very well have to be paid by the consumers.  That is unfair and unjust.  I should like the Minister to tell us if the consumers will not have to pay this tax as they seem to be paying the 2 per cent levy in many cases at present.  There is no use in the Minister telling us the consumer has not to pay the levy; it is the Minister's duty to tell us how he will ensure that it will be collected from the farmers and not passed on to the consumers who are being fleeced every day by rising prices imposed by a Government that promised to reduce the cost of living.  The chickens are now coming home to roost.</P>
      <P>Another very objectionable feature of the implication of this levy of .5p per gallon on milk and £3 in the case of an animal is that when taxation is once imposed it can be increased by any Government by order without further legislation.  There is nothing to stop the Minister or any future Government from increasing the milk levy which now stands at .5p to 2p, 3p or even 5p.  There is nothing to stop the Minister without coming to the House from increasing the £3 per head envisaged in this motion to £5 or £10 at the whim of the Government. I should not be surprised if the Government who jailed the dairy farmers a few years ago when they dared to march outside the gates of Leinster House to demand their rights, and who left them for three weeks outside in Merrion Square when the Minister refused even to meet them, would double or even treble those levies if there was a shortage of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A most alarming feature of the levy of £3 per beast is that the £3 has to be paid <Col N="1352" /> whether the farmer has ten or 100 cattle, ten acres or 100 acres, whether he has a £10 valuation of a £1,000 valuation.  The most unjust part of all is it must be paid whether he makes a profit or not.  The cattle feeding and exporting industry is important to our stability and future prosperity.  The Minister knows well that cattle feeders are going through a hard period.  Their profits are small enough without the imposition of £3 per head on their animals.</P>
    <P>We are not told how long the levies will remain.  We all hope that brucellosis and TB will be eliminated in the next four or five years but it may take longer&mdash;I hope not.  If that happens will the levy still remain?  We are entitled to know this from a Minister and a Government who shed crocodile tears for the farmers when we imposed what I still believe to be a fair system of taxation in 1974.  I am surprised that the Minister, who is a farmer, should allow the farmers to be fleeced and persecuted as they will be by those levies.  Did the Minister oppose them in the Cabinet?  Is he in favour of those increased taxes that I have mentioned?  He seems to be.  I am surprised.  A few months ago the Minister suddenly discovered that he had a conscience and he threatened to resign over a particular Bill then going through the House.  Another man suddenly found that overnight he was able to give him absolution.  He did that and the Minister got out of his difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>It is relevant in that the Minister is Minister for Agriculture. His first allegiance should be to the farmers of Ireland.  I am surprised that he did not threaten to resign when those taxes were being imposed.  I am surprised that his conscience is not pricking him.  We would like to know if he is in favour of this tax, or was it forced through the Cabinet by urban-minded Ministers who have no regard for agriculture and especially for the small farmers?  We are entitled to know that, because his first allegiance should be to the farmers of Ireland.  I should like to see his conscience pricking him again in <Col N="1353" /> this regard, and I should like to see him threatening to resign and do something for the small farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion proposes to authorise the collection of a levy in respect of milk received from a herd for processing and so on. Everybody agrees we must try to eradicate animal disease.  In 1957, 22 years ago, we started to try to get our herds free of TB and brucellosis.  We have expended a great deal of State money since then, well over £100 million of the taxpayers' money, I understand, with a view to achieving that objective. Unfortunately, our efforts have not been too successful, and a sizeable number of herds scattered throughout the country are affected by both TB and brucellosis. We all agree that efforts should be continued with a view to achieving our ultimate objective of TB and brucellosis free herds.  We all appreciate that in the light of our commitment to the EEC it is mandatory on us to do so.</P>
      <P>This motion proposes for the first time that farmers should pay a levy on milk, animals slaughtered, and animals exported, to bring in an initial figure of £10 million over a 12 month period.  That may seem quite all right, but it was not set down in the Fianna Fáil policy before the 1977 General Election.  In the manifesto, which is the gospel of the Minister's party, there is no suggestion that it was proposed to extract a levy from milk producers to meet the cost of eliminating animal disease and a charge per head on animals slaughtered or exported. On that basis I am opposed to the motion, even though I am well aware of the burden which has been placed on the taxpaying community by eradication measures over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why do I oppose a levy which would seem small and not very significant to large producers but which would seem significant to small farmers such as those mentioned by Deputy L'Estrange, small farmers with relatively small incomes particularly on the western and south western seaboard?  I do so because of the overall policy of the Government. In 1977, to gain public favour and to buy votes, Fianna Fáil promised to dismantle a tax which is payable in almost <Col N="1354" /> every country and which has been payable here since the foundation of the State, I understand.  They promised to remove car tax, a very popular measure, to buy votes in the 1977 election.  I mention that because it has a bearing on what a particular section of the community are being asked to bear in this motion.</P>
    <P>During my time in this House I never heard any Deputy from any party proposing the abolition of that tax.  It was purely a gimmick thought up by the planning department of the Fianna Fáil Party, known as the think-tank, in order to buy votes.  We all know the chaotic conditions which obtain at present and have obtained during the past months. Those conditions arise directly from Government policy subsequent to the 1977 election.  People were told then that another traditional payment by the public at large, rates on domestic dwellings, would be wiped out.  That was another item which found favour with the general public.  I can appreciate that a person living in Dublin city or county in a sizeable house with a valuation of more than £100 would save £1,200 or £1,300 rates, on that house.  Such people were not clamouring for the abolition of rates, but Fianna Fáil, in furtherance of their endeavours to get back into office, offered them that abolition if they voted for Fianna Fáil.  A second means of getting money was wiped out to secure the return to office of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Then we had the abolition of the wealth tax, which was supposed to hinder development, not only to buy votes but to get the necessary financial support from the people who would benefit to enable Fianna Fáil to conduct the 1977 election campaign and to provide the present Taoiseach with his helicopter and other trimmings to travel around the State and put forward the policy in the manifesto.  Then we had the rumpus about the co-op tax which many people felt was a fair and justifiable measure.  The co-operative groups engaged in ordinary activities and covered a wide sales system.  They had an advantage in competition with private enterprise.  Fianna Fáil wiped out all <Col N="1355" /> those things with a consequent loss to the State of a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>We are now trying to find money elsewhere.  Hence this as a part measure to obtain £10 million.  I understood from the Minister's contributions during the time of the Coalition that farmers should be allowed time to develop, that they had only got on their feet in the seventies and to impose additional burdens on them would stifle incentive.</P>
    <P>Statements made by a number of Government Deputies during the general election on farm taxation implied that if the Government were changed and the Coalition removed from office farm taxation would cease to exist.  That promise has not been honoured.  Accounts must be kept by farmers with valuations of more than £40 to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners in regard to their earnings. That would have been all right if it had been included in the manifesto. Many people feel that no group or person should be immune from having their income examined by the Revenue Commissioners.  There is an obligation on everyone to pay funds by way of taxation to the central authority.  That fact was cloaked in discussions we had when farm taxation was introduced.  I recollect public pronouncements made outside the House by the Minister, in an effort to curry favour with farmers, that Fianna Fáil did not believe in such a system of raising funds.  We have had much unrest during the past six months.  We have had no post or telephones.  Yesterday we had a situation where electricity was cut off in many homes&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this measure because it was not set down in the manifesto.  It is an undercover method of obtaining £10 million for the first 12 months.  When turnover tax was introduced it was at 2½ per cent.  Its name was changed to value-added tax and it is now ranging from 10 to 40 per cent.  The £3 per animal and 0.5p per gallon of milk can be increased in the same way as other taxes were.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this measure indicates that the Government may by trying to placate urban dwellers by imposing four types of taxation on farmers. We have the 2 per cent levy for approval, the taxation embodied in item No. 10 for approval, the taxation system on farmers with valuations of more than £40, where it is mandatory to have factual accounts because the notional system is to be abolished, and we have the £3.50 per £ land valuation for farmers in the £70 valuation upwards range.  It is no harm to let farmers know&mdash;farmers who were indignant at the way the National Coalition brought farmers in excess of £70 valuation upwards the tax net and who supported Fianna Fáil&mdash;where they now stand with their saviours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the recent EEC election, which was the first time people had an opportunity of showing whether they were satisfied or dissatisfied with the Government, they gave only 33 per cent of membership of the European Assembly to the Government.  It is evident that the Government's policy to abolish the traditional contributions towards the Exchequer helped Fianna Fáil on the road to victory.  However, alternative methods and some difficult injections will have to be made to extract the money required <Col N="1357" /> for public administration.  Money does not come from heaven; we must get it from the people.  If we do not, we must borrow it.  Our borrowing has reached a limit which is frightening.  That is evident to the Minister, who regards himself as the champion of farmers, big and small, when he has to bring in a motion asking for a fourth levy to be imposed on the farming community whether the farmer resides on the Berehaven Peninsula and has four cows or resides in County Kilkenny and has 100 cows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamOBrien1977" hpid="Mr. W. O'Brien Mr. W. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what section of the community we come from, and whether we represent city constituencies or rural constituencies, we are all agreed that agriculture plays a major role in our economy.  Having accepted that and being conscious of it we must make sure that no disincentive is brought in to impede the progress of this industry.  The present levies will create a disincentive.  There is a still greater danger that the present levies may be increased each year and create a greater disincentive.</P>
      <P>The farming community in general and the ratepayers have, in the past two years, been the victims of the present Government's legislation.  The question of domestic rates may not be relevant to this debate but it is relevant to what I am going to say.  When domestic rates were abolished we were informed by the Minister for the Environment that the ceiling on the rates was introduced so as to make sure that the people who did not derive the benefits of the abolition of domestic rates would not be the victims of increased rates.  And what happened? The agricultural sector here at the moment are subsidising domestic dwellings. I agree entirely with having the domestic rates abolished because it was something which people found very hard to meet, particularly people with limited incomes. We had introduced the same scheme starting off with a 25 per cent reduction but that was to be met by revenue and not taken in from other sections of the community.  It is only fair to say that the agricultural sector is the victim today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to farm taxation.  Two years ago our policy on farm taxation was being criticised.  The farmers were <Col N="1358" /> told that taxation would be not only modified but abolished completely. What has happened?  Valuations have been brought down and as a result the multiplier has increased and so more farmers are now in the tax net than ever before.  This, no doubt, is going to have an adverse effect on agriculture.  I remember a time when people speaking of agriculture thought in terms of farmers.  That day is over.  The recent elections, and particularly the European election contest, proved that the interest in agriculture is not confined to the farmers, their wives and their families. The spin off from agriculture is recognised.  There is an awareness by the workers here of the importance of such spin off industries from agriculture.  That makes me very fearful that such levies will result in unemployment and more people will be on the dole.</P>
    <P>I know it is often argued, particularly by urban people, that great wealth and great incomes are received by the agricultural sector.  But at present, when everything is taken into consideration, the farmers' income is not up to what it should be.  I cannot understand why a rural Minister would place his Deputies&mdash;the people who went around preaching and telling the farmers two years ago that taxation was introduced because of the social element that was then in Government&mdash;in the position of having to go out to canvas and ask the people to forget what they told them at that time.  I know what they told the people this time when they went to the doors.  They told them that it was not their fault.  They told them that the policy of taxation was introduced by the Minister, Professor Martin O'Donoghue, and they promised the people at that stage that he would go.  It is no consolation to the people of rural Ireland to be told that Deputy O'Donoghue will go after taxation has come in.  That is no use to the people.</P>
    <P>The Government are not popular and the Minister is not popular and I sincerely ask him to think seriously before he introduces such levies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>First it must be stated that we are here this morning passing this motion because of the failure of the <Col N="1359" /> Government to come up with an equitable and fair tax for farmers.  It should be said, and it has been said and will be said again, that at the 1977 general election Fianna Fáil raised the hopes of farmers beyond all expectations. They said that if they got into office again there would be a road of milk and honey for the farmers.  But what a disappointment it was.  Could anyone believe, after the propaganda of that election campaign and the deceit and the dishonesty that took place at that time, that we would find ourselves two years later nearing a crisis in agriculture?  The Minister may try to persuade us here that he is just bringing in these measures to pay for certain services to the agricultural community, but that is not the case.  This is an attempt to extract revenue from farmers to represent the taxes which they claim should be paid.</P>
      <P>The entire levy system must be described as a wrong system of extracting money from agriculture because it bears no relation whatsoever to the income of the farmer concerned.  The Minister must be reminded that there are still farmers who possess land in many parts of the country but do not pay their fair share of tax.  While that situation exists the Minister imposes four levies, with the prospect of a further two, on the farming community and lets people with big farms get away scot free.  Many of those people do not make use of their land except as a tax dodge.  The Departments of Agriculture and Finance, and the great financial brain, Deputy O'Donoghue, have failed to put forward any type of equitable system of taxation for farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of the conditions that now prevail in agriculture the Minister introduces this levy and starts the elimination process of farmers with small holdings.  The Minister is aware that as many as 50 per cent of our farmers have holdings of less than 50 acres.  What is their income?  How can they justify the borrowing of money to farm intensively? We are all aware that farmers cannot make any sort of a reasonable income unless they farm intensively.  They must <Col N="1360" /> carry out land reclamation, and the present cost of reseeding an acre is £100 approximately. Money costs in the region of 17 per cent and, for those who are not credit worthy, it can amount to 22 to 23 per cent.  Therefore, for those people to make a reasonable standard of living they must farm intensively but when they go to the creamery with their milk they are faced with the 2 per cent levy, a Bord Bainne levy, an EEC levy and the new .5 per cent levy being imposed by the Minister now.  They will face further levies in the not too distant future.  I was surprised that the Minister, in fact, did not return from the EEC talks and announce a further levy.  However, he did not manage to obtain an increase in prices for farmers.  He told our farmers that they were living in cloud cuckoo land.  I wonder if it is the Minister who is living in cloud cuckoo land.  Does he realise that small farmers, as a result of the Minister's levy system, a backdoor method of collecting tax from farmers, have a big amount of their creamery cheques stopped?</P>
    <P>The worst levy ever imposed on Irish farmers was the 2 per cent levy.  I cannot understand where the Minister's power, as the protector of our farmers, has gone when he allows Ministers Colley and O'Donoghue to impose such a levy. There was a simple solution to the problem, the introduction of 1 per cent VAT.  That levy has cracked the confidence of the farming community.  Since the introduction of the levy farmers have received only one creamery cheque and that has made them aware of how much that position will cost them.  I do not know whether Ministers Colley and O'Donoghue are aware that 50 per cent of our population are involved, directly or indirectly, in agriculture.  Any attempt to damage the confidence of those involved in that sector will have serious effects on our economy.  The protection which we all expected the Minister to give to agriculture is not forthcoming. The proof of that is the fact that the Minister for Finance forced through, over the head of the Minister for Agriculture, a 2 per cent levy on farmers.</P>
    <P>I feel sorry for our small farmers <Col N="1361" /> because our Minister is not prepared to protect them and has left them in the hands of the financial brain of the Government, Deputy O'Donoghue, who, in common with the Minister for Finance, does not have any knowledge of agriculture and cares little for its development.  Those involved in agriculture must sit up sharply and take note of what is happening.  We have already witnessed the removal of the rates subsidy, another attempt to raise revenue.  I never claimed that farmers should not pay their fair share in taxation, but surely it is possible to devise a fair and equitable system so that the small farmers are allowed a reasonable standard of living.  We must remember that some of the farmers in the west can avail of the dole, but what about small farmers in Kilkenny, Wexford and Meath?  Is the Minister aware that in County Wexford 36 per cent of the farmers have holdings of less than 50 acres?  If the levy system remains there is little hope of those farmers having a reasonable standard of living.  The levy system does not bear any relation to the increase of farmers, is objectionable in principle and is damaging the confidence of our farming community.</P>

      <P>It is customary to thank Deputies who subscribe to such debates, a debate which was unexpectedly long, and I do so now.  I was anxious to see if any useful suggestion or any useful scrap of information could be extracted from the contributions of Opposition Deputies, but not the slightest piece of useful criticism was made.  One of the most remarkable things about the contributions of the Opposition was the total unconcern for the really serious disease problem of our cattle herd.  If anything subscribed to doubling that problem in the space of two years it was the abandonment by the National Coalition of disease eradication for two years.  There remains now, as real as ever, the survival of the export cattle trade through the means of derogations which are becoming more difficult to get every year.  In that respect if disease eradication did not merit the expenditure of some of the <Col N="1362" /> money of the herd owners in order to finance the operation properly the constraints of the market or our capacity to sell abroad should be the decisive factor. In all the contributions there was not the slightest recognition of this.</P>
      <P>Many of the contributions were totally irrelevant.  Deputies spoke about the ESB, State-sponsored bodies and every thing else but had very little to say about the exaction of this 1 per cent levy for disease eradication or if other means might be found to raise a similar sum. There seemed to be a consensus in saying that farmers should pay their fair share of tax but they did not say how the money for this accelerated disease eradication programme was to be found. The sum of what they said was tantamount to saying that they believed that the taxpayers in general should pay for this rather specialised service.</P>
      <P>The poor performance in regard to disease eradication in the period since we began to try to eradicate disease has many sources but one of them has undeniably been the happy-go-lucky approach of herd owners generally to the question of disease eradication and the wide-spread abuse of the eradication scheme on the part of various people, who had no compunction in doing the most serious damage to their neighbours or to the public at large by trading in cattle they know to be diseased.  All of those things are coming to an end.  The very fact that the herd owners around the country will be subscribing their own money as well as the Government's public money to this vital campaign will make everybody more vigilant and more anxious to see that the campaign is successful. Deputies seemed to be in doubt as to where the blow would fall most heavily.  Pretty well every opinion was expressed.  The small farmers, who for some obscure reason are not generally in the meat production business at all and, therefore, will not be paying a levy on the export of cattle, will pay the piper according to some.</P>

      <P>The butchers and the factories will suffer as well as the consumers according to some Deputies. That is an immense amount of suffering caused by the imposition of a levy of 1 per cent in a price context that never has been better than it has been in the last six months.  I am not sure that is a good thing but that is the way it has been.  One of the most serious sources of the troubles of the meat industry at the moment is the failure to increase the size of the cattle herd.  The origin of that goes back to the cattle crash in 1974, when calves could not be given away during the halcyon days of marvellous times.  Following that year we had the fatal decision made by the former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, to admit&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That fatal mistake made by Deputy Clinton, the former Minister, to admit breeding cows into the intervention market resulted in 1975 in the slaughter of between 650,000 and 700,000 cows.  Practically the whole beef breeding herd was eliminated.  At least three times the normal number of cows were killed and consequently those cows could not produce any more calves.  The cattle numbers failed to rise.  This is telling now and will continue to tell in the meat factories.  There is a shortage of supply in these meat factories at the moment. There is possibly an overactive demand for the available supply, competition between the factories and the export trade.  As some Deputies pointed out, some meat factories are undoubtedly in difficulty.  I do not believe that this situation could have been avoided because its origins are several years back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public health aspect of the disease eradication programme was referred to by Deputy Bruton and others.  As he pointed out, a great many people involved in the cattle trade suffer from <Col N="1364" /> brucellosis.  This is a disagreeable complaint. This is a supplementary reason for the one point which escaped Deputies&mdash;the urgency of the matter. The speeches seemed to be aimed at an audience outside the House.  They were not calculated to assist.  If Deputies will forgive me for saying so, they were propaganda speeches.</P>

      <P>They were based on the assumption that the farmers were some kind of nit wits who cannot see through prate when they hear it.  I have never heard such prate as I have listened to this morning and last night.  I call it cant, prate and nothing else.  Deputy Hegarty, for instance, wanted this deferred.  He said: &ldquo;Give it the long summer, consider it deeply, consider the disruption the 1 per cent levy will cause in County Cork.&rdquo; Did he consider what disruption would be caused by the failure to eliminate disease in County Cork, which has the worst record in TB and brucellosis in the country and probably the worst in Europe.  Deputy Hegarty thinks we should not do something about it, the same as many of his colleagues on the Opposition benches.  I disagree and I am sure our farmers also disagree.  A campaign like this cannot be run on soft talk and plamás.  That is what they were being offered.  The former Minister, Deputy Clinton, was worrying about factory redundancies and farmer confidence.  He arrived up with the synthesis that the future of agriculture depended on cattle. It was hard neck on the part of Deputy Clinton to start talking about the shortcomings of herd numbers and about farmer confidence when during his reign of office young cattle could not be given away.  Every year during that period we saw cattle being sold for £5 a cwt and less and we saw calves being sold for less than the price of an oven-ready chicken. Is this farmer confidence?</P>

      <P>Deputy Bermingham was more constructive than other speakers.  There seemed to be a dichotomy in his mind as to whether he was for or against the levy.  He recognised it was necessary but allowed that he disliked the idea.  He mentioned that there was no reference to ability to pay.  He made the unusual statement that a man owning two cows will pay as much money as the man owning 200 cows.  Possibly he did not mean that, because it does not sound sensible in that form.  The Deputy said that the consumer will be the person who will pay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The interesting thing about the Minister's contribution on the motion to impose the levy, which is contained in substance in his Bill, was his complete failure to make an attempt to defend the principle of this levy.  At no time did he seek to justify the idea that a levy of this sort should be imposed.  He made a number of what, to use his own words, were totally irrelevant contributions in relation to the urgency of disease eradication, which is not affected in the least by whether or not this levy is imposed. The imposition of this levy neither accelerates nor decelerates disease eradication in itself.  The Minister is seeking to pretend that it does, and is not putting forward an argument in favour of the levy.</P>
      <P>He referred to what he described completely inaccurately as the total abandonment of disease eradication when the Coalition were in office.  He knows as well as anybody else in this House that during that period disease eradication did not proceed as fast as it would otherwise have done because of an industrial dispute on a genuine issue of principle between the then Minister and the veterinary surgeons.  It is no more sensible for the present Minister to say that the problems that arose in relation to disease eradication at that time constituted an abandonment by the Government of disease eradication than it would be for him to say now that because we did not have a postal service for the past few months it was an abandonment by the present Government of the postal service.  I do not think he or his colleagues would claim that nor that he would claim the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs abandoned the postal service for the past few months.  Does the Minister believe the postal service has been abandoned by his Government?  I do not think he will say that, but if he uses those words to describe his predecessor he must use them to describe his colleague.  He referred to the decline in the cattle herd, the fatal decision to admit cows to intervention and so on, but he did not attempt to defend the levy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to make a few points. First of all, this levy will be paid, regardless of ability to pay, by every farmer on every animal slaughtered regardless of whether that farmer has a taxable income and regardless of the size of the farm.  It will be paid at the same rate, £3 per animal, regardless of the value of the animal.  An animal worth £1,000 will pay £3 and an animal worth £10 will pay £3.  The levy is one of a number of levies.  It is accompanied by a 2 per cent levy which is being imposed across the board on all products.  A dairy inspection levy is to follow in a Bill which is before the House.  It is accompanied by what is tantamount to a levy in the form <Col N="1369" /> of increased veterinary fees, and by a fifth levy to finance the CBF, which is not a controversial matter but is now one of five levies being imposed by the present Government.  Yet that Government, who so seem to favour levies as a means of raising revenue, go out to Brussels and try to argue that we should not have a co-responsibility levy for milk.  If ever a Government weakened their own bargaining position in the EEC by means of their own policy, this is the best example of it.  It is going to be very difficult for them to resist the idea of a co-responsibility levy on the grounds that it is unfair, that it discriminates and does not take account of needs.  All these arguments will be put forward for not having a co-responsibility levy on this country because we are a special case and we need to be allowed to encourage milk production without a levy.  All those arguments which the Minister will be putting forward against a co-responsibility levy on milk in Brussels can be and are being put forward against the levies which this Minister is imposing in this country.  These are exactly the same arguments about not having reference to need, not taking account of special circumstances, not allowing people who have only one means of expanding, namely milk production, to expand. All of those arguments which the Minister is putting forward in Brussels on behalf of Ireland can be put forward on behalf of the farmers here against the levies which the Minister is introducing here.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that this levy is to be used for assisting the eradication of disease.  We are not told specifically what disease, although the inference is brucellosis and tuberculosis, but no concrete assurance is given that even after brucellosis and tuberculosis have been eradicated this levy will not continue long beyond that date.  There is nothing to prevent this levy becoming a permanent levy on all cattle slaughtered and all milk sent into creameries and dairies.  From starting out as a form of levy for a particular purpose, after the purpose for which it was set up has been achieved it could become just another part of the general taxation system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> In section 2 of the Bill it is stated that the levy is to be 0.5 new pence per gallon as regards milk and £3 per animal in the case of beef.  Under section 2 (5) the Minister may, by regulation, increase the rate of this levy.  It could be increased to £9, £10 or £20 per animal simply by the introduction of an order.  The Minister would have to get approval of that order from the House under the terms of the Bill, but it would be a simple matter of introducing that order and having it approved by the House, on a short debate with no requirement on the Minister to introduce new legislation if he wished to increase this levy to any amount that he chose.  He has the power to increase this levy from its present amount to any amount he chooses by order.  In agreeing to this legislation we are giving the Minister power to introduce further taxation at a much higher level by order. We do not give the Minister for Finance power to do that in respect of general taxation.  We should not be giving to the Minister for Agriculture power to do this in respect of this form of taxation.</P>
    <P>We were told by the Minister that the levy was to be used as a means of paying for disease eradication.  If that were the case one would have expected that the proceeds of the levy would have been paid into a separate fund which would be available and usable only for disease eradication, but that is not to happen. There is no provision whatever in the Bill for the creation of a separate fund for this purpose.  There is no guarantee anywhere in the Bill that the proceeds of the levy need necessarily be used solely for disease eradication.  I will be introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that such a special fund is set up so that if this levy goes ahead&mdash;naturally, one hopes that it will not but that hope is unrealistic in view of the fact that the Government have circulated this legislation&mdash;it will be put into a special fund earmarked solely for disease eradication and that the people paying the levy will have an important say in the way in which it is used.  I will be proposing that a committee or a group of trustees be set up, including a majority representative of the farming community, to administer this fund, so <Col N="1371" /> that those who are paying the levy will have a say in the way in which it is spent.  At the moment the Minister is saying to the farmers &ldquo;you pay the levy and I will decide how the money is spent&rdquo;.  That is not acceptable to the farming community if this is really a disease eradication levy.</P>
    <P>If this is nothing more than another taxation measure, then it is acceptable for the Minister to say &ldquo;I will decide it because this is taxation&rdquo;, but he has pretended and sought to portray that this is not a taxation measure but a special disease eradication levy.  If it is a special disease eradication levy, why is it not being earmarked for a special fund in disease eradication?  Why are the people directly involved in disease eradication not being given a say in the way in which it is spent?  The evidence is that this is just another means of taxation under another guise and that the Minister for Finance, who does not like introducing taxation himself, has come up with the very good idea of getting other Ministers to introduce taxation measures by making them impose levies for their individual purposes and thereby himself avoiding the odium of having to come into the House and impose taxation.  He gets other Ministers to introduce levies which are not supposed to be taxation but which are nothing but taxation, because there is no guarantee that they will be used for the purposes for which ostensibly they are being introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to pretend that this levy would not be paid by small farmers in respect of cattle because the majority of small farmers do not at the moment produce cattle directly for slaughter, although that is not to say that they should not do so if the opportunity were given to them.  They usually produce them for further fattening by other farmers who finally send them into slaughter-houses.  The Minister was seeking to pretend that in that situation the levy would be paid only by the fattener and not by the small farmer producing the store beast.  This is not necessarily the case.</P>
    <P>In the situation which can easily occur <Col N="1372" /> where the supply of cattle for fattening exceeds demand the buyer will have greater strength than the seller, namely the small store producer from the West. There is no way in which the Minister can stop the fattener passing on the levy in full and, perhaps, on the double in the form of a reduced price to the smaller farmer.  When supply exceeds demand the buyer has the greater bargaining strength.  That is a simple axiom of economics which I am sure the Minister understands.  In those circumstances the levy will be passed back to the producer, whose need to dispose of the animal is greater than the need of the buyer to acquire it.  I am not contending that this situation will arise at all times; it will arise at those times of the year when demand for store animals is less than supply.</P>
    <P>Equally this levy will be paid by the consumer and not by the fattener of cattle when the demand for beef exceeds supply.  The butcher will need beef so badly to keep his customers happy and his own employees in work that he will have to pay whatever price is demanded. He will not be able to pass back the levy to the fattener but will have to pass it on to the consumer.  It is a simple matter of understanding the economics of supply and demand.  In certain circumstances the levy will be paid by the consumer and in other circumstances by the small store producer.  The Minister says it is not intended that the levy should be paid by either of these, but this legislation does not contain any provisions which would protect them from paying the levy.  It is perfectly impossible to prevent the levy being paid by the consumer in the circumstances I have described in the absence of any retail price control of meat.  Because of the varieties of cuts and qualities of meat it would be impossible to administer such a system of retail price control.  Where demand for meat exceeds supply I state categorically that this levy will be paid not by the farmer or the butcher but by the consumer, and the Minister has no means at his disposal to prevent this.</P>
    <P>The essential objection to a levy as a means of taxation is that there is no control in a free market situation as to <Col N="1373" /> where the levy will fall.  This is a fundamental canon of public finance.  The levy will not necessarily fall on the person who is supposed to pay it. Depending on circumstances in the market, it will fall either on him, on people to whom he is selling or from whom he is buying.  The Government have no control over this levy or any of the other four levies which they have introduced. There is injustice as between farmers big and small and in its potential incidence as a tax on consumers and on small farmers.  This is a fundamentally wrong way of paying for disease eradication.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said there was no mention on this side of the House of other means of paying the expenses which arise in respect of disease eradication.  It is for the Minister and his colleagues in Government to find means of paying for the programmes they are implementing.  The Opposition should not have to tell them how to raise taxation. The argument put forward by the Minister to justify his levy that the Opposition have not come up with anything better is certainly the argument of someone who has failed utterly to find any self-sustaining justification for what he is doing and has to find justification in the absence of arguments from other people who are far less well placed and have far less access than the Government to sources of information.  It is no argument for any Government to say that their course of action must be right because the Opposition have not come up with anything better.</P>
    <P>My personal opinion on this matter has been put on record on a number of occasions.  I believe that the farming community should pay taxation on accounts on what they actually earn. Farmers who have a net income which exceeds their tax-free allowances should ultimately pay taxation on accounts just as everyone else.  This is the system which obtains in Northern Ireland.  I suggest that the Minister for Agriculture, the farming organisations and the Revenue Commissioners should examine that system with a view to its implementation here.  This is a personal suggestion made on my own behalf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  In Northern Ireland there are no rates on agricultural land and neither are there levies but all farmers pay income tax on accounts.  The system works without any excess of bureaucracy and there is no controversy about taxation as between town and country.  Each sector accepts that the other is paying a fair share.  That is the sort of taxation.  I should like to see, not this penal levy.  The Minister sought refuge in asking the Opposition to produce an alternative.  I have now produced one and I hope he will do better in reply to the debate and seek to justify the levy on its own grounds, not by reference to something which happened in 1974 or 1977 or something the Opposition did or did not say.  He should justify the levy he is imposing.</P>
      <P>I accept the provision in section 22 whereby fines for offences which encourage the spread of disease are increased to £500.  We have been pressing the Minister to introduce these measures for a long time.  I also accept the provision contained in section 17 whereby a prosecution may be taken up to two years after the date of an offence.  The situation has been that a prosecution could only be brought within six months of an offence.  Evidence of such an offence may not be available for some time afterwards, and it is not right that the Minister should be prevented from prosecuting people after six months from the date of the offence.</P>
      <P>I have doubts about the provisions contained in section 23 (1) which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anything done pursuant to an order made by the Minister in exercise of the powers conferred on him by section 22 of the Diseases of Animals <Col N="1375" /> Act, 1894, as amended by section 2 of the Diseases of Animals (Bovine Tuberculosis) Act, 1957 (as amended by section 5 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1960), shall not be questioned in any legal proceedings on the grounds that there was not made by the Minister in relation to an area to which the order applies a declaration by him either declaring the area to be an attested area or declaring the area to be an attested or disease-free area.</P>
    <P>Section 23 is retrospective legislation.  It is saying that something that was not a criminal offence at the time of its commission shall now be a criminal offence. The validity of the proceedings is being reasserted notwithstanding the legal flaw that may have existed at the time of the offence.  In his speech the Minister said that this section was necessary because of &ldquo;some vague doubts&rdquo; which had been expressed about the power to take prosecutions by virtue of the fact that in some cases this declaration of an area as being an attested area had not been made.</P>
    <P>Retrospective legislation that affects criminal proceedings should not be made without the greatest care.  It is not doing the House a service for the Minister to introduce retrospective legislation of criminal effect based on nothing more than unspecified vague doubts.  The Minister did not explain the doubts or the reasons for retrospective criminal legislation.  I believe that he should have done so in his speech which was read for him by the Minister for Justice.  We have too much retrospective validating legislation.  We have had retrospective validating legislation from the Minister for Justice in relation to the sacking of Commissioner Garvey and now, because of some other mistake, we have more retrospective legislation from the Minister for Agriculture.  That is not a good way to proceed.  It is too easy for Ministers to cover up mistakes by introducing validating legislation.  These mistakes should not have been made in the first place.  There are not many parallels for retrospective validating legislation <Col N="1376" /> in our history.  There was a recent one in the case of the sacking of Commissioner Garvey and there were ones after the civil war when actions taken by various people during that time were retrospectively validated.  To the best of my knowledge it has not been a common occurrence.  Where it is necessary to introduce it in the public interest, the House and the public are entitled to know why it is being done.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some other sections which are particularly obnoxious. Under section 12 an authorised officer is being given the power to go into any creamery, any butcher's shop, any place where animals are being slaughtered and where milk is being disposed of, to inspect records at any time he sees fit without a search warrant.  In his speech the Minister said that these were not new powers.  If they are not new powers I cannot see why it is necessary to include them in the Bill.  The Minister is incorrect in his claim that they are not new powers, because they would not be in the Bill if they were not necessary.  I should like to draw attention to the fact that the inspector is not required to have any objective reasonable grounds for entering a premises.  The inspector is the sole judge of whether it is necessary to enter premises to carry out extensive searches. He can enter premises at any time to look for documents.</P>
    <P>Further, he is not restricted by the provisions of the section even to entering the premises solely for the purposes of the enforcement of this legislation.  I believe this legislation gives an authorised officer power to enter and inspect the premises and inspect any documents for any purpose because it says in section 12 that he may retain such records, books or other documents for such purpose as may be reasonable for their examination or for the purpose of any proceedings for the recovery of levy payable or by virtue of this Act, or for an offence under this Act.  There are four alternatives.  So, any purpose for the examination of records is sufficient within the Bill regardless of whether or not it is for the purpose of proceedings under this legislation.  The first alternative <Col N="1377" />&ldquo;reasonable for their examination&rdquo; gives the Minister power to retain documents owned by creameries, butchers' shops or slaughtering plants for any purpose for their examination regardless of whether it has anything even remotely to do with responsibility for this levy.  That is taking a power which it is quite unnecessary and oppressive to take.</P>
    <P>Under section 11 of the Bill a butcher even though he may be only slaughtering one or two animals a week is required to retain in his possession for six years after the date of the slaughter of an animal any document which relates to the transaction whereby he bought the animal.  Presumably he would have to keep the dockets he gave, receipts, blue cards, tags and so on.  All this must be retained up to six years after the date of the transaction.  If five years later a Department inspector arrives and says: &ldquo;You slaughtered an animal five years ago: where are the tags and receipts?&rdquo; and if the man cannot produce the material required he will be liable to prosecution and a fine not exceeding £500 or at the discretion of the court imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months if he is deemed not to be cooperating with the Department by not having retained this material for the full six years after the date when the animal was slaughtered.</P>
    <P>I realise that it is not the intention of the Minister or of the officials implementing the legislation to use the powers in this extreme manner but with the greatest respect to all of them the point is that the powers are being taken, unnecessarily in my view.  There is a tendency for Ministers of all parties in legislation of this sort to take powers which are about five times as great as what they require for the purpose of implementing their legislation simply to be on the safe side.  They are making very substantial incursions into the civil liberties of people without really needing to do so in order to be sure that in a difficult situation they have sufficient power to do everything they might possibly want to do to get a prosecution.  I do not think that should be the approach of any Minister in a matter of this sort. The approach should be for the Minister to take to himself the powers necessary <Col N="1378" /> to secure the enforcement of the legislation alone and no single power more whereas this Minister&mdash;he is not alone in this&mdash;is in this Bill taking far more powers than he really needs to secure enforcement of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 the Minister will have power to reduce the amount payable to any milk producer whose herd is infected with brucellosis or TB.  He will have power to require the creamery or dairy which is taking the milk from that producer, regardless of what they might want to pay the farmer, regardless of the value of the milk being supplied, to pay a lower price to that farmer than to other farmers to an extent determined by the Minister only.  In my view this gives power for an unlimited reduction in the price paid to producers without any reference to objectivity or to need or to the purposes of disease eradication.  I know that the Minister does not intend to use this power in an oppressive way. When he replies to what I have said that is what he will say but the point is that he is taking the power which may be used by him or his successor for purposes that have no relation to disease eradication&mdash;to reduce the price of milk to individual producers to an unlimited and unreasonable extent.  A safeguard must be written into this section to ensure that if it is to be used it shall only be used in strictly limited circumstances and for strictly reasonable purposes. That is not the case as the section is drafted.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that if the creamery or dairy was going to pay a certain producer a lesser price under the provision which gives the Minister power to require them to do so, the money saved would be used&mdash;what the Minister said was that &ldquo;these funds could be used by the processors either to increase the price paid for milk from disease-free herds or to provide appropriate services to help herd owners fight disease.  It is important to note that the Minister says only that they could be used for those purposes; he is giving no guarantee that they will be used for such purposes nor is he taking any power in the Bill in respect of section 8 which allows an unlimited reduction in the price of milk to <Col N="1379" /> farmers who have a disease problem, to ensure that any money raised in that way is used for such purposes.  The Bill is seriously deficient when that is not being done.</P>
    <P>Further, there is no provision for using this power in such a way as to discriminate between farmers where the incidence of disease in the herd is their own fault and farmers where the incidence of disease is due to factors totally beyond their control.  We know that these diseases can spread from one farm to another even though every precaution is taken to keep animals separate and the herd owner does not allow his cattle to come into any contact if he has a clear herd and his neighbour has an infected herd.  The disease can spread on the wind.  It can spread through water supplies, or in one way or another, from one herd to another, notwithstanding every precaution being taken by the farmer with the clear herd.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, if a farmer through no fault of his own&mdash;having taken every precaution to prevent the disease coming into his herd&mdash;finds that the disease comes into his herd because of the malevolence or negligence of his neighbour, there is nothing to say that the Minister, in the exercise of his power, will not reduce the price paid for milk to the farmer who has taken every possible precaution against the disease arising in his herd by the same amount as it is being reduced in respect of the farmer who has taken no precautions and has been responsible for the spread of the disease.  There is nothing in the Bill to give us any assurance on that point.  This is something which must be attended to in the drafting of the amendments for Committee Stage and I hope the Minister will do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few remarks about disease eradication generally but, before doing so, I should like to ask the Minister a question in relation to the purposes for which the Bill is being introduced and the purposes for which the levy is being imposed.  The title of the Bill is Bovine Diseases (Levies) Bill.  In all the publicity about the Bill, reference has <Col N="1380" /> been made to brucellosis and tuberculosis. It would seem it is possible within the terms of the Bill for these powers to be used to raise a levy for the purpose of meeting the costs which arise in respect of other bovine diseases as well as brucellosis and tuberculosis.  Is it possible, for instance, that this Bill could be used to raise levies to meet the cost of warble fly eradication, the cost of measures taken against bovine leucosis, or any other disease which may arise in respect of bovine animals, costs which must be borne by the Department?  If so we should be told so.  That matter remains unclear.</P>
    <P>The Minister laid considerable stress on the urgency of the disease eradication programme.  I should like to endorse what he said about the urgent need to eradicate brucellosis and tuberculosis.  I will advance three basic reasons in support of what the Minister said about the urgency of the need to eradicate these diseases.  The first, of course, is the loss incurred by herd owners because of the existence of these diseases in their herds. The second is the danger to our exports arising from the fact that we have a far higher incidence of brucellosis and tuberculosis than exists in any of the customer nations with which we are dealing in the EEC.  The third one&mdash;and to my mind the most important one by far&mdash;is the danger brucellosis and tuberculosis pose to human health.  I propose to deal with the second two reasons.  The one in relation to losses by farmers because of disease in their herds is so obvious that it does not need to be dealt with in a debate of this sort.</P>
    <P>At the moment there is a directive in draft form before the Council of Ministers which provides that no fresh milk may be sold from one country to another in the European Community if it comes from a herd which is infected with brucellosis or tuberculosis.  When there is a surplus of milk, the Ministers of the EEC will tend to search around for ways and means to restrict the production and sale of milk.  There is no better excuse&mdash;and that might well be all that it would be&mdash;for restricting the sale of milk products than the threat of disease arising among humans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> In the case of fresh milk there is justification for not allowing it to be sold if it has not been pasteurised and if it comes from brucellosis- and tuberculosis-infected herds.  It is quite possible that the Commission might seek at some date in the not-too-distant future to say that processed milk products which come from brucellosis- and tuberculosis-infected herds could not be sold in inter-Community trade.  I contend there is no danger whatever to human health in the case of processed milk products even if they come from infected herds because, in the course of processing, they will have been pasturised and measures will have been taken to prevent them posing any danger to human health.</P>
    <P>There is every reason to fear that this excuse&mdash;and that is all it would be&mdash;would be used by our partners in the EEC to restrict us in the sale of milk products which come from herds which are not clear of brucellosis and tuberculosis. That would be a very serious matter.  It would strangle our trade.  We would have to go and look for a derogation for Ireland in respect of the proposals they might be making.  They would come back to us and say: &ldquo;You are looking for a derogation to allow you to continue exporting your material even though you have certain diseases.  At the same time, you are keeping out our meat and our animals on the grounds that we have certain diseases.  Let us do a deal. We will give you your derogation if you let in our cattle, beef, and so on.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The danger then could be that diseases which are prevalent on the Continent and which do not exist here might be introduced.  We do not allow animals to come from countries in which the following diseases are prevalent, even though they may now be clear of them: foot and mouth, swine fever, blue tongue and Newcastle disease.  Even though the animals may be perfectly clear, if they come from a country where those diseases existed at any time in the recent past we will not allow them in.  The danger is not only that we would be prevented from exporting, but that the derogations we already have to keep out animals from those countries on the grounds that they contain disease could <Col N="1382" /> be challenged on the grounds that what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the gander.</P>
    <P>I am putting these matters on record&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister has already put them on record; perhaps I am more free to do so than he is&mdash;in order to stress the urgency of disease eradication and my full support for the Minister in any reasonable measure to deal with disease eradication.  This levy has nothing to do with disease eradication and it is not reasonable.  It is nothing but a revenue measure.  The eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis from our herds is important because of the danger to human health.  I have been advised by people more eminently qualified than I that there is a danger that not only can brucellosis spread to humans from animals but that bovine tuberculosis can infect humans as well.  This is of great concern.  Tuberculosis was the main problem in the forties and prior to that. If, arising from our failure to eradicate bovine tuberculosis, there was to be a recrudescence of tuberculosis as a human condition the Minister or those on this side of the House would not be forgiven for not taking all necessary measures to eradicate it.</P>
    <P>The situation is that not all precautions that should be taken by the authorities to prevent brucellosis and tuberculosis, where they exist in cattle, spreading to humans are being taken. Approximately 25 per cent of milk consumed is consumed in an unpasteurised form.  There is a similar proportion of herds in those parts of the country where a lot of milk is produced where brucellosis and tuberculosis are endemic in the herd.  The fact that we allow unpasteurised milk to be sold from herds where we are not certain that these diseases have been totally eradicated is a serious matter.  I understand that it is the responsibility of local authorities to make orders where they deem it necessary requiring the pasteurisation of all milk sold for human consumption.  I do not have information on this but I understand that there are a number of local authorities which have not made orders requiring that milk sold for human consumption <Col N="1383" /> be pasteurised.  If that milk is coming from herds where there is a risk of those diseases present in the herd we are taking a most unacceptable risk with the health of the community.</P>
    <P>Apart from milk which is actually sold in an unpasteurised form there is a considerable amount of milk in this form consumed by farmers' families.  I should like the Minister to ensure that wherever brucellosis is found special measures are taken to alert the family and anybody who might be consuming milk from that herd to the fact that that milk can only be safely consumed if it has been boiled and pasteurised.  Such precautions are not being taken on a general scale in respect of such herds.  In their absence we are taking a serious risk.</P>
    <P>A point I have repeatedly made is that no proper means of liaison has been developed between the health authorities concerned with human health and the Department of Agriculture authorities who are concerned with the eradication of the disease.  There should be a regular system at each county level of liaison between the district veterinary office and the health authorities whereby all outbreaks of these diseases which have a human health connotation are automatically notified to the health authorities.  The families concerned and other humans who might be at risk should be warned immediately of the danger to their own health by the health authorities.  There are far more elaborate precautions for preventing the spread of this disease from one animal to another than there are for preventing the spread of the disease from an animal to a human.  This is due to the fact that the Department of Agriculture have been far more assiduous in doing their job than the Department of Health have been in doing theirs in this context.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to two reports which have been presented in respect of milk and meat relating to the dangers of the spread of animal disease to humans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is getting very much into the health side of the matter, which would be <Col N="1384" /> for another Minister.  He is entitled to refer to it but not to go into it in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose that one of the main reasons for wanting to eradicate these diseases is their danger to human health.  The report of the Joint Services Committee on Zoonosis, presented by the Minister for Health in 1974 in respect of milk and meat, should be published because it contains information about the danger of the spread of animal disease to humans and the precautions that should be taken to prevent that happening.  If the reports were published they would lead to a more informed discussion than exists at present.</P>
      <P>I should like to make reference to the serious inadequacy of the inspection which takes place at slaughter houses other than export plants.  We are highly assiduous in eliminating any animal that contains evidence of tuberculosis on its body if that animal is going for export. The precautions we take to prevent animals being used as meat for domestic consumption are in no way comparable. There is a professional full-time veterinary inspection service in the export plants inspecting meat to ensure that it does not contain these diseases, but we have a part-time service inspecting the other premises.  In respect of slaughter houses for domestic consumption the inspection is by veterinary surgeons most of whom have other jobs and are given this one as a perk.  They are told they can do about half a day's work looking at individual butcher's stalls and so on.  If a butcher slaughters on a Tuesday but the vet did not happen to come around until a Thursday, he would not see any slaughtering or any animal slaughtered because no animal would be slaughtered on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inefficient means of inspection of premises from a disease point of view where the meat is destined for domestic consumption.  There is insufficient staff dealing with tuberculosis in the Department's veterinary laboratory at Abbottstown.  In the past there were two veterinary surgeons concerned with the question of the incidence <Col N="1385" /> of tuberculosis, but this complement has been reduced to one in the entire research services of the Department of Agriculture concerned with bovine tuberculosis.  I do not believe that a disease which is costing us so much can be properly eradicated from a research point of view by one veterinary surgeon acting on his own in Abbottstown.  There should be a considerable increase in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one or two other points about bovine diseases.  We have a problem at the moment with bovine leucosis which has broken out here in the last year or two as a result of the importation of Canadian Holstein bulls.  I understand that this disease, which is a form of leukemia or blood cancer in cattle, has now spread to about 70 or 80 herds here.  I understand also that it is not an easy disease to detect and that it can be present in animals, and indeed present to a degree that it infects other animals, for up to four years before any tumor or any visible evidence comes to light.  If we do not take resolute action now to eradicate this disease we run the risk that the disease will become endemic.  In Denmark they wiped this disease out completely, but they did so by slaughtering all the animals in the herds where the disease was prevalent. They had to take highly unpleasant and highly stringent measures to get rid of it. This disease has been present here for about 18 months, and I gather that there are measures being taken to follow up the disease and find out where it exists and lock up those herds where it has been shown to exist.  But is the Minister satisfied that these measures are sufficient and will in fact eradicate the disease by a specific time?  When this disease first came to light I asked the Minister if any date had been set for the eradication of this disease and he said that there was no date set.  We must set a specific date for getting rid of bovine blood cancer.  We must say that by 1985 this disease will not exist here but we will take every measure that is necessary to get it out of this country.  Any sort of softly, softly approach to this disease will not work.  This is the information that I have from people who are qualified to give it to me, and I would <Col N="1386" /> ask the Minister to take a hard look at it.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one last point about disease eradication, and I hope the Minister will agree with me.  Urgent attention needs to be given not just to the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis but to the prevention of the outbreak of them.  There is a great deal more that can be done to encourage farmers to take preventive measures to avoid the outbreak of disease in their herds.  We need qualified people who are prepared to go along to farmers and advise them on the type of disinfection procedures that they can take where an outbreak had taken place, and to advise farmers on preventive measures so that they will avoid getting the disease in the first place.  I have no criticism at all to make of the veterinary profession who are working on their own behalf, but the fact is that they are so busy running from one point to another in a fire brigade operation, dealing with diseases that have broken out in one herd or another, that they do not have the time to spend with a farmer to sit down and advise him on the various steps he should take to avoid brucellosis and call back, say, in two months' time to see how that farmer is getting on and to give him any further help if he needs it.  The fact of the matter is that the practitioner who is working for himself has not the time to do that sort of educational and advisory work with his clients because he is so busy doing fire brigade operations, putting out fires in the form of disease that have arisen on some farms; he rushes into the yard and out again to another man.  There must be an educational veterinary service here designed solely to help farmers to prevent disease.  I urged very strongly on the Minister at the time that this should be included in the advisory services under the new Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta.  The Minister did not accept the amendment which would have done this, but notwithstanding that the case I made then is still absolutely valid, and a tremendous amount of money could be saved by a proper prevention and education programme directed at all the farmers in the country.  I would ask the Minister if he would consider setting up a unit specifically concerned with the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1387" /> Educational requirements in the prevention of diseases.  I hope that when the Minister replies to this debate he will do that.</P>
    <P>I have spent quite an amount of time talking generally about disease in what I hope was a constructive spirit.  However I would not like to end my contribution without saying that we are resolutely opposed to the imposition of this levy and we are highly sceptical about the need for some of the powers that have been taken by the Minister to inspect premises and reduce the price of milk without any check being put on whether or not those powers are being exercised in a reasonable manner.  Because of the levy, if for no other reason, we will be opposing the giving of a Second Reading to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few points on this Bill.  Anything that would help in the eradication of diseases has my full support.  Having said that, I think the method being adopted to finance this and the levy being introduced in the Bill are unjust.  It takes no account of the person's income or ability to pay.  There are other ways in which the levy will work unfairly not alone for the producer but for the consumer.  For that reason we must find some other way of getting a fair and equitable share of taxation from the farmers.  But in introducing legislation of this type we must take into account the ability of farmers to pay.  The 2 per cent levy which was announced in the budget and was later scrapped, changed around and then reintroduced in a most unedifying manner by the Government can be justified to a certain extent but the same cannot be said about the levy under discussion which is not a percentage levy.</P>
      <P>The levy is imposed on a gallon of milk, irrespective of the number of gallons a farmer may bring to a creamery or the income of a farmer.  I will continue to oppose the 2 per cent levy because it did not take into account the ability of the farmer to pay but at least it is listed as a percentage of the gross income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levy under discussion makes a <Col N="1388" /> farce of the whole idea of levies.  It will be applied to beasts, irrespective of the value of the animal.  It is a most unfair system which cannot be justified.  I accept that farmers must pay their fair share of taxation but it must be within the competence of a government to devise a fair and equitable system of taxation for farmers.  In my view this levy will not encourage farmers to improve production and is something which would not be tolerated in any other industry. It will discourage people from getting involved in the production of milk and beef and will act as another blow to those who are anxious to improve their holdings.  It must be remembered that many people are depending on farmers producing more milk and beef for the creation of more jobs.</P>
    <P>We should also be made aware of how long this levy will remain in operation. When the diseases are finally eradicated will the levy continue to be collected and used to finance other schemes?  We are all anxious to see diseases eradicated but farmers are also anxious to know if this levy will become a normal part of taxation when we achieve total disease eradication.  Is this system an indication of what is likely to happen in other industries which are serviced in one way or another by public funds?  The introduction of the levy will create great difficulties for butchers who are in business in a small way.  They will be obliged to keep accounts for a long time.  In my view, because of the way such people operate, it will be impossible for them to charge the levy to the farmer who sells animals to them from time to time.  The result will be that the consumer will have to pay the cost.  The only way such traders can compensate themselves in this regard is to charge the consumer extra for meat.</P>
    <P>I view this as an easy way out for the Government.  I do not know whether the Minister likes this method of collecting taxes.  While I accept that we must step up our efforts to eradicate disease the finance for such schemes must come from central funds.  If farmers are to be asked to pay extra for those schemes it should be done in a fair and equitable <Col N="1389" /> manner.  The income and profits of farmers must be taken into consideration. Some years ago I was very unpopular when I advocated the accounts system as a fair and equitable means of farmer taxation but I believe many of them now accept it as the best method. It must be remembered that a levy system affects small farmers most, many of whom do not earn enough to make them liable for income tax.</P>
    <P>I fear that the levy will discourage farmers from producting more beef, a fear which is also held by managers of meat factories.  It will also discourage owners of large farms from engaging in beef fattening during the winter months for sale to the meat farmers.  Cattle will not be available to the factory if we make the profitability on them too small. Factory managers and people concerned in the trade recognise that fact.  Those people can change their methods of farming and will not be at any loss.  The loss of employment in the factories will be severe as a result of this levy.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that this 3 per cent levy will go on to consumers.  Does it go on to every beast, whatever its size, irrespective of whether it is sold for £600 or is a small beast worth around £100? It is unfair to put the same levy on all beasts.  Does it refer to beasts which are sold at a very poor price when they have some disease?  Many of those might be sold for £10 each.  They could be old as animal feed or to bonemeal factories.  Is this levy to be collected from the factories on reactors in the eradication scheme we have been talking about?  The Minister should think again.  I have the full support of my party for any just scheme he wants to introduce which will help in the eradication of animal disease which affects our exports of meat.  If money has to be collected it should be collected on an equitable basis and take into account the ability of a person to pay.  This Bill does not recognise the ability of people to pay and, therefore, my party must oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDarcy" hpid="Mr. D'Arcy Mr. D'Arcy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>In supporting my colleague, Deputy Bruton, in opposing this Bill it is only right that I should say a few words on the Minister's attitude in relation to motion No. 10.  He complains <Col N="1390" /> that our contributions had little meat in them as far as the Bill is concerned.  He has consistently in the House been going back over the situation and blaming his predecessor, Deputy Clinton, for the abandonment of disease eradication in 1975 and 1976.  I am the owner of a herd of cattle and this is unjustified.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton pointed out that we had industrial dispute at that time and progress was slow prior to that dispute. It was essential that new measures be taken to speed up the disease eradication then.  I do not blame Deputy Clinton for taking the action he took.  The Minister should think back over the 14 or 15 years during which he and the two other Ministers before him have held office and see what progress was made in the 10 years prior to the Coalition Government coming into power.  Very little progress was made in disease eradication, particularly of TB, which was being eradicated then.  Almost the same percentage of incidence of TB was in the herds in 1971 as in 1960.</P>
      <P>The Minister comes into the House and blames everything on a particular action taken by a man who conscientiously believed that certain measures had to be taken to speed up the eradication of disease.  He has consistently made a further point about the slaughter of 700,000 cows.  He never asked himself what cows were slaughtered.  He said that the slaughter of cows at that time led to deficiency.  I accept that but we should ask ourselves the type of cows that were slaughtered.  Suckler herds were slaughtered then.  I would never encourage any farmer, no matter how big or small, to invest in a suckler herd.  No farmer should be foolish enough to believe that he could have a good standard of living unless he has 400 or 500 acres of land.  The lowest possible income any man can get here from any enterprise in agriculture is from a suckler herd.  One will still get a very low income if one has multiple sucklers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party encouraged this in the years 1970 and 1971.  I know that the beef mountain in Europe had an effect on our prices at that time.  The people who had suckler herds and got rid of them have never got back into <Col N="1391" /> them again.  It is impossible to have an income in agriculture from a suckler herd.  Let us look at the income a man will get from having a cow to suck one, two or three calves and let us imagine keeping a cow to produce liquid milk. The lowest possible rate for a herd is about 620 gallons which yields approximately £300.  If one has a cow which suckles three calves and one makes £30 each on the three calves the income from that is approximately £100.  No good, sound milking cows were slaughtered in that period.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not be so foolish as to encourage people to go back into suckler herds.  The foundations of the State were laid on cow herds.  They produce the milk and the beef for the factories.  The Minister should try to bring in a system whereby calf rearing, which is quite modern now, can be successfully done.  He should talk about calf rearing rather than about suckler herds. He complained about our contributions this morning.  He is not fooling us or he is not fooling the people.  The disease eradication has to go on whether this levy goes on or not.  It will be necessary to continue the scheme in order to save the herds but I am prepared to accept that progress has been slow.</P>
    <P>Animal disease in Ireland must be described as serious.  Progress in all areas has been very slow.  We cannot make real progress unless we get the co-operation of the Department of Agriculture, the veterinary profession and, most important, the herd-owners. This co-operation is vital if we are to succeed in eradicating disease.  If anyone believes that any one of these three groups can eradicate disease on their own he is fooling himself.  All three parties have a vital interest in the eradication of disease and they must pull together.  The Minister has complained about our contributions.  It is my intention to speak on the practical problems attached to disease eradication and I will be critical of all three parties.  I will start with the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Department is to supervise and in this area they have <Col N="1392" /> fallen down badly.  There is a Department office in Carlow.  I have always believed that each county should have its own local office.  We made this case to the previous Minister for Agriculture; I understand it was made to the Minister, Deputy Gibbons, before 1972 and we will make the case to him again today. Supervision is necessary in any business but supervision over the expenditure of public money is absolutely essential.  A huge sum of approximately £22 million is spent each year by the Department on disease eradication.  I do not think they have the necessary exports in the local offices.  When a farmer is having his cattle tested the local vet notifies him. I understand that the local office is also notified but to my knowledge there have not been any spot inspections by inspectors although I understand there are some inspections now.  Although we may have the veterinary profession on our back, it must be pointed out that it is not necessary that the people involved be veterinary surgeons.  All that is needed is an inspection to ensure that all the cattle are presented for testing and, secondly, that the vet concerned is given the necessary time to examine the herd properly.</P>
    <P>As in every profession, 10 per cent of people in this area are not prepared to do the job as it should be done.  They will abuse the system.  I have yet to see a summons carried out by the Department in my area.  I know of reports being made of certain things happening but little notice has been taken.  I claim that the Department should tighten up their own system.  They should be able to guarantee that the entire herd is presented and that the veterinary officer concerned gives sufficient time to see that the test is carried out properly.  I had a personal experience with regard to my own herd.  An inspector came into my yard, asked for the books and got them.  We went through the cattle twice and we were one tag short.  In a large herd this is quite understandable and it is often due to human error.  We put the cattle through the crush on three occasions but we failed to find the missing tag.  The following morning three of my cattle had pneumonia.  I told the officer that anyone could make a mistake with one tag and I said I saw no reason why <Col N="1393" /> the cattle should be pushed backwards and forwards through the crush but he insisted that the beast had to be found. We did not find the animal.  In my opinion it was total over-reaction.</P>
    <P>The Department have records of every herd in the country for the past 15 years and they should be able to identify from the records where the disease is recurring.  Special attention should be given to such herds.  A farmer may be clear of disease for four or five years but all of a sudden he may find that an animal has disease and on a second test other animals may be affected.  The Department should check all their records.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that they have not the experts to identify the source of disease. We have heard that badgers bring down the disease from the hills or that hens roosting in a cow-house can infect the herd.  I have never heard of anyone going through a farm and identifying the source of disease.  The Department, by checking the records, should be able to see where the breakdown is taking place in the various herds.  They should have an expert team in each office to identify the source of disease.</P>
    <P>I understand that some improvements have been made with regard to disinfectant. Up to now this had not been the case.  If a farmer found that one of his beasts was affected he got a leaflet stating that certain regulations laid down by the Department should be carried out, but his was never done.  There should be some attempt to see that regulations are carried out.  This is in the interest of the Department who are spending large sums of public money on disease eradication.</P>
    <P>I have never hammered the veterinary profession but I must state that certain abuses have taken place during the years and the Department are aware of this. Certain action had to be taken but I claim that there is a small percentage of vets who are not carrying out their duties properly and in accordance with the Department's regulations.  If we are to have real success in eradicating disease it is essential that these people be tracked down.  With regard to farmers, I claim that about 10 per cent of them are prepared to abuse every regulation the <Col N="1394" /> Department will make.  One of the most serious matters is tag-switching.  I have never understood why a watertight system is not devised so that tag-switching could not be done.  It is the easiest thing in the world to switch a tag from one animal to another.  I have been on a few deputations to the Department about this issue but for some peculiar reason they never come up with a watertight system which cannot be abused.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he tightened up the regulations, increased the penalties and so on, but the tags are no different now than they were five years ago.  It is as easy to switch a tag now as it was then. If I switched tags it cannot be proved by anybody because there is no ear identification. The only identification that exists is the number on the tag.  I find it very difficult to suggest proposals to remedy this tag situation.  I understand that it is possible to put a plastic tag in a beast's ear which cannot be removed and if it is cut off it cannot be put in another beast's ear.  I understand the Department have been discussing this matter with a plastics manufacturer.  I appeal to them to try and come up with a solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>Whether we like it or not, tag switching is, and always has been, carried out on a wide scale.  I buy cattle from the southern counties and they are very good at tag switching.  I will not mention any county.  I heard the Minister say this morning that a particular southern county had the highest incidence of disease not alone in Ireland but in Europe.  He does not have to look far to see the truth in what I am saying.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State said it, not me.  The main purpose of this Bill is to extract £10 million from the farming community.  Is this sum part of the Minister for Finance's £100 million which he said should be taken from farmers this year in the form of tax? Does he intend increasing this .5p per gallon, or approximately 1 per cent, year by year?  I believe he does.  This is the thin end of the wedge.  It is very wrong that this system should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1395" /> A number of levies have been imposed on farming commodities which bear no relation to the income of the person concerned. This is hitting our small farmers, particularly those under 50 acres, very hard.  I am sure the Minister of State has seen the first cheques out this month and the levies attaching to them.  There is the agricultural production duty of 2 per cent, the Bord Bainne levy of .3p per gallon, about .6 per cent per gallon, the EEC levy, this new levy, and yet another one.  That makes five levies, This system of extracting money from the farming community is unfortunate, and I oppose the principle involved.  This will affect the confidence of the farming community, because each month there will be these enormous stoppages from the cheques received from the dairies or factories. These five levies will represent approximately 12 per cent of the profits made by milk producers.  To a lesser degree the Minister is responsible for an increase in overheads of around 14 per cent.  He did not get an increase in the price for milk products in Brussels.  Will this increase confidence in the farming community?</P>
    <P>As far as cattle are concerned the situation is slightly worse.  I have always believed that the cattle industry is vital to our economy.  After a very difficult year beef producers' profits have slumped.  They made very little profit over the winter period.  The papers claimed there was a reduction in profits of over 40 per cent but in my opinion that is a slight exaggeration.  There was a 25 per cent reduction in profits.  This will not create confidence in the industry and will undoubtedly damage prospects for the future.</P>
    <P>Disease eradication should be the responsibility of the State, whether it be in humans or in animals.  I am not saying it should be completely financed by the Exchequer.  Whether this .5p per gallon levy goes on milk, the disease eradication programme must continue.  This Bill is the thin end of the wedge because it looks as if the farmers will be asked to pay for the implementation of this programme.  If they are being asked to <Col N="1396" /> pay 50 per cent in a bad year, what will happen if they have a good year?  The Minister will have no qualms of conscience in making the 1 per cent into 2 per cent.  It seems that farmers are going to be asked to pay for the implementation of the disease eradication programme. If eradication is as slow as it has been over the past ten years farmers should have the right to put an alternative scheme into operation.  There is the old saying that the man who pays the piper should be entitled to call the tune.  If we are going to spend another ten years eradicating disease and paying at the rate we are being asked to pay at the moment, farmers will not pay indefinitely for a bad scheme which has proved inefficient.  I do not know the date of the start of the tuberculosis scheme but it is something like 15 to 20 years ago.  The incidence of tuberculosis in the herds of this country is very little lower than it was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister was looking for suggestions here this morning.  If disease eradication were handed over to each individual herdsman and if at the end of a period of three to four years he was given a substantial grant, no doubt we would eradicate the disease considerably faster than we will in the way we are trying to do it at the moment.  We have to examine the 10 per cent of people who are prepared consistently to abuse the scheme itself.  Are we going to ask the 90 per cent of farmers to subsidise this 10 per cent?  There are deficiencies on all sides, on the Department side, the veterinary side and the farmers' side. The sooner the Department come up with proper inspection of all concerned the sooner we will get rid of the disease.</P>
    <P>Another measure which the Minister put into operation this year is one with which I did not agree, although I disagree to some extent with my colleague, Deputy Bruton, about this.  I am referring to the 30-day test.  The Minister should ask himself how successful this 30-day test is.  I have some figures.  It is extremely expensive on the farmers.  We tested about 800,000 cattle under the test and we managed to identify approximately 300 as diseased.  I am subject to correction on these figures.  The cost of <Col N="1397" /> this test is enormous and the results from it are not what they should be.  I have also from the Wexford marts an accurate account of what has happened since the 30-day test was put into operation. In January of this year compared with January of last year there was a reduction in sales of 43 per cent in the group of marts.  In February the reduction was 30 per cent; in March, 26 per cent; April, 20 per cent and May 25.5 per cent.  I asked the people concerned why this was happening and they told me that private sales in the county were in full swing.  They have put a man on the road to canvass the farmers to bring the cattle to the marts to be sold and to do the 30-day test.  Whatever good the Minister is doing by the test is being undone by the private sales.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the deficiencies in the test.  If my cattle are tested today I can sell them six months later&mdash;who is to say that I did not sell them between I July and 30 July&mdash;the buyer can sell them to the factory a short time after.  I can sell them in six months.  If I am prepared to abuse the test nobody can argue that I did not sell them within the 30 days allowed on the test.  The Department know that.  It is being abused right, left and centre and those figures from the Wexford marts are there as written evidence that the 30-day test is being abused and that private sales are in full swing across the county. Furthermore, as a result of the implementation of the 30-day test and the reduction in sales at the marts, 20 full-time employees were made redundant in that group of marts.  That is the effect that it has had in Wexford.  I am prepared to accept that 800,000 were tested and that 300 were identified as being diseased.  How many were sent around the county in private sales without being identified which are now right across the county?  There is no doubt that the abuse is there and will continue to be there.</P>
    <P>The cost of the 30-day test and the cost of all these actions, the 2 per cent on a £500 fat beast sold in the market and going to the factory is £10.  The figure that I got from the marts for the average cost of the 30-day test is around <Col N="1398" /> £4 per beast.  It would cost about £3 in the marts to sell the beast to the factory. That amounts to £17 per beast imposed by these regulations.  All this will not help.  Some people who have fattened cattle have informed me that if they get £40 profit per beast they are doing well, and the Minister is asking for practically half of that.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will take some notice of the question of compensation.  I am not claiming that the hard-pressed taxpayers should be asked to compensate the farmers for disease eradication completely, but the loss per annum of diseased animals is one of the biggest stumbling blocks in disease eradication. At the moment we can have a loss on replacement of cows in a herd.  The source of tuberculosis and brucellosis is the cow herds and the question of compensation is a big one.  When the Minister is extracting £10 million from the agricultural community I hope he will see fit to increase the compensation to a reasonable level whereby farmers will not be losing around £400 per cow as a result of tuberculosis and brucellosis.</P>
    <P>I would like to get back to the Bill and to refer to section 8.  The Minister stated that a significant reduction in the price of milk supplied from herds with either TB or brucellosis infection could also prove to be a most effective way of bringing home to herd owners that we cannot afford to tolerate continuing delay in getting rid of these diseases.  He also said that any funds accruing to milk processors as a result of operating a price differential system will not go to the Exchequer. Farmers will be asked to pay for the scheme and will also be penalised.  I am surprised the Department have not warned the Minister about this section. By whom is it to be exercised?  If there is brucellosis in my herd the Department will state that fact, but who is to state what the reduction per gallon in the price of my milk will be?  How long will the reduction apply?  This is a very serious section and we are in favour of its deletion.</P>
    <P>Brucellosis is a very contagious disease.   <Col N="1399" /> A farmer who is taking every precaution can find his herd infected by that of a neighbour.  I appeal to the Minister of State to make these views known to the Minister.  This objectionable section must be removed because it is ridiculous to give anyone this kind of authority.  By whom is it to be exercised?  What is to be done with the money?  A farmer whose herd has been free of infection can suddenly find that he has an infected animal and automatically he will be penalised.  The Minister described farm leaders as living in cloud cuckoo land.  If he allows this section to stand, he must be living in cloud cuckoo land.  This provision will put people out of business.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners already have sufficient powers over farmers.  It has been stated that the small butchers must keep records for the Revenue Commissioners of herd owners who sell cattle to them.  It has been stated that these butchers will have to pay the 2 per cent and also another £3 per head, but in reality these levies will be passed on to the consumer.  With the exception of city butchers, most butchers have land adjacent to their premises and they buy what are known as three-quarters finished heifers and finish them themselves.  The marts are not stopping the 2 per cent and neither will they be asked to pay the £3 per head.  The consumer will have to pay.  These levies have shaken the confidence of farmers and will damage the industry as a whole.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this issue in the interest of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>This can be regarded as an effort to justify a further levy of 2 per cent and this is very dangerous.  Eventually it will be passed to the consumer. The producer is in business and nobody can continue working at a loss or on a break-even basis.  The average beef producer has invested substantial sums of borrowed money.  It was invested at a time when he could convince lending agencies that he could and would meet his commitments to them and make a profit.  He invested money in buildings and stock.  Anyone involved in beef production or dairying has problems <Col N="1400" /> with which to contend.  There may be difficulties with the planning authority regarding silage effluent.  Large sums of money must be spent in building a proper beef or dairying unit.  Once he is in production he has to cope with the disease problem and it has been said that where there are livestock there are also dead stock.  That is an occupational hazard for which he must allow.  Now the Government are slapping on two further levies.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister and the Minister of State not to rush this dangerous legislation through the House on the eve of the Recess.  They will not lose face by having another look at it and I would be the first to compliment them if they decided to withhold it. Mistakes are made by every Government, especially when things are done in a hurry and this appears to be a very hurried piece of legislation.  It is a question of &ldquo;We must find money.  How shall we find it?  This is one way.  Let us try it&rdquo;, without really going into the consequences, dangers and problems involved.</P>
      <P>Our Minister in Europe&mdash;and now a full European membership&mdash;are endeavouring to do a job for the Irish farmers endeavouring to convince their sophisticated parliamentary colleagues that agriculture here, by their standards, is in its infancy; that we have a long road ahead before we can compete fully with our European counterparts; that we have difficulties of marketing and so on, longer distances to the market-place, as Deputy Clinton has pointed out; that we are endeavouring to break into new markets; but the most vital point, that we, as a nation, have not contributed one iota to beef mountains, dairy mountains or milk powder mountains, or butter mountains.  We have always succeeded in selling our produce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are certainly weakening the hand of our Minister and our Europarliamentarians in imposing this levy. When they are fighting this co-responsibility levy and all the other levies that will be imposed without doubt, how can they argue against a co-responsibility levy when they can be told &ldquo;You are doing exactly the same thing at <Col N="1401" /> home.  Have you not levies of 2 per cent, levies for the eradication of bovine diseases? Are you not thinking about levies to pay for your advisory services?&rdquo; We shall be a laughing stock if we try to fight a levy in the European market place.  We cannot argue against this co-responsibility levy if we impose a levy at home.</P>
    <P>We are now talking about a 1/2p a gallon on milk and £3 a head on beef.  This is probably only the thin end of the wedge.  Inflation being what it is, what is it going to be like next year?  Will it be 2p a gallon on milk and £6 a head on beef, or what will it be?  We do not know.  Once we accept the principle, we cannot argue about the amounts.  If we, in this House, accept the principle of this levy as being a just way of paying for eradication of disease, we cannot possibly argue in future about the amounts levied.</P>
    <P>As I already said, any form of taxation or levy should be related to the person's ability to pay.  Putting this imposition on a struggling young farmer could mean all the difference between success and failure&mdash;and I mean failure. Some speakers felt that he could move out and into another operation, into tillage and so on.  That is not possible.  All his financial commitments, present and future, are already poured into this enterprise; he cannot take up his buildings and bring them to the market place and buy tractors and combine harvesters.  He is committed.  He is nailed to that policy of beef production or dairy production, and until such time as he makes sufficient money to get out he cannot do so.</P>
    <P>The effects of the levy, contrary to what some Deputies on the Labour benches think, will not be seen overnight in industry.  However, the long-term effect will be disastrous, for two reasons. Firstly, it will impair the efficiency of that young farmer.  Not only does he need finance to develop, he needs finance for day-to-day operations.  If he is having problems with his bank his operation will suffer, and there is no way that he can expand further if he cannot justify his original operation.  What are <Col N="1402" /> we doing?  We are saying to that man &ldquo;You are going to be held up&rdquo;, which is a pity, because we are only in our infancy in regard to beef and dairy production.  We have many acres of this fine country to develop further if we expend more and more in beef and dairy. We have a wonderful market place and a great future.  We have a natural, Godgiven climate to grow the cheapest food in the world for dairy animals and beef production.  Yet, when any responsible Government should be giving incentives and encouraging young people with interest-free loans&mdash;and mind you, this whole business of borrowing at the moment is a frightening operation&mdash;what are we doing?  We are providing disincentives. This is a very serious aspect of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Other sectors of the community rightly point to the farmers and say &ldquo;We think you should carry your fair share of the tax burden&rdquo;.  That has been generally accepted by farmers and everybody else. However, there is a hidden tax, a tax for which they will get no credit from anybody, because it will not be recognised by anybody as a tax.  They will still be regarded as tax evaders, although they have now on their shoulders income tax, double rates, 2 per cent levies, this levy, probably and advisory levy.  I do not know how many other levies they will have before we are finished.  This must look like an anti-farmer bias in this House, as if we are about to do them down when we should be encouraging them.  As Deputy Bermingham pointed out rightly, agriculture is a source of great employment.  The number of people employed in it at the moment is fantastic.</P>
    <P>The multi-national companies are pulling industries out at the first bit of a sneeze in their head factory; it becomes pneumonia here and they close the Irish factory down.  All these things are happening and the mainstay, the beef and dairy co-ops and fertilisers and so on, are going strength to strength, which is why I believe we here should be giving every encouragement to farmers instead of discouraging them.  Have a fair system of tax and be done with it.  Do not be putting on all these little aguisins day after day, until the farmers arrive at <Col N="1403" /> the stage where they do not know where they are.  The end result will be a stalling of further production, a holding operation at a time when we need someone to keep on forging ahead in order to ensure that our people&mdash;young people especially&mdash;will have jobs here at home, worthwhile, safe jobs, that they will not have to emigrate, but will find the necessary jobs in agriculture, there for the taking, if we continue as we have been doing.  Now we have, as it were, put on the brakes when there is no need at all to do so.  We are highly competitive; we have the right article for the market place&mdash;good quality butter, cheese, beef and horticultural products.  Everything is right; our prices are right but we are saying to the producers now: we will levy you out of existence, because that is really what we are doing.  What will the producer do?  He will be cautious, careful, almost cowardly, when production will grind slowly but surely to a halt.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter to which I might make reference, that is, the philosophy of freedom for industry enunciated by this Government time and again.  In the exercise of that freedom the co-operative movement have done their own thing.  On their own initiative they have given incentive bonuses over the years for high quality milk production, for high quality products.  Indeed because of these voluntary incentives we have been successful in putting a high quality product in the market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true to say, especially of an Irish farmer, that you can lead him but you cannot drive him.  This Bill is an effort to drive him rather than lead him and will be met with resistance all along the line. History has shown that to be the case. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister of State to have another think about this Bill.  By not allowing the market place to operate as it were, bonuses will cease to be an incentive.  It seems very unfair that a farmer who is doing everything properly, looking after <Col N="1404" /> his herd, keeping a clean and efficient herd, if landed with brucellosis through no fault his own should be classified as a third rate farmer.  God knows brucellosis, in itself, is a great penalty without having to pay another.  Any Deputy in this House who is a farmer will realise what an agonising penalty it is for a farmer whose herd is stricken.  It is nearly as bad as was leprosy of old to a farmer who has perhaps put his whole life's work into building up a dairy herd, and that is not done overnight, nor will money buy a dairy herd.  It is something that must be developed slowly.  A first class dairy herd must be built up over a period of years.  Yet overnight all that work can be undone.  That, in itself, is sufficient penalty.  Such people should be helped in every way possible instead of imposing the further penalty of getting a lesser price for their milk.  One might as well say that they are being put out of business altogether, because that is what is being done.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this is a hurried piece of legislation.  I told the Minister so last evening.  When talking to his farming colleagues, as he must, because he is a farmer himself, as is the Minister of State, surely they can come up with a better answer.  If they are short of £10 million surely there is a better way of recouping it.  But if it is done the proper way, at the end of the day, many millions of pounds will be found because people will be encouraged to continue what they have begun, that is, to expand and develop their beef and dairy herds. If anything is put in their way at present then there will be a situation in which these people will halt, which will manifest itself across the board of the economy not in £10 million but in hundreds of millions.  This stop-go type of operation is not on, particularly at present when we are so dependent on agriculture for the provision of the additional jobs so badly needed.</P>
    <P>I should prefer to see this hurried Bill deferred, when we might have another think about it after, hopefully, what will have been a hot, long summer, when we will have had time to talk to the Minister and his colleagues, when rural Deputies on the opposite benches will have been <Col N="1405" /> able to seek the advice of their farming friends and come up with a better answer.  God knows they must be embarrassed about this too&mdash;levy after levy after levy despite the fact that, at election time, they told us that they were the people with all the solutions and would ease our burdens.  That has not happened. This is the beginning of a bad series of levies.  That is why I appeal to the Minister, the Minister of State and indeed to the experts in the Department who surely can think of a better way of recovering what is comparatively small sum of money than by upsetting the whole economy and the farming community with this abominable levy.</P>

      <P>Where a person is employed by a local returning officer at an assembly election and his duties are such as to prevent him voting at his normal polling station, the local returning officer may authorise him to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.  A similar provision applies in relation to local elections.  I understand that in at least one area the local returning officer decided not to give such authorisations because of difficulties arising in the absence of polling cards.  I would point out, however, that under the law the giving of an authorisation is entirely a matter for the local returning officer.</P>

I might add that it does not help the cause of this scheme or of any scheme in the county concerned that the council do not have a priority list.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the energy crisis and the urgent need for fuel conservation, a unilateral ban will now be placed on the use of the nine inch cavity blocks for external walls in all new houses and domestic buildings, due to their low heat value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no present intention of introducing such a ban.  The present position is that from the 1 July 1979 all grant-aided houses will be required to achieve a U Value of 1.10 or better for all external walls.  This performance requirement can be achieved with the use of nine inch cavity or hollow blocks provided sufficient insulating material is included in the construction of the wall.</P>
      <P>The draft building regulations also specify a U Value of 1.10 for external walls of new houses but it is left to the builder to determine the manner and materials he will use to reach this standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to local authority housing, <Col N="1418" /> nine inch cavity or hollow blocks are not generally used in the construction of external walls.</P>
    <P>I feel that the setting of a minimum standard of insulation for external walls, as I have done in the case of grant-aided houses and as is set out in the draft building regulations, while leaving the builders the freedom to use whichever materials they choose, is the best procedure for improving the standard of insulation in houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have allocated a sum of £40,000 to the referendum returning officer for the purpose of informing voters of matters relating to the referenda.  The referendum returning officer is undertaking a publicity campaign involving advertising on radio and television and in national and provincial newspapers.  Deputies will, no doubt, have already seen the first advertisements. Further steps to inform voters at local level are being taken by local returning officers.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of encouraging people to vote, I would refer the Deputy to the Taoiseach's statement in the House on Tuesday last of the Government's plans in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the House appreciates the importance <Col N="1421" /> of these two constitutional amendments and I appeal to Deputies to play their part in ensuring the maximum voter turnout and that the amendments will be approved by the people on Thursday next.</P>

This would indicate that there is an area here which could be looked at.  I would ask the Minister to see what the possibility is of getting funds from the EEC because there are 240 jobs at stake in an area which is run down already.  It is imperative that the Minister should exercise all his options.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time I was referring to this levy and I was making the point that because farmers have a few good years the present Minister and his colleagues are endeavouring to really clean them out.  That is what they seem to be doing with this series of levies.  I was unprepared for the Minister's contribution but I found it amusing.  He said I wanted the levy deferred and that the Minister had the summer to consider it and that I wanted the Minister to consider the discruption that the 1 per cent levy would cause in County Cork in relation to disease eradication.  That is not what I said. Does the Minister think we are fools? What relationship has the levy got to disease eradication?  It has none whatsoever. If the Minister were from Grafton Street or somewhere like that I would forgive him but if a farmer like the Minister says that there is a direct relationship between the levy and disease eradication he must think we have all gone mad.  I have yet to hear such a crazy assertion by a Minister in this House, that disruption would be caused by the failure to eliminate the disease. We are aware of the disruption that <Col N="1468" /> would be caused by such a failure and we are behind the Minister in his efforts to eradicate the disease.  Nobody wants to eliminate diseases more than the farmers but for the Minister coolly to say that the levy is directly tied to the elimination of diseases is crazy.</P>

      <P>There is no other relationship between collecting levies for anything and disease eradication.  We should proceed with disease eradication with as much haste as possible in summer and winter without let-up.  Levy collecting has nothing to do with such schemes.  It is the Minister's job to get the money from his colleagues but we all know that they are not sympathetic to the needs of the farming community.  It is amazing that the Minister's rural colleagues are not rushing in to support him in his desire to introduce this levy. Where are they?  One of the Minister's colleagues told me that because the farmers had a few good years the Minister wants to hammer them.  Is that the attitude of the Minister to the farming community?  I take grave exception to the Minister's accusation that, as a responsible Deputy and farmer, I am doing something to prevent the eradication <Col N="1469" /> of bovine TB or brucellosis.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I spent many years as a voluntary member of a farming organisation encouraging farmers throughout the country to work towards the eradication of diseases to better their lot.</P>
      <P>In this debate we have lost sight of the importance of the beef and dairy industries which are only in their infancy. In order for those industries to succeed and prosper money will have to be poured into them at farmer level, factory level and all the way along the line.  We have just succeeded in capturing a little corner of the market because of the quality of our products.  It is possible for us to grow and expand but if we start at the source and hammer that, as the Minister is doing, with levy after levy we will hinder the continuance of that progress.  We will do serious damage to the farming industry and the nation. That is why I do not make any apology for asking the Minister to discuss the levy with his farming colleagues after church on Sunday and ask them for their views on the levy.  The Minister should ask Fianna Fáil backbenchers for their views because they have been very reluctant to support him on it.  Of course, they all think the Minister is mad to put this levy on top of others.</P>

      <P>This levy, on top of the others introduced by the Government, has put a big question mark in the minds of the farming community and, worse still, has put a bigger question mark in the minds of the lending agencies.  If confidence is lost in the farming community it will take a long time to recover.  I appeal to the Minister to scrap this levy before it is too late.  The farmer whose herd is hit by brucellosis will have to pay <Col N="1470" /> the levy although he will be very badly hit.  What about the farmer who is recovering from such an attack on his herd?  On top of his other commitments he will have to pay this levy.  There is no justification for the Minister's action except that the Government are short of money because, in order to win a general election, they dissipated money right across the board; they threw money away and the Minister while travelling around in his State car is now looking in every nook and cranny for money.  The Minister has fallen into the pit and it is he who will have to get out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLipper" hpid="Mr. Lipper Mr. Lipper">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lipper</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my intention to be brief because it is my belief that the subject has been milked dry.  However, having listened to the excellent contributions the Minister does not have any choice but to withdraw the Bill and review it. The Labour Party believe that those with the ability to pay tax should do so and it is the duty of the Government to ensure that such people pay their fair share of tax.  We are opposed to the Bill because there is a fundamental principle of social justice involved.  A levy of £3, plus charges per gallon of milk, are being foisted on the farming community but, ultimately, that charge will have to be met by the consumer.  Those who are in touch with reality will know that meat is conspicuous by its absence from the diet of our people.  In spite of that the Minister is imposing a charge on farmers which will mean an increase on certain produce.  When the Minister wants more loot for any of his schemes all he has to do is to adjust this increase and he has got his money.  The Labour Party feel that that principle is very wrong, and we will have to oppose it.  We feel that this is a regressive tax and it should not be imposed on anybody.  If the Minister is sincere he should go back to the Department of Finance and tell them that this is not the way to collect tax.  The Minister for Finance has a duty to tax everybody, irrespective of the trade or profession of those people, equally.  I am as conscious as anybody, inside the House or outside it, that it is important to have a scheme for the eradication of bovine TB.  It is in the interest of everybody, not alone those engaged in agriculture, that not <Col N="1471" /> only for this generation but for generations to come, we have disease-free cattle.</P>
      <P>We hope we have a Minister and a Government capable of introducing a comprehensive scheme to tackle this very serious scourge we are facing.  It is of interest to the ordinary people of the country who have no interest at all in the farming community except that they know they are there and they know the type of business they are engaged in, that we have disease-free cattle.  They are all very conscious of several illnesses people suffer from today which come from cattle, and it is important that the Minister introduces a comprehensive scheme to ensure that we have disease-free cattle.  The scheme the Minister is now introducing is comparable to Sonny Liston, with all the confidence in the world, going into the ring to take on Cassius Clay.  Poor Sonny is knocked out when his guard is down.  The Minister introduced this at the end of a session when he felt that the guard of the Opposition would be down and he would get away with such a Bill.  That cannot happen because there is no guarantee in the Minister's proposal that a proper eradication scheme will be introduced.</P>
      <P>The consumer will ultimately pay this increase.  The Labour Party, because of this, are very concerned.  We are in touch with the ordinary working class people, the less fortunate in our society, the deserted wives, the widows and the social welfare recipients who cannot put much meat on their tables today.  The Minister is now proposing to foist on the consumer through the farmer another increase in the price of meat.  This is unjust and we cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a few excellent bacon factories in Limerick city employing a considerable number of people but, because the producers of pigs no longer found it lucrative to engage in that business, they went out of business and did not produce the pigs.  Many of the factories could not keep their doors open and hundreds of people lost very good employment.  The levy proposed in this Bill is £3 now plus the increase in the gallon of milk.  If the Minister is given <Col N="1472" /> the all clear now he will be at liberty any time to adjust his rates.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of years ago we had a very serious illness among human beings and a comprehensive scheme was introduced to eradicate TB from humans. There was an incentive with that scheme.  People were encouraged to get treatment and if they were hospitalised the State financed their stay in hospital. We had the elimination of TB among humans because of that scheme.  The Government decided then that the problem could not be tackled just by tipping the iceberg, trying to fiddle around the same as the Minister is doing in this Bill.  They gave incentives to people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an obligation to eradicate bovine TB but he has not shown so far that he is serious about tackling the problem.  He is trying to get money from farmers which will ultimately be passed on to consumers.  The Exchequer should finance this very important scheme.  If the Minister brought in a scheme like that he would get the support from all sides of the House.  The man in the factory who is depending on cattle for his employment will be very seriously affected.  I do not mind the Minister smiling, but I want to assure him that we have had experience in Limerick city where very good employment was given in bacon factories and because the people involved in pig production got out of that business those workers found that the factory gates could not be kept open any longer.  If farmers decide to get out of cattle production there will be a serious situation and people engaged in the industry will find themselves in the dole queues.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believe that people should pay tax.  We insist that those who are able should do so but this is no way to tax people.  It is wrong and unjust. Once this levy is adopted the Minister can adjust it.  At the moment people cannot afford to buy meat and they will certainly not be able to buy it if this levy is introduced.  The Labour Party oppose the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Minister my opinion in the hope that common <Col N="1473" /> sense will prevail.  I am the Deputy for South Tipperary and the farming community form a large proportion of my constituents.  They have come to me individually and collectively asking me to bring their views on this vexed question to the notice of the Minister.  As farmers in the Golden Vale they feel that this Bill will affect them most severely.</P>
      <P>I wish to leave the Minister in no doubt as to where I stand on this measure.  I oppose it categorically and unequivocally.  I realise that the Government have a large majority in this House and my vote will not affect the passage of this Bill.  The farming community in South Tipperary are bewildered at this further levy.  They feel they are being victimised once more by this Government, they think they are being singled out and they accuse the Minister of being totally insensitive to the situation as it affects farmers.  This levy is a further barrier between urban and rural Ireland and will cause great divisions.  This levy follows on a succession of levies.  The Government have introduced punitive legislation; there have been capital acquisition and gift taxes, there has been a crippling increase in the rates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair, but I think we should jog the Minister's memory about what has gone on and what he has helped to introduce against the farming community.  The Minister came back from Brussels recently with one hand as long as the other with regard to milk production. We are told a price freeze is to be introduced. He had the audacity to accuse the leaders of the farming community that they were living in cloud cuckoo land&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister had the audacity this morning to verbally assault his illustrious predecessor, Deputy Clinton.  Perhaps it is worth jogging his memory.  When the former Minister <Col N="1475" /> came into office the income of the farming community amounted to £250 million per year but when he left office it was £950 million.  These figures speak for themselves.  They are incontrovertible and cannot be challenged.  If the Minister has any doubt about the popularity of his predecessor he has only to check his vote in the recent Euro-election where the former Minister swept to victory with overwhelming support from the farming community.</P>

      <P>I am trying to build up the case for the farming community. This winter has been the winter of discontent among the farming community. Despair and gloom were cast over the countryside partly due to the elements outside the Minister's control but also due to measures brought about by the Government, and particularly by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Many young farmers have made deep commitments to agriculture&mdash;milking and silage layouts, the purchase of extra land and machinery and so on.  They have committed not only themselves but their children for years ahead.  It is against this background that I want to inform the Minister of the true feelings of the farmers of south Tipperary and south Kilkenny.  They look upon this extra levy as a further disincentive to progress.  It will sap the confidence, enthusiasm and drive needed among our young farmers if they are to be competitive in the EEC.  Once confidence in the farming community goes it will be very hard to restore it.  Lending and banking associations will feel this lack of confidence and the urban and rural communities will suffer the consequences.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that land, particularly the top ten inches, is one of the greatest assets.  What is below the earth in minerals or in our seas are extra bonanzas but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Before the interruption I was attempting to bring home to the Minister for Agriculture the consequences of the implementation of the levies proposed in this Bill from the rural point of view.  I would like also to bring home to him the effects this could and will have on the urban dweller, particularly the consumer.  The butchers will pass on the levy of £3 on slaughtered animals to the consumer.  Consequently, meat will become much dearer and less <Col N="1478" /> available to the urban dwellers.  Naturally the price of milk will increase, but perhaps by only a small amount.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about a statement in today's paper from the prestigious and reputable association, the Irish Livestock Exporters' Association.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The association's secretary was quite concerned and hoped the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance would take cognisance of this fact and of the irreparable damage this must inevitably cause to farmers and to the economy of the country.  They are concerned that a further levy might be imposed&mdash;50p per animal&mdash;to fund the activities of the CBF.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chairman of the Irish Farmers' Association national and animal health committee also said that imposition of these levies on beef cattle now amounted to the enormous figure of £16 per head. <Col N="1479" /> That is absolutely monstrous.  It will remove the profitability from beef herds and it will be a discouragement to export or even raise cattle.  A number of young farmers in Tipperary have indicated that should this and subsequent levies be imposed they will go away from milk production despite their deep commitment buildingwise and their financial commitments in the production of milk. If this happens surely it will be a national loss not alone to rural Ireland but also to urban Ireland and to the economy at large.</P>
    <P>We all laud any efforts made to eradicate bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis. This year the figure for the eradication of these diseases will, as the Minister said, amount to roughly £22 million.  He hopes through the imposition of these levies to collect £10 million.  If this £10 million is collected it will be rfrom the point of view of the economy and of the goodwill of the farming community, the costliest £10 million collected by any Government in this State. I suggest that the Minister have a second look at this, but he seems to be unrepentant and to take pleasure in imposing further penalties on the farming community. I hope he will have another look at this to see if an alternative method can be arranged so that this £22 million can be got from Exchequer funds.  To draw a parallel, it is as though a person suffering from tuberculosis were to be charged the full cost of treatment in a sanitorium or a hospital.  It is as outrageous as that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about some sections in the Bill.  Section 2 (2) states that the amount of levy payable:</P>
    <P>... stands for the time being so prescribed, £3 per animal.</P>
    <P>The Minister can at a whim increase that to £5 per animal.  There is no clear indication that it will be £3 and only £3. Likewise the charge on milk is:</P>
    <P>... for the time being so prescribed, 0.5 new pence per gallon.</P>
    <P>Again, in the next budget, perhaps, the Minister can double, triple or quadruple that.</P>
    <P>The farming community have an inbred fear of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1480" /> and their inspectors.  They feel that the prying eyes of the Revenue Commissioners will be delving into their private affairs, their books, bank accounts and various other matters and they are naturally and understandably worried about this further extension of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to inquire into their private affairs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could do with a little teaching in that regard.  He must be aware that the older farmers especially despise keeping accounts.  They are not prepared for it.  Perhaps the younger generation of farmers are more suited to keeping accounts and records than are the older generation.  Here they are being asked to keep further accounts.</P>
      <P>Section 10 concerns information to the Minister as regards land used for or in connection with the grazing or retention of animals.  Here again there may be concern that there will be undue pressures on the farmers, undue inquiries made, undue interference with private deals of grazing of land and retention of animals on land.</P>
      <P>Section 12 refers to the inspection and removal of records.  Here we are setting a dangerous precedent where an inspector or officer may request the production of or may search for and inspect any records, books or other documents whatsoever relating to milk or to animals.  This is giving them too much power when they can go in and search, forcibly I suspect if necessary, for these documents.  The privacy and sanctity of a man's house is being contravened here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 states that under this Act proceedings may be instituted at any time within two years after the date of the offence.  I am not a legal man, but to <Col N="1481" /> my knowledge in other offences this is limited to six months.  Here again the farmers are being treated in an exceptional manner and more punitively than any other person.  I believe that section to be unconstitutional and I would like to see it challenged in the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 20 leaves some doubt in my mind.  It says:</P>
    <P>Moneys paid to the Minister in pursuance of any provision of this Act shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Finance may direct.</P>
    <P>I thought that all money accruing to the Minister under this Act would be employed solely for the eradication of bovine diseases and is not to be used at the discretion of the Minister for Finance.  I hope that the Minister will amend that and that he will insist that moneys so gathered from the farming community, this £10 million, will go exclusively for the purpose for which it was extracted, that is the eradication of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.</P>
    <P>This Bill, especially in section 22, implies that among the farming community there are many criminals who are always out to falsify, alter, ante-date or counterfeit ear tags and to defy the Government and the law of the land. This is totally unfair to the farming community, especially when the high level of penalties is considered.  I do not know of any other section of the community who would be penalised to the extent of £2,000 at the discretion of the court, or sentenced to a term not exceeding two years.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to have another look at this.  Members <Col N="1482" /> on this side of the House have noted that no Member at all and especially no rural Member in the Minister's own party has given him any support in the implementation of this Bill.  If he took a head count of his rural Deputies it would be interesting to know what support he would have for the introduction of this levy.</P>
      <P>This Bill is reminiscent of the struggle between landlords and tenant farmers and it ill behoves the Minister in this centenary year of Michael Davitt to impose further levies on the farming community. In the name of sanity I would urge him to reconsider.  We all know that bovine TB and tuberculosis must be eradicated and rather than impose this penal levy on those who are unfortunate enough to have diseased animals we should give them every encouragement to get rid of them.  The grants available will not adequately compensate any farmer for replacing a diseased animal.</P>
      <P>The Minister must regain the confidence of the farming community.  They have indicated that they are prepared to pay their fair share of taxation.  The Minister would find them responsive to other suggestions, especially those which would not impose further levies.  As a rural Deputy representing some farming constituents I oppose this Bill and hope the Minister will have a change of heart. In these difficult times farmers must face the competitiveness of their Northern Ireland and European counterparts and every encouragement should be given to them to meet the challenge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The worst provision in this Bill relates to the price differential as between milk from disease-free herds and that from infected herds.  The implication is that dairy farmers would deliberately introduce or welcome brucellosis into their herds.  It is well known that an outbreak can occur in any herd without any reasonable explanation. Why should the owner be victimised in such circumstances by receiving a reduced price for milk?  Very little consideration is shown for the man who has the problem of replacing the herd. These diseases are very contagious and would most easily occur in congested areas because of ease of contact with adjacent farms.</P>
      <P>I particularly refer to County Clare where over 30 million gallons of milk is produced and where production during the last few years has been so notable that the co-operative intend to build a processing factory within the county. The Minister will be responsible if this provision so discourages dairy farmers that they do not consider it worth while to continue in a business which does not provide a steady income.  Serious consideration has not been given to this provision and I ask the Minister to delete it completely.  The farmer is not responsible for an outbreak of disease and there should not be a reduced price for milk from infected herds.  It is well known that milk from an infected animal would not show any infection.</P>

      <P>Possibly for TB, but however I shall not dispute the veterinary judgment done on this particular line.</P>
      <P>I am totally opposed to this provision for the reasons stated and would ask the Minister to give thought to the smaller producer in the congested area where the incidence of that disease would be more likely to spread.  These are the people who are the backbone of the dairy industry and of the cattle trade.  They are stuck firmly to a limited acreage, with no hope of expansion of that acreage because of the congestion.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to give the matter the necessary thought and to leave it in that provision.  I fail to see why the dairy farmer should carry the cost of the implementation of a scheme. You might as well say that our teachers should carry the cost of the Department's inspectorate or that industries should bear the cost of the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The same logic could apply in regard to our different Departments.  The load appears to be laid more heavily on the dairy farmer than on most.  This weight of taxation and of levies is entirely unprecedented. I am asking the Minister to be reasonable and not to differentiate between the price of milk from an infected herd and that from a free herd.</P>

      <P>All I know is that the Minister gave back to the Minister for Finance £7½ million of that, unspent, although I had an agreement with the farmers and the veterinary profession that immediately the first round was finished we would start the second round in an effort to get ahead as fast as possible with the eradication of disease.</P>

      <P>If the Minister talks like this, it is right that the House should know exactly what happened in 1974 and why, because the Minister knows it only too well but wants to try to deceive the people into believing that what he says here is correct in all this. 4What happened in the couple of years leading up to 1974, of course, was that prices were rising.  They were rising, in fact, before we joined the EEC in anticipation of higher prices.  Cows which normally would have been culled were kept on for at least two years extra in order to obtain extra calves that would secure this enormous price increase that was coming up.  It was quite a sensible decision in the normal way.  It was also quite a sensible decision, when a drastic drop took place in the price of cattle and beef in 1974, that they should decide <Col N="1486" /> that this was the right time to get rid of these animals as they were overdue for getting rid of in any case.  I hope that that was the right decision for me at the time, as Minister for Agriculture, to ensure that when&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the feeling that it is relevant because we are all very concerned about cattle numbers, about cow numbers to produce milk and to produce cattle for the beef herd as a result.  I certainly can assure the Minister that I am as anxious as he is that this should be so. He did not refer to the fact, and did not explain the fact, that in the last year 20 per cent of the cow herd were slaughtered.  He has not said why that happened.  Why has it happened?  I want the Minister to tell us why 400,000 cows were slaughtered last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone knows that the cause of the slump in 1974 was that there were absolute miscalculations made by the Commission in Brussels, that there were imports allowed from all over the globe to an extent that should never have been allowed, that there was not even a unit in existence to forecast the market or assess the future position. We were assured, two months before the collapse, that as far as they could see four years ahead, there was no danger of an excess supply in Europe.  It was an outrageous situation but that is the fact. It is outrageous of a Minister to come in here and dishonestly blame me for the fact that there was a slump in the cattle trade in 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister, when replying, will explain to the House what has gone wrong now&mdash;when 20 per cent of our cows were slaughtered last year with none of those conditions obtaining, and when prices were as high as they have ever been.  There is serious difficulty being experienced in the cattle trade because numbers are not increasing as they should be.  I had the impression that the Minister at least had a hope that he would come back from Brussels with a deal that would provide inducement to <Col N="1489" /> people to put heifers in calf, to increase our cattle numbers, but we do not even seem to have got anything on those lines.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what the Minister has in mind now&mdash;since his statement in the manifesto and so on&mdash;about a livestock development programme.  What is his new look at the whole situation?  What will he do now, because our processing capacity has doubled since 1974.  The position now is that a lot of processing factories will be in very serious difficulty unless our cattle numbers can be increased.  At the same time we are confronted with a very serious problem of disease eradication that must take place at an accelerated rate.  All of us in this House are concerned that disease be eradicated in the shortest possible time.  In this regard all of us inside and outside the House have an obligation to co-operate with the Minister and the people in his Department in every way.  I ask the Minister to state in what other country is this type of levy being imposed for disease eradication. I ask him to consider the competitiveness of our exports to Northern Ireland, to the United Kingdom, where they get very much higher grants in this respect.  How does he see the justification for imposing&mdash;on top of the very substantial losses farmers are experiencing and which they necessarily incur particularly in replacement of cows&mdash;a levy thereby increasing their burden?  He has not endeavoured to explain that.  He simply said this morning that nobody said where the money was to be found.  I say we found approximately £20 million in 1977.</P>

      <P>In 1979, the Minister&mdash;having failed to spend the money in 1977 to prove that things were not moving and that it could not be done&mdash;produces £22 million.  I say £22 million in 1979 will do no more than, if as much as, £20 million in 1977.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know from the Minister how much money we are now getting from the EEC to assist us in the cost of disease eradication.  I want to know also when that money comes, what will be the net figure he will be providing, or what is his estimated cost of an accelerated programme, what is the accelerated programme for which he is seeking this money.  As I see it, the farmers are being asked by the Government and the Minister for a blank cheque; they are not being told the total amount of money that will be necessary in any one year, this year, next year or whenever; they are not being told how long this will last.  Neither are they being told exactly how it will be used.  They are not being told the extent to which they themselves will have a say in the use of this money.</P>
      <P>The situation obtaining is that farmers &mdash;and there are many of them in the country&mdash;eradicated brucellosis from their herds entirely at their own expense without any assistance whatsoever from the State.  Indeed, I managed an institution farm where that was done with a herd of approximately 170 cows, and as many more other cattle, at no expense to the State.  Is it fair that herdowners who did that should be asked to pay now for the eradication of disease in respect of other herdowners who did not do so by the imposition of this levy?  Is any consideration being given to those people who concerned themselves with the eradication of disease within a reasonable period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent decisions about this plethora of levies being imposed by the present Government&mdash;like a lot of other things they have been doing&mdash;have not been thought through.  All sorts of difficulties are arising all over the place.  This was to have been stopped in the marts in the <Col N="1491" /> first instance.  The auctioneer in the marts was expected to know who was a butcher and who was not; the man selling to a butcher get so much less.  I am sure the craziness of the whole thing could not have escaped the attention of the Minister for Agriculture.  His influence in the Cabinet must be very small indeed when he was not able to make his voice heard sufficiently in order to overcome the stupidity of all of this.</P>

I have heard the customers talking to the butchers and <i>vice versa.</i> The butchers said: we will go to jail before we will collect this money for the Government and the customers said: if you charge us the levy, we will never stand in your shop again.  I am quite sure the Minister knows that only too well.  I am sure he has been confronted with it in Kilkenny, as I have been.  It is of very considerable significance that not as much as one Fianna Fáil Deputy got up to defend what the Minister is looking for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be no necessity for me to be here this evening complaining about the arrangements being made for two extremely important referenda which will take place this day week.  Last Tuesday Deputy Dr. FitzGerald asked the Taoiseach what arrangements were to be made in relation to holding the referenda.  Deputy Fitzgerald asked:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1492" /> What steps does the Taoiseach propose to take to alert public opinion to the fact that it is happening and to ensure that the proposals put forward are given every consideration to ensure their adoption by the Irish people?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>As far as the bringing of the importance of the referenda to the notice of the people is concerned, arrangements have been made with the RTE Authority to have a series of television and radio broadcasts.  Arrangements are also being made for the insertion of advertisements in the national press over the weekend and in the early days of next week.  Furthermore, informative leaflets will be distributed over the weekend and during next week.  By and large the public will have the opportunity of knowing what the issues are.  As far as individual parties are concerned I expect they will use their own organisation to vote and to vote in whatever way they suggest.</P>
    <P>After some exchange Deputy Dr. FitzGerald said:</P>
    <P>How are the leaflets being distributed?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach replied:</P>
    <P>We will have factual leaflets printed and they will be available on Thursday. As far as our Deputies are concerned they will be taken to their various constituencies for distribution by the local organisation.</P>
    <P>If one were legally minded there is only one interpretation that could be put on that and that is that the Government were to distribute them to the various constituencies for distribution by the organisations at local level.  However, early on it was obvious that that was not what was intended, but that it was intended that Deputies would collect them in the House today and take them to their constituencies for distribution there.  Evidently the Taoiseach was under the impression or had given instructions that the Minister for Justice would contact the Whips of the Fine Gael and <Col N="1493" /> Labour Parties and inform them of these arrangements.</P>

      <P>Evidently the Taoiseach is under the impression or has given instructions that the Minister for Justice would contact the Whips of the two parties and inform them of the arrangements about these leaflets.  Deputy Keating asked what was the text of the leaflet and the Taoiseach replied that he understood that the Minister for Justice was in touch with each of the Opposition parties.  In fact the Minister had not been in touch with the Fine Gael Whip. <Col N="1494" /> Deputy Collins, the Minister for Justice, was in the House at the time and he said:</P>
      <P>The Government Information Service is providing a statement of fact on what the issue is, that it is non-political. It will be available for distribution or collection from the Government Information Service.  It is completely non-political.  It is a publication on behalf of the Government. I had hoped to have full discussions with members of the other two parties.  I mentioned it to the Labour Party Whip briefly last week.  I was not able to talk to the Fine Gael Party Whip.</P>
      <P>That is difficult to believe because Deputy L'Estrange said that he was in the House all through the three sitting days the week before and no effort had been made to contact him about this matter.  On today's Order Paper there was a question to the Minister for the Environment:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for the Environment the total amount of money he has allocated to publicise the Referenda on the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to the Constitution and the steps he is taking to encourage people to vote in this referendum.</P>
      <P>The Minister replied that money was being made available.  Then he said that he knew the House appreciated the importance of these two constitutional amendments and appealed to Deputies to play their part in ensuring the maximum vote turnout so that the amendments would be approved by the people.  We all concur with those sentiments.  However, the urgency shown on this side of the House is far greater than that shown by the Government who have done absolutely nothing to see that sufficient leaflets were available in time or to see that there was any effort at public education in relation to these referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all recognise the danger of a very small turnout.  We had two elections on June 7 last and we will have two referenda next week.  Because of the two elections on June 7 there is a danger of a low turnout for these referenda.  That is obvious to every Deputy here and has been a matter of discussion, in our party <Col N="1495" /> anyway, for the last month.  Yet the Government appear to have done absolutely nothing to be sure that the people were informed about this.  Last Tuesday the Taoiseach was pushed by the Leader of the Opposition to say what he was doing and he said that leaflets were being printed.  When we tried to question today what these leaflets are, all we got from the Minister for the Environment, who has a responsibility in this matter, was a flippant reply.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange stated today that the Taoiseach had said that the leaflets would be available on Thursday for all Deputies to take home to their constituencies and asked where they were at present.  The Deputy asked if the Minister was aware that most Deputies had gone home and asked if the leaflets were now available in Dáil Éireann for Deputies to take home.  The Minister replied that he knew that the leaflets were available at No. 13 Mount Street today.  That may have appeared to the Minister to be very clever.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Education apologised for the Minister after he had left the House and said that it was a slip, that Deputy Barrett had not meant it that way.  I accept that the Minister had not intended this to be a political bat between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.  I object to the lack of urgency shown by the present Government in relation to these leaflets and their distribution.  We spent the last three days on the telephone from our party headquarters; I am not sure about the Labour Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of our party has been in touch with the head of the Government Information Services and we have raised the matter twice in the House within the past 72 hours in an effort to ensure that these leaflets will be available having regard to the importance we attach to these referenda.  We wish to play our part in ensuring that the referenda are passed.  We understand that the leaflets would have been sent to our headquarters <Col N="1496" /> in the past few days.  I understand that this morning the Fianna Fáil Party got 250,000 of those leaflets and our party were informed at about 11 a.m. today that there were in the region of 100,000 leaflets available to us though we could not be told exactly when they would be available.  At 4.45 this afternoon&mdash;25 minutes ago&mdash;we received a telephone call to say that at that stage the leaflets were available for Fine Gael.  I do not know whether the Labour Party have received any.  We understand that a further 100,000 will be available at 6 o'clock and yet a further amount of the same quantity in the morning.</P>
    <P>We wish to hear from the Minister how many of these leaflets were ordered. We understand that the allotment was to be of the order of between 1,500 and 2,000 per Dáil seat, or a total of about 1,250,000.  If these leaflets were ordered in sufficient time why are they only arriving now in dribs and drabs from the printers on this which is virtually the last day it will be possible to give them to Deputies for distribution and when we are only one week away from the referenda?  Why were not sufficient quantities ordered or why were not proper arrangements made to distribute the leaflets into the hearts of the constituencies? Instead, we have a state of confusion.  From what the Taoiseach said on Tuesday our understanding was that the leaflets would be available to individual Deputies before they went home today.  That is a reasonable interpretation of what was said since the Taoiseach said that the leaflets would be available to Deputies on Thursday morning.  It was reasonable to assume from that that each Deputy would be given his parcel of leaflets today, but the situation is that Deputies have been going home all through the day, not having received their quota of leaflets.  Each of the political parties have a responsibility for ensuring that there is a good turnout for these referenda.  The Minister should tell us whether the order for the leaflets was placed in sufficient time to ensure that they would be available for distribution to Deputies long before today.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to explain the rather flippant remarks he made <Col N="1497" /> earlier today.  I take it he did not intend them to be taken in a party political sense but he should tell us why Fianna Fáil members got their leaflets early this morning whereas members of this party had to wait until 4.45 this evening.  Also, I want an answer in detail as to what arrangements the Government are making now to ensure that these leaflets will be delivered to the house of every Deputy within 24 hours.  The urgency attaching to the referenda would appear to be escaping the Government.</P>
    <P>We want a promise from the Minister on behalf of the Government that vans will be dispatched tomorrow morning for the purpose of delivering an adequate supply of these leaflets to every Oireachtas Member by tomorrow night. That is the only solution that will satisfy this party.  Therefore, we must have an assurance in that regard.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the week both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice stressed the point that the leaflets are totally non-political in nature but they are leaflets that have been published by the Government at taxpayers' expense.  We should be told why one political party received two-and-a-half times the quantity received by Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Each of these referenda is very important but the one relating to the validating of adoption orders is particularly important and is of great concern to many people.  We realised that some time ago but we realised also that the absence of postal facilities would render it very difficult to make known to the people the urgency and the importance of the referenda, especially having regard to their being held within a month of the European elections and of the local government elections.  Realising all this, a week or so prior to June 7 I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment asking what proposals he had in mind in the absence of postal facilities to bring home to the electorate what was involved in these referenda.  In reply the Minister assured me that the importance of the referenda would be brought home to the electorate.  However, within a week of the referenda being held we find that proper arrangements have not been <Col N="1498" /> made to distribute literature that would help to make the people aware of what is involved.</P>
      <P>Since the local government elections were held, adoptive parents have expressed concern in many cases that all parties would join together in asking the electorate to come out and vote.  The adoptive parents feared that because the Government party have so obviously lost standing in the country, the electorate would not accept their invitation to vote.  The Minister may think that is not serious but it is a point I have heard made by a number of adoptive parents and others interested in these referenda. Therefore, it is particularly important that each political party give their support to encouraging the people to vote on Thursday next.  I took the precaution of inserting an advertisement in the local paper in my constituency on behalf of Fine Gael in which I asked people to vote on the referenda but what I am concerned about now is that Fianna Fáil people, presumably, will be outside church gates around the country on Sunday next giving the impression that this is a Fianna Fáil election matter while the Fine Gael people will not have for distribution to the people the literature that has been printed at public expense.  As Deputy Barry has said, the Taoiseach assured us on Tuesday last that Deputies would have these leaflets to take home this weekend.  It is no excuse to say that the intention was that the House would sit until tomorrow.  The Taoiseach knew yesterday that this would not be the case and, consequently, the leaflets should have been available today.  I join with Deputy Barry in asking that arrangements be made now to send copies of these leaflets to every Member of the Oireachtas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to press this point.  It is an extraordinary situation that two hours ago in the House the Minister was not able to say how many copies there are of these leaflets and that all he knew about them was that they were at the Fianna Fáil headquarters in Mount Street.  According to the Minister's statement, the decision now is that the Government have an absolute duty to deliver these leaflets in time for <Col N="1499" /> distribution to the political parties this weekend.  While we attach importance to the university issue to be voted on in the referenda in order to clear the way for legislation, it is somewhat less pressing than the other issue involved.  If the Government have any concern for the adoption situation they will put right what they have put wrong.  They are guilty of gross ineptitude in this case. However, we will do whatever we can, by whatever means may be at our disposal, to urge the electorate to ignore the tactics adopted by Fianna Fáil in this case and not to take the referenda as Fianna Fáil referenda but as referenda in which all political parties are involved. To do this effectively and to carry conviction our people, like anybody else, must be in a position to distribute these leaflets.  The Minister has a duty to ensure that they are delivered to each part of the country within 48 hours.  We can make arrangements to take that course of action.  Any other course of action would be a gross abuse of public money.</P>

The Government Press Secretary said that the Government Information Service was being used as a central distribution service and that all political parties could collect the leaflets at the Government Information Service office this afternoon and tomorrow. That is still the case.  So far, it appears that more Fianna Fáil members have collected them than have the members of Fine Gael.

      <P>The Little Angels Association, Letterkenny, have applied for sanction for the establishment of a day school for moderately mentally handicapped children.  They have been informed that, to warrant a day school, at least 20 <Col N="1440" /> suitable children of school-going age&mdash;enough for two teachers&mdash;would be needed and these children should live within daily transport distance of Letterkenny, about 15 miles.</P>
      <P>Suitable children would be those assessed as moderately mentally handicapped under the definition laid down by the Commission on Mental Handicap.  Only ten such children among those whose parents have given their consent to their enrolment in a day school in Letterkenny have been identified as fulfilling all the necessary criteria.  The establishment of a day school would, therefore, not be warranted at present but I am keeping the position under review.</P>

      <P>I interpret the question by the Deputies to refer to EEC Councils held since 21 March 1979 which were attended by me or at which I was represented by a Minister at my Department.</P>
      <P>On this basis, the Council's attended were: (a) Council (Energy) of 27 March 1979, attended by me; (b) Council (Foreign Affairs) 2-3 April 1979, attended by Mr. R. Burke, TD, Minister of State; (c) Council (Energy) 17 May 1979, attended by me; (d) Council (Energy) 18 June 1979, attended by me.</P>
      <P>Of the items discussed at these Councils, the principal items which were mainly or solely the concern of my Department and the decisions taken on them were as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  <i>Council (Energy) 27 March 1979</i></P>
      <P>(i)  Petroleum and energy market situation.</P>
      <P>It was agreed to limit consumption and importation of oil in 1979.  Long-term objectives were also proposed.</P>
      <P>(ii)  Community Energy Policy Guidelines.</P>
      <P>The Commission was requested to carry out a study of national policies. Energy saving and development of alternative sources, including coal and nuclear, were to be given priority.</P>
      <P>(iii) Monitoring of the oil market.</P>
      <P>It was agreed to improve information on oil imports with particular reference to original grades of crude oil, loading dates and component data in the price of oil and petroleum products.  Monitoring of the free markets would be resumed.</P>
      <P>(iv)  Long-Term Outlook.</P>
      <P>It is intended to open a dialogue with producer countries on the long-term outlook for trends in supply and demand in the world petroleum market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(v)  Community Crisis mechanism. The Council examined the <Col N="1447" /> problems arising in crisis arrangements to meet supply difficulties.</P>
    <P>(vi)  Limitation of oil consumption.</P>
    <P>Discussions were held on the measures to be employed in order to reduce the level of oil consumption and petroleum products.  To avoid these measures having an adverse effect on economic activity in the member states it was decided that they should be aimed at consumption of energy by Government Departments and local authorities and rational use of energy by motor vehicles. All member states were prepared to apply some of these measures.</P>
    <P>(vii)  Progress on the proceedings on coal proposals.</P>
    <P>The Council requested the Commission to submit a report on the measures taken (or in preparation) to promote the use of coal for electricity generation.  Reports on national policies regarding Community and imported coal were also required.</P>
    <P>(viii)  Demonstration Projects for Energy Saving and Alternative Energy Sources.</P>
    <P>The Commission approved financial support for energy saving and alternative energy sources.  It was agreed to introduce at a future meeting regulations concerning geothermal energy, solar energy and gasification and liquefaction of solid fuels and regulations fixing ceilings for expenditure on projects concerning alternative energy sources.</P>
    <P>(b)  <i>Council (Foreign Affairs) 2-3 April 1979</i></P>
    <P> (i) Negotiation of Textile Agreement between the Community and China.</P>
    <P>The Council agreed on a &ldquo;package&rdquo; to be offered to China in regard to imports of textiles from that country into the Community.</P>
    <P>(ii)  EEC/Japan Relations.</P>
    <P>The Council heard a report from Commission Vice-President Haferkamp on the outcome of his talks, in March 1979, with the <Col N="1448" /> Japanese Government.  The Council noted that EEC/Japan relations remained a subject for concern.  It also noted that the Commission would continue its consultations with the Japanese authorities and intended to submit an overall report in June.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Iron and Steel Industry-Aid.</P>
    <P>The Council considered further a proposed code of conduct for the grant of aids for the restructuring of the steel industry.  The Council requested the Commission to continue its efforts to find a solution to the difficulties encountered by the UK and Italy, both of which had entered reservations.</P>
    <P>(iv)  GATT Multilateral Trade Negotiations</P>
    <P>The Council noted the Commission's intention to authenticate the various texts and agreements concluded in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations and that the Commission would submit recommendations to the Council, in due course, for the formalisation of the results of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>(c)  <i>Council (Energy) 17 May 1979</i></P>
    <P>(i)  Situation of Community Oil Supplies.</P>
    <P>The Commission was asked to keep itself informed of the activities of the oil companies during the coming months and to report to the Council.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Economic consequences of the crisis.</P>
    <P>Since the rise in prices was having a negative effect on growth the Council decided to take appropriate measures to reduce oil consumption and to cope with a possible deterioration in supply. It also decided to call on the Community's industrialised partners to take similar action.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Limiting oil consumption.</P>
    <P>The measures being taken by member states were approved.  The Council objective was to maintain consumption at the 1977-78 level.  The Commission was asked to keep present activities under close scrutiny and to consider what additional measures were needed to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> (iv)  Monitoring the oil market.</P>
    <P>Measures proposed by the Commission on improving information on oil imports and prices were approved. Member states were asked to supply the relevant information to the Commission which was asked to provide an analysis of price formation mechanisms.</P>
    <P>(v)  Crisis arrangements.</P>
    <P>Certain arrangements as laid down in Decision No. 77/706 on the exporting of crude oil and petrol from one member state to another in the event of supply difficulties were approved.</P>
    <P>(d)  <i>Council (Energy) 18 June 1979</i></P>
    <P>(i)  Preparation for the meeting of the European Council on 21-22 June 1979.  Guidelines for the energy sector were prepared for reference to the European Council on</P>
    <P>(a)  a weekly analysis of oil prices paid by spot market operators and consumers for comparison with import prices.</P>
    <P>(b)  measures for compulsory recording of oil purchases.</P>
    <P>(c)  measures to stabilise and later reduce EEC oil imports.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Dialogue with producer countries.</P>
    <P>Discussions are to be held on 30 June with representatives of the producer countries.</P>
    <P>(iii) Economic consequences of the oil situation.</P>
    <P>A preliminary examination was made of a Commission communication prepared for the European Council.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Next Council Meeting</i>

    <P>The next scheduled Council meeting which may discuss matters of concern to my Department is a Foreign Affairs Council on 23-24 July 1979.  The agenda for this Council is not yet available.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 108 and 109 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Friendly Societies that there are in excess of 1,100 industrial and provident societies, each with its own separate rules, currently registered in the Registry of Friendly Societies.  It would, therefore, be impracticable in this reply to set out the names and objects of each individual society or to state what is or what is not contained in the rules.  However, a list of registered societies is published annually in the report of the Registrar of Friendly Societies.  Copies of the reports are available in the Dáil Library.  The rules of any industrial and provident society may be inspected at the Registry of Friendly Societies, 2nd Floor, Frederick Building, Setanta Centre, Dublin 2, by any interested party.  Copies of the rules may also be obtained from the registrar or from the society in question on payment of the appropriate fee.</P>
      <P>With regard to penalties for breeches of a society's rules I would draw the Deputy's attention to sections 62 to 70 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, sections 10 and 11 of the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1913, and section 28 of the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to the Bull Island.  I understand from the corporation that the position in relation to the use of lands on the island as golf courses is as follows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Anne's Golf Club had a lease of land on the Bull Island from the Vernon Estate since the 1920s.  At that time the corporation did not own any part of the island.  The Vernon Estate subsequently sold the island to the Royal Dublin Golf Club and St. Anne's Golf Club became lessees of Royal Dublin.  In 1954 Dublin Corporation bought the island, exclusive of the Royal Dublin links, from the Royal Dublin Club and consequently became the landlords of St. Anne's Golf Club.  In the 1960's the corporation decided to build the causeway road to the island in order to facilitate public access especially by car and bus to the island and to the three-and-a-half mile strand.  In order to build this access road to the beach it was necessary to ask St. Anne's Golf Club to surrender portion of their course.  St. Anne's facilitated the corporation's plans and after negotiations agreed to surrender the lands required for the road access and roundabout in return for an equivalent area of playable land.  This agreement was put into effect then and the club were granted a new lease by the corporation <Col N="1458" /> for a term of 99 years from 23 January 1971.</P>
    <P>In relation to the matter of a fence being built by St. Anne's Golf Club on the eastern boundary of their course, it is understood that a meeting is being held this week between officers of the club and officials of the corporation to discuss the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the reason for the reduction in the allocation for water and sewerage services to Meath County Council from £642,000 in 1977 to £460,000 in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation made to a local authority in any one year for water and sewerage schemes is related to the amount which it requires to finance major schemes in progress, its small schemes programme and contributions to group water schemes, the main element being the major schemes programme. As Meath County Council succeeded in constructing many of its high priority water and sewerage schemes in the period 1975 to 1977 major expenditure arose on these schemes&mdash;schemes such as Mornington, Navan, Trim, Duleek and Oldcastle sewerage schemes, Navan, Mid-Meath and East Meath Stage 3 water supply schemes&mdash;particularly in 1976 and 1977.  As the major expenditure on these schemes had been met before 1978 and as Ashbourne Sewerage Scheme was the only major scheme to get to construction in that year the council's requirements for 1978 showed a reduction on the two previous years.</P>

      <P>I attended the Council of EEC Ministers of Social Affairs on 15 May 1979.  Details of the main agenda items and decisions taken at the meeting are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  <i>Social Security for Migrant Workers</i></P>
      <P>No decision was reached on a proposed Council Regulation on the extension to self-employed workers of Regulation No. 1408/71.  The Council decided to resume its discussion of the issue at its next meeting.</P>

      <P>The Council agreed on the substance of a directive on the approximation of laws relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer.  The Commission is to draft an annex to the directive listing certain exclusions from its scope.  The directive will then be formally adopted by the Council.</P>
      <P>3.  <i>Second Programme for the Exchange of Young Workers</i></P>
      <P>The Council agreed in principle to a draft Decision on a second Joint Programme to encourage the exchange of young workers within the Community.</P>

      <P>The Council adopted conclusions requestion the Commission to continue its studies and analyses in this area with a view to establishing a Community framework for work sharing and to submit any appropriate proposals.</P>
      <P>5.  <i>Improving Relations with both sides of industry</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Council noted the Commission's communication in the matter and instructed the Permanent Representative Committee to examine further the Commission's communication in order to <Col N="1462" /> finalise an improved working method for Community tripartite meetings.</P>
    <P>6.  <i>Commission Report on the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women</i></P>
    <P>This Report was noted by the Council.</P>
    <P>7.  <i>Consultation on migration policies</i> vis-á-vis <i>third countries</i></P>
    <P>The Council instructed the Permanent Representatives Committee to examine the Commission communication in this matter and submit the results of its deliberations at a future meeting of the Council.</P>
    <P>8.  <i>Social Aspects of Iron and Steel Policy</i></P>
    <P>The Council noted a Commission memorandum on the social aspects of the restructuring of the iron and steel industry and a proposed Commission decision on the creation of special temporary allowances to help workers in the iron and steel industry under the Community's restructuring programme.  The Permanent Representatives Committee was instructed to examine the texts submitted by the Commission and to submit the results of its deliberations at a later meeting after the ECSC Consultative Committee had given its opinion.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy wishes to have more detailed information on the decisions taken at the Council I will arrange to furnish him with a copy of the Council's official press release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter of urgent importance.  I have, since the matter arose in the House ten minutes ago, checked the position further in respect of the referendum.  The position is that a quarter of a million leaflets have been delivered to the GIS. The greater part of these have been collected by Fianna Fáil already.  No copies are yet available to any other party and at this stage many Deputies and Senators have left.  I want to have this matter discussed.  We are now in a position where Government money has been spent to produce leaflets which one political party was able to distribute because of arrangements made and the other parties cannot distribute.  That is an abuse of Government funds and it is also going to produce a very negative effect on the referendum which should be one of unanimity among all parties.</P>
