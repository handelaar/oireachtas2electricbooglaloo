      <P>asked the Taoiseach, in light of recent demonstrations of public disenchantment with the PAYE system and the letter delivered to his Department by trade union leaders demanding reforms, when it is proposed to hold talks between the Government and trade unions on the reform of the PAYE tax system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6 together.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's demonstration which was carried out peacefully and with little rancour was the culmination of many years of the dissatisfaction felt by the PAYE sector at the imbalance of the income tax system.  The Government are already fully aware of this and in two successive budgets since taking office have increased allowances in order to reduce this burden.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the budget debate here on 8 February this year, I indicated that taxation in this country does not take an excessive proportion of national output, in the aggregate, by EEC standards.  I said, however, that when the incidence of taxation is examined a different picture emerges.  Those liable to tax on incomes pay on a comparatively low level of income a comparatively high level of tax, in comparison with other EEC countries.  I said that this discrepancy was due in part to the high incidence of tax on one section of the population and a correspondingly low incidence on others.  I indicated that agriculture accounts for approximately 18 per cent of national output but the proportion of income tax and rates paid by those engaged in agriculture lies somewhere around the figure of 2 per cent or 3 per cent.  I said that the Government had no desire to levy an unfair proportion of tax on any section in the population but that the present imbalance obviously creates a situation which could not be allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>I also referred in the same debate to the Government's determination that the self-employed and other persons outside the PAYE system should pay their fair share of taxes and that the campaign to tackle tax evasion should be prosecuted vigorously.  While the Government are doing this, it is only fair to point out that sufficient trained personnel cannot be recruited at once.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 27 February, the Tánaiste, the Minister for Agriculture and I met representatives of the main farming organisations.  It was agreed at that meeting that following further consultation with those organisations, the Government would devise an income tax <Col N="4" /> system for farmers that would bring in a yield from them in line with that of other sectors of the community.  The Government will go ahead with action to achieve this result.  As for the 2 per cent levy, the yield to the Exchequer will be the same whether or not the levy is operated this year, because if it is not operated farmers will pay, through the VAT system, the same amount as the levy would have yielded.</P>
    <P>On 15 March, the Tánaiste, Minister for Labour, Minister for Economic Planning and Development and I met representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to discuss a wide range of issues, dealt with in their policy proposals for a national development plan, including health services, employment and taxation.  A joint working party has been established to consider the various issues in greater depth.</P>
    <P>Discussions are also being held with the Irish Employers Confederation.  The first meeting with this organisation is to be held today.</P>
    <P>The object of all of these discussions, as I indicated on a number of occasions recently, is to achieve a common understanding on issues which affect the well-being of the worker and the community. These include the relationship between earnings, taxation, welfare, employment and inflation.  Over the years, earnings have increased considerably, in most cases bringing more and more wage and salary earners into the tax net.  By and large productivity has not matched wage increases and this has contributed to the rise in inflation which even more than tax erodes the value of the weekly pay packet.  The Government here have been tackling inflation fairly successfully since assuming office less than two years ago and are determined to win this fight. However, some excessive wage demands are being made which if granted could produce only the opposite of reductions in income tax and inflation.  The discussions which we have been having with representative organisations are over such issues as these and the necessity for balance as between the competing objectives of achieving a fairer system of taxation, increasing expenditure on health, welfare and other services and sustaining <Col N="5" /> economic growth.  These are complex issues and their resolution will take time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach prepared to stand over the statement made by the Tánaiste that the Government are not prepared to yield on the PAYE issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right that the matter should be put in context to see what exactly the Tánaiste was asked and what answer he gave.  The question to which the Tánaiste was replying was asked by a journalist in Brussels.  The question was whether he had any last minute concessions to make to PAYE workers.  The Tánaiste's reply clearly indicated that no one seriously expected last minute concessions.  The implication of the question was obviously that some concessions should be made on the eve of the march and it was in this context that the Tánaiste answered.  Incidentally, at no stage did the Tánaiste say that the marchers were wasting their time though a report in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> which was not quoting the Tánaiste directly, left one with the impression that he did say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider the setting up of a taxation review committee now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are involved now. Yesterday the Minister for Economic Planning and Development with his officials had a meeting with representatives of the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  Separate committees are being set up to discuss the various suggestions and proposals made in the congress document which was adopted by delegates of congress a couple of weeks ago and taxation is simply one of the subjects which will be discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that there is justice in the PAYE wage and salary earners case that they pay a disproportionate share to the Exchequer?  Would he agree that <Col N="6" /> there is need to focus on the immediate demands of PAYE wage and salary earners in the same manner as there has been a response to the demands of farmers for a revision of the tax code in relation to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>All these are matters that ought to be discussed with the interests concerned and in recent speeches long before the march was contemplated I referred to that very point.  In a speech on 2 March I said that consultation and discussion are necessary to help reduce the area of misunderstanding and to support a common programme of action.  I said that there was widespread agreement that this should be the procedure for tackling controversial or disputed issues&mdash;an attitude which was reflected, for example, in the movement towards industrial democracy, that if that trend towards greater participation in decision making is to be successful it must embrace and reflect the interest of all major groups in the community and not become the prerogative of any one section, however privileged or powerful. That is exactly what we are doing.  In current discussions we are embracing as wide a context and perspective of people as is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that some of the policies pursued by the Government in the past 20 months, including the abolition of wealth tax and the removal of food subsidies, have heightened the sense of injustice on the part of PAYE taxpayers?  Have the Government any intention of reversing those anti-social policies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is relating to a matter which is widening the subject and which is not covered by any of the six questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I repeat&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We may not have a debate as wide as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that in the interest of the relevancy of this institution there is need for a constructive response on the <Col N="7" /> part of the Government to the widespread demands for a review of the present taxation code as it bears on wage and salary workers?  Is it not incumbent on the Taoiseach as head of Government to respond constructively as speedily as possible, that is, if the relevancy of the Government and of our democratic way of life are to be preserved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The response from us could not have been more speedy and constructive.  May I repeat that within days of the delegate conference of the unions who are affiliated to the ICTU at which the congress proposals were endorsed, we acceded immediately to their request to meet them.  We met them within days and I proposed at that meeting&mdash;that was on Thursday last&mdash;that we set about the task of setting up immediately a steering working party committee.  We agreed to meet again yesterday.  That meeting took place and there will be another meeting tomorrow.  As I have indicated also, we are meeting the employers confederation this afternoon.  Therefore, the Deputy could hardly expect a more speedy or constructive response than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the policies pursued by the Government in the past 20 months have increased the sense of injustice on the part of PAYE people?  Is it the Government's intention to reverse those policies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These matters ought to be put in their proper perspective.  The decision on wealth tax&mdash;and I think this has been successful&mdash;was for the main purpose of generating employment by ensuring that sufficient capital would be kept in the country to generate increased employment opportunities.  The food subsidies were introduced at a time when inflation was running at a level of from 20 to 25 per cent.  These subsidies were introduced following a suggestion from this party who were then in Opposition. But these conditions no longer obtain. Inflation has been reduced to less than half the level which obtained then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that we would not be in a position where the Government were practically moving from response to response, staggering from blow to blow, if they had not made the blunders which had such a divisive effect on our society?  In relation to the Taoiseach's reference to increased allowances as announced in the budget, would he agree in retrospect that the process of abolishing the lowest band and clawing back the social security contributions was the kind of trick that the people resent and that it is that kind of action, together with the type of anti-social policies referred to by Deputy Mitchell that have led to this massive resistance to the Government's policies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question whatever of a trick.  The Government are elected by the people to determine policies and put them into effect as fairly as possible between one section and another.  That has been our purpose.  I might say, in respect of members of the Government and of this Dáil generally, that we, too, are liable for income tax under the PAYE system.  I make the point as a result of hearing a commentator&mdash;not an RTE commentator&mdash;say on radio this morning that we do not pay income tax.  Those of us who are in Government pay income tax on our salaries as Members of the Dáil as well as on our salaries as Ministers.  That ought to be said because some people seem to forget it.  To the extent that there might be any suggestion of alienation from other PAYE payers, we are all in the same boat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has said that food subsidies were introduced at a time when inflation was at a level of between 20 and 25 per cent but in view of the latest figures published which show that the food element in the consumer index shows approximately an 18 per cent increase, would the Government consider an immediate reintroduction of food subsidies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in any of the six questions about food subsidies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Mitchell the Taoiseach said that the reason for abolishing the wealth tax was to encourage employment and that that policy had been successful.  In what sector of the economy is it demonstrable or even probable that the abolition of wealth tax increased employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Right across the economy.  Of all the EEC countries, unemployment has been reduced only in Ireland, in Germany and in one other. Surely the abolition of wealth tax was a contributory factor in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a sense of fantasy inherent in that suggestion and in the suggestion that the abolition of a resource tax increases output but that the introduction of other resource taxes would also increase output?  Would the Taoiseach agree that the immediately <Col N="10" /> precipitating factor in the present crisis was the statement by the Minister for Agriculture after the meeting with the farmer organisations that he was pleased that the farmer organisations had expressed a willingness to work out an income tax system that would be equitable?  Was it not the reaction of the rest of the community against the suggestion that one sector would work out their own income tax system that precipitated the problem?  Should not the tax system be worked out by the Government equitably as between the different groups?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard Deputy FitzGerald make that comment in a radio interview this afternoon.  He made many other comments also during that interview but he did not refer to the fact that the PAYE system was in existence also during his period in office and that there was no attempt then to change it. The official statement that was issued after the meeting that the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture and I had with farmer organisations was that the Government would consult immediately with the representatives of the farmer organisations attending the meeting and would devise an income tax system for the farmers that would bring a yield in line with that of other sectors of the community.  It is stated clearly there and I said this subsequently, that the Government would devise a system. If the farmers do not agree to the system, certain other actions will follow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that it was the statement of the Minister for Agriculture which had a different effect and which precipitated the problem?  Would the Taoiseach agree also that the policies we pursued in relation to taxation did not result in bringing onto the streets 200,000 people?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would he not agree that the reason this did not happen was <Col N="11" /> because of the measures we took to achieve social justice by removing VAT from food and clothing, by bringing down the income tax rates, by reforming capital taxes, by introducing farm taxation and by introducing food subsidies?</P>

In the context of the present talks with the unions on which so much depends in regard to wage settlements, does the Taoiseach see any prospect of relief for PAYE wage and salary earners as a result of the talks?

      <P>It might be that the Deputy would like to see a crisis created. I do not see any such crisis because of the series of consultations on which we have embarked.  I repeat that they were embarked upon before this march took place or was envisaged.  I encouraged that kind of consultation in speeches I made as far back as January, from which I have quoted in reply to supplementaries. I will not anticipate the outcome of talks with the ICTU Executive Council.  I do not think the Deputy would expect any member of congress to anticipate the outcome either.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the estimated income per head in Ireland per full-time farmer and estimated income per head in non-farm occupations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible to make only approximate estimates of the particulars requested.  The information available on income relates to that arising in different sectors and is estimated in aggregate form for the national accounts. There are a number of difficulties in using these estimates to derive average income per head figures since some of the income generated in one sector may accrue to persons outside that sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information available in respect of income from farming is the series of estimates, relating to calendar years, of the income from self-employment and other trading income arising in agriculture as a whole.  This income represents the amount available to remunerate farm holders and members of their families for their labour and management and to cover interest on capital.  The estimated total figure in 1977 was £743 million.  A breakdown of this income between full-time farmers and others is not available.  The number of persons, excluding employees, whose <Col N="14" /> principal occupation was in agriculture was estimated at 208,000 in 1977.  These two aggregates, which are not strictly comparable in scope and coverage, yield an average of £3,572 for 1977.</P>
    <P>For non-farming occupations the relevant aggregated income generated relates to income for self-employment and other trading income in the non-agricultural sector together with remuneration of employees in that sector. In 1977 this amounted to £3,258 million.  It is estimated that in 1977 there were 808,000 persons at work in non-agricultural occupations.  These two aggregates, which are not strictly comparable in scope and coverage, yield an average of £4,032 for 1977.</P>

We are producing physical education graduates from Limerick for the last four years and halls have not been built.  It is a retrograde step to decide to delete physical education halls from new schools because we have qualified teachers to teach physical education and a physical education hall is as important as a science laboratory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans at present formally to designate such areas. My priorities are determined by the needs of the individual child, irrespective of where he or she lives.  The most immediate of these priorities is to reduce the size of large classes in primary schools which have a particularly adverse effect on socially disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, a total of 900 extra teaching posts have been created for this purpose in the current school year.  One hundred of these posts are being allocated on a selective basis for remedial work in schools where there is a serious problem of backwardness. Many such schools serve disadvantaged areas as defined in my reply to the Deputy of 10 November last.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that disadvantaged children are much more concentrated in some areas than others and that the mere allocation of 100 extra teachers, not all of whom will go to these areas, in no way meets the need for educational priority area policy?</P>

      <P>My commitment to improving the position in disadvantaged areas involves being more than flexible in regard to the pupil-teacher ratio in some of the disadvantaged areas as distinct from dealing with disadvantaged children, no matter which areas they are in.  In some of the disadvantaged areas the pupil numbers have gone down and consequently schools are in danger of losing teachers.  In such cases I tend to allow the retention of teachers even when the pupil numbers are not there. There is a commitment in regard to remedial teachers, and discrimination in favour of disadvantaged areas is exercised by many in the allocation of remedial teachers.</P>

      <P>Many things have happened since then.  I am sure there is no need to remind the Minister what has happened since the debate adjourned. This is a very important Bill dealing with the lower income group.  One of the important items of news we got over the weekend was the factual increase in the cost of living over the past 12 months. We were told that the cost of all essential commodities increased by 17.9 per cent. If the Minister accepts this figure as a factual assessment of the position, he must agree that the increases proposed in this Bill are inadequate.  The increase <Col N="153" /> proposed for certain recipients of social welfare benefits is 16 per cent and for others 12 per cent.  The Minister should have a serious look at this matter before this Bill leaves the Dáil.  The factual increase in the cost of living, given over the weekend, is 17.9 per cent, 5 per cent in excess of the increase granted to some social welfare recipients and almost 2 per cent in excess of the increase granted to others.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday I asked the Minister to delete section 4.  I will not go over that ground again.  Section 4 deals with unemployment assistance payable to small farmers on a notional assessment based on their land valuations.  The Government were able to say that they would not ask the wealthy sections to pay any taxation through the wealth tax approved in this House by the Coalition Government.  They were able to say that irrespective of the size of the mansion one lived in one would not be asked to pay rates.  The Government also decided not to ask the motoring public the position of the people affected by this measure as they see it.  There was an aura of affluence about the election campaign. In their manifesto Fianna Fáil promised almost everything, but they did not promise that within a very short time of assuming office they would hit this section of the community.  I would ask the Minister to re-think the position.  The reductions proposed are fairly substantial and will have a drastic affect.  If the Minister will not delete the section, I would ask him to modify its contents.  It is hard to expect these people to accept a decrease of £8, £9 or £10 per week in their income when the cost of living has increased by 18 per cent in the last 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Wednesday I also appealed for the restructuring of the old age pension system.  Pensions are paid without variation except in relation to age at present. When a person moves beyond the 80 age limit, he gets £1 or £1.10 of an increase. There should be a classification of pensioners with emphasis on pensioners who are severely incapacitated, either mentally or physically, who cannot get assistance from a health board at present.  It is impossible in my area to <Col N="154" /> qualify for supplementary allowances. The Minister in this legislation or in subsequent legislation should focus attention on giving extra to those who need it. Some old age pensioners, because of family circumstances, can live reasonably well on the present allowance but pensioners who depend solely on the allowance find it very hard to live.  In south-west Cork the average cost of keeping an old person in hospital is £100 per week.  It would be of considerable advantage if the Minister made a financial contribution to the relatives towards keeping at home old people who, in general, do not wish to be institutionalised. It is the primary duty of children to look after their parents and I am not overlooking that fact.  However, incapacitated old people who need constant care and attention impose great financial hardship and it is upon these cases that I am asking the Minister to cast his eye.  Within the framework of present legislation it is possible legally to pay out a disabled persons' allowance to persons over 66 years of age, but that is not happening.  The eight health boards automatically cut people over 66 from their entitlement to disability allowance. This is a local and not a mandatory action. It would be quite legal to continue payment of that allowance where deemed necessary beyond the age of 66. I would be glad if the Minister would address himself to that aspect.</P>
    <P>I assume that by ministerial order the scope of the prescribed relative allowance could be extended.  By extending this we could help to keep people at home rather than in institutions and this would save administrative expenses. If circumstances warrant it the prescribed relative allowance should be payable to daughter-in-law as well as daughters or sons living alone with the applicant.  At the moment where a pensioner lives in a house with a daughter, when the daughter gets married the allowance is cut off.  I could not possibly say what the cost of continuing that allowance would be but it would not be too great.  The Minister should ask his Department to inquire into it because it seems to be quite feasible.</P>
    <P>Another way of helping old people <Col N="155" /> would be to broaden the scope of the prescribed relative allowance system. The Minister should, next year, follow the example of the Coalition Government by reducing the qualifying age limit.  It is amazing that the Coalition could reduce the pension age from 70 years to 66 years within a four-year period and Fianna Fáil, who have been in office for almost 40 years, could not reduce it by one year.  Over the years I put down questions about the desirability of reducing the qualifying age limit and was told that the cost would be too great and that it would be impossible to do so.  Not only did the Coalition reduce the age limit but they also included the wives of pensioners irrespective of age.</P>
    <P>On the question of unemployment benefit, which has been increased by 16 per cent, we were told that Fianna Fáil would create a position where unemployment would gradually disappear. That objective has not been reached. Any reduction in unemployment can be attributed in part to the fact that there was a great deal of emigration last year. The official figure is 14,000.  We had a communication from Father O'Callaghan, the Director of Catholic Chaplains, on the position of some of our emigrants, particularly young people, who were forced to emigrate to Britain because they were unable to do anything for them here.  Perhaps the Government privately welcome emigration as a way of dealing with the surplus population which they cannot provide for.</P>
    <P>It is not good to pay money to able-bodied men for doing nothing.  I have been saying that in this House for a long time.  It is all right to pay money to physically handicapped people; but some system should be devised, either by departmental committees or otherwise, where useful and productive work could be carried out by those qualifying for unemployment benefit.  There are many schemes in the towns and cities, such as environmental schemes, that such people could participate in.  In rural areas there are 101 different kinds of schemes including road improvements, drainage <Col N="156" /> works and amenity schemes.  If a county council employ casual workers and their work ceases, they are dismissed. They then go to the unemployment exchange and in some cases receive as much money there as they did while working.  Why not have them go to the ESB, the Land Commission, Posts and Telegraphs or the Office of Public Works and have some kind of rota system where employment would be provided in public work?  It is demoralising to ask young people, married or single, to go to an exchange or Garda station and sign their name to get this money.  In many circumstances they are entitled to it because they have been paying for it through their contributions. Would it not be better for the Department of Social Welfare to channel the money paid out under unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance into schemes that would be productive and would uplift the recipient rather than pushing him down?</P>
    <P>Great play has been made about the number of people on the unemployment register through the years.  I take the figure of 102,000 lightly, because no division has been made between those unemployed and trying to get work and those unemployed and not trying to get work or who cannot work.  When the Minister tells us that there are 102,000 on the register I am sure that there are not 102,000 people breaking their necks to get work.  There should be a different kind of classification because many of the people on the register are middle-aged and are not in the best of health. They are more social cases than people anxious to obtain employment.  I am amazed that the Department of Social Welfare do not realise that.  What is the exact number of people who are unemployed and anxious to obtain work? What is the number of people who are on the register and are not available for work for one reason or another?  It is essential to have such a breakdown.  One hears of areas where there is high unemployment and yet when a person wants to have a job done it is impossible to get anybody to do it.  That is a fact and the State must take cognisance of its existence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> The Minister for Social Welfare must address himself to this question and endeavour to revise the system of recording those on the unemployment list. First of all, those who are not designated as social cases, who are not actually in the market place for work, should be set aside.  Their number should be deducted from the overall figure of those in receipt of benefit when we would be in a position to see how many people are unemployed and seeking work.  Having established that figure, surely it would be possible to devise some scheme to ensure that those in the market place for employment get it and can do productive ing it punishable for them if they do work.  If they do a day's work they are not supposed to draw unemployment benefit for that day; they are supposed to remain idle while they are receiving that money.</P>
    <P>To start off one's career on unemployment assistance is a very bad beginning for any young boy or girl and we, as a State and people, should be endeavouring to do away with that system. Instead, we should be endeavouring to boost young people's morale rather than diminishing it.  We should endeavour to implement useful schemes in this respect. If there is not industrial employment available in different areas, there is a plentiful supply of alternative employment which in its own way is quite productive&mdash;at least it is very much more productive than paying money for nothing.  Hence I have in mind the numerous amenity schemes&mdash;road improvements, drainage, environmental schemes and so on&mdash;on which we could very usefully deploy our unemployed.  If such a system obtained we would not be asking a worker and his employer for what at present amounts to some £8 weekly in respect of each worker.  In such circumstances it would transpire that the worker would have to pay the total amount because the employer would take into account the fact that he had to pay approximately £5 weekly for each worker he employed.  This, in turn, would have a bearing on the rate of remuneration he would pay.  We owe it <Col N="158" /> to our young people to do something about the existing system.  This matter has been raised in this House from time to time.  I have been a Deputy a reasonably long time but nothing has been done in that field during that period.  There are numerous public departments employing people.  As soon as their work is completed these employees are laid off, with no alternative source of employment and they have to go on to the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>I had thought that the appointment of Deputy O'Donoghue as Minister for Economic Planning and Development would ensure the co-ordination of the efforts of the various State Departments. At present each of these Departments operate as if no other Department existed. They do not work in a cooperative spirit.  For example, the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will not ask the ESB, CIE, any other Department or public agency if they have employment for a particular man when they have no further need of him.  There must be some co-ordination of effort.  I shall be taking up the time of the House this evening on that question because I consider it sufficiently important.</P>
    <P>My main objective is to see in productive employment our people who are in the market place for work.  I want to see a reduction in the numbers attending labour exchanges or going to Garda stations signing for unemployment benefit or assistance.  It was not a part of our tradition and it should disappear from the scene as quickly as possible. However, without it people could not exist at present and could not in the future until some Government do something about it.  I shall not labour that question further, although it is one on which I feel strongly.  I have said over the years that governments should be endeavouring to do something to keep able-bodied men away from labour exchanges.  So many of our people are unemployed and yet there is so much work needing to be done all over the country.  Wherever one travels one hears of desirable works of a productive nature waiting to be carried out.  It is a sad reflection on the country as a whole.  Is it beyond our capacity to <Col N="159" /> do anything about it?  Is every man feeling smug in his own job saying &ldquo;What about it?  It is not part of my duty?&rdquo;  Are Ministers and Departments, or are their advisers and senior officials thinking along the same lines: the old system is there; let it be carried on?</P>
    <P>We, as public representatives, honoured with the confidence of our people and privileged to be Members of this House, are obliged to do something about it.  We are sent here to express the views of the people, having regard particularly to the circumstances prevailing in our constituencies and to those of the nation generally.  We are now reaching a dangerous stage, unhelpful to our advancement and development as a nation, when a man or woman can earn almost as much at home as abroad, so to speak. We were told that 85 per cent was the percentage of one's wage one could expect to receive at home.  Certainly one would not receive 85 per cent abroad, bearing in mind the various deductions to be made, and the average worker would not take home anything like that percentage of his nominal earnings. Therefore, this problem is one for the Government and for the Minister for Social Welfare in particular.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to the question of widows' allowances.  We all receive representations from widows, and organisations representing them, concerning improvements in their allowances. I am aware of the difficulty of getting funds to meet all the demands on the Exchequer, but if we can help the wealthy by abolishing wealth tax and not asking them to pay rates on their big houses or tax on their big cars, surely we can find some extra money for recipients of social welfare benefits.  The co-ops were also told that they had too much to do without having to pay tax and that the Government would not bother collecting it from them.  Fianna Fáil were in a very forgiving mood as far as taxes were concerned in May and June 1977 but, like the character Edmund in King Lear, the wheel has turned full circle and the people are protesting as we saw yesterday in Cork, Dublin, Galway and Donegal.</P>

      <P>Unlike the situation that existed under the National Coalition social welfare recipients will not receive a further increase in October. We were told last weekend that the cost of living for the past 12 months had risen by 17.9 per cent but the Minister has only granted such recipients an increase of 16 per cent.  One does not need to be a professor of mathematics or have an academic qualification to know that this will mean a reduction in their standard of living, because they will be at least 2 per cent worse off.  That figure will apply for the next 12 months, if the Government are still in office&mdash;there is a doubt about that as a result of what happened recently.  The stone wall of a majority could be demolished almost as quickly as it was gained with the promises of 1977.</P>
      <P>It must be very difficult for widows who have to rear children to exist on an allowance of £15.80.  I noticed last week that the steak cost £2.15 per lb. in Dublin and surely it is not possible for social welfare recipients to buy such a commodity on their allowance.  They cannot make ends meet.  I can recall when it was almost possible to buy a bullock for £2.15.  Pensioners and widows are greatly disappointed at the increase granted.</P>

    <P>We are moving towards anarchy of one kind or another.  It was brought about entirely by the Government.  I have no hesitation in asserting that as forcibly as I possibly can.

      <P>I am asking the Minister to think over this Bill again, to do a little research and to remove section 4, to broaden the scope of other sections and, if his colleagues will allow him, to increase the allowances or the percentages granted to the different classifications of recipients in the light of the marked increase in the cost of living.  We owe it to the people who are constrained to live on social welfare benefits to be more liberal in this day and age.  Having regard to the present state of our economy, the cost of living and inflation, we should give better allowances to such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the Minister for Social Welfare is committed to the Fianna Fáil Manifesto of 1977 and that every action of his in relation to the administration of the Department of Social Welfare is related to it.  He is obliged by that and he also is morally obliged to fulfil the promises so readily given in 1977.  I will not deal at any great length with the Bill before the House, but I have a few things to say which go back to the manifesto.  The first paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The vision of this manifesto is an Ireland in which a successful strategy for national re-construction offers real security for all.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the House there would be real improvements.  On page 22 of the manifesto it is stated:</P>
      <P>People in need have a right to income maintenance.  Fianna Fáil's record in improving the rates of benefit and introducing new services, including benefits in kind, is a pioneering one.  Special attention will be paid to those social welfare recipients who have little income other than their weekly social welfare benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very bold statement.  I wonder how many small farmers in County Donegal, how many widows and orphans, how many unemployed people would regard that promise.  What would the boatyard workers in Killybegs say? The Minister for Fisheries has now assured 80 of them that there will be no redundancies.  They will now have to live on reduced incomes or on social welfare <Col N="163" /> benefits.  However, I will deal with that later.</P>
    <P>In their manifesto they said:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil intends to:&mdash; Maintain the living standards of Social Welfare recipients by regular adjustments of the level of payments at least in line with the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;low&rdquo; should be inserted so that it would read that they intend to maintain the low living standards of social welfare recipients.  That is what the Minister has achieved in this Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>They refer in the manifesto to an action plan for national reconstruction. They proclaim that they are the republican party with the sole right to use that subtitle.  I hope they still believe that the people living in the six northeastern counties called Northern Ireland are part of the Irish nation.  They dealt with that part of Ireland in about ten lines in the entire document.  They talked about national reconstruction but they had not even got the vision to reduce the qualifying age for a pension from 66 years to 65 years.  If they want to harmonise the two areas of Ireland they must be blind if they do not know pensions are paid north of the Border at the age of 60 years for females and 65 years for male workers.</P>
    <P>People who were very young when the Fianna Fáil Party first took office in 1932 believed in the promises made by the former leader, the founder of that party, that the unification of Ireland was just around the corner.  When they sought work in the city of Derry or the city of Belfast or in the provincial towns in Derry, Antrim, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh they considered that a temporary measure and that the circumstances which caused them to obtain work north of the Border would iron themselves out in the near future.  They thought that they would not be at a disadvantage when they retired from their employment.  There were unable to get work in the Republic and they gave their services to the northern state.  They now find they are at a disadvantage.  They are discriminated against because they <Col N="164" /> have not reached the age of 66 years and therefore they cannot avail of the electricity allowance, free transport, free television licence or other fringe benefits which go with the old age pension.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil talked about an action plan for national reconstruction but they did not have the wisdom to attend to simple matters like that.  I spent the past couple of days in Belfast.  I should not like to have to explain to people who are dreaming of unification of Ireland or an Ireland with one Government, one Parliament, one flag, one Minister for Social Welfare how people in County Donegal have been let down by a Government who said they would give them real improvements.  They have taken away the food subsidies.  They have increased electricity charges. County council rents have increased and the Government have given meagre allowances to social welfare recipients. These are people on the lowest income in southern Irish society and we have not got the sympathy in our hearts to take into consideration the fact that those people have given their services to this nation; they have given their best years to Irish society.  But they are not as strong as the PAYE group who protested yesterday in this city; they are not as well organised as the farmers who forced the Government to stand down; they are not as well organised as the post office workers who are now fighting for their rights.  They are just simple, ordinary people&mdash;in many cases with not a lot of education&mdash;but honest-to-goodness people, the backbone of the Irish nation.  They are people who have paid their debts, brought up their children and are now living on very small incomes and we ignore them the way we do.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record, even though it bores me to read it, what Fianna Fáil said in their election manifesto in 1977.  I have already dealt with the first point.  In the second point they said they would institute a supplementary welfare allowance scheme to replace the outdated home assistance system operating at present.  That has been done; it has been called another name.  But how well off are the people who require the <Col N="165" /> benefits?  I do not see any gain.  In fact in many cases the home assistance officer was in a better position to dole out money to people who needed it immediately.</P>
    <P>In point No. 3 of the manifesto they said they would ensure that the pension rights of those who accepted voluntary phased retirement in order to release jobs would not be adversely affected. Surely that must make even the Minister blush.  There is not one shred of evidence that this has been attempted in the slightest degree since this Government took office almost two years ago, two budgets ago.</P>
    <P>In point No. 4 they said they would provide for the transferability of full pension rights on the change from one occupation to another or to a similar occupation with a new employer.  I have just referred to that.  People in employment north of the Border who find themselves out of employment and come here on retiring are very much let down. People who go north of the Border get their benefits but people who come to this side of the Border do not.  This is what this noble Fianna Fáil Party, the republican party, mean by taking action for national reconstruction.  That is what they think about it.</P>
    <P>In point No. 5 they said they would work towards the elimination of discrimination against single, married and widowed women.  Something has been achieved in that area but surely the Minister's blush must be getting redder.</P>
    <P>They said in point No. 6 they would initiate an inquiry into the operation of the means test with a view to eliminating all anomalies within that code.  Last week here in the House I asked the Minister to explain how his officials attempted to carry out a means test. Deputy Tully, former Minister for Local Government, put a specific question to the Minister about a lady in his constituency who had worked for 24 years and who was now getting unemployment benefit but her credit had run out and she could not receive unemployment assistance because her family were well enough off, on this means test, to support her.  I submit to the Minister that this is a most despicable way for the <Col N="166" /> Department of Social Welfare to get out of their responsibilities to people who not alone need money to have a certain amount of personal independence but who need money to ensure that they are not a burden on their families.  I can well imagine the Minister's official going to the house in County Donegal and saying, &ldquo;We know that you worked for ten years; we know that you paid your income tax; we know that you paid up all your stamps; we know that you have never drawn unemployment benefit until you became redundant two or three years ago but now your credit is gone and you must go on unemployment assistance but because your father owns a small farm or because your mother has an independent income and because you are living here we are going to charge you with the amount of money that we believe it costs to maintain you in this house&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What the Minister's official is really saying is that the Government are no longer responsible to that insured person who is now out of credit.  They are asking the family how much it costs to keep their daughter in the house each week; how much it costs to provide her with a bed, with breakfast, lunch, dinner and supper; how much it costs to give her a few shillings to keep her clothed.  The Department official estimates that to be £18 a week so they say that they are now going to charge the daughter with a means of £18 a week.  In other words, he is saying to the family that they must give him £18 a week so that he can give it to the daughter so that the daughter can give it back to the family.  But the arithmetic of all that is that the Government are saying &ldquo;We owe your daughter nothing&rdquo;.  I will repeat the point in the manifesto again&mdash;&ldquo;initiate an inquiry into the operation of the means test with a view to eliminating all anomalies within the code.&rdquo;  That must have been thought out by experts, the think-tank of the Fianna Fáil Party, over two years ago and it must have been read by many people who voted for this Government. It must have meant that people voted for Fianna Fáil because point No. 6 on page 17 of their manifesto, &ldquo;Action Plan for National Reconstruction&rdquo;, says this. There are many people who would have <Col N="167" /> read that and who, under the National Coalition Government, would have said that because their families had a certain standing in life, a certain income, they were being deprived of a living because of this obnoxious means test.  But here is this new-thinking Government, this Government under Fianna Fáil who say that the vision of this manifesto is an Ireland in which a successful strategy for national reconstruction offers real security for all.  It has been carefully put together and costed for implementation by a Government by a new team under the Taoiseach.  People can really say at this stage that they have been &ldquo;lynched&rdquo;, they have been conned.  The Fianna Fáil Party have given a new meaning to what being lynched means.  History will not record the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, as a man who had lead the greatest number of Deputies into this House but as a man who has lead the dumbest, dullest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The funniest promise of all is the one to subsidise telephone charges for old age pensioners living alone.  I know some old age pensioners living alone in County Donegal who would willing pay telephone charges if they could have the service.  I trust that whoever has buried this document does not dig it up too often because every time I have reason to refer to it it smells heavily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Murphy spoke about the Government losing touch with the people. I came here 18 years ago as a raw recruit with no ambition to stay as long as I have stayed.  Like many others I came here more by accident than by design, certainly more by accident than by purpose, but in that time I have not seen a Government who have moved so far away from reality as is the case with this Government.  What is happening in our society is all related to that manifesto which was prepared too slickly. In a foreword to the manifesto there is the note that it has been carefully put together and costed for implementation in government under a new team led by Mr. Jack Lynch as Taoiseach.  What about the old age pensioners who are expected to live on £15.80 per week if they are under 80?  Is this indicative of careful costing?  Similarly, a widow living alone is expected to survive on £15.80 per week or £2.20 per day.  There is only one word to sum up this situation and that is the word &ldquo;shame&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Government expect people to wait until they reach the age of 66 to receive the old age pension and then expect them to live on £2.20 per day.  How many days a week does the Minister expect they will be able to afford sprouts or roast beef or a T-bone steak?  I wonder what their shopping list will be and how many times they will be able to afford butter.  I do not envy the person living alone who has to survive on £2.20 a day.  My own home is cosy but far from luxurious and is probably one of the simplest homesteads owned by a Member of this House.  Even in those humble surroundings I feel ashamed when people come and tell me what they have to live on.  It is no credit to anyone in public life to say he is part of that system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> The Minister juggles around with figures in his speech.  A couple of old age pensioners have £23.65 per week.  One evening towards the end of last year I went into an hotel not far from this House and it cost £17 for a meal and a drink for the friend who was with me. Being a pioneer myself, I settled for ordinary table water.  I think of the money I spent in the restaurant here and try to translate that into figures which would explain how two old age pensioners could live in comfort, remembering that in his speech the Minister referred to real improvements in the living standards of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The Minister deals in glowing terms with unemployment assistance.  A person with no means will get £12.70 per week or £1,80 per day.  A married couple with two children will get £30.25 per week or £1.08 per head per day.  The Minister shakes his head, but I have based my calculations on the figures given in his speech.  How many times will a married couple with two children buy meat when they must live on £1.08 per day?  How many times will they buy a pound of butter from the local grocer? How much does the Minister expect they will spend on clothes, in buying a shirt or shoes for the children?  How many times does the Minister expect them to send shoes to be repaired by the local shoemaker?  It is not a credit to this Government that the Minister proudly boasts that a family with two children will feed, clothe and maintain themselves and pay rent and electricity bills on £30.25 per week.</P>
    <P>It is said we have a buoyant economy and we wonder why people are marching.  We wonder about the explanation for the abolition of wealth tax and the removal of rates from domestic dwellings.  I confess that rates were an unfair tax system.  But I have met wealthy people in this city who are honest enough to say that they give the Government no credit for the removal of rates on their houses, even though they were paying £1,200 or £1,500 a year in rates.  People who are in the millionaire bracket or close to it were quite prepared to pay and received the handouts with a certain amount of wonder.  Would it not <Col N="173" /> be better to let such people pay rates on their houses and do justice to the man drawing unemployment assistance who has a wife and two children?  That is where my social conscience would lie.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Manifesto, to which I have referred so often, was a give-away election gimmick.  Everybody was to get something.  The man receiving unemployment assistance, who found it so difficult to pay his rates&mdash;though they may have been only £10 per year&mdash;was glad to be rid of that responsibility and voted for Fianna Fáil.  He was completely in the dark as to the effect this would have across the board.  He gave no thought to the man paying £1,200, or in some cases over £2,000, in rates who could afford to pay that amount and did not even notice when it was paid by his financial adviser or secretary.  He gave no credit to the Government for relieving him of it.  The man receiving unemployment assistance, whose wife had to budget in pennies and decide between margarine and butter, voted for Fianna Fáil in order to rid himself of the obligation to pay rates, which may have amounted to only £10.  The Minister now makes him pay by keeping him and his family well below subsistence level and, of course, the profiteers and racketeers and the guys who subscribe to the Fianna Fáil election fund&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House expects a couple with two children to live on unemployment assistance. If a couple have four children the position becomes worse.  If they have six children the position becomes almost impossible, and if they have eight children it defies my arithmetic as to how they can survive. If the father finds that a local farmer has a day's work for him and he is tempted to do it without informing the Department, a kind neighbour will inform on him because he earned an extra £3 to help feed his wife and children.  The giving of such information is a criminal <Col N="174" /> act.  Is the Chair telling me that the removal of rates by this Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said many things which have little meaning for the people who sent me here to speak for them and little meaning for those who voted for Fianna Fáil, believing that their standards of living would be improved by a carefully-costed policy under the leadership of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  It makes my stomach heave to think that a policy that expects a family to live on £30.25 a week, which works out at £1.8 per child per day, is considered to be a well-costed policy.  The Minister's smugness and tolerance of such a system upsets me.</P>
      <P>The Minister is also willing to listen to the tales of jealous neighbours.  Such reports are not given for reasons of jealousy but because certain people in our society&mdash;the elderly, the disabled and the handicapped&mdash;cannot work and are forced to live on meagre allowances. We keep the poor poor and sealed off from other sections of society.  As a result, they are unaware of the cost of a meal or bed and breakfast in a hotel in Dublin.  The people who make reports to the Department are comparing the unemployed with those who are unable to work.  I wonder what their thoughts would be if they compared the unemployed with the wealthy.  If they did so, I am sure they would march in organised groups for those who are forced to live on small incomes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gets under my skin to hear Fianna Fáil Deputies talking about getting the country moving again.  The manifesto did not explain to the many small farmers in my constituency that their PLVs would be increased and that their incomes would be reduced.  I admit that the system has been abused.  As a Donegal man, speaking on behalf of social welfare recipients, I will tolerate that abuse because the Government have not created sufficient jobs in Donegal.  The Government believe that <Col N="175" /> we are not part of this State.  We have the worst telephone system, the worst roads and the highest unemployment rate.</P>

Now the man living on a farm of £10 valuation has his multiplier increased by 50 per cent, from £20 to £30.  On Saturday morning the wife of a man in that category came to me.  She had six <Col N="176" /> children, the eldest 17 years.  He is going to a vocational school&mdash;whether he gets a job when he has qualified is another matter.  She went to the social welfare office and she was told that because her husband has been sending milk to the creamery the family will lose about £17 per week.  I did not ask her whom she voted for in the general election: I hope she did not feel fooled by the Fianna Fáil promises then.  In this respect, the Minister has attacked the farmers at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.</P>

      <P>I have given them to the Department.  In the case of a farmer with a valuation of between £10 and £15, the increase in the multiplier is from £30 to £50, and the increase in the case of a farmer whose valuation is between £15 and £20, the multiplier increase is from £40 to £60.  Why in the case of a man with a £10 valuation has the multiplier been increased by 50 per cent but it has been increased by 66.6 per cent in the case of valuations between £15 and £20?</P>

      <P>That is a 100 per cent increase. The Minister's introductory speech was inaccurate.  I have the speech in front of me, the document circulated to us while the Minister was speaking.  I have asked the Minister for the number of farmers in Donegal who will lose these benefits but I have not got the information. I am sure the number will be very high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On page 5 of his introductory statement the Minister referred to increases for widows and so on and then to other <Col N="177" /> categories, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.  Why do the Department and the Minister have to inform all and sundry that a wife's husband has deserted her, that a mother is unmarried or that a woman's husband is in jail?

      <P>I am dealing with what the Minister said in his address to the House on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, 1979.  I am embarrassed <Col N="178" /> when a young woman comes in to tell me she is unmarried and is looking for the unmarried mother's allowance.  Why should any woman have to come in and admit to a public representative or to an official that she is an unmarried mother? I do not want to know it, the Minister does not want to know it and I am sure the official employed does not want to know it.  Could we have some other description such as &ldquo;temporarily separated&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>If a young man gets into trouble, either through the politics in which he believes or because he was tempted to do something that the courts now find him guilty of and he is serving a term of imprisonment, why should his wife have to come to me as a public representative or to a social welfare officer and say that she is the wife of a prisoner?  She has committed no crime and she should not have to confess publicly the sins of her husband, if they are sins.  It is a most degrading thing.  I hold the Minister in very high esteem and I know that he has compassion in his heart.  I know that the next time such a Bill comes before the House terms such as &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo;, &ldquo;unmarried mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;prisoner's wife&rdquo; will have some other name.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge your position, Sir, but it is important to establish this.  Is the Minister telling the House that a man who is in jail and whose wife will be paid what is now called prisoner's wife's allowance for four weeks after her husband comes out of jail will qualify for unemployment assistance for the same period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the cat is out of the bag.  Are they two separate allowances and will they both be paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if the conditions of the schemes allow it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>We will leave it at that.  It is not unreasonable that I kick up a fuss about this terminology.  Instead of &ldquo;unmarried <Col N="180" /> mother&rdquo; would it not be simple to say &ldquo;single-parent family&rdquo;?  There are cases where young people for some reason or another do not go through the ceremony of marriage but live as husband and wife.  When they look for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit or children's allowance, they do not have to say &ldquo;We are not married&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am an unmarried mother&rdquo;.  But the young girl who finds that she is let down by her boyfriend has to come in and say blushingly &ldquo;I am an unmarried mother&rdquo;. This is not fair, and the Minister will recognise the unfairness of it and will see to it that in future we will do away with this despicable reference to unmarried people.  The Minister should use some term like &ldquo;single-parent families,&rdquo; and for deserted wives and prisoner's wives &ldquo;temporarily separated&rdquo;.  That is not too much to ask, and I make this appeal to the Minister for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that the increase in disability and unemployment benefit is to be £16.05 in the personal rate and £10.45 in the rate for adult dependants. A man and wife receive a weekly income of £26.50 per week from this source. Does the Minister consider that that is well costed as per the Fianna Fáil Manifesto?  Is this the way that that document is being implemented by the Government under the present Taoiseach?  What will happen in Killybegs when these 80 people become redundant in February of next year?  In a few weeks' time 45 of them will be no longer required and the balance of 35 will have to go next year.  These men who have been receiving a wage of £70 per week with take-home pay of £50 per week, will be expected to live on £26.50. Is the Minister serious in suggesting that people can live on £26.50 per week with the cost of living as it is at the moment? If that young couple, believing in the security of the employment, have committed themselves to building a new house with the help of a mortgage from Donegal County Council or some building society, or have bought a second-hand car, some old banger, through hire purchase, what is to happen? They are told that they are redundant. That is a nice way of saying that they are sacked, kicked out, not wanted <Col N="181" /> any more, that they can get lost.</P>
    <P>What will the allowances be for a father, a mother and six children?  On my calculation there will be £51 per week or 91p per day per person for that family to live on.  One pound of butter and a loaf of bread now cost 99p. Therefore, you can buy seven pounds of butter and seven loaves of bread for this week, but if you do you are going to be short and your daddy will have to go out and take a job on the side, hoping that the local social welfare officer will not hear about it, so that he can earn £5 or £10.  This is the reality, and the Minister is telling this House that this policy is well-costed for national reconstruction and offers real security for all.  Oh boy, the people of Killybegs will read that one well this week.</P>
    <P>A few years ago people did not know the meaning of the word &ldquo;redundant&rdquo;. They were told they would be paid something because they had lost their jobs.  Now, a father, mother and six children get £51 a week from the Minister for Social Welfare, that is 91p per day per person to feed and clothe them, pay the rent and the fuel bills.  This is from a State which received its independence in 1922.  A family of four receive £35.80 a week, less than £1.30 per day.  The Minister is telling those people not to have a big family because a family of four receive £1.30 per head per day while a family with six children only receive an allowance of 91p a day. Is that Padraig Pearse's dream of what the nation would be?  We are now boasting that a family at the bottom rung of the ladder receive 91p a day.  We are telling those people not to buy any steak it will cost £2 a lb.  I do not know what the Minister really thinks about the plight of those people.  It does not make me very proud to be a member of this parliament and have to listen to the story of widows living alone who are expected to live on a maximum weekly pension of £15.80.  Not alone do we expect the unmarried mother, the deserted wife, the woman whose husband is in jail, to live on £15.80 a week but we embarrass her by slotting her into the category of unmarried mother, deserted wife&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>All the humbugs are not on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>This legislation that the Minister introduced in glowing terms lacks imagination and does not appreciate the needs of the people on the lowest level of the social welfare scale.  It lacks the imagination of a national plan for national reconstruction.  &ldquo;National&rdquo; does not mean the Twenty-six Counties, the area over which we have jurisdiction.  Fianna Fáil have always talked about &ldquo;national&rdquo; being the Thirty-two Counties. Have they now accepted that &ldquo;national&rdquo; no longer means that? &ldquo;National&rdquo; in the context they use it in this document refers exclusively to the needs of the people living in the republic.</P>
      <P>When I first saw this plan for national reconstruction I thought that at last we would have a harmonisation of social welfare benefits with those in Northern Ireland.  The Government had not the wit to change the old age pension age from 66 to 65 in the case of a man and from 66 to 60 in the case of a woman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> The Government do not give a damn about national reconstruction.  They have paid lip service to the people for far too long.  If the Government are going to talk about the standards of the republic and use terminology like &ldquo;national&rdquo; why did they character assassinate Senator Cruise-O'Brien whose two-nation theory they have accepted?  That document justifies everything that Senator Conor Cruise-O'Brien said about two nations in Ireland.  Fianna Fáil were the first to argue strenuously against and to take exception to this.</P>
    <P>In the North of Ireland the old age pension ages are 60 for a woman and 65 for a man.  A Donegal person working in Tyrone under what is called a foreign, occupying force, can retire at 60 or 65 depending on sex, but a person living at home in Donegal will be deprived of the fringe benefits that the Minister acknowledges these people need.  The old age pensioner living alone gets an electricity allowance, free travel in case he wishes to visit a son or daughter in the next village and free telephone rental. The Government are not being generous, however, because they are keeping them below subsistence level.  These people are being treated as outcasts.  The Government have no thought or compassion or appreciation for the needs of these people and have totally ignored the increased cost of living.  Nobody in the Government benches seems to think that an old age pensioner might want a half a pound of steak one day a week, or fish on Friday or might want to have diet on a Sunday that might include brussels sprouts or something that he cannot grow in the garden.  There is no appreciation of the needs of people living alone&mdash;bread and butter, tea and toast, spuds and stirabout, and that is about it.  After 65 years of national Government&mdash;national in the narrow sense&mdash;the Minister smiles when I accuse him of lack of imagination in what he offers to these people.</P>
    <P>If the small farmer who does a day's work, and works hard, decides that he will take his next door neighbour's field, buy two or three cows and send a few gallons of milk to the local creamery, his unemployment assistance will be taken <Col N="185" /> from him whether he has a £10, £20 or £40 valuation.  If a man is industrious and is ambitious along those lines and the inspector catches him, his small farmers' dole will be stopped.</P>
    <P>The Government, who have had four out of six Deputies in County Donegal and who treat the people as the Minister now does, deserves more than I would wish on the Minister.  Donegal did not let down Fianna Fáil but Fianna Fáil have let down the people of Donegal.  Fianna Fáil have given us the largest unemployment rate, the lowest social welfare benefits, the worst roads in the country and no automatic telephone communications. We are sealed off.  The Government have done something that has not been done since Red Hugh O'Donnell: they have isolated Donegal.  Storms never isolated Donegal in the manner in which we have been isolated by the lack of telecommunications.  In the obnoxious Fianna Fáil manifesto the Government said that they would subsidise telephones of elderly people.  They have not even given them a service.  I hope that when the Government start talking about buying executive jets to fly gorgeous George and cheeky Charlie off to the rich countries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have a friend who said he did not mind paying rates and he does not thank the Minister's party for removing them.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his job.  He has a very difficult task to perform.  I hope he will put more effort into it next year because I will be referring to what I said this year.  I do not want the Minister to keep the payments to these people at their present standard.  They are just running after inflation and are reaching for a ceiling which is not there.  I will be judging the Minister on his performance and I beg of him when he sits here next year and lays claim to something which is justly and rightly his to make it more than a boast that he gave free transport to the old age pensioners in County Donegal.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill creates a two-tier system with which I disagree. Recent figures have indicated that food has increased by 18 per cent, yet the top figure in the Bill is 16 per cent.  A 12 per cent increase is miserable when one considers that there could be very little difference in the ages of the people in the two tiers.  A person on sick benefit or disability might need the money more than a person who had reached the age of 66 years.</P>
      <P>Social welfare payments were always too low.  If we make two categories it will be a retrograde step and will separate people who are unfortunate enough to be on any benefit.  Widows have been badly treated over the years.  I am not blaming this Minister for that.  Where an old age pensioner dies and his widow has not reached the age of 66, the entitlement to free electricity ceases and it is cut off. That is disgraceful, unchristian and inhuman. Yet, it is happening on a regular basis.  It is almost a throwback to the Victorian or landlord days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The administration of the new supplementary welfare allowances under the Bill leaves a lot to be desired.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware of <Col N="188" /> the way it is being administered but it seems to me to be under the old Victorian system with people being quizzed and frustrated with questions.</P>
    <P>The means test being operated in the payment of this supplementary welfare allowance is a disgrace to our so-called Christian society.  I asked the Minister a question in this House about people living alone on the old age pension, who had a supplementary welfare allowance of the large sum of £1 a week and who, when this much-boasted about £1 a week extra is given them over the age of 80, have the supplementary welfare allowance of £1 withdrawn.  The Minister when replying asked me to give him cases.  I received the same request from the county medical officer in that area, even though the health board administering that scheme knew well the cases about which I was inquiring. Likewise, I was asked to produce evidence by an officer of the health board at a health committee meeting.  I gave him details of a particular case.  His reply was that the £1 had been cut off not because the particular recipient had received an increase but because of the benefits she had from living near her married daughter.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that this supplementary welfare scheme is being administered in an archaic, Victorian way, which is both unchristian and inhuman.  It behoves the Minister to examine its operation.  I do not know whether that is occasioned by a shortage of money but that is the way it is being administered by officials who should know better.  I do not want to attack any official in this House, but that is the reply I received from an official of the Minister's Department who has been administering the supplementary welfare allowance in my constituency.  It was never meant to be administered in that way and I hope the Minister does not mean to administer it in that way.  If he does not mean it to be so operated, then he should inform his officials how it should be properly administered.  Indeed, it is about time he issued a guidebook telling us and them how it should be administered. Then the officials concerned <Col N="189" /> had the cheek to tell me that they never took it from anybody because they received the £1, when they took it from a person who received the £1 because of the benefits she enjoyed from living near her married daughter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In some cases that might not be of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not.  I am merely telling the Minister what this gentleman wrote down for me.  I can produce the letter from him.  That is a very serious statement to have to make and I make it in the full sense of its seriousness.  There is a list of people in my constituency who lost the £1 supplementary welfare allowance because they received a £1 increase since they reached the age of 80.  The officials of the Department know well who these people are.  I could continue to speak on that supplementary welfare allowance for quite some time but I appreciate that the Minister is entitled to reply, and I know Deputy White wants a few minutes also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At budget time the Minister maintained that these increases would substantially increase the standard of living of those people.  The highest increase in any rate of benefit is now 16 per cent. Yet it was shown in statistics, not compiled by me, that the price of food had increased by approximately 18 per cent. Therefore the Minister must have been misinformed when he made that statement. It is fair to say also that 90 per cent of the income of these people is spent on food.  I know it can be contended that overall the inflation rate is less, but it must be remembered that food prices have increased by 17.9 per cent.  These people should be compensated for this increase in some way.  The cost of living bonus implemented by the previous Government in the month of October was some attempt to keep abreast with that kind of inflation.  The Minister should examine if that could be done again, say, in the month of July, October or some other time, with the increased price of food being taken into consideration.  I have already recommended that to health boards in regard to medical cards.  That is a different matter, <Col N="190" /> but they might well take another look at the appropriate guidelines.</P>
    <P>The food subsidies were removed before the Minister made his budget calculations.  The removal of these subsidies will have a serious effect on the standard of living of all people in the whole range of social welfare&mdash;for example, on people receiving the 12 per cent increase.  Even the 16 per cent increase has not compensated for the increase in food prices.  Perhaps the Minister does not realise that people in that category spend 90 per cent of their income on food, because that is all they can afford to buy.</P>
    <P>I want now to say something about the operation of the appeals system in the Minister's Department.  This is a system which was in operation before the Minister's time and I have spoken about it on several previous occasions here.  However, something must be done about it.  When a medical referee cuts somebody off social welfare benefit, that person has to appeal.  His own doctor tells him he is not fit to work.  Mark you, the medical referee does not say he is fit for work; he says he is not unfit for work.  That is the term used.  One has to appeal against that judgment and be re-examined. But during that time one might even die of hunger because that appeal goes on interminably in the Department.  It is absolutely appalling that people must wait for months on end between the time their allowance is cut off and their appeal is heard and decided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>One can get a supplementary welfare allowance, which is a far lesser amount and for which one will be subject to the scrutiny I have described already.  The Minister must devise a method of speeding up appeals. I accept that a difference of opinion may arise in some cases between the local doctor and the medical referee but surely it should be possible to hold the second examination within one week.  In the case of a person who leaves employment for any reason and claims unemployment benefit that appeal can go on for up to 12 months.  A person who is turned down in his application for unemployment benefit or assistance has a right of appeal but if he depends on such benefit he will die from hunger because of the length of time it takes to hear such appeals.</P>
      <P>Many young people have come to me having been offered from 50p to £2 unemployment assistance.  The Department, in assessing the amount they were entitled to, took into account the fact that they were getting free board and lodgings from their parents.  In some cases the father of that household was on social welfare.  Such parents must keep their children, irrespective of their income, but the Department reckon that those claiming benefit are getting free board and lodgings.  That is the type of Victorian carry-on that officials of the Minister's Department engage in.  It is still going on throughout the length and breadth of the country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who is refused unemployment benefit and decides to appeal against that decision may have to wait up to 12 months for that appeal to be heard.  I accept that it is possible for such a person to be brought into benefit after six weeks but what will happen if the Department claim that a person is not seeking employment, as a person is bound to do when seeking unemployment benefit or assistance?  I am aware of cases where people were refused benefit because the local official stated that such people were not making a proper effort to obtain employment. Those cases were on appeal for up to two years.  The system is rotten and the Minister should investigate it.</P>
      <P>In deciding not to continue to reduce the age for old age pensions, a move started by the previous Government, the Minister made a mistake.  Within four years the National Coalition reduced that age limit by four years.  Throughout Europe 65 years is the accepted age for an old age pension.  It would benefit everybody if the Minister reduced the retirement pension age to 60.  If we reach the stage when people are paid a decent pension they should be encouraged to retire at 60 years of age thereby providing employment for younger people. When the National Coalition were reducing the age for old age pensions they should have reduced the age of retirement pensions also.  The Minister should reduce both to 60 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common for people in many <Col N="193" /> areas to complain about what is known as farmer's dole and make the case that it should not be paid.  I do not subscribe to that.  However, the Minister's Department should not be handling it.  It should be a subsidy to farmers.  There is nothing wrong with paying a subsidy if it means that a person is kept off the unemployment list.  We are paying up to £25 per week to some employers, including multi-nationals, to encourage them to employ people off the live register and for that reason there is nothing wrong with paying a sum of money to keep farmers on their holdings, provided they are trying to progress.  Such a payment should be made to farmers by the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  The fact that it is paid by the Department of Social Welfare belittles the benefit.  For a lot of people that benefit is essential but it should not be described as a farmer's dole.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the situation in relation to the distribution of pensions, family allowances and social welfare benefits which are affected by the postal dispute.  In the name of God, the Government should meet the union involved in the Post Office dispute to try to settle it.  In my area some people have to travel 16 to 20 miles to get their benefits.  Some of them have to pay £3 to come to Dublin by bus to collect a cheque for £14 or £15.  I am not talking about the rights or wrongs of the strike, but it will never be settled if the Government do not agree to meet the people on strike.  Hardship is being caused to social welfare recipients.  Will the Minister for Social Welfare ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to come down off his high horse, meet the people, discuss the problems and get the strike settled?</P>
    <P>The other morning I spoke to an unfortunate man who had not got his social welfare cheque for four weeks.  He is on a multi-certificate and that should not have happened.  He went to the Carlow Labour Exchange where his cheque was supposed to be, but he did not succeed in getting it.  Apparently some people can go into shops and supermarkets and change their cheques.  Some can even do so in banks.  I know an unfortunate <Col N="194" /> woman who needed her pension.  She went into a bank and was told they could not change her cheque unless she had a bank account.  If she had a bank account she could wait for her pension. She had no bank account and therefore she got no pension.</P>
    <P>This type of thing is going on. Sometime or another someone representing the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Government will have to sit down with the Post Office workers and settle this dispute.  Will that be done when some of these people have died?  The Minister is an influential man and he should talk to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and ask him to meet these people and resolve this dispute so that these unfortunate people can get their money and their new pension books.  It is no good appealing to the people on strike.  Someone will have to meet them and talk about their problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have proved that it is relevant.  I mentioned people in my constituency who had to pay £3 on a bus to go to Dublin to get their social welfare cheques.  They could ill afford £3 out of their small cheques.  I am not talking about the merits or demerits of the strike.  I have my own views on that, and they are not relevant. What I am saying is relevant to this Bill and to the distribution of social welfare payments within the State.  It is relevant to the distribution of new pension books. It is very relevant to the unfortunate people who are not getting paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Labour and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs should sit down and talk to these people and settle this dispute.  There are many reasons for doing this, but the only reason I want to put forward now is the distribution of social welfare benefits and social welfare books.  There is no use in blaming anybody.  The two groups concerned are the Government and the Post Office Workers' Union.  The union are prepared to sit down and talk to the <Col N="195" /> Minister at any time.  I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to use his good offices with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to bring about fruitful discussions which will resolve this problem.  It is a problem.</P>
    <P>When these people come to Dublin they stand in long queues in Store Street and then they find that they should have been in Townsend Street.  This is what sick people are being asked to do.  I am asking the Minister for Social Welfare as a humane act to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to get down off his high horse and meet the people who are in dispute with him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came into this House I have spoken on every Social Welfare Bill which has been introduced. I am surprised that the Minister has introduced such a mealy-mouthed Bill as this.  On other Bills I had the pleasure of saying what I thought was good about them and mentioning the few things I thought were bad about them.  I have to tear this Bill to shreds and point out what is wrong with it.  However, I compliment the Minister on the very few changes he has made which will be of benefit to the people.</P>
      <P>The last speaker was quite right. When the Minister introduced this Bill he was blowing and puffing about the tremendous increases pensioners and people on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance would get.  He told us old age pensioners would get an increase of 16 per cent.  Deputies on the opposite benches were delighted to hear that.  The Minister went on to say people on unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and sickness benefit would get the tremendous increase of 12 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week we read in the papers that over the past 12 months food prices have increased by 18 per cent.  A couple of months ago Fianna Fáil were telling us they had inflation under their wing. They did not tell us the inflation they had under their wing was the inflation the Coalition Government prophesied would happen 18 months after they left office.  The crunch is coming now.  I am <Col N="196" /> very disappointed to think that old age pensioners and people receiving unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance are not getting enough to cover the increase in food prices over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister when he is replying to guarantee to these people that, if inflation continues at the rate at which it has been running over the past couple of months, he will bring in a supplementary Bill to ensure that the old, the unemployed and the sick will not be worse off in six months time than they are today.  It is very easy for the Minister to quote the rate of inflation and the increase in food prices over the previous 12 months.  Old age pensioners are not interested in what the figures were 12 months ago.  They are interested in the inflation rate and the increase in food prices this week, next week, in two months' time and in six months' time.</P>
    <P>I hope that, when the Minister is replying, he will give us all an undertaking that he will ensure that the weakest section of our community will not be worse off then than they are now.  I honestly feel that we have seen nothing yet as far as inflation is concerned in 1979.  I hope I am wrong and, if I am wrong, I would be the first to admit it. However, working in supermarkets, I am very much alarmed to see the tremendous price increases that are coming in week in and week out.  Eventually these increases must be passed on to the consumer.  This is one of the things that Fianna Fáil promised to control in their manifesto.  They have failed to do this.  The second thing that they promised to do was to reduce the unemployment figures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the point. I come from a constituency where there are more unemployed people now than at any time I can remember.  Our figures are over 16 per cent at present, whereas the national average is 9.9 per cent, and 1979 is going to be a disaster year so far as the people in County Donegal are concerned.  We want more work.  I do <Col N="197" /> not like to see people on the dole or on unemployment assistance.  These people should be able to get suitable work so that they can provide for themselves, their wives and their children.  At present they cannot.  The Chair will remember that, when a previous Fianna Fáil Government took the dole from the single man in the western areas, there was a revolt so far as the single person was concerned at that time.  If Fianna Fáil learned anything then, they must have forgotten it.</P>
      <P>The reason I am so annoyed with this Bill is that the Minister for Social Welfare has now interfered with the means test for small farmers in the western areas.  He has changed the multiplier for people with valuations under £10 from £20 in the £ to £30 in the £.  He has changed the multiplier for people with valuations of £10 to £15 from £20 in the £ to £50 in the £.  He has changed the multiplier for people with valuations of £15 to £20 from £30 in the £ to £60 in the £.  A farmer with a land valuation of £11 who might only have 20 acres and no more than five cows and five calves is entitled to assistance to keep him on his small farm and to make sure that he and his wife and family have at least a reasonable standard of living.  At present a married man with no children is entitled to earn £19.70 per week.  What do these changes in the multiplier mean in money terms?  They mean that a married man with no land would probably get about £19.20 per week for himself and his wife to live on.</P>

    <P>A married man with a small valuation of £11, who might have 20 acres and five cows and five calves, taking the multiplier at £20 in the £, would have an income from social welfare of £14.20 per week and from April that man's income will be reduced by £4.46 per week and he will now get only £9.74.  That is bad, but let us take it a little further.  Let us quote a few more figures.  A farmer in Gortahork, the Rosses or west Donegal with a valuation of £14, who has a wife will now take a drop of £7.52 as far as the small farmer's assistance scheme is concerned.  A farmer with a valuation of £15, who was getting £8.20 per week, now gets absolutely nothing.  A farmer <Col N="198" /> with a valuation of £18 will have to take a drop in his income from £14.20 per week to £3.50, a drop of £10.70 per week.</P>
    <P>We have seen protests over the past few months.  Some of them we agree with and some we do not agree with.  But there has been no protest so far as the small farmers in the western areas are concerned, and they are the people who can least afford to take the cuts.  Very few people have mentioned this and it is only when these farmers go to the unemployment exchanges in April that they will realise what this Bill had done. I know that the present Government have been looking at the idea of executive jets.  I understand it has been recommended to the Government that they should purchase two.</P>

Fianna Fáil have stooped to reduce the means of the small farming community for the sake of £2 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not giving the full picture.  Everybody will get the 12 per cent increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>I have included the 12 per cent in my figure.  I defy the Minister to prove me wrong.  I have taken today's figures and the figure at the end of April, allowing for the 12 per cent increase, <Col N="199" /> and I defy anybody to state that a married person with a valuation of £11 will not have a drop in his income of £4.46 per week.  I have worked out the figure.  I have a little bit of education and I can do a little bit of arithmetic and I have worked it out allowing for the increase the Minister introduced.  Now the Minister tells us that it is going to cost the country £164,000 to have uproar in the weakest section of the community.  I am absolutely surprised that the Minister for Social Welfare, who is generally accepted as having a good heart, should stoop to change something for such a small amount of money.</P>
      <P>I know that I am limited as far as time is concerned and I do not want to go on too long, but I would ask the Minister to look into this and to make sure that nobody is going to suffer undue hardship because of the scheme he has introduced. The Minister may say that these people can go to the local welfare officer if they find their means are cut and that their means can be assessed.  I have always thought, particularly so far as western areas are concerned, that this was the fairest, straightest method and that it was just simple arithmetic as far as they were concerned.</P>
      <P>I should like to be able to speak on this Bill for about an hour and a half, but that is not possible because of the time element.  I fail to understand why the old age pension qualifying age was not reduced to 65 and neither do I understand why the means in respect of a means test was not increased from the £6 level.  The position is that a person of 66 or over whose means are assessed at £17 per week is not entitled to any pension from the State, that is, if he has not been contributing to social welfare.  I have said always that there should not be a means test in respect of widows pension.  There are very few wealthy widows.  As public representatives we find that among the saddest people who come to us in regard to pensions are widows, especially those in middle age who have little hope of marrying again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of interjection earlier the Minister said that it was he who introduced the free travel scheme for old <Col N="200" /> age pensioners, but I wonder if the Minister is in touch with the situation in the various other European countries. Surely the best way to ensure the health of the people is to look after them and what better way can there be of helping to keep old people happy than to ensure that they have a holiday each year?  In Germany and Austria, for instance, old age pensioners are given a three-weeks holiday at certain resorts in the off-season. A similar type of scheme here would cost very little to the State but it would mean a lot to the people concerned. In addition, they would be very welcome in the resorts in the off-season times such as April and May.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand, too, why a person aged 80 or over must be living absolutely alone before being entitled to the additional allowance of £1.20.  There are many cases of two old age pensioners living together, both of whom are over 80, and if there happens to be another person in the house those old people should not be deprived of the additional allowance.  We should be encouraging people of that age to have somebody live with them who would be at hand in the event of sudden illness or of accident to the old people.</P>
    <P>Another matter that causes a lot of concern is that of the allowances for deserted wives.  There is a lot of fuss made in respect of determining eligibility for these allowances.  For example, a woman must prove to the court that her husband has left her.  Sometimes that is not sufficient and she must prove that some decree was taken out against the husband.  I suggest that if a woman has been deserted by her husband for four weeks she should automatically be entitled to the allowance.  It is humiliating enough for a deserted wife to have to seek the allowance in the first place, but her situation is made much more difficult when she finds that she must have recourse to the courts if her application is to have any success.</P>
    <P>The supplementary allowances have been of tremendous benefit.  We all become aware from time to time of cases in which people do not qualify for a disability allowance but who are unable to work because, perhaps, of having some <Col N="201" /> back trouble.  It is of great benefit to these people to be able to receive the social welfare supplementary allowance.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bermingham that the delays are ridiculous in relation to some payments.  Appeals officers take a long time to decide on eligibility or otherwise.  Would it not be much more satisfactory to have appeals officers go out and investigate each case within, say, a couple of weeks and thereby be in a position to make an early decision?</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the biggest disappointment of any legislation on which I have spoken since coming here.  I trust that the Minister will at least endeavour to do better on the next occasion he is bringing a Bill before the House.  I am disappointed particularly in relation to the provisions as they will apply to small farmers in the west.  Surely Fianna Fáil have not forgotten the grassroots entirely. The passage of this Bill will indicate to me that the Government have forgotten the people who supported them most down through the years.</P>

      <P>It is necessary that this Bill be put through all Stages this evening.  I understand there is agreement in that regard.  I propose to conclude this stage at 6.50 p.m. so that we may take the remaining Stages.  Consequently, in the few minutes at my disposal I shall not have time to deal with the various points raised by Deputies.  Naturally, I deplore this situation because there has been much criticism of the Bill, as well as there being raised a number of good points, with which I should like to deal.  I would have preferred if Deputies had been a little more honest and straightforward in relation to this Bill and had not been cynical enough to criticise situations that existed while their parties were in office when any one of them had plenty of opportunity to approach the Coalition Minister concerned about the matters in question.  It is false and hypocritical of Deputies to berate me for situations that existed for a long time and for which they have equal responsibility with me and with every other Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there is one important point I <Col N="202" /> wish to make I must ignore most of the criticism put forward.  I wish to say to all the various social welfare recipients who are experiencing difficulty in procuring payments that, on behalf of the Government, I apologise for the situation which prevails and which is causing these difficulties. I assure them that the Government are anxious as are the Department of Social Welfare to make every effort possible to ensure that their benefits reach them as expeditiously as possible and without causing hardship.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are probably aware, I have sought the assistance of the President of the ICTU in this matter and I wish to express to him my gratitude for his goodwill and co-operation and for his willingness to use his good offices.  At present there is a meeting in progress and I can only express the sincere wish that the outcome of that meeting will be favourable from the point of view of social welfare recipients.  I recognise clearly that social welfare recipients, unlike most other sections of the community, do not have reserves to fall back on, and that the benefits and allowances they receive are used up immediately. The overwhelming majority of these people must be able to receive their payments when due unless they are to be caused real hardship.  I can only express the wish that somehow we will be able to get over the present difficulties and get their payments to them.  The situation is becoming increasingly difficult and the payment of pensions and children's allowances is in the balance.  It is a cause of very serious anxiety to me as Minister for Social Welfare, to the Department and to the Government.</P>
    <P>There is no point in my attempting to reply to a number of criticisms which have been made.  I feel somewhat aggrieved that more Deputies did not acknowledge the very considerable number of improvements contained in this Bill.  When Deputies raise matters with the Department of Social Welfare, either directly or by way of Dáil questions, these matters are carefully considered and in the Social Welfare Bills last year and this year a considerable number of anomalies in the social welfare code have been dealt with.  When <Col N="203" /> the Bill comes into operation I would hope that the benefit of these changes would be felt throughout the community. A large number of difficulties to which Deputies have directed attention from time to time in the Dáil are being removed through this legislation.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Dublin Bus and Rail Services: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy R. Ryan on Wednesday, 14 March 1979:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, noting the increasing inadequacy of the road network and the steady deterioration of rail rolling stock, calls on the Government to implement the CIE proposals for the Dublin Rapid Busway and rail system as a matter of <Col N="206" /> urgency, thereby providing an effective commuter service whilst also creating much needed employment.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that CIE proposals for the upgrading of the Howth/Bray railway line are at present being evaluated by the Government in the context of the overall transport needs of the Dublin area; and that the comprehensive rail rapid transit system envisaged by CIE for the greater Dublin area will be considered as soon as the views of the Transport Consultative Commission (established by the Minister for Tourism and Transport in September, 1978) on the arrangements for the provision of urban passenger services in the Dublin area have been received.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Tourism and Transport.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a melancholy comment on the state of transportation in the city of Dublin that the progress of the large number of people who marched yesterday from Parnell Square to Merrion Square was more rapid than the normal progress associated with bus transport through that part of the city in normal traffic conditions.  Normal traffic conditions in the city of Dublin are now, every day, every hour, total congestion adding to the kind of operating costs that CIE have already referred to in their submissions.  CIE reckon that the present traffic congestion costs them £1½ million in extra operating costs per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made the point that, before we committed ourselves to any long-term investment further inquiry and examination of the various options before us would have to be made.  I agree that one must make a full examination of options to which are attached such heavy capital price tags.  However, it does not require much examination to come to the conclusion that we need at least some interim measures to alleviate the existing chaotic situation.  I recommend that the Minister should at least <Col N="207" /> adopt the first phase of the CIE plan, at least adopt that part of their plan which would give them modern rolling stock on the Bray/Howth line.</P>
    <P>Electrifying that rail system would ensure the extra passage of something like 50,000 persons per day.  A modern rail line along that coastal stretch could probably transport 100,000 people per day. There is no report that one can refer to which will authoritatively establish that that number of passengers could be moved per day but there are estimates that come close to that figure.  There is no doubt that the public transporting of such a large number of people along that coastal stretch would alleviate the present situation.  Admittedly, transporting such a large number of people would require more intensive use of the modernised line.  We would be talking about an early morning to late-at-night service. We could then anticipate a large number of commuters from Donabate, Killiney, Booterstown, Howth, Sutton and Raheny utilising the new line, the more intensively used line, the more efficient line, the more rapid line.  We would see commuters who presently use their cars leaving them at home, which would mean a reduction in the number of cars in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>Who is to judge the social cost of the huge investment, the kinds of options, the kinds of choices that are presently being made in many parts of the city, the options and choices being made between car parks and further facilities for people. These options and choices are forced on authorities, both commercial and public, because the community will not make a rational decision on the transportation difficulties of our capital city. Because we constantly postpone making a rational decision the chaos is intensified day by day.  We already have the well-prepared and well-researched proposals of CIE calling for the implementation of improvement, at least partially, on the coastal line.  They have, as the Minister knows, in certain consequential recommendations called for a second phase which would cost something like £45 million in which we <Col N="208" /> would see the extension of that system to Clondalkin and Lucan, and eventually serving the town of Tallaght.  The town of Tallaght is a euphemism for a huge urban area that will rival Cork in population size over the next five years.  One wonders if the Cabinet appreciate that Dublin is a series of growing new cities requiring a new transport system to connect them.  We are evading the problem of this new growing city of Dublin, a city that will soon have a population of two million, by postponing well-researched proposals for modernising existing rolling stock and for the electrification of new lines.  These proposals could be implemented now.</P>
    <P>So far, the real failure of the Government in many areas has been their incredible stupidity, their refusal to face the planning facts of our situation; their refusal to give the public transport company sufficient funds to enable them to give a proper service to the travelling public.  As a result, they have forced the travelling public to the individual expenditure of the car.  Therefore, we have growing congestion in the centre of Dublin.  Give CIE sufficient capital allied with an efficient management so that the operatives of CIE may once more have the opportunity of serving the city of Dublin efficiently and properly as they would wish.  They can only do this if they have modern rolling stock.  CIE are presently being financed on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, and the travelling public must pay for the deficiencies in income from which CIE suffer.  The services of the Howth-Sutton-Bray line will be gravely undermined over the next few months.  The commuters who use it at present will no longer be in a position to avail of its limited services if sufficient cash is not given to CIE.  My plea to the Government is to abandon their ideological objections to an efficient public enterprise transport system and finance adequately the public transport company so that the citizens of Dublin will be enabled to have a public transport service to meet their needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Transport (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> It is interesting to listen to Deputy O'Leary <Col N="209" /> speaking about the complexities and difficulties of the Dublin transport system. Anybody who complains about public transport in Dublin and is under the impression that it is capable of an easy solution does not fully understand the complexities of the whole situation.  I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Leary say that this Government have failed to appreciate the problem of the chaotic situation of traffic in this city.  Deputy O'Leary was a member of a Cabinet for four and a half years which practically did nothing at all about public transport for Dublin.  We, after 20 months in office, have taken positive steps.  We fully realise the significance of a proper public transport system and how necessary it is not only to Dublin but to those who commute to and from the capital every day.</P>
      <P>We must appreciate that the extension and explosion of private traffic over the last five or six years is a reflection of our economic advances.  Thousands of people are now in an economic position to be able to purchase cars which they were not able to do some years ago.  We must remember that that part of the city between the two circular roads was never designed for the type of traffic it must deal with today.  We must take this into consideration when looking at the question of how to solve the Dublin traffic problem.  I do not believe we can solve it in a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be looked at in two phases. The proposals put forward by CIE will not mature for some time.  As regards the electrification of the Bray-Howth line if such a decision is taken it will not come into operation for four years.  The rapid transport system envisaged by CIE will not be completed for about 20 years.  We all realise that there is no way Dublin can wait for the next 20 years to try to solve the problem.  We must have a short term approach to the whole problem.  When the Minister for Tourism and Transport came into office one of his first undertakings was to establish a Transport Consultative Commission. We gave an undertaking in our manifesto that we would look at the transport system throughout the country and with special reference to Dublin.  I will quote from part of the speech the <Col N="210" /> Minister made at the first meeting of the Transport Consultative Commission on 21 September 1978.  The Minister set out their terms of references as:</P>
    <P>To investigate and report on the measures necessary to achieve the most efficient and economic transport system for goods and passengers having regard to the need to maintain a flexible competitive transport system&mdash;thereby ensuring the facilities necessary for industrial development through the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Those were the broad terms of reference of the commission.  The Minister, and the Government, were fully aware that Dublin was in a special category.  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>Your terms of reference are very broad and, having regard to the wide range of issues in the transport sphere, it is clearly necessary to establish some priorities.  I propose, therefore, to give you a broad outline of the particular areas to which I would wish the Commission to accord priority.</P>
    <P>While the terms of reference appear to place a particular emphasis on freight transport, there are a number of more serious and pressing problems which would merit examination by the Commission.  One of these is the provision of urban passenger transport services, particularly in the Dublin area, where it is proving increasingly difficult for public transport, because of traffic growth and congestion to ensure attractive services for commuters.</P>
    <P>The urban transport problem is concerned primarily with what I might describe as the vicious circle of increasing traffic congestion leading to deterioration in bus services, which leads to more utilisation of private cars, still greater congestion of traffic, fewer people using buses, loss of revenue to public transport and increased Exchequer subsidy.  The cycle seems endless and all the time the problems of public transport, of car and lorry owners, and of commuters become more and more acute.  It is against this background that I see the need for the Commission to consider <Col N="211" /> as a matter of priority the arrangements for the provision of urban transport services, especially in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The Commission's examination will need to have regard to the appropriate role of public transport, the potential benefit of traffic management schemes, the need for co-ordination between the various bodies having responsibility in this area, social, environmental and energy considerations, and last but not least, the financial burden on the Exchequer.  Any examination of transport in the Dublin area must of necessity pay close attention to the role of the Dublin surburban railway, which makes such a valuable contribution towards easing Dublin's traffic congestion problems, and also to CIE's proposals for the extension of the Dublin suburban rail system.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Tourism and Transport was fully aware that Dublin needed special attention.  He asked the commission to give it first priority as regards their investigation into the transport system.  It is a complex problem and there is no easy answer to it.  We must see what can be done in the short term. The proposals put forward by CIE merit serious consideration.  The electrification of the Howth-Bray line, which is at present before the Government, must be considered very closely to ensure that if the money, which is in the region of £42,000,000, is spent it will measure up to the commitments and undertakings contained in it.  We must ensure that people will use the buses and railways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> Eventually within the confines of the inner city, within the two Circular Roads, public transport will have to play a much larger role than it does at present. Otherwise I cannot see how we can accommodate the traffic within the confines of our city.  For that reason several studies have been undertaken.  Dublin Corporation traffic department are carrying out this type of study continuously to ascertain what can be done to alleviate the problems.  There are several possibilities under discussion.  For example, is it not possible to stagger working <Col N="213" /> hours?&mdash;I know this has been tried in some Departments but it will probably have to be considered more.  Perhaps staggered shopping hours in various parts of the city might be considered also.  Then we might consider the implementation of a scheme reversing the flow of one-way traffic, inwards in the morning and outwards in the evening. Perhaps the provision of lane-ways for bicycles might be considered.  I am speaking of the short term.</P>

        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> Deputy Quinn is concerned about one particular aspect of traffic in Dublin, the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  We on this side of the House are concerned about the entire traffic of the city.  I am as concerned about traffic coming in from Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Terenure, Ballymun as I am with that from Clontarf and Howth.  I view the whole question of transport in Dublin in a broad sense.  It must be looked at in that light to ensure that we know exactly where we are going.</P>
      <P>We are aware that several improvements will have to be effected as regards motorways, although these will take ten years to implement.  However, progress has been made and decisions taken. Problems will be encountered in the building of such motorways, which in turn can create problems within certain communities.  If we are to have a free flow of traffic in Dublin, in conjunction with the Howth-Bray line, the roads will have to be made available with outlets from the centre city.  I know the flow of traffic has deteriorated considerably over the past four or five years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> There has been a huge increase <Col N="214" /> in the number of cars moving around the city.  For that reason we must ascertain whether or not we can utilise our present public transport facilities to their full capacity.  We are aware also of how difficult it is today for any bus driver to drive a bus through the congested areas of Dublin.  We are aware of the amount of man hours lost, the amount of fuel and oil consumed.  If we can convince people, perhaps by persuasion, that a public transport system is the best, then we will have moved someway toward relieving the congestion all around us in this city today.</P>
      <P>Several proposals have been made in regard to the roads system.  As was stated in the recent White Paper, the Government believe that a large and sustained increase is necessary in investment on improvements to eliminate the present inadequacies in the road network.  The Government have declared their intention of substantially increasing the capital investment in roads both this year and in 1980.  Their commitment to that policy is reflected in the grants totalling £47.9 million the Minister for the Environment is making available to road authorities this year.  The proportion of those funds to be allocated in this year to the three road authorities in the Dublin region will amount to £9.165 million which compares with a figure of £5.165 million in 1976, £7.163 million in 1977 and £7.175 million in 1978.</P>
      <P>Deputies will have read recently that Dublin Corporation have adopted in principle the review carried out by the Dublin City and County Manager of the major road proposals recommended in the Dublin Transportation Study.  I understand that the Manager's review incorporates a report by the Chief Roads Engineer which contains a 10-year programme for the city area and a 20-year programme for the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the preparation of the national road development plan to cater for the needs of the 1980s account will be taken by the Minister for the Environment of the programmes for major improvement works included in the City Manager's report.  It is anticipated that the programme of works finally approved will relieve city centre congestion, <Col N="215" /> remove traffic hazards and generally improve environmental conditions.</P>
    <P>In the short term, traffic management measures designed to make maximum use of the existing road network have been and continue to be applied by Dublin Corporation and the Gardaí.  Examples include one-way streets, clearway arrangements, co-ordinated systems of traffic lights and parking controls. To assist in the drawing-up of any such proposals there has been in existence for a number of years a Dublin Corporation Traffic Study Group consisting of representatives of Dublin Corporation, the Garda Síochána, CIE and, in an observer capacity, the Department of the Environment.  This group considers matters relating to the alleviation of traffic congestion.  I understand that in 1977 representatives of the group undertook a study tour of certain European bus priority facilities in four cities to assess what might be achieved in Dublin.  Under the aegis of the group a technical traffic unit has been set up and has been in operation for the past six months.  This unit is composed of two engineers, one from the corporation and the other from CIE.  This unit is examining the technical aspects of any proposals to alleviate traffic problems in Dublin at present, and proposals which the unit consider suitable for consideration are submitted to the traffic study group.  At present the unit is engaged on a detailed examination of proposals to improve bus operations and the possible use of bus lanes.</P>
    <P>Certain examinations are being undertaken to see how traffic congestion can be relieved in the short term and to ensure proper utilisation of our present buses and trains.  The proposals contained in Deputy Quinn's motion are at present before the Government.  But before expending a sum of money in the region of £42 million any Government must ensure that that sum will be fully utilised.  For example, CIE estimate that something in the region of 27,000 people per day travel at present on the Bray-Howth service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> Twenty-seven thousand, and CIE's projections are that this figure will increase considerably, to something in the region of 80,000 per day.  These are projections any Government must consider carefully to ascertain first that they are accurate and, if they are, that they would undoubtedly relieve congestion. But we must also take into consideration the attitudes of people in those areas.  We must take into consideration their attitude to cars.  Would the people of Clontarf, Bray and Stillorgan utilise an electrified train system?  Such questions must be considered by the Government to ensure that the public money which would be spent on such a project gives proper return.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin South-Central):</i> The streets of the city will never accommodate that number of cars.  We must look at that problem now; there is no use in waiting until 1991 when we have such a number of cars on our streets and many new towns outside the city centre.  We must ensure that as towns like Blanchardstown and Tallaght develop people living in them do not have to cross the city to work.  I know of many people who live in Ballyfermot <Col N="217" /> and Crumlin but who must travel to Coolock and Ballymun to work.  We must do all we can, as the population of the city expands, to ensure that people do not have to travel across the city to work.  We must see to it that factories are built close to these new towns and that all necessary facilities are provided for the people living in them.  Such matters must be considered in conjunction with a rapid transport system for the city.</P>
      <P>This is a complex and expensive matter. Practical steps will have to be taken to try to relieve the present congestion.  It is easy for Deputy O'Leary to tell the House that one would walk faster from the Parnell Monument to Leinster House than one would travel the same distance by car but he should have been more practical and put forward his solution to the problem.</P>

Were it not for their foresight I have no doubt that the traffic in Dublin, rather than operating intermittently as it does, would be at a permanent standstill.  There has been relatively little done by anybody in public authority since to improve traffic flow.  In the greater Dublin area today there are several different road authorities without roads, a bus service that cannot bus, a train service without trains, a phone service that does not work, an intermittent postal service and an occasional electricity service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to explain the position of Dublin at present.  The public water supply can run dry in the southern part of the city during the wettest recorded period in history.  That is the sort of situation which is developing in this capital city because of lack of attention, lack of planning and lack of commitment to the development of public services.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the city of Dublin is being choked to death by traffic, by our own actions as individuals and by our lack of attention and lack of action as elected and responsible people. Recent figures published indicate that traffic congestion, snarl-ups, sitting in traffic and waiting about, cost CIE £1½ million last year in Dublin city alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="220" /> There is always a cry about the enormous subsidy which has to be paid to this State body every year, but £1½ million of that subsidy was taken up by buses sitting in the middle of Dublin city, which could not move because the road authority had not got the roads to carry them.  If it cost CIE £1.5 million, let us ponder for a moment on what the entire cost of congestion was when you consider the other public services and the private sector, all the transport which was delayed for so long in the course of one year.</P>
    <P>Last year an additional 20,000 cars were registered in the city of Dublin.  The figures I have show that there were 136,000 registrations of private vehicles in Dublin in 1972.  By 1977 that figure had risen to 156,000 and in one more year it had risen to 176,000.  The Minister of State said the figure has risen to 213,000.  I am rather surprised at that but, if it is true, it paints an even grimmer picture.  For the additional 20,000 cars which were registered with the taxation authority in Dublin last year, I wonder were there 20,000 yards of new roads built in Dublin, not miles, not meters, but yards.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to all of us that it is wrong for us to continue to rely in the main, as we have been doing, on private transport to move people from their place of abode to their place of employment. You cannot continue to operate a capital city in that way, a capital city set out in the unique geographic way Dublin is set out in, where there is no eastern outlet because of the containment of the sea, a restriction to the south because of the range of the Dublin-Wicklow mountains, and where the entire development, through a conscious planning decision, is in the three new cities being built in the western part of county Dublin.  You cannot continue to rely on private transport being able to cope with the situation when road authorities are starved of funds and cannot build roads.  Many people do not want those roads built anyway.  The transport authority have not got the capital injection to provide the rail services and cannot move their bus services because of the lack of sufficient roadways. <Col N="221" /> One of the suggestions put forward by the Minister last week, and by the Minister of State again today, was that there is a range of options which could be employed.  The Minister suggested the introduction of flexi-time in the public service, as if that were the solution.  Let us be honest.  There are about 47,000 to 50,000 public servants and about 1,500 of them are operating flexi-time.  Another option suggested was the staggering of school hours.  In the winter the amount of staggering of school hours which could be achieved is very small unless we are to have young children travelling long distances in the dark.</P>
    <P>The third option was the extension of parking restrictions.  Have we not got sufficient harassment and annoyance already from the lack of parking space? Do we not all see the absolute disregard by many motorists for parking restrictions? Is the Minister seriously suggesting the solution to the traffic problem in Dublin is to extend the unforceable traffic regulations and restrictions which operate at present?  Those were the three main options outlined by the Minister last week and, to some extent, re-echoed by his Minister of State this evening.  They are not on.  They are not solutions.  They are short-term temporary attempts to improve the situation. They do not encompass any broad view of the problem and how to solve it.</P>
    <P>We encouraged 20,000 additional registrations of private cars in Dublin last year.  Since we began this discussion the price of oil has risen seriously and a further serious rise is threatened.  Yet more and more we are encouraging people to rely on that form of energy.  The public transportation authority at present are relying exclusively on oil as a form of energy.  Very often it can take up to 90 minutes to travel from Tallaght into Dublin city centre.  These are not figures off the top of my head.  They are statistics from which CIE can show that quite regularly it takes their public transportation service 90 minutes to collect and carry passengers from Tallaght to Dublin city centre.  Tallaght is one of the new towns into which we are forcing people, taking people and planting them. It takes another 90 minutes to collect them and bring them home again.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> There are very stark facts relating to Dublin.  I often wonder how few people in this House appreciate them, or are interested in them, or want to know about them.  The population of County Dublin has doubled in the past ten years from 170,000 to 350,000 and the projection is that it will double again between now and 1991.  Three new cities, not three new towns, are being built in the western part of Dublin county, in Tallaght, Clondalkin-Lucan and Blanchardstown. The city of Tallaght is scheduled to become as big as the city of Cork is today with a population of 120,000.  The city of Clondalkin-Lucan and the city of Blanchardstown are scheduled to become cities with a population of 100,000 each, far bigger than Limerick or Waterford.</P>
    <P>They will be the third and fourth largest cities in the State.  Indications from population counts so far are that each one of those three cities is running ahead of the population projections. Have we made any effort to provide new road services out to them?  Have we made any real effort to provide a realistic public transportation service for them?  None whatsoever.  One could have an interesting debate on the lack of other public services in those new cities, but tonight we are talking about public transportation and effective ways of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State appeared to be a little bit confused as to which motion he was speaking to.  There is a slight difference between the wording in Deputy Quinn's motion and the motion in the names of the Fine Gael Dublin Deputies. The Dublin transportation study was published in 1972 and envisaged a major programme of motorways and roads to be built over a 20 year period.  Part of that was adopted by Dublin County Council and very recently part of it was adopted by Dublin City Council.  By the time the city had got around to adopting it, the county had decided to scale down the proposals.  They realised that because of the capital cost most of those motorways would not be built in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>According to the Transportation Commission upon which both Ministers <Col N="223" /> place such reliance, the Dublin city and county engineer has suggested that if the controversial eastern by-pass were to be built, it would take 11 years.  The Minister of State berated the House because we suggested that the first phase of the electrification of the railways would take three years, not four years, and that this would be too long.  Is he suggesting reliance on the roadways if the eastern by-pass will take 11 years to build?</P>
    <P>The Transportation Commission on which the Ministers rely as their excuse for everything said it seemed that unless some measures are implemented traffic congestion in the Dublin area in the years immediately ahead will reach chaotic proportions.  That is the Government's own Transportation Commission.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with this commission which has been held up as the panacea for all ills, the fulfilment of an election promise.  The Government will recall that the election was in June 1977.  They took office on 5 July 1977 and they found a report which had arrived three months earlier from CIE setting out specific proposals for the building of phase 1 of their rapid rail plan, that was, the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  In September of 1978 this transport commission was set up.  In January of 1979 it published its first paper and invited comments and it made it clear in that paper that excluded from its terms of reference was any consideration of phase 1 of the CIE proposals.  Let there be no clouding of the issues; let there be no hiding behind this commission as there is so very often.  First of all it took almost a year and a half to fulfil the simple election promise of setting up a transport commission and, when it was set up, excluded from its terms of reference was the electrification of the Howth&mdash; Bray line, phase 1 of the CIE proposals. It is there in detail on the Minister's desk.  It is now, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, 20 months since the Government came into office.  Yet they have not managed to make a decision on the electrification of the Howth&mdash;Bray line.  In the meantime the cost has risen <Col N="224" /> by approximately 25 to 33? per cent since the day they first took office.</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that we are extremely lucky in the Dublin area because of the building, almost 100 years ago, of the coastal railway line running out through Blanchardstown and the railway line to the south.  There are now existing permanent ways running out on a radial basis into the main population centres.  If it had not been for the short-sighted, ridiculous attempt at removing the Harcourt Street line some years ago we would have had a further railway running unto the southern part of the Dublin commuter belt and every part of Dublin could have been served by rail lines.  However, the Minister will realise himself whether he should thank his predecessors for that or not.</P>
    <P>The situation is that there can be built by CIE, on their existing property and on reservations that have been held for them by the Dublin County Council in their development land, rail services to provide a transportation system that would allow 220,000 workers in Dublin to be brought from their homes to within 10 minutes' walk of their place of employment and the total disruption to private property to bring that about would be 20 houses.  We are extremely fortunate that those permanent ways happen to exist, that they are of such a width that additional lines can be built out and that reservations were held by the planning authority in such a way that the land is still clear to take links up into Tallaght new town from the Cherry Orchard on the southern line and to take links up into Blanchardstown new town on the Broadstone line.  In addition to that the suggestion of transferance to electrification of the rail services allows us an opportunity to reduce our dependence on one type of fuel.  The existing rail service on the north-south line relies exclusively on oil.  Mainline diesel trains which were designed and bought and built to serve on mainline services are now providing a hopelessly inadequate commuter service on the suburban lines.  We are also being offered a unique opportunity, through the CIE proposals, to provide a transportation service not just for the city, not just for the north-south <Col N="225" /> belt, as the Minister of State was inclined to represent, but to the new town of Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Lucan and Tallaght as well, the new population centres, the three new cities. We can now provide lines that are free of urban congestion, that can move large masses of people rapidly from one centre to another with no pollution, no noise and no reliance on the Ayatollah.</P>
    <P>The conclusions in the Final Report of the Dublin Rail Rapid Transit Study are worth quoting and are as follows:</P>
    <P>The rapid transit system would operate free from the effects of urban congestion.  The faster journeys possible have been reflected in the benefits used to evaluate the alternative systems.  Additionally, the rapid transit systems would be capable of providing a reliable transport service over a large part of the city.  The recommended system has sufficient spare track capacity for increases in trip demand beyond the 15-20 year planning horizon used in the study.</P>
    <P>We believe that investment in the recommended plan would provide the City of Dublin with a system which allows considerably greater flexibility with regard to planning issues, opening the way for changes in parking policy, land use development, pedestrianisation of streets, and would provide a stimulus for the development of the new towns to the west of the city.  It would provide an underground link along the length of the River Liffey in the city centre and, later, connect the dispersed office employment areas in the Ballsbridge corridor.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, this Report was prepared by the same consultant who prepared the plan for Newcastle-upon-Tyne which the Minister told us about last week and said he had visited.  I accept the Minister's interest in visiting Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I was inclined to shudder when I realised what he said when he described what was happening in Newcastle:</P>
    <P>It will be interesting to see how it will perform in terms of passenger carrying relief of congestion and financial results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> Does that mean that nothing is going to happen in Dublin until it is discovered whether or not the new system in Newcastle is a success or a failure?</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that the report made to CIE envisaged phase 1, the electrification of the existing suburban lines from Howth to Bray.  Phase 2 was to build a new electrified line out on the line of the Dublin-Cork railway as far as the centre of the new Clondalkin-Lucan new town, the station there to be served by an internal bus service collecting people in the ends of the two new cities and bringing them into the station, with a new link being taken off at Cherry Orchard and running up into Tallaght.  The difference between the 90-minute commuter journey on the bus from Tallaght along the non-existent roadways and the journey by rail would mean that a rail link running from Tallaght to Kilnamanagh, to the Naas road, to Cherry Orchard and into the city would take 19 minutes, noise free and pollution free.</P>
    <P>Phase 3 was to take a link through Broadstone, through Cabra, Ashtown, the Navan Road, into Blanchardstown and a new link, on a reservation, into the Blanchardstown new town and with a further link running off that to take in the people from the new satellite town of Ballymun into the city in 11 minutes.</P>
    <P>Both of the Ministers were suggesting that this is a plan that does not provide a comprehensive transport service for the city and its environs.  Of course it does and if Harcourt Street rail line was still there the area directly to the south of Dublin could also be served by a rail service. CIE are now suggesting, because a bus way would not be appropriate in view of the removal of the bridges across Adelaide Road, that there should be a rail service on Harcourt Street line and connected into this new system.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1971 the McKinsey Report commissioned by the Government said on page 33:</P>
    <P>The commuter services more than justify their current losses when their social benefits are taken into account and their social benefits will become even more significant as the populations of Dublin and Cork grow bringing increased traffic congestion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> It was a fair enough thing to say, one would have thought, even in 1971.  Yet the Minister, speaking at column 1561 last Wednesday about the proposed improvement of the Howth-Bray services which would attract additional traffic said:</P>
    <P>There is no prospect that they could operate on a totally commercial basis meeting capital and interest charges.</P>
    <P>Was anybody suggesting that they should?  Have we not all accepted by this stage that CIE, to a large extent, provide not a commercial service in public transportation but a mixture of commercial and social services?  Is anybody suggesting for a moment that if we handed the entire thing back to private enterprise that they would decide to electrify the Howth-Bray line and hope to make a profit?  No one is suggesting that.  What we are suggesting is that the losses in traffic congestion, the losses in pollution, the reliance on one type of scarce and rapidly diminishing commodity should be set against whatever operating losses would be envisaged not just in the electrification of the Howth-Bray line but in the provision of the new services into Tallaght, Clondalkin and Blanchardstown.</P>
    <P>The favourite excuse is also trotted out by the Minister of State that there are no detailed proposals from CIE except for Phase 1.  Of course there are not.  Would the Minister put in detailed proposals for an entire transportation plan for Dublin city and county if he was hanging around for two years looking for a decision on Phase 1?  Does the Minister make the excuse that he has not got a decision on the first set of detailed proposals because he has not got the last set of detailed proposals?  Who is trying to fool who?  The Minister is certainly not fooling the House and he is certainly not fooling the general public who have to travel on these services at present.</P>
    <P>There are minor differences which I believe ought to be included in the CIE proposals.  The link to Ballymun which I dealt with ought also to include a further link to Dublin Airport.  My local <Col N="228" /> authority has made this point repeatedly to CIE and I think eventually CIE will come around to acceptance of that point of view.  In the long term that link could be carried right back through Swords and on to the northern line so as to provide a circular route there.</P>
    <P>The simple fact of the matter is that what CIE have suggested as opposed to the existing services on the Dublin-Bray line would be that they would run from 6 o'clock in the morning until midnight or perhaps until 1 o'clock in the morning, a service to provide fast comfortable trains every five minutes at peak hours and every 15 to 20 minutes at other times. There would be on the entire system 47 stations ranged over approximately 40 miles of track serving the north, the south, the south-west, the north-west and the Ballymun area of Dublin city and county.  That is the proposal before the Government in its outline form and in its detailed form as far as Phase 1 is concerned.  They also envisage operating local bus services which would collect commuters from suburban estates and carry them in to each of the stations involved thereby eliminating very much of the public transport journeys by bus that have now to be taken from the outlaying areas directly to the city centre and into the areas of congestion.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the existing rail service that we have in Dublin at present.  They are generally operated by old, outmoded, outdated carriages designed originally as mainline carriages and which are still sometimes pulled off the suburban services at weekends and operated on the main lines.  They are drawn by mainline diesel engines that are both slow and cumbersome, so slow to accelerate that by the time they reach their optimum speed they must be cut back again in order to be stopped at the next station.  Most of the carriages are unheated.  Many of them have doors that do not operate properly and most have at least one broken window.  Very often the suburban trains running from Bray to Drogheda, and that is quite a distance, have sets of carriages in which there is not one public toilet.  If one happens to be lucky enough even to get on a <Col N="229" /> train that travels at night he may have to travel without light, without heat or other facilities.  Now CIE have resorted to fitting plastic stacking chairs because apparently they cannot operate the ordinary sort of basic commuter service. The following is a quotation from a letter which I received in November last from the Chairman of CIE:</P>
    <P>I do not think that you appreciate the difficulties which we are encountering through the lack of rolling stock.  The numbers travelling on the Suburban rail services are increasing each week and the number of carriages which are available is reducing. We can either reduce the frequency of service or increase the capacity of the remaining carriages by providing more standing room.  We have chosen to do the latter.</P>
    <P>Further, he says:</P>
    <P>I do not know if you are aware that many people travel in the Guard's Van because no other facilities are available when they board the train.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister told us that the Government are committed to the retention of these services.  Where is the service? I invite either Minister present this evening to travel with me on any day of the week at any time they may wish on the Dublin suburban rail services and then on stepping off the train to say honestly whether there is any sort of decent service for the people of this capital city.</P>
    <P>Inept and inefficient as the service is, with rolling stock that must be pulled off at 7 o'clock each evening because it requires a whole night's maintenance if it is to be used the following day, it has increased from about 10,000 passengers per day in 1972 to 27,000 passengers now.  According to CIE the electrification of the rail line and the bringing in of a German firm to build the rolling stock and new signalling equipment could treble the number of journeys on the system.  That would be of considerable relief to the overcrowding in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Let us consider, too, the population aspect.  Both the Green Paper and the White Paper indicate that there is not a high employment content in the scheme <Col N="230" /> proposed by CIE but that scheme contains the equivalent of 1,500 jobs for 12 years.  The Minister of State asks what we are to do in the short term and reminds us that the plan will take 20 years to complete.  A motorway proposal also takes many years to put into effect.  It is less effective and relies on the assumption that there will be sufficient fuel to provide for the additional number of cars envisaged by the transportation study.  The simple fact is that there are 1,500 jobs for 12 years in the CIE proposals plus the jobs created by bringing into the country the firm that would build the rolling stock and the signalling equipment.  That is a considerable amount of employment but in the short term we could examine the capital cost and decide not simply to sanction phase one but, in order to have a transportation service extending to the newer parts of the city, to link together phases two and three in order to bring electrified rail to Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown simultaneously.  The system can be built over 12 years. Naturally, there would be a difference in capital cost but there is a considerable amount of employment involved.  In addition, there is the considerable need for people to be able to move rapidly from one location to another if we are to meet employment prospects or to achieve any other aim we have for Dublin.</P>
    <P>I accept that there is a need to create special lanes for public transport in the city centre but I do not foresee the road network being improved rapidly in the next few years.  However, this way of relieving congestion in the centre city area will only contribute partially to a solution of the problem.  Because there is so much land in the ownership of CIE along the lines of those permanent ways we are in the unique position of being able to provide a decent service out into the new towns and along the existing rail lines with only the disruption of a total of 20 houses.  With his experience as a member of the City Council I should have been interested to hear the Minister of State say how many houses would be disrupted if the plans in the Dublin transportation study were implemented in respect of the building of roads and motorways through Dublin city.  At peak <Col N="231" /> times in this city, CIE buses move at a mere four miles per hour.  As has been said that is slower than walking pace.  I do not see an improvement in that situation in the short term but a considerable improvement could be effected by the electrification of the Howth-Bray line and in conjunction with that there could be electrification of the line as far north as Balbriggan or even Drogheda.</P>
    <P>Those are the sort of options that are open in relation to moving large masses of people faster from the outlying locations to their places of employment.  I am disappointed with the change in emphasis from the Green Paper, with its milk-and-water approach to the CIE proposals, to the White Paper which seems to be giving the thumbs down to these proposals generally.</P>
    <P>In addition, we must consider the statements attributed to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, a Minister who is inclined to speak a lot for himself.  In a publication entitled <i>Southside</i> the Minister is quoted as saying that the rapid rail plan is not the only option for the future of suburban rail, that there is nothing to prevent modernisation of the existing system which could be done for less than one-fifth of the cost of the other option.  Of course there is everything to prevent modernisation of the existing system.  The signalling system needs replacing.  The carriages are obsolete.  I expect that people travelled on those carriages to the Eucharistic Congress.</P>
    <P>I can only assume that the transportation system envisaged by the Minister for Economic Planning and Development must be on one of his own flights of fantasy.  We have examined the CIE proposal with the utmost care and we are in favour of their option for the electrification of the first phase and the rapid extension of that into the following two stages for the provision of fast and efficient commuter services for the people living in the three new towns.  We are in favour of the plan being condensed into a period shorter than 20 years.  If we were in office we would implement such a plan and we shall implement it when we are in office.</P>

      <P>In proposing this motion Deputy Ryan said that most of us thought we were traffic experts.  I agree and, consequently, the Minister and the Government are to be complimented on their very definite action in setting up the Transport and Consultative Commission whereby there will be brought together the services of experts on this burning question of the Dublin traffic problem.  We must realise that in Dublin city alone there are 800 miles of roads and streets and that the cost of maintaining these alone is very heavy each year. The city is expanding all the time. Therefore, the traffic problem is an increasing one.  The commission must take a hard look at the whole future of transportation. Hopefully, they will be able to suggest a suitable solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>The Minister has assured us that the committee are working with all speed in the preparation of their report.  There is a danger, though, of the motorist becoming a hate figure as a result of the difficulty in walking through our streets because of the numbers of cars that are parked illegally.  This situation should not be tolerated.  The increasing numbers of cars in the city are a sign of our growing affluence.  With one exception, no city in the world has been able to control the entry of cars.  Singapore is the exception. A person who drives a car into that city on his or her own must pay roughly £1, but if four people occupy the car there is no charge.  This system was tried in two English cities but it failed in both cases.  People will not react until the eleventh hour when the truth dawns.</P>
      <P>We have discussed different types of roads and motorways.  Dublin Corporation have no proposals now for a motorway but have a proposal for a multi-purpose road.</P>

      <P>He sanctioned the river crossing and said the motorway would have been built if the money had been available.  We may be able to go into that more deeply on another occasion.</P>
      <P>The simplistic attitude adopted by many people, including politicians, consists in pinning their hopes on one type of transport, such as the rapid rail system, and regarding it as the solution to all our problems.  The rapid rail system would cater for only a very small part of the population and the same applies to the corporation's multi-purpose road.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that Dublin port is an essential part of the city and over 12,000 people work in the port area.  In considering any road proposals we must bear in mind the importance of the port to the economy and well-being of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the corporation adopted a proposal for a multi-purpose road on the eastern approaches but even if this proposal were accepted by the Government it would take seven years to build the road.  What is to happen in the meantime? Residential areas are being destroyed by traffic and an interim solution is necessary.  At a meeting of the corporation yesterday a proposal of mine was adopted and they have called on engineers and officials to bring forward a report within a month showing measures proposed to ease traffic problems until we have adopted some major proposal on traffic reform.  We hope to implement the recommendations of this report as soon as we receive it and it will call for the full co-operation of all citizens because grave damage is at present being done to the health of inhabitants of the city.  Slow-moving traffic pollutes the air to a greater extent than fast-moving traffic.  Dublin is choking. We must ensure that there is a free flow of traffic so that people will not be poisoned by fumes.  We should also emphasise the great need to build in the inner city areas so that people will not <Col N="234" /> have to move outside the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy McMahon and I want to speak on the political decisions involved in this issue. The technicalities have already been dealt with.  During the past 20 months the Minister has been asked repeatedly when a decision will be made on this matter and he has repeatedly evaded that question by saying he was waiting for a report or still reviewing it.  The time has now come for a decision to be made. The Minister knows all the answers; they have been fed daily to him by CIE. However, I realise that the Minister and the Minister of State are completely hamstrung and that a decision has already been made.  I put it to the Minister for Tourism and Transport&mdash;his title shows the priorities within the Department&mdash;that his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, has already commissioned an economic study from an economist colleague in Trinity College, Dr. Seán Barrett, and that this study has informed the Minister that the Government have already made a decision and that the figures given in the <i>Southside</i> paper to which Deputy Boland referred came from that group of economists and from Dr. Barrett.  Many people in transport circles in this city are aware of this and I would ask the Minister to confirm or deny it.</P>
      <P>My second point is also a political one.  The Government who abolished the wealth tax, food subsidies and car tax are a Government who will not allocate funds for a system of transport which will benefit all the people equally.  That is not in their nature.  As we have seen to date, the ideology of this Fianna Fáil Government is such that where the choice exists between the few and the many they have come down in favour of the few.</P>

      <P>Fine Gael Deputies tabled this motion on the understanding that in doing so they would prod the Government to quicker action, thinking that decisions had already been made to improve the traffic situation in the Dublin area generally.  We were sadly disappointed to learn during the debate that the wrong decisions were made.  It was decided to continue with the chaotic conditions and to sit back and do nothing as these chaotic conditions worsen almost hourly.  It is clear that no matter what money is poured into the development of roads we cannot hope to keep pace with development in the city and county areas.  This applies particularly in relation to the county areas. Taking into account recent events, it will not even keep pace with the marchers, never mind those travelling by car and other means.  I would ask the Government to accept this motion.  Decisions will have to be made without further delay.</P>
      <P>Not so many years ago it was my habit to get a bus from Bohernabreena at 7.30 a.m.  This bus would often arrive at O'Connell Bridge at 7.55 a.m.  That same bus now takes one hour for the same journey; on occasion it is not unusual for it to take an hour-and-a-half. Such delays are most frustrating for those who must travel by bus.  Many people who wish to travel by bus are being forced to use alternative transport. This is a policy which the Government will regret and is a policy that is not paying locally or nationally.  It is frightening people away from our capital city and is bad for tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I travelled by bus, the town of Tallaght was served by seven buses.  This was in 1966, 1967 and 1968, which is not so long ago.  At that time Tallaght had a population of 3,500.  That same town, with a population of more than 52,000, is today being served by 36 buses.  This is a fair indication that CIE have failed to keep pace with developments. However, I do not blame CIE because they are dependent on Government decisions, on cash from central funds to keep the service going.  Instead <Col N="236" /> of decreasing the number of buses serving the new estates in the county of Dublin, we should be increasing the number of buses serving these areas in order to encourage people to use public transport.  An industrialist in the Terenure area who employs between 30 and 35 people recently claimed that the incidence of late arrivals for work in the morning has increased 300 per cent in the past few years.  That is an indication of the delays being experienced by commuters. Employers will have to take this into account when considering applicants for jobs.</P>
    <P>It is not unusual for school children leaving schools in the Templeogue, Terenure and Rathfarnham areas to wait one-and-a-half hours for a bus.  The odd bus that comes along is unable to take them.  It is not unusual for children from Tallaght attending school in Templeogue, Terenure and Rathfarnham to spend between two and three hours getting home from school. That is not good enough in 1979.  The 49A bus route is shorter today than it was 25 years ago.  CIE have had to shorten this route in order to keep to schedule.  It is a waste of time for CIE to produce a timetable as people have to ignore them.  It must be frustrating for the staff of CIE to have to wait so long for Government decisions and for the decisions of local authorities and the Garda.</P>
    <P>In 1971 we had an experimental bus run from Fairview to the centre of the city.  It is generally accepted that this experiment worked so why are we now talking about further experiments?  Why did we not have a decision on the experiment that was carried out in 1971? Later it was suggested that Burgh Quay should be a busway.  This was talked about for a few years and then it was forgotten.  In April 1975 Grafton Street was reserved for buses.  This experiment was also forgotten despite the fact that it would have worked.  There are many other instances of successful experiments which were forgotten.  In 1977 the Corporation, the Garda, the Department of the Environment and CIE toured a number of European cities, including London which has 130 sections of roadway exclusively for the use of buses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="237" /> In Reading the centre of the city is reserved for buses.  Despite the acceptance by all who went on that study tour that some of the answers to Dublin's traffic problems lay in reserving areas for buses, no action has been taken. Despite CIE's latest request to reserve Parliament Street for buses, no decision has yet been taken.  It would speed up the traffic flow particularly for those using public transport from Tallaght, <Col N="238" /> Crumlin, Kimmage and Ballyfermot. The Government should have talks with Dublin Corporation about trying to speed up traffic in the city.  Unless there is immediate Government action and a flow of money to CIE to implement these policies, I forecast a standstill in the city in the next couple of years.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Adjournment Debate: Post Office Dispute.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably, I find it necessary to seek time on the Adjournment to focus attention on what has become now a national scandal.  I refer to the continuing disruption of the postal and telecommunications system.</P>
      <P>A fortnight ago we had a debate on this matter on the Adjournment when we appealed to the Minister, as the Minister responsible for maintaining the country's vital communications system, to take some initiative, some step, or make some gesture which would have the effect of restoring normal services.  In the fortnight that has elapsed the situation has worsened.  I referred on a previous occasion to the very severe disruption, inconvenience, hardship, and loss of business, indeed the manner in which the continued disruption of the postal and telecommunications services is affecting industry, commerce, business, tourism and so on.</P>
      <P>In the past fortnight a new dimension has entered into the situation.  I refer to the appalling hardship being suffered by hundreds of thousands of social welfare recipients.  I am conscious that something like 100,000 old age pensioners will be expecting to receive their pension books in the next week or ten days.  With the continuation of the present impasse, these unfortunate people, the poorest and least privileged section of our community, will be faced with very severe hardship.  The situation has now reached the stage where it is nothing short of a national scandal.  That it should be allowed to continue and the apparent failure of the Minister to take any initiative is absolutely incomprehensible.</P>
      <P>In seeking permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening I am hopeful that the Minister will accede to our appeal, putting it simply, to do something to break this deadlock and have normal services restored.  I could outline at length the number of cases brought to my attention over the past couple of weeks of businesses being completely disrupted, of inconvenience being suffered, and I am very concerned at the appalling hardship being suffered by social welfare recipients.  I have seen it in my own constituency in Limerick city in recent weeks when in very inclement weather these people have had to queue for long periods only to find that their social welfare payments have not arrived.  They come across to my office but I cannot telephone the Department of Social Welfare because there is nobody there to respond to telephone calls.</P>
      <P>It would be difficult to exaggerate the adverse effects of this prolonged dispute and disruption in the country's vital telecommunications and postal services. The whole country is waiting for the Minister to take some initiative in an endeavour to resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House.  My colleague, Deputy Cluskey, the Leader of the Labour Party, wishes to speak also and I will give way to him in a moment. The point I want to get across here this evening is that there is an obligation on the Minister to take some step now to bring to an end immediately this situation with which we have lived not merely in recent weeks but for over a year, when scarcely a day or a week passes that telephones are not working and there is disruption of telephone and postal services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="241" /> Again I want to emphasise the appalling hardship being suffered by social welfare recipients, the possible immense hardship that will be suffered by old age pensioners in the next few weeks because they will be unable to get their pension books.  In the city of Limerick this coming weekend there is to be a world sporting event.  At present teams from all over the world are arriving in Limerick, accompanied by press corps from various countries, some as far away as New Zealand.  It will not be possible for them to send their reports back to their newspapers.  I am sure that will give us a nice name abroad and will prove a good way of advertising our attractions for tourism and industry.  I demand that the Minister take action immediately to restore this vital communication service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Donnell for permitting me to speak during the time allotted to him.  On three occasions I tried to raise this matter in the House as a matter of urgency but the Chair did not accept it as such.  I tabled two questions on the Order Paper relating to the dispute, but as they are Nos. 119 and 200 they will not be reached for approximately two weeks.  In those questions I requested the Taoiseach and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to meet the executive of the Post Office Workers' Union with a view to resolving this dispute.  The Minister is the employer in this case and he cannot, as he has attempted to do over recent weeks, hide behind the view that it would not be the proper procedure to meet the executive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case the Minister might imply that I am seeking to gain political advantage, I should like to point out that I am asking the Minister to do something which I did when Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare.  During the time there was a strike situation in the Department of Social Welfare and, although there were laid down procedures for dealing with such a dispute, I knew that if I waited to go through the normal channels unimaginable suffering would be inflicted on social welfare recipients.  It was because of that that I agreed to meet immediately the executive of the organisation <Col N="242" /> involved in that dispute and within one afternoon I had resolved the situation to everyone's satisfaction. Therefore, I am not asking the Minister to do something which I was not prepared to do myself when faced with a similar problem.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, this strike is deteriorating.  Two weeks ago there was a possibility that social welfare payments would be interfered with but that was overcome.  However, because of the frustration of those involved in this strike at the attitude of the Minister, at his lack of concern and activity, the dispute is getting worse.  One would imagine that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Labour had gone out on strike in sympathy with the workers because they have not made any effort to resolve this serious dispute. While bearing in mind the position of social welfare recipients we must also consider the question of our international image, which has suffered severely in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>At considerable expense we brought up to 100 Japanese businessmen here recently and their main concern was the fact that it was practically impossible to communicate with the outside world but it is also nearly impossible to contact any county within the country because of this dispute.  The Minister should stop sitting on his dignity, cease hiding behind procedures and do what he was elected to do.  He should resolve, or at least make an attempt to resolve this dispute. I will concede the minute remaining to me to Deputy Harte.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to express my regret to users of the Post Office services throughout the country for the continuing inconvenience and hardship caused by this dispute.  I have had to do so now on a number of occasions in this House and on each occasion I have tried to explain why it is necessary to preserve the orderly procedures which are agreed with all the unions in the civil service for settling claims in regard to pay and conditions. It is of primary importance that the public should understand what is involved here.  Deputy Cluskey suggested that we were too concerned about procedures, but I do not know what he means exactly by that.  The procedures are there to protect the interests of the staff.  If agreements are to be ignored and orderly methods of resolving pay problems are to be set aside, then there will be no settled procedures for any group in the civil service.  I do not believe that anyone wants that, least of all the civil service unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the procedures under the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the national pay agreement, to both of which the union is a party, are available to the union for the purpose of settling their pay claims.  No obstacles are being <Col N="244" /> placed in the union's way.  I have repeatedly assured the union of my Department's readiness at all times to resume negotiations on the claims in accordance with the agreed procedures.  I have also given an assurance that the Department will facilitate the union in every way possible in processing its claim quickly to a conclusion and I have undertaken that, if the union wishes to avail of independent arbitration, I will accept the findings of the arbitrator. Deputies will appreciate how difficult it is in these circumstances to understand why the union is continuing a strike which is unnecessary and which inflicts such difficulties and hardships on the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing in the Fianna Fáil manifesto about conciliation and arbitration.  What was the Minister's stand in 1977?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are also the attendant consequences for our economy and the jobs of other people.  Deputy Cluskey suggested that I should negotiate with the union outside the conciliation and arbitration scheme with a view to settling the dispute.  That suggestion is ill-considered and I am sure the Deputy is aware of that.  Is the Deputy suggesting that the orderly industrial relations procedures should be abandoned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his party undertook in 1977 to examine that problem and do something about it but they did nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Is Deputy Cluskey advocating that the Department and the Government should seek a settlement of the dispute without any regard to the consequences?  If that is what is suggested, and it seems to me to be the only logical interpretation, I ask the Deputy to come out in the open and state his position clearly because the central issue involved here is whether there is to be a stable basis of industrial relations in the civil service or whether the agreements between the Minister for the Public Service and all the civil service staff associations, including the Post Office Workers' <Col N="245" /> Union, are to be overturned.  Let us be clear that, if that is done, there can be no going back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to sum up by repeating that the Department stand ready to resume negotiations immediately on the unions' claims in accordance with the provisions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the national pay agreement.  I ask the union and the staff to accept that there must be a general commitment throughout the civil service to the use of the conciliation and arbitration scheme and the national pay agreement. I am sure it will be appreciated that any other approach would be harmful for the future of industrial relations in the public service.  Nothing is to be <Col N="246" /> gained by a continuation of this strike. Everybody in the community is the loser.  Therefore, I again appeal to the union and to the staff to cease their action and to resume negotiations with a view to settling their claims as quickly as possible.  In making this appeal, I wish to assure the staff of my interest in having their problems dealt with speedily and sympathetically and to emphasise again that my primary concern is to see a settlement of the union's claims on a basis which is fair to the staff and to the users of the Department's services</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Haughey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have attended two Council meetings of Ministers responsible for social affairs.  The first meeting was on 28 October 1977.  At that meeting, as well as dealing with items on the agenda which were the responsibility of my own Department, I deputised for the Minister for Labour, who was unable to attend, in relation to items for which his Department were responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from customary routine items the following items were on the agenda: 1.  Re-examination of the rules governing the tasks and operation of the European Social Fund.  2.  Commission communication concerning the employment <Col N="41" /> of young people. 3.  Proposal for a Council Decision amending the Council Decision of 22 July 1975 concerning a programme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty. 4.  Proposals for Regulations amending Regulations (EEC) Nos. 1408/71 and 574/72 and their Annexes on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community.  5.  Fifth report of the European Social Fund (financial year 1976).  6.  Report on the programme to combat poverty.  7.  First progress report of the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work.</P>
    <P>My Department was responsible for items 3, 4 and 6 and the decisions taken in relation to these items were as follows&mdash;</P>
    <P>Item 3&mdash;The Council agreed on an amendment to the Decision of 22 July 1975 to ensure that action under the poverty programme would continue with financial assistance from the Community beyond the two years originally laid down.  The amendment enables Community financing to continue until 1980 for projects currently in progress.</P>
    <P>Item 4&mdash;This item contained proposals for improvements in the Regulations dealing with social security for migrant workers.  The proposals were approved.</P>
    <P>Item 6&mdash;This item concerned the report for 1976 on the operation of the pilot schemes to combat poverty.  The Council took note of the report.</P>
    <P>The second meeting which I attended was on 27 November 1978 and the main items on the agenda were as follows: 1. Proposals for Community support for aid to promote the employment of young people.  2.  Sixth report on the European Social Fund 1977 financial year.  3. Proposal for a Directive on the progressive implementation of the principle of equality of treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  4. Second European social budget.  5. Amended proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states to combat illegal immigration and illegal employment.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Progress report.  6.  Situation regarding social matters and employment <Col N="42" /> in the Community.  &mdash;Progress report (Introductory statement of Mr. Vredeling, Vice-President of the Commission).</P>
    <P>My Department was responsible for items 3 and 4 and the decisions taken in relation to these items were as follows:</P>
    <P>Item 3&mdash;The Council agreed on the proposal for a directive on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.  The directive applies to statutory schemes of social security and member states have six years within which to comply with its terms.  Occupational schemes are not covered by the directive but the Council noted the Commission's intention of making additional proposals regarding these schemes at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Item 4&mdash;The Council took note of the Second European Social Budget which had been drawn up in accordance with guidelines adopted by it at its meeting on 30 April 1976, stressed the importance of the information provided, invited the Commission, in co-operation with experts from member states, to evaluate the experience gained in drawing up the Second Budget and then to submit proposals for a third European Social Budget.</P>
    <P>In reply to a similar question addressed to him, the Minister for Labour is supplying information in relation to the items on the agendas of both meetings for which his Department were responsible.</P>
    <P>I understand that the next meeting of the Council of Social Affairs Ministers is planned for 15 May next.  The agenda for the meeting is not, however, yet available.</P>

Electronic data processing is already used in my Department and associated offices for accounts and salary work, economic and financial forecasting, Revenue administration and engineering operations.</P>
      <P>Feasibility studies relating to computerisation are under way at present in a number of other areas but it is not yet possible to estimate the likely cost savings involved.</P>

      <P>My Department are responsible for ensuring that computerisation is effectively applied in the civil service and in certain related public service agencies. Comprehensive arrangements have been made, and continue to be developed, to ensure that computer facilities are <Col N="72" /> available to all Departments.  The Central Data Processing Services (CDPS) of my Department provide a wide range of computer services to many Government Departments and to certain related public service agencies. Before a decision is made to develop any computer system, CDPS and the user organisation examine the benefits likely to be achieved.  Only those projects which are likely to result in substantial benefits are implemented.  It is generally difficult to quantify potential cost savings because of the large number of imponderables involved.  However, the benefits are much wider than cost saving&mdash;for example, it would scarcely be conceivable that many of the complex administrative systems operated with the aid of computers could be maintained in any other way.</P>
      <P>As regards the Department of the Public Service itself, while some small elements of its administrative systems have been computerised, the scope for computer systems in the Department is limited.  Any further computerisation of the Department's operations is likely to concentrate on improved planning and information systems rather than on routine tasks currently carried out manually.</P>

      <P>A study is being carried out at present within my Department into the feasibility of use of computers in the <Col N="78" /> placement and information procedures of the National Manpower Service.  The principal objective of introducing such a system would be to perform the matching of job seekers and vacancies in the most effective and expeditious manner in the interests of those seeking employment and of employers.  The study will also examine the cost aspect. When the results of the study are available, I shall make a decision on the introduction of such a system.</P>

    <P>Numerous and very detailed requests for monthly, quarterly and annual statistical information are received from the EEC, the OECD and FAO.  It will be appreciated, however, that since the questionnaires are directed to all member countries of the international bodies in question not all the details requested are necessarily relevant or significant for each country.  To date it has been possible to comply reasonably fully with annual requests from the international organisations specified.</P>
    <P>Presently there are no proposals to fundamentally alter the type or method of collection of statistics relating to agriculture.  It should be noted, however, that the on-going process of collecting <Col N="83" /> statistics is constantly under review and the categories of data collected are frequently modified to meet new and changing demands.  In particular certain inquiries were initiated in recent years to comply with requests for new data e.g. the April and August Enumerations were initiated in 1973 to comply with an EEC Directive on pig stocks on farms. Changes have been introduced also in the annual June and December Enumerations to meet other EEC needs, for example, additional data were collected in the 1975 and 1977 June Enumerations to comply with the requirements <Col N="84" /> of the 1975 and 1977 EEC Agricultural Structural Surveys.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> The position in regard to the three estates which are on the hands of the Land Commission for more than two years is as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Heafey S 28163</i> In view of the number of deserving applicants for allotments for this estate it would not have been practicable to formulate a satisfactory division scheme for the property on its own.  For that reason disposal of the lands has been deferred pending acquisition of a nearby estate of Fitzgerald, Record No. S 28951, comprising 36 hectares, possession of which is to be taken shortly.  It is hoped to formulate a composite division scheme for the two estates with a view to division early in 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Kinsella EEC/UC 6135</i> It was not practicable to deal with the allocation of this estate any sooner.  A division scheme has been formulated with a view to allotment this spring.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Lyons S 28097</i> It would not have been practicable to formulate a satisfactory division scheme for this comparatively small estate on its own.  The Land Commission expect to obtain possession of a nearby estate of O'Donoghue, Record No. S 29465, comprising 14 hectares, later this year and both estates would then be taken together for allocation purposes.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to build an agricultural college in the Cork area. However, it is intended to increase residential student places at the agricultural college at Clonakilty and at some of the other colleges.  It is also proposed to further develop local part-time vocational training in agriculture and for this purpose additional agricultural education centres are being provided at various centres throughout the country, including a number in County Cork.</P>
      <P>The objective of this policy which is included in the White Paper on National Development is to provide education and training opportunities for all young men and women entering farming.</P>

      <P>As is generally known there is at present a shortfall in oil supplies of about 5 per cent across the board, the shortfall being greater in some products than in others.  Steps to minimise the effects of this shortfall by reducing demand where possible are under consideration.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="125" /> The oil companies are fully cognisant of their responsibilities for ensuring adequate supplies of oil and oil products and I am satisfied that they are discharging these responsibilities to the best of their ability.  If, however, the need to establish priorities in the use of oil arises, special attention will be paid to the needs of the farming community arising out of seasonal cultivation work.</P>

      <P>With regard to the alleged uncertainty about the location of the file when a phone inquiry was made recently about the case, I would point out to the Deputy that last year over 50,000 grant applications were submitted to my Department from all parts of the country&mdash;or more than three times the total number of applications made in 1977.  Files in connection with these applications are constantly in circulation, both within the Department and between the Department and its outdoor inspectors.

      <P>An application from the person named was rejected on the 29 January 1979, as it appeared that the work had been completed in June 1977.  The closing date for application for grants under the old scheme in respect of work started prior to 1 November 1977, was 31 January 1978, and the application in question was received after that date.</P>
      <P>However, the applicant now claims that the work started in December 1977, and the inspector has been asked to investigate the matter further.  The application will be re-examined, on receipt of his report.</P>

However, these measures have been the subject of discussion in the Community, particularly in the Standing Committee on Employment and in the Tripartite Conference which was held in November 1978.  The Heads of State meeting in the European Council on 12 and 13 March 1979 decided to ask the Commission to submit a communication on the social and economic implications of concerted work-sharing.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the staffing and enrolment position in the school mentioned in the Deputy's question.  The present staff of principal plus eight assistants may be continued in a permanent capacity under the Rules for National Schools subject to an average enrolment of 275 pupils <Col N="141" /> being maintained.  This results from the recent reduction by me of the average enrolment required for the retention of the eighth assistant in a national school from 300 pupils to 275.</P>

      <P>The statement in the first part of the question is not correct.  Plans for the Community School in Cabinteely submitted to Dublin County Council in July 1976 included a site layout showing possible siting of a future sports hall.  The council asked for details and were informed that there were no plans at the time to provide a sports hall.  If it is decided to erect a sports hall at a future date the necessary plans will be forwarded to the planning authorities at the appropriate time.</P>
