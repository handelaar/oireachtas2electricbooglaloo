      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach (a) the number of the 3,180 enumerators recruited by the Central Statistics Office for the current census, who already have other employment, or, being married, are supported by their spouses; (b)  the number so recruited who were known by the Central Statistics Office to have no other employment; (c) whether any instruction was given to the Central Statistics Office in their recruitment to prefer, other things being equal, persons registered as unemployed; (d) whether the 3,180 positions as temporary enumerators were advertised; (e) if not, by what method of selection these positions were filled; and (f) whether vacancies for these positions were notified to local employment exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. P. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual procedure followed by the Central Statistics Office in recruiting part-time enumerators was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (1)  The positions were widely and frequently advertised in the national and local press over a three-week period at the end of November and at the beginning of December 1978.  They were notified to each National Manpower office and local employment office and <Col N="890" /> advertised therein.  Posters were also exhibited in post offices and Garda stations and application forms were also available in these centres.  Managers of local employment offices were instructed by the Department of Social Welfare to examine their list of registrants, to draw the attention of suitable persons to the vacancies and to advise them to apply.</P>
    <P>(2)  All completed application forms received were considered and persons who on the basis of the completed form seemed to be suitable for the requirements of the job and to possess the essential qualifications set out on the form were called for interview.  The total number of applications received was 12,200.  The total number of persons interviewed was 8,400.</P>
    <P>(3)  Interviews were held at some 100 separate centres where candidates were assessed for suitability.  Preference was given to unemployed or otherwise genuinely needy persons and such candidates who were considered suitable were offered appointments on a priority basis provided that in a rural area a candidate had a current full driving licence and had the use of a motor vehicle for the duration of the enumeration. </P>
    <P>From the records available it would appear that the number of persons appointed to the 3,080 enumerator posts following the procedure outlined comprised 1,120 who had full-time employment, 288 who had some part-time employment and 1,672 who had no other employment.  Of the final figure quoted some 1,045 were married and on home duties.</P>
    <P>There were in addition 100 postmen recruited as enumerators in the Dublin area by means of a special competition confined to postmen.  This arrangement was made in view of the involvement of postmen in previous censuses in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for such a painstaking reply and I accept the facts which he has given to the House, but have the Central Statistics Office done anything to satisfy themselves that the instruction given to prefer people known to be registered as unemployed was obeyed?  If so, how can he explain the fact that only about one in <Col N="891" /> 16 of the people taken on was registered as unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office have not exhausted the inquiry into this because at the moment they are at the height of the census collection procedure.  Sunday was census day and on the lead-up to that and immediately afterwards it was not feasible to undertake a more detailed analysis.  Roughly 800 people classifed as unemployed were interviewed.  The Deputy talks about one in 16, but we are talking about one in four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State not think it strange that out of 12,200 applicants we end up with only 196 persons who were formerly registered as unemployed?  Surely that argument on the part of some office for which the Minister of State or one of his colleagues is responsible is an absolutely neglectful approach towards job creation, a thing which is supposed to be their main preoccupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that it is a neglectful approach.  I confess that I would have hoped that more people would have been taken from the unemployment register, but, on the other hand a number of those applicants would have been disqualified bearing in mind that in about half the areas, the rural areas, one would need a driving licence and the use of a car.  What really disappointed me when I got the figures that I have was the fact that so few of the people registered as unemployed applied for this post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fantastic situation that when the last Government in office postponed the 1976 census they were castigated heavily for missing an opportunity of handing out 3,000 jobs to people who needed them.  Is it not fantastic to find that now 1,220 persons have been taken on as census enumerators who already have full-time jobs?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> If the Chair would bear with me for a moment&mdash;the Minister has spoken, not once but twice about a full driving licence.  I am putting it to the Minister that that qualification would automatically exclude a great number of people who could do the job very well, with the co-operation of their households, on foot or with a bicycle?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Deputy says.  The Deputy said that it was the second time I had said this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion I said it Deputy Kelly reminded me&mdash;and it is on the record&mdash;that most rural dole drawers have cars; that is what Deputy Kelly knows about it.  Also on the last occasion Deputy Kelly said that we had changed their format in relation to the taking of a census and asked why we were not following the pattern they had established.  Well, we are not because they did not hold a census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> Is the Minister not ashamed that most of the people who have got these jobs are well-heeled married women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all right for the Deputy to say that.  As I have said <Col N="893" /> already, the problem is that it involves only 800 people who are unemployed. One of the reasons advanced to me in this regard is that the amount of money, a little over £200, for what could be the months of March and April constituted under-payment and that that was why a number of those people who are unemployed did not seek the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>One last question: was the Employment Action Team consulted about the method of recruiting these 3,000 persons?  Did the Employment Action Team earn their keep in respect of the 3,000 jobs we are talking about? This is a farce.  They care nothing about employment or anything else; employment my eye.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>My original answer, had the Deputy been listening, said yes; they were notified; posters were up in the employment exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the regulations people who are registered as unemployed, if offered these positions by the labour exchanges&mdash;and in the event of their not accepting them&mdash;would automatically be disqualified for six weeks from drawing unemployment benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister did not.  I am now asking the Minister: were the labour exchanges notified that these jobs were available and did they offer them to people who were registered with the labour exchanges as being unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The positions were notified to each manpower office and each local employment exchange, and all of the people who were calling would have been notified in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, under the regulations, if these people were offered the <Col N="894" /> jobs and refused to take them they would automatically be disqualified. Could the Minister tell me how many people were disqualified because they did not take up these positions offered to them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. P. Lalor Mr. P. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Lalor</NameTxt>

If any proposals are submitted to my Department following these discussions, they will be considered quickly and sympathetically.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied with some of the conditions in a number of these hospitals.  I consider however that the <Col N="895" /> solution lies, not in the appointment of an independent inspectorate, but in a continuing programme of improvement works and, in the long term, in the replacement of many of these facilities by community-based services.  I will continue to give the development of this policy a high priority.</P>

      <P>I explained in my reply to the Deputy's previous questions on 13 October 1977 and 1 June 1978 that the question of establishing a charter of rights for hospital patients is a complex issue and requires very detailed consideration; and that the Council of Europe had not completed their consideration of the matter.  I understand that this is still the position.</P>

The Minister has been telling us that he has been making arrangements to improve those services. That question appears to specifically ask the Minister his progress in bringing about those improvements. Can the Minister give us any indication as to what improvements have been brought about, or are envisaged, in the very unsatisfactory situation existing in many out-patient departments?</P>

      <P>There are very considerable improvements and developments being undertaken all over the country.  The accommodation in out-patient departments in hospitals is being extended and improved.  In all the new hospitals being built and in all the new major extensions considerably improved accommodation is being provided for out-patients.  In addition, I made some money available towards the end of last year to any hospital interested in providing amenities, facilities and comforts in existing out-patient departments. Therefore, the work of improving out-patient departments is continuing very extensively throughout the country all the time.</P>

      <P>There was no expenditure in the last year on newspaper, radio or television advertising of Health Act benefits.  My Department, through its Information Section, and each of the health boards, provide information as a matter of course on the benefits available to the public under the Health Acts but this is usually done by personal interview, correspondence or telephone. Details of the health services are available also in an information booklet &ldquo;Summary of Health Services&rdquo;, published by my Department.  The National Social Service Council provides information on benefits available to the public under the Health Acts through a network of Community Information Centres.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the measures being taken to combat malnutrition among the elderly, particularly those living alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Public health nurses are expected to pay particular attention to the care of the elderly in their districts. Social workers, employed directly by health boards or by voluntary organisations grant-aided by health boards, also have the duty of keeping an eye to such people's needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An essential part of any programme for ensuring that needs of this kind are <Col N="899" /> not overlooked is the degree to which relatives and neighbours accept a personal responsibility.  Official policies therefore place special emphasis on the encouragement of voluntary local organisations and on the integration of the health board community care services for the elderly with this voluntary activity.</P>
    <P>Social service councils are encouraged with grants from health boards and provide a variety of services, including meals-on-wheels, visiting, day centres. There are over 250 such councils and committees.</P>
    <P>The Health Education Bureau plan to launch a publicity campaign in the autumn, in consultation with the health boards, which will lay emphasis on the need for understanding of loneliness in old age and on the danger to which old people may be exposed if left alone for long periods.  A booklet will also be prepared aimed specifically at old people themselves, containing information and advice which encourage their independence and confidence.  Diet will be one of the subjects treated.</P>

      <P>In view of the particularly harsh winter we have had would the Minister consider putting comprehensive plans in train to ensure that all steps possible will be taken to ensure that every assistance will be given to old people in the coming winter?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex matter and it will take me some time to deal with the questions the Deputy has posed. There is a comprehensive structure of services for the aged throughout the community.  We are reviewing those services with a view to showing up any inadequacies there are and indicating what improvements can be brought about. That review is under way.  I am also in discussion with the National Social Service Council about the whole matter. Furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, the question of providing heating for the old people is under review at present <Col N="900" /> with a view to propounding some new service before next winter.  At present the very long extension of the severe winter weather has caused particular problems and these are being actively followed up, investigated and, where possible, remedial action taken by the health boards.</P>

It will be some time before information on such lines is available in realtion to the Cork Regional Hospital which is not as yet fully occupied.  Information in relation to a hospital which is only partially occupied would not reflect the situation which would obtain when the hospital as a whole is in full use.</P>

In the year 1978, 190 hip replacement operations were performed in the unit and 173 of the patients had been on the waiting list for a year or less.</P>
      <P>A second operating theatre at the orthopaedic unit will be completed this month and when it is opened the waiting period should be further reduced.</P>

I would ask him to ensure that people who are undergoing a rehabilitation course will get their allowance during holiday periods.

The fact that a special investigation <Col N="917" /> unit is operating in an area may have a very considerable deterrent effect and people may go off the register.

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will give the total <Col N="919" /> amount per week an employer will have to pay, from April next, in respect of an employee on the average national wage to cover social welfare, health and redundancy; and if he considers that this has the effect of taxing employment and therefore jeopardising job creation efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In June 1978, the latest date for which statistics are available, the average wage in the manufacturing and transportable goods industries was £72.48 a week.  On the basis of this figure the employer's share of the fully pay-related social insurance contribution from 6 April next will be £6.34 per week.</P>
      <P>This amount is in line with the total contribution for which an employer would be liable under the existing system from that date in respect of an employee on the average national wage after allowing for the normal increase in the stamp arising from this year's budget increases in the rates of social insurance payments.  The changeover to the new system of paying social insurance contributions could not therefore adversely affect employment or job creation efforts and in so far as it provides relief for labour intensive industries employing lower paid workers can be regarded as having the opposite effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>

Would he accept that the pay-related changes introduced will be beneficial to those who employ cheap labour but not to those why pay their employees well?  As this is a tax on <Col N="920" /> employment, would the Minister not at least look at alternative means of paying social insurance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of the position was that everyone connected with the situation had pressed for the adoption of this system for many a long year and we now have it in operation. There are many benefits arising from it, the principal one being that the lower paid worker and the industries employing them will pay less while those industries which are in a position to pay more will do so.</P>

      <P>This is a new matter and it is necessary to move it to provide for Sub-head E, the Pearse Commemoration Project, to enable initial payments to be made in connection with commemorative items which arise on this Vote, such as the making of a film, the commissioning of orchestral work and a one-man show on aspects of the life of Pearse.  This being a new service it has not been possible to have payments made in advance of the Estimate being passed.</P>
      <P>It may be necessary to make the initial payments in advance of the resumption of the Dáil after the Easter Recess.

      <P>We would like more details than the Taoiseach has given about the form the commemorations for Pádraig Pearse will take.  Will they run up to 10 November, which was his birthday, or will they take place during May, which was the time of his death?  We have no objection to passing the money and encouraging the Government to see that the commemoration is fitting for a man of his stature but we must protest about the way we are being asked to do it, in a hurry on the basis of a telephone call 24 hours before it came before the Dáil.</P>

We accept, on the basis of the information we had yesterday afternoon, that it will be necessary for some additional payments to be made to some people but we reserve our comments on the overall programme because we wish to see the precise nature of the programme, what other organisations may or may not get moneys and, in a general sense, we wish to reserve our position until we see the precise content of the programme.  With that in mind we agree to the token Estimate of £10 and look forward&mdash;-since this is the last week of the Dáil before we adjourn for Easter&mdash;as soon as we come back on 27 or 28 April to receiving the full Estimate for the remainder of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few points which occurred to me in consequence of the speed with which this matter was brought to the attention of the Opposition Whips.  The fact raises a doubt in my mind as to the procedure by which the work to which the Taoiseach referred is proposed to be done.  The Taoiseach mentioned in his short statement five minutes ago, if I heard correctly, the commissioning of a film and of orchestral work.  I would like to be assured, as I am sure will other <Col N="960" /> Deputies, that this will be a commissioning by a procedure which will not hereafter be open to any objections. Perhaps in the circumstances it is not appropriate to hold a full-scale competition at this stage in regard both to the film and orchestral work or works but many people outside the House and I and, I am sure, other Deputies, are of the opinion that a competition is the appropriate way to get a good result in regard to providing, for the use of the State or otherwise, a work of art whether a film or a piece of orchestral music.</P>
      <P>There are bad precedents in the history of the State for other procedures having been adopted.  In 1969 or thereabouts when the present Minister for Health was Minister for Finance he, it is not unfair to say, took it upon himself to decide what the design for the State's new coinage should be and almost gloried in the fact that he had been able to patronise a particular artist and commissioned her to design&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We want to ensure that if a film is to be commissioned it will be done by a procedure which is above board and which is appropriate to the artistic effort involved, if possible, by a competition. I accept that this may not be practicable because they left it so late, they did not think of it in time.  However, advice should be obtained from an independent outside body.  There is already such a statutory body with such a function.  I would like the Taoiseach to state here and now that the Arts Council will be formally, or have been, asked to perform their statutory function and give advice on how the film could be made, how the person to make it should be selected.  I am sure there are many film makers who would be glad of the honour of making it In regard to the orchestral work or works I hope they will advise on which composers are to be given a chance&mdash;if possible let them all be given a chance&mdash;and who has the job of deciding between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not have thought that was a contentious comment to make.  I did not come here with any intention of offending the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  It was only five minutes ago that I learned that this motion was on the agenda and I make my comments with the reserve that the Minister may be in the right and I may be in the wrong but if that is the case it is curious that when this very topic was debated in the Seanad in 1970&mdash;the first debate in which I took part following my election to that House&mdash;there was not a word uttered about a competition.  The burden of the case made by the Opposition then was that there had not been a competition in contra-distinction to what had happened in 1928 when an artistic committee presided over by W. B. Yeats advised <Col N="964" /> the State with painstaking care on the design of coinage.  But those were the days when standards were upheld in this State about those matters and about everything else and we want those standards maintained today also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of standards, the most important place for standards to be upheld is in this House.  I can say firmly and categorically that the design of coinage and currency notes is a matter for the Central Bank and I reject as completely unfounded any suggestion that the coinage on the last occasion was brought into being by way of an act of patronage or, to use Deputy Kelly's words &ldquo;friendly patronage&rdquo; on my part.  I had no function whatever in the selection of the artists who designed the coins.  If we are to have standards it is hardly legitimate for Deputy Kelly to stand up here <i>ex parte</i> and to launch this totally unfounded allegation against me.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the specific charge made by Deputy Kelly, there is no question of patronage in the allocation of the assignments under the different headings.  The following are some of the details: a film will be made and a number of Irish film producers have been invited to submit details of their treatment of such a film. The Arts Council to which the Deputy referred were invited to take part with Dr. Gerard Victory, Director of Music of RTE, with Professor Anthony Hughes, UCD, and Miss Dinah Mulloy of the Arts Council in advising on a composer for a major orchestral work for the smaller competitions, for example, compositions for a brass and reed band, for the new Irish Chamber Orchestra and for a suitable work for the Irish Ballet Company.  So far as the major orchestral work is concerned I do not <Col N="967" /> know whether it is the practice or whether it is feasible to commission a number of people to submit contributions but in this case the four people whom I regard as being well qualified for the purpose suggested that Mr. Seoirse Bodley be commissioned to write an orchestral work.  This is being done. There is a one-man show on aspects of Pearse's life and work.  It is intended to stage this in the autumn.  In addition, a commemorative stamp of a 10p denomination will be issued on 10 November this year by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The Office of Public Works have commissioned Mr. John Behan to execute a bronze bust of Pearse at St. Enda's.  I do not know how Mr. Behan was selected nor do I know what is his capacity in comparison with that of any other sculptor but obviously he is a man of high repute and worthy to undertake this commission.</P>
    <P>On the other side, the Department of Education are arranging for the reissuing of the educational writings of Pearse and for a new publication of his political writings.  These publications will be distributed to schools and colleges so I do not think there could be any patronage there.  A range of post-primary and post-graduate scholarships is being drawn up by the Department of Education, details of which will be announced later.  Also, an award for excellence in Irish at teacher-training college level is being organised and the Department have arranged also for a Pearse commemoration scholarship at post-graduate level to a foreign university.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education are making arrangements also for a training course through Irish for journalists.  That course will commence in September-October this year.  Full details of these proposals will be announced at a later stage.  In addition, the same Department are arranging for the commissioning for distribution to school libraries of an environment reference book to mark Pearse's interest in nature and in the landscape of Ireland.  So far as St. Enda's is concerned, the Office of Public Works are arranging to have ready for public viewing during the course of this <Col N="968" /> year as many rooms as possible.  Some items of furniture which had been removed are being restored for the purpose and other items which cannot be restored will be replaced by reproductions. The work involves in the main the restoration of An Halla Mór, the library and the oratory as well as some works in the basement.  Regarding Pearse's Cottage at Rosmuc, improved facilities are being provided and I understand that Galway County Council also are undertaking certain activities in relation to the cottage.</P>
    <P>That is the range so far of the activities and I do not think that anybody can take much exception to them.  On the contrary I should imagine that there would be public endorsement for them.</P>
    <P>As far as the haste of introduction of this Supplementary Estimate is concerned, as I indicated at the outset it is a new subhead, and we have been given legal advice that it is not possible to draw on the Estimate as a whole in advance of getting formal permission from the Dáil to draw on this new subhead.  It was only in the last few days that we learned that some modest payments were required and that it would not be possible to make these modest payments in advance of the Dáil approving of this token Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will recall that, when the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy introduced a motion in June last dealing with the guaranteeing by the State of loans for Avoca Mines Limited, he informed the House that the Government were in the process of reviewing the question of continuing State support for the mine.  As the Minister explained on that occasion, the State has over a long period of years put substantial public funds into the Avoca mine.  In more recent years, under the previous and present Governments, State support has taken the form of guarantees for bank borrowings to meet operating losses at the mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Government's review, the Minister commissioned a report from a firm of consultants with wide international experience in mining and the metals sector generally.  His decision to commission the report followed upon a study of the position earlier in 1978 carried out within his Department which suggested that, having regard to the outlook for copper prices at the time and the limited operational options open at Avoca, it was difficult to recommend a sound <Col N="970" /> basis for continued support.  However, this Departmental study did identify certain possibilities and these and, indeed all possible options for the mine, were very fully examined by the firm of consultants.</P>
    <P>The consultants' report, which was examined in detail in the Department and considered by the Government shortly before Christmas, concluded that, making certain assumptions about future copper prices and other critical factors, a mining programme mainly based on mining out known reserves underground over a period of about four years could be an acceptable option.  The report emphasised that this proposal could not be regarded as an acceptable venture in purely commercial terms. However, on the basis of the consultants' report and subject to the discharge by the State of Avoca debts of £3.15 million due to commercial banks and to Fóir Teoranta, thereby relieving the company of an estimated interest burden of £1.6 million over the period, the prospect emerged of a viable future operation which would generate sufficient profits to recover all, or at least a substantial proportion, of State funds amounting to £4.35 million which would have to be committed up to the end of 1979.</P>
    <P>The consultants' opinion that the project could not be regarded as a commercial venture confirmed experience over the previous year or more during which considerable efforts had been made, without success, to attract interest from private mining companies.  The consultants' estimates of the likely financial outcome over the period in question were based on projections on copper prices which, at the time their report was received in September 1978, appeared very optimistic.  Indeed these projections represented a favourable view of future price trends which was by no means shared by all the expert views in relevant technical and financial publications at that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister was, therefore, faced with the very difficult decision as to the recommendation which he should make to the Government.  The positive aspects of the scheme suggested were, of course, <Col N="971" /> the maintenance of the valuable employment being provided at the mine with the implications this has for the locality generally and the prospect of recovering a significant part of the funds which had already been committed by the State. Against this, the project could not be justified if a decision were based purely on commercial criteria.  Furthermore, even though there was the prospect of recovering most of the funds then subject to State guarantee and the additional funds now required, this amount, large though it was, constituted only part of the State funds which had been provided for the Avoca operation over a long period of time.  The operations envisaged by the consultants did not hold out any real prospect that the money advanced by the State in earlier years would be recovered.</P>
    <P>Finally, even if the apparently optimistic price projections were realised, there were other risk factors which could frustrate realisation of the modest financial objectives envisaged.  These additional risk factors included operating costs, the achievement of the projected ore tonnage and grades of ore, not to mention the normal on-going commercial risks involved in any operation and, particularly, in the mining business.</P>
    <P>However, having taken all the circumstances and projections into account and fully recognising the inherent risks, the Minister felt justified in recommending to the Government that the State should continue to support the mine for a further period at least.  The Government approved this but directed that the Minister should keep the matter under continuous review so that their decision could be reconsidered if there was a marked deterioration in any of the critical factors involved.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noticed, copper prices have improved very considerably since the consultants' report was received in September last.  A firm upward trend in the price was evident over the last few months of 1978.  Since then certain international developments affecting potential supply and demand have resulted in a sharp rise in prices so that the optimistic outlook on which the <Col N="972" /> projections of the consultants were based has, up to the present time at any rate, been justified.  We are, however, looking at the economic projections over a four- to five-year period ahead.  It is scarcely necessary for me to emphasise to the House how volatile the metals market is, particularly the market in copper.  There may be an appreciable element of speculation involved in the recent sharp price increase and certain of the international developments which have fired this speculation may prove to be short-term.  Nevertheless, certain factors behind the improvement in price are more firmly based so that, even discounting the speculative and temporary elements, the trend seems to be favourable.  However, as I have said, the copper market tends to be extremely volatile and it is clear that at any time price levels and the general trend in prices must be major considerations in the on-going review of the situation to which the Government's decision is subject.</P>
    <P>The additional support of the Avoca operation now envisaged involves clearance by the State of the company's existing borrowings of £2.85 million from the banks and £300,000 from Fóir Teoranta and the provision of certain additional support.  The funds for the clearance of these debts and for the provision of further support will be provided under the authority of the present supplementary estimate.  As I have said, the Government decision to continue support will be subject to continuous review.  I am not, therefore, in a position to give the House a precise and accurate statement of the additional funds, apart from those to which I have referred, which may be advanced out of the Vote.  Part of these additional funds will be devoted to the replacement of essential mining equipment, which will improve the economics of operations, and to cover possible contingencies during 1979.  The extent to which funds may be necessary for other purposes will, of course, depend on realised prices for copper concentrates and the other factors which I have mentioned.  The best estimate that can be made at this stage is that the total sum required to be provided from the Vote for the various <Col N="973" /> purposes which I have outlined will be £4.35 million.  The extent of actual advances from the Vote within this total sum will, of course, depend on the Government's view as to the prospects of achieving the objectives of the present programme.  Assuming that the improvement in copper prices is maintained and if there is no substantial deterioration in costs, tonnage mined and processed, ore gradings and so on, and taking account of the relief from bank interest liability which will result from clearance of the bank borrowings, funds additional to those which have been estimated should not be necessary and, in fact, a start on recovery of some of the indebtedness to the State should be possible.</P>
    <P>Agreement on the above arrangement has been reached with Avoca Mines Limited and the parent Canadian company, and appropriate legal documents are being drawn up.  This will provide for a charge in favour of the State on the assets of the company and also that any surplus revenues arising within the company over the period in question will be exclusively devoted to repaying the indebtedness to the State.  Provision is also being made for certain essential controls by the State on expenditure and mining programmes and for involvement by the State in other critical decision areas.  The proposal to make funds directly available from the Department's Vote for the maintenance of the mine constitutes a new service for which approval of the House is required.  Since it is necessary to implement these arrangements without delay, it is not possible to defer the matter until the general Vote for the Department comes up in the normal course.  This is the reason why the matter is being dealt with by way of a Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>In view of the pressure on public funds in the current year, it is necessary to ensure that every effort be made to effect savings which will offset, to some extent at least, the additional funds now sought.  It is expected to be possible to defer certain projects for which a net provision of £478,000 was made in the main Estimate and to use that sum instead towards the support operations at the Avoca mine.  For that reason, the <Col N="974" /> present Supplementary Estimate provides for a net sum of £3.872 million which, together with the savings of £478,000 from the existing Estimate, will enable the Minister to make funds totalling £4.35 million available during 1979 to support operations at the mine. This is a substantial sum of money but to be set against it there is the point that, if the mine were to close now, the State would have to honour its guarantees to the banks and there would be the socioeconomic costs associated with the closure of the mining operation and the loss of employment.</P>
    <P>I would like to emphasise again that the situation of the mine will be subject to continuing review because this is a critical part of the Government's decision. The present decision by the Government is not open-ended.  It is not an unqualified assurance of support for the full four-to five-year term envisaged in the programme outlined by the consultants. It is a decision to continue support for the time being and to keep the situation under review.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the State guarantee motion in the House in June last, he said that the State could not justify maintenance of support for continuing heavy losses at the mine.  He indicated that support, if forthcoming, would have to be contingent upon there being the possibility of a viable operation. I am sure the House will agree that the Minister has not been particularly stringent in defining the terms and objectives of the kind of operation which we are prepared to support.  But the objectives, modest though they are, must be achieved if continuing support is to be justified.  The Minister is confident that the management, the work force, contractors and others involved in Avoca will, as they have in the past, recognise that this is a knife-edge situation and that they will play their full part in giving the venture a reasonable chance of success. Neither the Government nor anyone involved at the mine can do anything about copper prices which are such a crucial factor.  But, of course, we are not concerned simply with copper prices in isolation but with the margin between the overall cost of producing a <Col N="975" /> ton of copper at the mine and the price realised for it.  If this margin can be kept in the black, our limited objectives can be achieved and the valuable employment and other economic benefits in this area, with its long tradition of copper mining, can be preserved for a further period.</P>
    <P>I believe the House will agree that the proposals and conditions for continuing State support for the Avoca mine which I have outlined are reasonable and justify provision of the funds proposed under this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>This party will not object to the Supplementary Estimate.  The objective has been shared by all Governments. The Minister pointed out that the last Government also put money into the Avoca mine in the hope of keeping it on its feet.  It has been dealt with here in the form of a motion and in the form of parliamentary questions.  The Minister has made no secret of the fact that there is a large question mark hanging over the future of the mine and it is not likely to go away.</P>
      <P>I cannot resist the temptation to remind the Minister and the House that this is the very area, namely the exploitation of our mining resources, in which the Minister's party told the people in the months coming up to the last general election that there were tens of thousands of secure jobs only waiting to be created.  All they had to do was put the Minister's party into office and out of the air would jump tens of thousands of secure jobs in the field of the exploitation of natural resources, particularly in the context of mining resources.  The implication lurking not too far beneath the surface of that statement was that nothing but the incompetence and the malice of the National Coalition Government prevented those jobs from being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years have now passed and what do we find?  The Bula mine is not yet in operation and the Tara mine is staggering under the most severe difficulties.  I am not saying that the Government are to blame for either of these matters, but it puts the vainglorious and crazy nature <Col N="976" /> of their election propaganda into perspective.  The Avoca mine, which is much older than the mines at Navan, must be helped out yet again, possibly to the tune of £4,385,000.  Is this to provide tens of thousands of secure jobs?  No; it is to preserve temporarily 230 jobs and there is no promise of security or permanence. It is a matter for themselves. The Minister's speech was not contentious and I do not find fault with it but I regard the concluding words, which no doubt the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy would have delivered himself if he had been here, as being the first shots in a campaign to lay the blame for the eventual closure of the Avoca mine&mdash;if it ever does close&mdash;on the people who work there, manage the place and do business with the mining operation.  It is an attempt to lay the blame on anybody and everybody except the Government.  In no other field&mdash;even the field of ground rents, national joke though that has become&mdash;has the potential of the Minister's party measured up so ludicrously badly with their performance than in the field of the development of our national resources, particularly our mining resources.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to offend or annoy Deputy Hussey, who is only standing in, but I am not sure how it is that in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy, which has three office holders as distinct from the one and a half which Senator Keating had when he was Minister, the three of them are on the wing somewhere.  Where is the Minister? Where is Deputy Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn and where is Deputy Ray Burke? How is it that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture has to be in here to deal with this subject?  Can it be that the public interest requires that three office holders from the Department should be unable to attend the business of the House?  I invite Deputy Hussey, who is standing in and who is a fair-minded man, to ponder in his heart the contrast between the tricoloured piece of literature he brandished around the country this time two years ago and the empty, vainglorious words it contained in regard to mining and natural resources, with the present situation in <Col N="977" /> regard to one of our best known and oldest mining operations.  Nearly £4.5 million is being spent merely to allow 230 jobs to carry on for a period into an indefinite but possibly not very distant future.  In relation to the <i>per capita</i> cost of industrial jobs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We must stick strictly to the Avoca mine.  If the Deputy can relate this to the Avoca mine, it is all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will relate this to the fact that, if the money represented in this Vote is divided by the number of jobs involved, it works out at about £20,000 per job.  One of the daily papers recently gave great prominence to a story to the effect that the IDA job creation programme had worked out in such a way that the jobs they created were costing, not the modest £4,000 or thereabouts which was targeted as being a reasonable <i>per capita</i> job cost, but more like £25,000 per job.  The paper pointed to the IDA for ripping the people off to that extent.  I was contacted to comment on this and I refused because I thought it an unfair observation on the IDA.  A sum of £25,000 per job is not totally excessive.  After all, it represents only a few years' gross salary for a wellestablished industrial worker.  It is not an excessive investment by the State, provided the employment is a firm job protected against any foreseeable accident. This is not such a situation.  We have been asked to vote something like £20,000 per job to protect 230 jobs for a limited period.  I recognise that if we do not vote this money the State will become liable for that amount anyway because of its already having underwritten the Avoca borrowings during the lifetime of the Government I worked for. I still ask the House to measure the kind of money we are talking about against the number of jobs involved, apart from the money which the State has injected into the Avoca operations in different connections.  All sides of the House are so desperate to create and maintain employment that the ceiling has been taken off any kind of reasonable figure in regard to a sum per job created.  While I do not complain about that, because <Col N="978" /> £20,000 or £25,000 does not seem to be an excessive sum to provide a job for a lifetime, it is, however, an awful lot of money to provide a job for only a few years.</P>
      <P>I have a suggestion which the House may or may not think is very sensible. The copper mine at Avoca is, to the best of my knowledge, the only copper resource in the EEC, although of a very low grade.  If I am right about that, that gives it a value and a dimension over and above its local importance.  I realise that the extent of the resources in the mine are not all that enormous and that, if the mine were worked flat out by open cast methods, it would be exhausted in a very few years.  Nonetheless, the fact that it is the only copper mine in the European Community might make it possible to pass some of the financial burden of keeping this mine going on to the Community.</P>
      <P>The resource which the mine represents, small though it is, is apparently the only resource in the Community. Admittedly, if Spain becomes a European Community member that will revolutionise the situation in regard to indigenous copper resources in the Community, because Spain has a great deal of copper.  Until that happens the unique status of the Avoca mine seems to suggest that the Community might look upon the mine as being a resource which might have a value out of proportion to its size and out of proportion to the present apparent commercial value of the resource buried in the ground.  For all I know, it might be a more reasonable use of resources if the operation were discontinued and left until the market improves, not in the immediate future but when a real copper emergency arose in which the Community had genuine difficulties in solving within its frontiers.  In that event the livelihood and the future of the 230 men working there would be a major charge and obligation on us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that context I wonder whether the Minister and the Department have explored the possibility of the Community taking up the burden of this mine and making an assessment of the sensible thing to do with it from the resource management point of view.  The Community <Col N="979" /> might make funds available, if they have an appropriate basket of money from which such funds can be drawn, to supply an alternative livelihood for the men who would find themselves redundant.  I am the first to see that this suggestion is very general and vague.  This suggestion presented itself only because the mine has a certain unique quality in the Community and I would like to know that the Department have explored the possibility of driving that point home to the Commission to see if some help could be given to reduce the weight of the burden which this House is now being asked to carry through this Vote.</P>
    <P>Apart from that this party have no objection to continuing the help to the operation.  We are glad that it will be kept under continuing scrutiny and we hope that the optimistic projections the Minister referred to will turn out to be justified.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to provide these moneys.  They will go a very long way towards maintaining the operations of the Avoca Mines for at least the next two or three years.  I am being careful to omit any reference to maintaining the viability of the mine because it depends so much on the international price of copper concentrates.  As the Minister rightly said, that is an open question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the very fortunate coincidence of the availability of the consultants' report commissioned by the Minister and the simultaneous rise in the price of copper concentrates on the world market.  If we had not had the current experience of a very substantial increase in world copper concentrates prices as of now, the viability of what is proposed might be brought into question. However, the coincidence is there, and it is very much to be welcomed.  It is a matter of profound relief to the 200 employees and the management staff of the mine that for some considerable time at least the general operations of the mine can continue.  We should not underestimate the capital contribution, what one might even call the write-off <Col N="980" /> contribution, which is now being made by the State.  It works out at anything up to £22,000 per employee being pumped into the company in the context of writing off debts and providing the essential funds for future working.</P>
    <P>Perhaps no mine in the history of the State has received greater attention from the public servants responsible in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy.  No mine in the history of the State has received more attention from a long succession of individual Ministers.  I recall having long discussions with the previous Minister, then Deputy Keating, and trade unions and management staff, when the mine faced a crisis during the period of the previous administration. There is no absolute assurance that it could not face another crisis in the period of office of this administration over the next two-and-a-half years.  All of the Ministers and the senior staff of the Department have bent over backwards down through the years to help this mine to maintain its general working operations and its employment continuity.  Deputy C. Murphy, Deputy Kavanagh, Deputy Timmons and I often met the workers concerned and had long and intensive discussions with the management staff concerned.</P>
    <P>On the basis of current high levels of concentrate prices, it may well be that in recent months the mine had some operational surpluses.  This is to be welcomed.  I would hope that surplus position would continue for the remainder of the year and that the mine might have some additional working reserve, and that the Department might not be too harsh in insisting on immediate repayment of operational surpluses to offset the State injection of funds.  I gather things have been going quite well particularly in the past two or three months, and that is to be welcomed.  It depends very much on world price levels in the copper market. The general development is good and the prospects for the remainder of this year seem likely to be solid from reading the financial press and trying to assess the markets.</P>
    <P>I should like to express some concern about the manner in which the assistance <Col N="981" /> is being given.  The Minister said it is expected to be possible to defer certain projects for which a net provision of almost £500,000 was made in the main Estimate.  It is not inappropriate to ask what they were.  If I were a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I would be asking that question.  Money is going from the main Estimate to support the operations of a mine which has had a long history of financial problems, and inevitably that question will come up. The Minister may also wish to elaborate on that.  Admittedly the £478,000 goes towards the general total of £4.35 million to support the operations of the mine.  It must have posed some considerable difficulty for the Department to build up a package of this nature from the main Estimate and the Supplementary Estimate.  As the Minister said, we have the new precedent of making funds available directly from the Vote.</P>
    <P>I remember the current incumbent nearly having a seizure when the former Minister, Deputy Keating, brought in anything unusual.  Perhaps it is poetic justice to say to him now that he is not above adopting an unconventional approach when it comes to funding certain operations.  I do not necessarily disapprove of that, but he would have had an apoplectic seizure two or three years ago if the former Minister had introduced a proposition of this nature and we would have had a rare display of Limerick selfrighteous indignation at a proposition such as that which was put to us so calmly here today by the Minister of State, Deputy Hussey.  It is no harm to point that out to the present Minister, and perhaps he will appreciate some of the problems with which his predecessor had to cope in assisting industry and particularly a difficult industry such as this.  I make the point in the context of the procedure for making these funds available.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would make one point about the consultants' report.  It may be possible to make it available&mdash;indeed it may have to be made available ultimately&mdash;to, say, the Committee of Public Accounts when they do their prolonged examination in three or four years' time.  There is not a great deal <Col N="982" /> about Avoca Mines that is not generally known anyway.  One would not need to be a mining financial expert to be able to read between the lines of the published data relative to this company.  They have had so many consultants and so many examinations that the data available has had the most exhaustive examination in the world, bearing in mind their relatively small size and the history down the years.</P>
    <P>In the national interest, if we are voting £4.35 million&mdash;admittedly a lot of it retrospectively in write-off&mdash;it is arguable that the consultants' report should be made available subject to the normal commercial criteria relating to aspects of confidentiality.  There is no reason why that report should not be made available in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I put that to the Minister because he too waxed eloquent as to why consultants' reports should not be made available, so he might as well be fed with the spoon with which he belted the former Deputy Keating over the head in relation to aspects of Votes of this nature.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to provide this financial assistance. The trade union of which I am a member are also pleased that the Minister and the Government have seen fit to provide this money.  The management are not only relieved but pleased that this has been possible.  Should international prices maintain their current high levels, I hope that the State will proceed to recoup some of the funds invested in this venture.  The State funds invested over the years have been very considerable relative to the size of the operation and in that sense we are entitled to a substantial return should the mine now proceed to give us at least a year or two years' monthly surplus on operation of accounts. These are my comments.  The Labour Party welcome the decision of the Government in this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to delay the House very long on this matter.  I recollect speaking on a motion that the Minister introduced last June when he was very pessimistic about the future of the mine.  Prospects were grim <Col N="983" /> at that time and the outlook was bleak for the workforce and also for management. I expressed my hope then that the feasibility study which the Minister was commissioning would produce sufficient optimism to enable him to bring in legislation such as we have at the moment which, in effect, is voting £4.35 million to Avoca Mines Limited.</P>
      <P>Naturally, I am pleased that the job situation there will be continued.  That is vital to that area, and I am very satisfied in the circumstances that an exceptional arrangement has been made between Avoca Mines Limited, the parent Canadian company and the Minister.  I have confidence that that trio and the workforce there will be able to implement the various factors of the agreement. I know that the mine is marginal at the best of times and this is a huge amount of money, but I hope that this agreement will generate sufficient profit to enable the State to recover a substantial portion of the funds which will be voted here today.</P>
      <P>The price of copper fluctuates greatly. The grim prospect has departed for the moment, but everybody in the area is aware that the matter must be kept under review, and it is being kept under review.  I welcome that and I am pleased that there is a note of optimism now in that area, an optimism which I thought was beginning to disappear and perhaps had been nearly quenched last June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly reiterated a point which I mentioned last June and I reiterate it now.  The Minister is only to aware that this is the only copper mine in the EEC. The Minister, when he replied to the debate last June, mentioned that he had gone into all aspects in discussions with the EEC and the various authorities over there to see what funds could be made available for the mine.  Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister is continuing to press upon them that this resource that we have is the only copper mine in the EEC.  It is marginal, and continuous difficulties will arise between the margin of profit available, between the cost of securing a ton of ore and the price realised for it.  Nevertheless, it is very satisfactory to come in here and congratulate <Col N="984" /> the Minister on having the courage to deal with this matter in a very humane way.  I know the difficulty of finding alternative employment in this field in that area.  Mining in general can be extremely hard and it is marginal. This mine is particularly marginal because of the low grade of copper.  Certain happenings in world market trends have enabled the Minister to take this step.  I wish well to all involved in this programme and say &ldquo;comhghairdeas&rdquo; to all involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>When it comes to finding employment for people or keeping them in employment, this House would always be concerned to support any effort that would have such effect.  It takes an extreme effort to keep in excess of 200 people in employment for as long as is possible.  We are talking about a very substantial sum of money and are taking a very great risk.  Everything that is said in that part of the consultants' report that we have seen and everything contained in the Minister's statement indicate that the Minister is telling the House that we want to spend this money but we see no future in so doing.  That is what is conveyed to me in the Minister's message today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy B. Desmond appealed to have the consultants' report made available to the House.  In what the Minister had to say we got very little from the consultants' report except in relation to prices and their effect on the viability of the mine.  It does not say anything at all about an estimate of possible quantities or how long they are likely to last.  We know that the quality is low grade, but the information contained in the report is all in relation to viability depending on price in the future.  There is some mention of the known quantities of copper and that there should be a concentration on getting those known quantities out in the next four years.  It is very difficult to see anything in that report or the Minister's statement to give us confidence that the mine will continue for the next four years.  It is obvious from what Deputy C. Murphy has said that the Minister has tried to obtain EEC support for mining copper in Avoca and that so far he has failed.  I assume he <Col N="985" /> would not have failed had he been able to produce sufficient evidence that there was a prospect of getting anything worthwhile from that mine.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand the thinking in the Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy when they recommend to this House that a very substantial amount of money should be invested in what is regarded as a lost cause, while at the same time our tanneries and timber processing industry&mdash; the chipboard factories&mdash;are allowed to close down.  That seems to me to be quite inconsistent.  We know we have the raw materials in those two cases.  We know that these industries can and should be kept going.  Yet we do not support them and make such a decision.  In this case the Minister cannot hold out any prospect of viability over any worthwhile period in the future.  What both the Minister and the IDA should be doing is endeavouring to find alternative secure employment in this area.  It is obvious from what the consultants have told the Minister and from all that is known about the mine and mining generally that the prospects in this case are very poor indeed.  It is difficult to understand why some industries are abandoned when their prospects are good when, in the case of an industry looking rather hopeless, we continue to give substantial support.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Government have not made this decision without looking very seriously at the consequences.  The first serious thing to happen will be that something in excess of 220 or 230 people will lose their employment if the mine closes down.  However, the Government must see a vague prospect of keeping these men in employment and of the mine remaining viable for a few years ahead.  I know they would not come in here irresponsibly and say &ldquo;Look, we have got to spend this even though we see little or no prospects&rdquo; and in other cases allow industries to close down.</P>
    <P>We have received the minimum of information. I do not know what information is available to the Government. Perhaps they have something more to encourage them than what is contained in this statement.  Certainly, there is very <Col N="986" /> little there making for the sort of confidence one would like to see in the future of the operation.  I should like to support any prospect of maintaining employment there.  If it does nothing more than keep people in employment, without making profits over and above to compensate either the Government or the concern involved, it will have achieved a satisfactory goal.</P>
    <P>It would appear from the difficulties encountered in getting people to undertake this mining operation that all the experts, from whatever part of the world they may come, do not see very great prospects.  I discern a feeling on the part of the Government that the future is bleak.  Now is the time for the Government to be concerned about finding alternative employment opportunities for the people at present engaged there, if and when this mine has to be closed down.  From what is said in that report, it appears that that day is not too far ahead.  That is where efforts should be concentrated from now on.  The decision has been made to spend this very substantial amount of money.  Obviously, it is gaining the support of people in this House and I shall lend my support also. But it places on the Government an obligation to look seriously at the future, to try and find a means of employing these people if and when the mine closes down, because that is what is envisaged in everything I have read.</P>

      <P>In answer to Deputy Kelly's criticism of the absence of the Minister and of his two Ministers of State, I should say that both Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Burke are out of the country on business at present and that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is suffering from laryngitis. Therefore I am sure Deputy Kelly will accept that it is not possible for particular Ministers to be present at all times when business of this type is being moved in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is in London on an industrial promotions trip and Deputy Burke is in Brussels for the multilateral trade negotiations.  I shall merely answer some points made by Deputies, because I am sure they will accept that this is not my brief and that I am merely standing in for my colleagues.</P>
      <P>First of all, Deputy Kelly is correct when he says that Avoca is the only copper mine in the EEC.  We have pressed and will continue to press the EEC for any help or support we can get in the operation of that mine.  I do not know whether or not that is possible, but certainly we shall continue to press that matter.  During the past two years metal prices dropped very sharply and recovery has materialised only in very recent months.  For instance, early in 1977 zinc was priced at 800 dollars per ton.  Only recently did it come back to that level, having dropped to almost 600 dollars per ton.  When one takes account of inflation in real terms that means that the current price is less than it was two years ago.  Apart from the copper price factor, the low copper grade of .7 per cent being mined at Avoca is the biggest single factor militating against profitable operations there.  In the climate which has prevailed over the last two years, expansion of the mining industry was not possible.  Indeed, we are fortunate that Irish mines were able to keep in operation. Prospecting by mining companies has continued at a high level over these difficult years and there are indications of a general improvement in the mining scene internationally.  Therefore the Government are hopeful that the Irish mining industry may now be over the worst and that we can look forward to a situation in which the operations and conditions of the existing mines will ease, with some expansion being possible in some areas of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Kelly to the Minister's request that every effort be made by all those involved to ensure that this mine be kept viable.  The Minister has indicated already that, if forthcoming, support for this mine would have to be conditional on there being the possibility of a viable operation. <Col N="988" /> This is reasonable.  It should be the responsibility of all the agencies involved, the workers, unions, management and the Government to ensure that they are working towards making this operation viable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton mentioned the prospects of viability in the future.  The programme outlined in the consultants' report is based on known ore reserves, that is that there is a reasonable certainly as to the tonnage and grading of ore available over the next four years. There are further reserves in the Avoca Mine area but they are largely in the unproven or possible categories.  Estimates about such reserves are based mainly on geological inference and considerable exploration and development work would be required before the extent of additional tonnage of ore and the trading of such ore could be established with an acceptable degree of confidence.  At this stage I would not rule out the possibility that funds may be available at some stage for the exploration and development work necessary but that does not form part of the plans at this time.  It is far too early to say whether the trend in copper prices when set against the general economics of production at Avoca will turn out to be favourable enough to realise even the limited objectives of the current plan.  As far as the future plans are concerned we have to wait to see how things go.  We will have to try to keep our options open and monitor the progress at the mines which we hope will advance as a result of this injection of capital.</P>

It is incongruous that one should go in in Irish. When the NIHE Bills come before the House the Irish name for the National Institute for Higher Education in Dublin and in Limerick will, no doubt, be in those Bills.  The Minister should accept that and put in the NIHE title in Irish also.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1) (f), line 29, after &ldquo;institution&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of higher education&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="991" /> I merely want to specify that the colleges and institutions, to which we are referring, are colleges of higher education and that this Bill should be confined to colleges of higher education.  It should be specified that that is what we are doing under this Bill.  The interpretation may be loose at the moment.  Under section 20, to which paragraph (f) refers, the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; appears.  Obviously we can have a school of higher education as well.  My amendment seeks to insert after &ldquo;institution&rdquo; the words &ldquo;of higher education&rdquo; so that it is quite clear that we are confining this Bill to the higher education section.  I consider that &ldquo;any institution&rdquo; should have been coupled with &ldquo;college&rdquo;.  My amendment seeks clarification of the type of institution we are referring to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the spirit of Deputy Collins's amendment but I have some difficulty with its substance. It seems to me that a middle line has to be drawn between the situation in which we are giving National Council for Education Awards a <i>carte blanche</i> permission to organise everything and anything in education that they choose to organise or, on the other hand, restricting them so much that they are unable to intervene in areas in which they might genuinely have an interest in intervening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not strike me as impossible that at a certain stage in their development the NCEA might award qualifications for students who are students at second level institutions.  We have been complaining for long enough inside and outside the House about the way in which the leaving certificate, which was originally a general examination designed to assess the degree of success with which a student had completed a second-level course of education, has been turned into the handmaiden of the university system.  We should be, if anything, importing more flexibility into the award system at second as well as at third level if we are to avoid the intense pressure which builds up within the second level educational system to make it conform to one sector of third level <Col N="992" /> education rather than to the real needs of the student.  While I sympathise with Deputy Collins's desire for clarification, the amendment as drafted would present me with certain difficulties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that it is necessary to define the council further or the institutions by putting in the words &ldquo;of higher education&rdquo;.  In the Bill the Minister is given discretion with regard to the institutions which he can nominate under section 20.  The whole idea behind the council was to use them as a vehicle for the promotion of technological education and commercial education.  I do not believe there is any need to be more specific than the actual words of this section are.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Horgan was a good one.  I also decry the developing situation where the universities on a points system have undue influence on the terminal examination for secondary or post-primary education but that should be dealt with otherwise than by using such a council as the NCEA to remedy emphases, biases or exaggerations which are developing.  I have outlined to the House on another occasion my intention in that regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins is concerned with it being clear that it is higher education that is involved.  Deputy Horgan expresses his dissatisfaction with what is happening at the terminal stage of the post-primary examinations but he is not keen on the council having a function in the matter.  I agree with him in relation to that.  I believe that it can be remedied and it is not beyond the resources of the Department of Education to do that. That Minister is given in the Bill full power with regard to the designation of the institutions.  As its purpose is the promotion of technological education, commercial education and so forth, I do not consider that there is any need to worry about its misuse and its being fathered on institutions that would in some way work against the purpose of the council and this Bill.</P>

      <P>We are agreed about one thing.  The present university bias in the terminal examination at second level <Col N="993" /> has the total disagreement of the spokesmen here.  I do not believe it is the intention of the NCEA to go into the question of the leaving certificate or the examination at the terminal position in second level education.  If the Minister intends to allow the NCEA to give some awards in respect of examinations at the end of second level I would like him to say so.</P>

I fully appreciate that the Minister or any Minister is not out to abuse the system.  I put down the amendment to make it crystal clear that the NCEA are confined to involvement in education after school life.  In view of what the Minister has said I withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I am not too happy about the concept in amendment No. 36 in the context of this definition amendment <Col N="994" /> here.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I think I see what the Minister is at, I do not know if it goes far enough.  We are in somewhat of a difficulty here in that we are discussing a definition that relates to a later section in which there are other problems and on which we shall be putting down amendments when the time comes.  The Minister's amendment extends, I presume for the purpose of avoiding ambiguity, the definition of staff to include professional teaching and professional administrative staff.  The main difficulty with one aspect of section 5 relates more to the exclusion of management and specifically to regional technical colleges in subsection (2).  I suppose we can leave that argument until we get to it.  So far as the Minister's amendment is for the purpose of clarification it does not seem to me to present any major difficulty.</P>

      <P>There is one fundamental omission that we need to thrash out in order to get some indication of the Minister's mind on an important issue relating to the development of technological education, namely, the omission of any reference to the Dublin vocational education colleges that are carrying out third-level work at present. If it is the case, as the Minister has assured us, that it is his intention that all non-university qualifications should effectively be validated by the NCEA, what will happen henceforth to the students of the Dublin VEC colleges who are at the moment grouped within an organisation and institution known as the Dublin Institute of Technology? What is the Minister's attitude to this institution? Does he accept that it exists in a valid way?  Will he propose at a later stage to designate it under the Bill when <Col N="995" /> it becomes an Act?  What will happen in the interim to the students who are currently receiving qualifications from these institutions?  Will they continue to be NCEA-validated qualifications even though the institutions at which they are studying have not been designated under this section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position with regard to the Dublin Institute of Technology has not been clarified in the Bill and that is most unfortunate.  The Minister had the opportunity of designating the institutions as regional technical colleges or making special reference to them under section 1 but he has failed to do so.  He has also failed to resolve the position in relation to awards.  He has not told us what is the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the NCEA.  We are entitled to an explanation of the Minister's intentions in this matter.  I ask him to make a statement clarifying the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the powers conferred in section 20 which enable the Minister at any time to designate an institution, so that the institutions named, either specifically or generally, between (a) and (d) of section 1 are not exclusive of others.  The regional technical colleges are done generally and under (f) there is reference to any institution specified in an order made under section 20.  Deputy Collins stated that the Dublin colleges could have been designated as RTCs.  I wonder if the Deputy knows if the City of Dublin VEC desire RTC status.  I am not aware that they do.  There are powers and facilities under this Bill for the colleges to apply for validation of courses if they so wish.  Needless to say, the NCEA are in a position to assess and make awards in those colleges. Related to this, there is also the NIHE, Dublin, which is mentioned and which will have its awards made by the NCEA.</P>

I do not have to be aware of that when discussing a Bill <Col N="996" /> dealing with general education.  I am aware of the difficulty arising between the Minister and the City of Dublin VEC with regard to the transfer of third level courses to NIHE, Dublin.  The position has not been resolved; indeed, it has been exacerbated by recent statements. Leaving those matters aside, I am entitled to pose the question what will happen to the colleges in Dublin.  In this Bill the Minister has not taken the opportunity to clarify the position.  It is an important aspect in relation to the greater Dublin area.</P>

      <P>We have an extraordinary situation here in that in this Bill we are designating the National Institute for Higher Education, Dublin, which to the best of my knowledge has not got a single student to its name, and we are not talking at all about the VEC colleges that have a huge number of students at third level, some of whose qualifications are apparently being validated by the NCEA and some of which are not being validated.  It is all very well for the Minister to refer us to section 20 and his power to designate the institutions, either severally or individually, at any time in the future if he so chooses.  But this is not a mere administrative convenience. What we are talking about here is a matter that is fundamental and germane to the whole development of techological education in the country, and more especially in the capital.  I do not think it is good enough that the Minister should keep us totally in the dark as regards his intentions in relation to these colleges and their courses as presently constituted.</P>
      <P>In reply to questions at Question Time some time ago, the Minister gave it as his intention that all third level courses which are currently being conducted in the Dublin VEC colleges would eventually be validated by the NCEA.  Could he explain what this means in terms of designation of these colleges?  What does it mean for the future of the Dublin Institute of Technology?</P>

      <P>Deputy E. Collins said there was some difference between me and the Dublin city colleges.  There is no such difference.  The purpose of this Bill is to provide an assessing and award making council in the third level non-university section.  The ulterior purpose is to promote technological and allied education and the Dublin city colleges are involved in that task.  There is not, and there cannot be, any conflict between the activities of NIHE Dublin and the work of the Dublin colleges because they are working to the same purpose, for the same objective.  They are trying to provide places for students because there is very heavy pressure for places, which are far too few.  Consequently, I refute the suggestion that there can be any conflict of interest seeing there is such a high demand.  This Bill, with the council, NIHE Dublin, the new institution, and the colleges of the City of Dublin are working for the advancement of technological education.</P>

When I referred, purely from memory, to something I understood the Minister to have said in reply to a supplementary question at Question Time, the Minister asked for the source and I was not able to provide it.  But that is a fact and we want to know the Minister's intention on the matter.  Is it his intention, as I originally understood it to have been, that the NCEA will validate the greater part of third level awards currently being awarded by the Dublin VEC colleges?

      <P>Clarification of that has been a useful exercise.  I had a problem during the Second Stage debate and perhaps the Minister has thought about it since.  I have not framed a specific amendment.  It is a question of the NCEA being given power to designate individual courses in institutions which have not been designated by the Minister under the Act.  I raised the question of the Ecumenical College at Milltown which has had one of its courses validated by the NCEA but which presumably considers it would be unwise to apply for total recognition.  Has the Minister addressed himself to this question?</P>

      <P>In regard to No. 6, I am advised by the draftsman that the wording used is standard, that it is often to be seen in the Statute Book.  The word &ldquo;acquire&rdquo; carries the meaning of acquiring an interest in, a leasing interest or a renting interest.  Consequently an amendment is unnecessary because the word &ldquo;hold&rdquo; in amendment No. 7 would cover the point.  The subsection would then provide power to acquire, hold and dispose of land, and that would make assurance doubly sure in regard to the word that is worrying Deputy Collins.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 8 seeks to deal with a problem in a section like this in Bills like this in the matter of the specific powers and provisions enumerated at a certain level, and one could argue that in this section we <Col N="1003" /> should include everything the NCEA may address themselves to at any stage in the distant future.  One could also argue that the simplest thing to do is to insert a portmanteau provision saying the council may interest itself and facilitate, promote, co-ordinate and develop anything it likes.  This section as originally drafted is a compromise between those two positions.</P>
      <P>The amendments we are discussing are related to the argument we had on Second Stage and, in particular, to the position of the National College of Art and Design.  Amendment No. 8 relates to the need to make specific provisions for art and design.  Amendment No. 10 substitutes the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;.  We do not need to have a long argument about this.  I am not prepared to press the point if the Minister, when he replies, will advert to it and give an indication of his reasons for preferring the original wording.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of art and design I am glad that the Minister has met the spirit and the letter of the criticisms made of the Bill on Second Stage by advancing his own amendment in relation to this specific area of the council's activities.  I will have no problem in withdrawing my amendment No. 8 in favour of the Minister's amendment No. 11.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In putting down amendments Nos. 9 and 25 I felt that the subsection needed to be more comprehensive. I do not like the word &ldquo;commerce&rdquo;. It is out of date in its own context and I am advised that modern usage would be something along the lines of &ldquo;commercial education&rdquo; and &ldquo;business and management studies&rdquo;.  The question of philosophical studies was raised by Deputy Horgan.  In regard to agriculture and fisheries this is an area in which the council would be interested and I would like it to be specified that they have a function in this field lest some other body might try to use their muscle to keep them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of catering covers such areas as Cathal Brugha Street and so on but it should also be specified.  Legal <Col N="1004" /> studies is an interesting area in which the NCEA could have an important part to play in coming years.  Public administration is a course which is provided and yet it is not specified.  I have included art and design in line with what I said on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Complementary studies&rdquo; is a more up to date rendering of the words &ldquo;liberal education&rdquo;.  I included an important item which relates to apprenticeship courses.  I will deal with this question in view of the fact that my amendment No. 29 has been ruled out of order.  Obviously the Ceann Comhairle has his reasons for doing so; it may have involved potential charges on revenue.  That is fully understandable and I have no quibble with it.  There is a need for a recognition of apprenticeship courses in Ireland. The London City of Guilds which has been a traditional supplier of awards in technology is being phased out of the Irish scene.  There is a need for a national awards system for apprentices. There is no reason why we should have to call on anybody outside the State to grant awards to apprentices when the NCEA are being set up on a statutory basis.  The making of such awards would fall to them as part of their activities.</P>
    <P>My observations on this matter are allied to my concern and reservations in relation to the AnCO apprenticeship courses which are currently in force.  The courses provided do not meet the educational needs of young people.  They may have direct relevance to the needs of employers.  That must be kept in mind but there is serious need to protect the educational needs of apprentices.  The courses directed by AnCO are not satisfactory from an educational point of view.  The NCEA are an ideal vehicle through which to ensure the educational content of such courses.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider specifying apprenticeship courses.  He could bring in his own amendment.  I would have no quibble with that.  I am asking him to say now: &ldquo;Yes, the NCEA are the vehicle to make awards to plumbers, bricklayers and so on, on completion of their courses&rdquo;.  Why should they not have certificates?  The certificates should be such as to be applicable <Col N="1005" /> both nationally and internationally as is intended in the Bill.  We should not be dependant on foreign bodies to award certificates and diplomas.  We have our own statutory body to do so.  It is a serious matter and I would like the Minister to make a statement on it in a positive way.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 9 &ldquo;.... and shall promote and encourage the availability of recurrent education&rdquo;, I am suggesting that the NCEA would have an interest in the question of recurrent education until such time as we have a Bill which would establish a council for adult education which would take over this function.  I put down this amendment as a holding amendment.</P>
    <P>In relation to amendment No. 25, I am deleting on page 4, lines 18 and 19, the words &ldquo;relating to technical, industrial, scientific, technological or commercial education&rdquo;.  I do not see why they should be specified.  It would be much cleaner if it read &ldquo;for the furtherance of higher education outside the universities&rdquo;.  It makes the functions of the council open-ended rather than getting involved in specifying certain areas.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister has decided to include in his amendment the words &ldquo;and education in art or design&rdquo;. This is a reaction to a deeply-held conviction especially among those involved in the NCAD that the omission of their role in the non-university sector was regrettable to say the least.  The wording proposed both by Deputy Horgan and by the Minister meets the point but I prefer my amendment because it is comprehensive.  It was tabled after consultation with a number of people involved in various colleges and institutions who were offering these types of courses which they would like to have specified in order to ensure that this legislation would apply to them. More than anything else I would ask the Minister to consider the question of the recognition of apprenticeship courses with a view to allowing the NCEA to devise a system of awards in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the detailed amendment proposed by Deputy Collins <Col N="1006" /> I would draw the attention of the House to the two amendments in my name which I think meet the points of the Deputy's amendment.  Deputy Collins has said that there is serious need to protect the educational content of our apprenticeship courses.  I would accept that and that there is a certain onus on me as Minister and on the Department regarding the direct content, though philosophically it is difficult sometimes to distinguish between what is referred to as education and what is referred to as training.  In some instances at least there is developing a false kind of distinction. This is encouraged by certain thinking in the EEC.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins suggested that we should not depend on foreign bodies such as the City and Guilds.  At no time were they involved in the whole spectrum of apprenticeship courses. They were involved only in specific areas but in many instances they will be replaced by the NCEA.</P>
      <P>On the question of art and design I may have said at Second Stage that when we were putting the draft heads together there was no indication that the NCAD wished to be a designated institution. We thought that it would have been proper to so designate it and we so argued, putting the points before the board.  Our thinking was strengthened by the need for the reorganisation of art education and the linking of the national college with other colleges providing art education.  The NCEA which should have a national role seem to be the ideal vehicle for the rationalisation, reorganisation and co-ordination of art studies in the regional technical colleges, for instance, and in any other colleges operating at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The NCEA are involved in the apprenticeship field in so far as they are providing courses say, at certificate level, which provide for apprentices.  I do not think either that the national council should have any specific role regarding the input of education except in terms of their role of assisting courses in the various institutions but, as I said at the outset, the Department and I have an obligation to ensure that the specifically educational part of the apprenticeship <Col N="1007" /> courses is adequate and suitable. Educationalists maintain that this is becoming more important daily because of the well-known speed at which technology is developing.  What the young citizen is left with is the solid basis of education when a change in training, a change in role is demanded.  I am fully conscious of this and, consequently, I have no intention of being remiss in my duty in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer in more detail to amendment No. 12 in the name of the Minister which proposes to delete the words &ldquo;in association with the aforesaid education&rdquo;.  This seems to be related in some sense to amendment No. 20 in the name of both the Minister and me.  Earlier in this discussion the two points emphasised by the Minister were that the Bill is for the purpose, first, of giving statutory recognition to the NCEA and, secondly, of providing for an improvement and for the further development of technological education. He is now proposing an amendment to the effect that the functions of the council shall be generally to encourage, facilitate, promote and develop as proposed and to encourage and promote liberal education regardless of whether such education is associated with any of the other sectors or educational activities described earlier in the subsection.</P>
      <P>I am wondering whether the Minister is consciously widening the scope of the Bill by this amendment.  What precisely does he understand by &ldquo;liberal education&rdquo;, a phrase that is used so often that I suspect it may mean something different to different people? In relation to this amendment is the function of the NCEA to be more limited in regard to liberal education by the fact that in relation to liberal education they are only to encourage and promote whereas with all the other forms of education, they are not only to encourage and promote but to facilitate, co-ordinate and develop?  Perhaps the Minister would expound somewhat on amendment No. 12 in terms of the actual effect he would anticipate it having on the workings and on the priorities of the council.</P>

      <P>Earlier in the discussion Deputy Horgan touched on the case we were trying to cover when, at Second Stage, he mentioned specifically the School of Ecumenics.  Under the original wordings, it was felt that we would have to install machinery in the School of Ecumenics and have the rattling of the mills of God.  The amendment was tabled in order to free such courses from the necessity of being in association with the purely technological or commercial.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed for action in the technological field and I hope the council will resist any take-off in, say, a purely liberal arts college context.  However, there are worthwhile areas to be covered in the assessment, validating and awarding field, such as the one mentioned by the Deputy, and it was thought that the wording should be sufficiently flexible to cover them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has clarified the purpose of this amendment in this way because it was a problem which occured to me as one which would need to dealt with differently in the Bill.  I have no hesitation in welcoming the Minister's explicit reference to the fact that validation by the NCEA of a course of the School of Ecumenics will not be threatened by the passage of this Bill.  In passing, it might be noted that not only are the mills of God involved but that when William Blake referred in his famous poem to the dark satanic mills he was not referring to the industrial development of his time but to the churches of his time.  Whether or not that would be regarded as technology, I do not know. <Col N="1009" /> The other interesting point we have had from the Minister this afternoon is his explicit desire that this should not be regarded as a take-off point for hosts of institutions and organisations of every kind, some of dubious worth, looking to the NCEA to validate their courses.  The Minister will agree that it is difficult to make an exception in the Bill for an institution, however worthy, such as the School of Ecumenics, without at least opening the NCEA to pressure from other liberal arts institutions to follow the same path.  In the last analysis we shall have to leave it to the good sense of the NCEA to decide on the appropriate balance of regulations and validations. Ultimately, it will also be up to the Minister of the day to decide in terms of designations because I presume that the NCEA will not be allowed to validate institutions and courses which the Minister has not designated.  Effectively, it will be a double check on the activities of the council in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that what the council validate has national, international, or regional implications and that courses would not be validated for the sake of being validated, which would be an abuse of the Bill.</P>
      <P>In regard to apprenticeship courses, it is a fact that the City and Guilds are phasing out their awards.  A great number of teachers in the technical sector hold qualifications from the City and Guilds and they are of excellent standing.  I was not reflecting on the holders of City and Guilds awards but was simply saying that the phasing out of these awards created a vacuum.  The Department award technical certificates which are also of good standing.  These awards should now be transferred to the NCEA.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that amendment No. 29 has been ruled out of order, I wish to retain the right to move an amendment relating apprenticeship courses even if it means moving amendment No. 9 again on Report Stage to emphasise the need for the recognition of apprenticeship courses.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important amendment because it relates to the purpose of the Bill and to the way in which we draft legislation generally.  It is quite in order to set out in general terms in a section or subsection of a Bill what the functions of an organisation like the NCEA should be.  The normal practice then, unless I am very much mistaken, is to further provide that the specific way in which they will implement these general purposes is along certain lines.  In section 3 as drafted there is a general overall subsection relating to the functions of the council.  One would have expected that section 2 would read as follows: &ldquo;In pursuance of the functions enumerated in subsection (1) the Council may....&rdquo; The formulation used is very much broader and states as follows: &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1) of this section, the Council may....&rdquo; I doubt that I am wrong in assuming the phrase &ldquo;Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1)&rdquo; means that the activities which are conferred on the council in the remainder of the section are not exclusive and that the council may do anything they like as long as it can be brought under the general umbrella of subsection (1), regardless of whether it has been specifically referred to in subsection (2).  The whole purpose of specific references in subsection (2) is that people will be clear as to the specific ways in which the council will be carrying <Col N="1012" /> out their functions.  If people are not clear about this, they will be very much in the dark.  They will be open to iniatives by the council, of which they may have no prior knowledge or warning and which will make their own planning and course construction that much more difficult.</P>
    <P>My amendment, while not at all weakening the council, makes it quite clear that the council's functions are specific and establishes the appropriate relationship between the general subsection about the functions of the council and the more detailed subsection in relation to their activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not share Deputy Horgan's view as to the effect of subsection (2).  Subsection (1) sets out the general functions of the council and subsection (2) particularises them.  It is important that the words should be included lest subsections (1) and (2) be thought of as operating independently. We do not want any clash between the general functions referred to in subsection (1) and the particular functions referred to in subsection (2) and the formula &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo; is the best way to see to it. The mothers of some animals eat their young and here there might be a question of the young eating the mother if there were not the coverage of this part which Deputy Horgan wants to excise. Subsection (2) emphasises the functions as set out in subsection (1).  If the words were omitted there would be difficulty of interpretation and it could be read as ousting subsection (1).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept part of the Minister's argument.  If the words were omitted and nothing else substituted there might arise some risk that the two subsections would appear to act independently. It is no part of my desire that the two subsections should act, be seen to act or be open to the interpretation of acting independently, much less that they should act in conflict with each other.  As it is worded at the moment, there is a distinct danger that under subsection (1) the council may act independently without relation to subsection (2).  I believe it was probably the intention <Col N="1013" /> of the draftsman to ensure that subsection (2) flowed from subsection (1), was related to it and dependent on it. However, the words &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality&rdquo; seem to give <i>carte blanche</i> to the council under subsection (1).  While I am disposed to withdraw the amendment as it stands, it would be in order on Report State to re-insert a form of words which would make clear the nature of the dependent relationship between subsection (1) and subsection (2).</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2), line 17, after &ldquo;give&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;primary, higher and honorary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The intention is to make it clear that the council would have the power to give primary, higher and honorary degrees. The last line of amendment No. 15 which is to be moved by the Minister states that a programme of research may be carried out under the aegis of the council and perhaps it is intended that higher degrees may be awarded.  The question of honorary degrees has not been clarified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; is used without clarification.  It does not exclude higher degrees, provided certain other conditions are satisfied.  If other <Col N="1014" /> conditions can be satisfied within the terms of the Bill, I cannot see that it would exclude honorary degrees. Amendment No. 15 in my name makes provision for awards for prescribed programmes of research and that, together with the word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo;, covers what the Deputy is looking for.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that it might be wiser to specify that the council are empowered to award primary, higher and honorary degrees, lest at some future date some oddball might challenge the right of the council to award an honorary or a higher degree?  The word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; seems to say primary degrees.  It might be wise in the context of parliamentary draftsmanship to specify the council's right simply to avoid any confusion that might arise at a future date.  What I am proposing in the amendment is reasonable and necessary to protect the council in awarding degrees.</P>

The council will not be involved to any great extent with honorary degrees but provided certain conditions are met I cannot see how they may not be able to award honorary degrees as well.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 15 seems to satisfy the substance of the Deputy's amendment.  The Deputy adverted to the words &ldquo;programme of research&rdquo; in the second last line of the amendment, and this covers the type of degree he refers to as a higher degree. The word &ldquo;degree&rdquo; is not hedged in in the actual Bill; there is plenty of latitude in the word.  To make assurance doubly sure amendment No. 15 talks about awards to persons who have carried out a prescribed programme of research.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be contentious in this matter.  In line 17 of section 3 the word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; is used but the word &ldquo;diplomas&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;certificates&rdquo; are also used.  If we wanted to be silly about the thing we could equally interpret the position so as to have ordinary diplomas, higher diplomas and honorary diplomas or ordinary certificates, higher certificates and honorary certificates.  Obviously, that it not meant in the ordinary usage of the words.  We may award a diploma with distinction or a certificate with distinction but it is not intended to have higher diplomas or certificates.  In that context the word &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; is not as clear as I would like it to be.  I am merely seeking to protect the council in a statutory form by having the matter clarified.  The words used in amendment No. 15 to which the Minister referred are not strong enough and do not make the case clear enough.</P>

      <P>I take the Deputy's point about the ordinary meaning of words and so on but in the very same context when one talks of a programme of research one is usually not talking about primary degree level.  The very same <Col N="1016" /> kind of understanding of what one is at obtains there.  The words quite clearly refer to the award of a higher degree.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (2) (a), lines 19 to 32, to delete sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i)  (I) the Council is satisfied have attended or otherwise pursued or followed courses of study or instruction conducted by, or provided under the supervision of, an institution to which this Act applies and which are courses which for the time being stand approved of by the Council, and (II) have either&mdash;</P>
      <P> (A)  attained a standard regarded by the Council as satisfactory in examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability which are either prescribed or set by the Council or for the time being stand so approved of and relate to such courses, or</P>
      <P>(B)  performed in a manner regarded by the Council as satisfactory other exercises which both so relate and for the time being stand so approved of, </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> or</P>
    <P>(ii)  have either attained a standard regarded by the Council as satisfactory in examinations or other tests of knowledge or ability or have performed other exercises in a manner regarded by the Council as satisfactory and who have carried out, under the supervision of an institution to which this Act applies, and in a manner regarded as satisfactory by the Council, a programme of research approved of by the Council,&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Various representations were made to me in relation to this subsection and for the purpose of clarifying the points and ensuring that there will be no doubts at all as to the provision in the section, I decided to recast the section.  In subsection (2) (II) (A) I am providing that the council may confer educational awards on persons who have carried out prescribed programmes of research.  In the context of higher studies it is clear, generally, that a programme of research resulting in an award is in the field of higher degrees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say at the outset that I object to the powers being given in this Bill to the council to set their own examinations.  I put down an amendment to delete the words &ldquo;set by the Council or&rdquo;.  So did Deputy Horgan. I firmly believe the concept of the NCEA was that of a validating body.  In that role they must be independent of examinations being set.  Their powers must be seen quite clearly to be validating.  In the context of the original Bill and the Minister's amendment they have power to set examinations.  That is not acceptable to me or to a number of people directly involved in the technological sector and directly involved in the regional and technological colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one basic point on which I received a number of representations from different people serving in different capacities in the technological sector. We are quite firmly convinced that the council should not have power to set examinations. They must have the power to validate and, in that context, they must assess courses, monitor standards and ensure that a financial, technical and <Col N="1018" /> lecturing input is made into the giving of courses at any level, certificate, diploma or degree.  They must assess courses minutely, and validations and awards. Giving power to the council to set examinations defeats the objective of the council being a validating body.  They should not have the power to set examinations because they would be validating examinations they set themselves.</P>
    <P>Traditionally examinations in regional and technical colleges have always been set by the college authorities in consultation with extern examiners.  That has been the practice to date.  It is also the practice in universities.  It ensures that college authorities, college principals and academic staff within the colleges know they have an involvement with their own colleges in standards and in the development of their own courses and the development of the examination structure. To move that out of the colleges is dangerous.  It is a move which is designed to reduce the standing of college principals, heads of departments, lecturing staff and academic staff within the colleges.  That should not be done.  It should not be an objective of this Bill.  It should not be part of the Minister's policy for the developing technological sector.</P>
    <P>There must be academic freedom within the colleges, and it must be seen. There must be respect for the staff of the colleges.  They are concerned about the welfare of the colleges.  They are also concerned about changing times and changing needs.  In their concern for those matters they must be free to speak with extern examiners of their choice.  In that way they will be seen to have responsibility for the destiny of their own courses.  In that context, giving the council power to set examinations is a regressive step, a retrograde step.  It will cause concern among many people in the technological sector.  It will cause concern and disappointment to principals, heads of departments and lecturing staffs.</P>
    <P>This aspect of the Bill is unacceptable to me.  I will have to call for a division on this amendment although I know I will be defeated in the lobbies.  There is an onus on me to make it quite clear that <Col N="1019" /> this part of section 3 is obnoxious in the extreme.  It goes against the tremendous work which has been done in the technological colleges by heads of departments, by academic staffs and by principals.  Those people have not worked in the context of being paid for setting examinations or to see that standards are maintained.  They have not even got a proper management structure within the colleges as the Minister well knows.  Here we are taking away power from people who have been seen to be the most concerned people in the whole of the technological sector.  I cannot accept that.  I will not accept it.</P>
    <P>Whoever advised the Minister to allow the council to set or prescribe examinations has seriously ill-advised him. He has been wrongly advised.  He is doing damage to many genuine people in the technological sector.  The Minister said a programme of research approved of by the council indicates that it may also refer to higher degree diplomas.  I want to impress on the Minister that he is not strengthening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that that reference in the amendment is not strong enough and I would ask the Minister to look more specifically at that matter.  I object strenuously to the concept of the council setting their own examinations. That is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of my Second Stage speech I said the Bill was sloppy and badly composed.  I said it was the sloppiest Bill to come before the House for quite some time.  That is proved by the number of amendments I have seen fit to put down, a number of which are consequential, the number of amendments Deputy Horgan has seen fit to put down, and the Minister's own amendments. They prove that the Bill was hastily conceived, <Col N="1020" /> hastily drafted and hastily presented to the House.  That is unfortunate because it is important when bringing a Bill before the House that the policy of the Bill is seen and appreciated. The reason for that is the reluctance of any Minister to accept amendments from the Opposition.  There is always an unfortunate reluctance on the part of Ministers to accept amendments, but the fact that the Minister himself has had to introduce so many amendments is a reflection on the quality of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The powers being given to the council to set or prescribe examinations is damaging to the whole technological sector and the people involved in it.  For the sake of the goodwill which exists within colleges and institutions, I ask the Minister to look again at the powers he is giving the council to accept the input that has been made by the staff of the colleges throughout the country, to understand their feelings about this matter, and to take away from the council this power to set examinations.  It is a very damaging power, no matter what goodwill the council may have in the matter of setting examinations.  I am not saying that they are going to set bad examinations or poor standards or anything like that.  I am not reflecting on what the council will do but I am making it clear that the powers he is giving them are resented deeply by many people I have spoken to who are involved in the technological sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision in the section which is repeated and extended in ministerial amendment No. 15 which we are now discussing is a major innovation in higher education here.  One could make a political point of the fact that the National University of Ireland technically set the examinations for the constituent colleges of that organisation and that the model we are adopting here is to some extent similar. However, that does not really meet the situation.  Anybody who knows the reality of the third level education situation in this country will know that there has been a very strong tradition for third level institutions to set their own examinations, subject to whatever corrective action extern examiners or similar <Col N="1021" /> structures may import into such examination system.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that we should now, in the name of developing, encouraging, facilitating and promoting technological education, allow an organisation to assume, octopus-like, so many powers to itself, and especially now the power of setting examinations. The Minister in proposing this amendment made what was, in effect, a drafted speech.  Perhaps it was proper for him not to refer to the substance of the section as repeated in his amendment, and the main substance of the section is the intention to give to the Council the power to set examinations.  One might be forgiven for thinking that we have already enough examinations without setting up another institution who will have the power to set examinations.  This is not just another institution as such.  It is not a teaching institution.  One might argue that the National University of Ireland, which has an umbrella function, is a teaching institution, but in no way are the NCEA a teaching institution. Nowhere in section 3 (1) will we find the words, &ldquo;encourage, facilitate, promote, co-ordinate and develop&rdquo;, nor do we find the word &ldquo;provide&rdquo;.  The NCEA are not to be a provider of education although it is proper for them to be a validating institution. There seems to be absolutely no reason why they should be an institution who also set individual examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may make the point that in relation to second level, for example, the Department of Education set examinations although only in very rare circumstances do they provide directly second level education.  Even in second level education there has been a strong and professionally-based reaction against the idea of a centrally-set examination as the most appropriate mechanism in all institutions and at all times to determine an individual pupil's academic attainment.  That reaction, which is embodied in the report of the Committee on the Intermediate Certificate Examination, has still not yet found very many or very sympathetic echoes in the corridors of power in Marlborough Street.  If this amendment <Col N="1022" /> and the section which it repeats are anything to go by, we have evidence that, if anything, the trend of opinion is the other way and that the Minister and the Department will resist any attempt to remove examinations from centralised institutions or to give individual institutions which provide education any real flexibility and permission to innovate in this area.</P>
    <P>It might be argued again that the NCEA power to set examinations might be a useful way of resolving problems in relation to individual institutions, but this is conflict management of the worst kind.  It is all very well for the NCEA in conflict with a particular institution to say, for example, &ldquo;Not only will we not validate your examination because we do not agree with it but we will set up our own examination&rdquo;.  It is a big stick but is meaningless because it would be possible for the NCEA under this amendment to set up examinations, which, because of the conflict with the institution concerned, not even one student would sit for.  If this Bill is to mean anything it should be reasonable and confer only reasonable powers on the NCEA.</P>
    <P>In introducing this amendment the Minister referred to the fact that he had received many representations in relation to the subject matter of this section. It is plain from his amendment and from his speech that he has not even begun to listen to some of the loudest and most cogent representations which were made on this issue.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to a number of other matters in relation to this ministerial amendment and perhaps the Minister will reply to them all.  First, the amendment reads:</P>
    <P>(II) have either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(A) ...or for the time being stand so approved of and relate to such courses,</P>
    <P>It is very important that we should know here whose option is involved.  Is it the option of the council or that of the institution concerned?  Secondly, at (II) (B) in the amendment there is the interesting phrase &ldquo;other exercises&rdquo;.  We would be very glad to have more information from <Col N="1023" /> the Minister about the nature of such other exercises.  What precisely has he in mind?  Is he thinking in terms of practical work or work experience?  If this is the case does he have in mind that the exercises should be organised or OK'd in some way by the council or should they be organised or OK'd in some way by the institution which the individual student is attending?</P>
    <P>Finally, in relation to the post-graduate element we have discussed already, there is reference, five lines from the bottom of the amendment, to the fact that students shall also have carried out a programme of research approved of by the council.  If we are talking here about post graduate degrees based on research and not on students who are being taught and who are doing examinations in relation to the courses they have been taught, the implication of this subsection seems to me to be that if the council is going to approve or validate the award of a post-graduate degree based on research, it would have to approve the programme of study followed by each individual post-graduate student.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Murphy that I will not go on for 40 minutes; I will cut my time.  I should like to hear everybody speak because it is a very important matter.</P>
      <P>I was shocked and dismayed to learn that the Minister and the board had contemplated closing our boatyards.  It is particularly sad for men who came from England, from Dublin, indeed from all parts of Ireland to take up jobs in these boatyards, because when they took up those positions they were assured that there would be continuous employment for them.  It is especially sad for the apprentices recruited 12 months ago, who in the month of November last were called in and given a £300 golden handshake to quit.  It is very disturbing that, as far as the Dingle boatyard is concerned, there are at present two apprentices in AnCO in Tralee undergoing a course in fitting.  If this move was contemplated surely these young people&mdash;the young people about whom we hear so much talk at present and for whom we are so anxious to get jobs&mdash;should not be led up the garden path.</P>

    <P>I do not know whether or not the Minister is aware of it, but there is widespread horror at these closures in three counties&mdash;Donegal, Kerry and Cork.  The people of Donegal gave vent to their feelings at a large meeting held in Killybegs.  In Kerry we had a special meeting of the county council and, in Baltimore, County Cork, there was a public meeting held also. From each of those meetings one thing emerged clearly: that everybody was unanimous that it was a disgraceful policy <Col N="1026" /> decision of the Minister for Fisheries to close these boatyards.  Let there be no doubt in anybody's mind but that he is responsible for the shambles of the boatyards.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I may be permitted to quote a parliamentary question and reply given in this House, reported in the Official Report, Volume 311, No. 8 of 15 February 1979, at columns 1422-23 as follows:</P>
    <P>221.  Mr. Bruton and Mr. Deasy asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, in relation to Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Inland Fisheries Trust (1) the amount and percentage of its total budget represented by, and conditions regarding expenditure of money received by it from non-Exchequer sources, and (2) the extent to which he is answerable to the Oireachtas for its activities.</P>
    <P>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan): At present (i) about £6 million or approximately 33? per cent of the total budget of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, and (ii) about £60,000 or approximately 7 per cent of the total budget of the Inland Fisheries Trust are derived from non-Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>The annual report and accounts of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara are laid before each House of the Oireachtas as required by the Sea Fisheries Act, 1952.</P>
    <P>While I am under no statutory obligation in the matter I would regard myself an answerable to the Oireachtas for the general policy of both An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Inland Fisheries Trust and for ensuring that these bodies are carrying out the functions for which they were set up.</P>
    <P>There in black and white the Minister accepts responsibility for rubber-stamping the policy of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and that he is answerable in this House therefor.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister shown such an appalling lack of interest in all aspects of the fishing industry?  It seems to me that all he can do is supply scripts with scurrilous innuendoes to Fianna Fáil councillors. <Col N="1027" /> At a special meeting of Kerry County Council last Monday week one of his councillors said that the boatyards lost £1 million last year.  When challenged as to how much Dingle boatyard lost he was unable to give the figure.  The very same public representative wanted deliberately to deceive the people in Dingle that the boatyard there was losing thousands of pounds.  When I challenged him afterwards as to where he had got that information, he told me it was supplied by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  The loss in Dingle is, indeed, very small.  Will the Minister tell the House why he has directed that the boatyard should close? Is he satisfied that that is the right decision?  On whose recommendation did he adopt this policy decision?  Was it that of BIM or the Department of Finance or is there another developer on the scene who has not surfaced yet?</P>
    <P>I should like to take the three options and look at them coldly and clinically. The attempt by BIM to put 159 workers on the dole queue seems to be part of a deliberate plan for the final closure or the sale of the three boatyards.  The House has a right to question the wisdom of BIM on that decision.  The board were well aware for some years that the trend for the purchase of new trawlers was towards steel trawlers and yet they did not make any effort to modernise or invest capital in the boatyards or retain the workers.  I am grateful to Deputy Blaney, who pointed out on an Adjournment Debate that the architect, the chief cook and bottlewasher, was not appointed until a couple of months ago even though the vacancy existed for years.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if BIM have a comprehensive document in their possession suggesting modernisation?  How long have they that document?  Can the Minister tell the House why it was not published?  Did the Minister meet the unions in 1978 when the unions put forward a scheme?  Did the Minister give an undertaking to the unions that there would not be any redundancies?  What has gone wrong since?  Could the current crisis have a serious significance for <Col N="1028" /> BIM?  Is it a winding down of the role of BIM in the fishing industry?  I should like to quote from the Official Report of 11 November 1976, when Deputy Gallagher, now the Minister for the Gaeltacht, questioned the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy M.P. Murphy. Where is Deputy Gallagher tonight?  The 50-mile limit has gone but he got the Ministry and that settled that.  The quotation from the Official Report is as follows:</P>
    <P>Mr. Gallagher asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries his projections in relation to (a) boat-building (b) development of harbours and (c) processing for the years 1977, 1978 and 1979; the estimated cost of these projects; and the sum being provided by the Government for this development in 1977.</P>
    <P>Mr. M.P. Murphy: Targets have been set which envisage the addition of an average of 76 boats of all sizes to the Irish fishing fleet in each of the years 1977, 1978 and 1979.  These targets will be monitored and if necessary up-dated each year.</P>
    <P>What has happened since that reply in the course of which we were told that a number of boats were to built each year?  How many orders have BIM got for all sizes of boats?  Is it true that the board are sitting on those orders waiting for the chop to come on the boatyards?</P>
    <P>I am aware that a vague hint was given in the White Paper that there was to be a toning down of BIM but I should like to remind the Minister that BIM are major employers in the underdeveloped coastal regions.  The loss of hundreds of jobs will have serious social implications. If the Minister has any backbone he will ensure that there is no sale and that the boatyards will not close or be reduced to operating with a skeleton staff for repairs only.</P>
    <P>I should now like to question the Minister about the second part of the triangle, the Department of Finance.  Are they putting the boot in in their customary fashion at Estimates time?  I am aware that in 1976 there was a loss of more than £100,000, that in 1977 it <Col N="1029" /> was in the region of £500,000 and, if the figure quoted by the Fianna Fáil Deputy at the meeting of Kerry County Council on Monday week is correct, last year it was in the region of £1 million.  That loss could have been foreseen because the board did not make any effort to modernise management, streamline output or anything else.</P>
    <P>Was the Minister so weak at the Cabinet table that when he presented his Estimate he was chopped and gave in without a fight?  Was he sacrificing the boat builders?  If he was, we know he had something else in view.  He does not mind being unpopular in the short term. He does not mind getting rid of the 50-mile limit because, as we are all mature enough to know, the Minister is angling for bigger things.  He does not mind being unpopular at the time of the next election by getting rid of the 50-mile limit, closing our boatyards or doing any other dirty job the Cabinet want him to do, because he is angling for the EEC Commissioner's job in Brussels.  He will be happy there away from all the smoke and thunder sitting in his luxurious apartment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  As the late President de Valera said many years ago, &ldquo;I am looking deep into the Minister's heart&rdquo;.  The Minister has taken the easy way out.  This evening I was informed by the General Office that a question I put to the Minister for Finance asking him if the Comptroller and Auditor General was aware that a certain visitor Dingle boatyard had the honour to receive in the recent past was to be referred to the Minister for Fisheries.  However, it has nothing to do with him.  Has the Minister broken all the rules in the book with BIM in allowing that visit?  We must wait until tomorrow to ascertain that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why Dingle has to be closed.  There are excellent craftsmen there.  My information, which <Col N="1030" /> is third hand from the Fianna Fáil Deputy at the recent Kerry County Council meeting, is that there was a small loss in Dingle.  I should like the Minister to tell the House why in recent times moulds were made in Dingle but the frames had to be cut and made in England.  That only happened in the last few weeks.  Can the Minister tell the House why that happened?  The Dingle shipwrights manufactured those frames in the past and could do so again.  If BIM did not think enough of the Dingle men to ask them to make those frames why did they not ask the Killybegs or Baltimore shipworkers to make them? This was a deliberate, calculated effort to escalate costs and make Irish shipwrights redundant whether in Killybegs, Dingle or Baltimore.  Will the Minister tell the House why a certain gentleman visited Dingle boatyard during the boat show?  That same gentleman stood outside the gate at 5 p.m. and counted the men coming out of it.  The Dingle men got suspicious because that gentleman is an undertaker among other interests.</P>

      <P>Last week Deputy Deasy, Deputy White, Deputy O'Keeffe and I met the Workers' Union of Ireland who presented a very comprehensive document to us from which I now give some quotations:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Potential Value of New Vessels 1980-1982.</P>
      <P>Note: The value of new vessels to be delivered in 1980 is between £33 million and £36 million.  The total value of all applications for new vessels orders is currently £28 million (80 vessels).</P>
      <P Just="Center">Current Situation</P>
      <P>Three hulls are under construction in Holland to be fitted out by a private yard.  One vessel has commenced in Scotland and the entire vessel is to be built there.  Steel hulls have already been fitted out by BIM who were the first to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1031" /> Potential Orders</P>
    <P>There are five vessels to be completely built abroad at a total cost of £10 million.  Four of these are 119 feet and one is 150 feet.  These are steel vessels.</P>
    <P>BIM figure for conversion for steel is £2 million.</P>
    <P>Even though BIM had a report, they never made an effort to modernise the boatyards so that they could manufacture those trawlers.</P>
    <P>I am sure that other Deputies will speak about their own areas.  As far as Dingle is concerned, the boatyard was the only industry in the town.  Its closure will cause severe hardship to the town. Newlyweds will be unable to meet their mortgages.  There is nothing left but the emigrant ship.  Why did the Minister or BIM not ask Gaeltarra Éireann to come into this matter?  Is it not a fact that Gaeltarra Éireann have given the substantial grant of £140,000 to a private boat builder with a guaranteed loan of another £140,000?  Why were Gaeltarra Éireann not brought in to rescue the Dingle boatyard?  Dingle is in the Gaeltacht and all the workers there are Irish speakers.  The Minister washed his hands of this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an obligation to make sure those boatyards do not close. I ask him to stand up to the Department of Finance and BIM or else have a sworn inquiry into the management of BIM.  The Minister should not accept the statement of BIM.  If the Minister lets those boatyards go as he let the 50-mile limit go he will go down in history as the nearest thing to Cromwell this State has produced.</P>

      <P>We should have a senible debate in relation to this matter because we did not have that on the last occasion.  It does not help when we do not approach a matter like this in a constructive manner.  On the last occasion I stated that the initial discussions were then taking place.  They took place on 13 March between the unions, manual and craft, concerned and BIM, and certain <Col N="1032" /> basic facts were pointed out to the men and unions concerned.  It was necessary that those facts be spelt out in specific form.  There is no point in continuing along a road of codding workers, as was done explicitly over a number of years, in particular in 1973.  I have letters and figures here, given by BIM to the then Minister for Finance and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy M.P. Murphy, another to the Minister for Finance, Deputy R. Ryan, and also to the Minister for Defence, Deputy Donegan, pointing out that as far as the boatyards were concerned the cutbacks in capital allocations were seriously harmful because they prevented the boatyards from changing their method of production, from timber constructed boats to steel hull boats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to make it quite clear in case there is any misconception. I have no ideological belief one way or the other as long as the operation is kept going and employment is maintained.  Whether these yards are owned by Bord Iascaigh Mhara or by a private operator or operated jointly, that option can be considered.  There are a number of options that can be considered. My main concern is to provide a viable operation, to get employment levels up and to make sure that the labour force will be engaged in building boats which Irish fishermen want.</P>
      <P>I was very glad to hear Deputy Blaney's constructive contribution here some weeks ago during which he did not exclude the option to which I have referred, the type of option that might be considered by the Government in order to get these yards going in a viable way.  He constructively threw out the idea that private interests could do a lot better job than the job being done at the moment by a State body, run and managed from Dublin.  I agree with that because I do not see any point in managing from Dublin these operations located far away from Dublin.  That is being done from Dublin in a quasi-civil servant operation.  It would be much more practical to get people working on the ground in order to get the operation going in a proper manner.  That is the only hope I see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the options I am considering at the moment.  We are about to have talks and we do not want these talks to be bedevilled by any political comments here in the House.  I want to see constructive talks between the trade unions and BIM, between the trade unions and myself and between myself and BIM, plus any possible private operators who may be interested in leasing <Col N="1043" /> these premises for boat-building purposes, with a clause built in that boat-building operations alone will be allowed in the yards.</P>
    <P>I do not see anything wrong in that.  I am determined there will not be a closure, and if these yards cannot be managed efficiently in an operation directed from Dublin, I will see that they will be managed efficiently by somebody.  The surest way to lead to closure of these yards is to continue a situation to the end of this year when there will be another loss of £1 million. No Minister for Fisheries in his senses could stand over a situation where these three yards are building boats which are not wanted by Irish fishermen, and not alone that but building them at a loss of £1 million a year.  That situation cannot be sustained and I will not stand over it. The option which will be adopted will be designed to avoid closure of these yards, indeed to provide for expanding employment in these yards.</P>

      <P>No section of the community were so gulled by Fianna Fáil in the 1977 election campaign than the fishermen.  I do not want to go over old ground about the 50-mile limit. Deputies Gallagher, Haughey, Molloy and O'Kennedy took good care once the election was over to put Deputy Lenihan in charge of Fisheries, and of course he could not be blamed for what had happened in the 1973-1977 period because he was resting at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Hopes were held out to our fishermen that modern boats would be built for them and that employment would be created in the BIM boatyards in the building of these boats at Killybegs, Baltimore and Dingle.  I do not agree with a lot of what Deputy Begley said tonight.  Indeed I disagree entirely with him because he seemed to be indicting <Col N="1044" /> BIM.  They are not at fault.

      <P>It is ministerial policy that is to be blamed.  It is quite evident from the Minister's statement that pressure from private interests has brought this position about.  I had a good deal of pressure from such interests during my period in office.  We are dealing with the public sector.  During my period in the House, going back to 1951, I have always found BIM helpful and cooperative. They were always anxious to expand and to readapt, to meet modern requirements, to steel-hulled boats. More important, the workers in the BIM yards at Baltimore, Killybegs and Dingle were quite satisfied with BIM as employers.  I can speak particularly for Baltimore.  Relations were quite good and excellent work was being done.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister appreciate the position of these workers today?  He said we were codding the workers and the unions.  Who is codding them?  When we were in office not only did we maintain the workforce but we increased it in a three-year period.  During three of our four years BIM had a profit in these yards&mdash;I refer to the detailed memorandum prepared by the Workers' Union of Ireland.  Now we are being told the yards must be closed down.  I understand the proposal is to reduce the workforce so that by 1980 the numbers employed will be 24 at Killybegs, ten at Baltimore and six in Dingle.  I want to make a special plea to the Minister to reconsider his attitude. I am quite sure the Minister is under great pressure from private boatyard owners who, I am quite sure, helped Fianna Fáil financially in the 1977 election campaign.</P>

      <P>The Minister is selling out to the private boatyards.  As I represent Baltimore I know what the effect of the redundancies that are to take place there will mean.  At present there is a workforce of 67 people, and that is a big number considering the overall population of the district.  It is proposed within the next 15 months to scatter at least 57 of the 67 people to the winds.  There are skilled operatives working in the three yards but if we implement the measures the Minister has in mind they will be scattered.  How can we gather them together again?</P>
      <P>The Minister said the yards were not modern.  What prevented the Minister from modernising them since he took office in 1977?  At that time we were about to provide a transverse slip for the Baltimore yard which would have helped to modernise it.  The cost of the slip would have been in the region of £300,000.  All these proposals were before the Department.  At the time the Coalition left office they had in mind getting BIM to modernise the yard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That was the <Col N="1046" /> position.  There was no talk in Baltimore, Killybegs or Dingle during the election campaign of redundancies in the yards. It was stated that there would be expansions in the fishing industry and consequently expansion in the workforce in the BIM yards.  The Minister should rethink this position.  Can the Minister visualise the problems confronting the workers who are facing redundancy who have a craft which in some cases took years to acquire?  They are now to be thrown on employment exchanges.  It is completely out of place in 1979 that such a situation should occur.  On behalf of the workers I should like to make a special plea to the Minister to rethink the position.  It is not so long ago since I made a special plea to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development to rethink the farmer's levy and the advisability of continuing it.  It was accepted even though it was in two doses.</P>

      <P>If the Coalition were still in office it would not be reduced.  What would be happening is that we would be modernising the yards. We had a programme for the expansion of the fishing industry.  The gimmickry about nobody being allowed inside of 50 miles, which we heard so often in debates on the fishing industry, has been forgotten.  Our programme for the expansion of the fishing industry set out in detail the number of additional boats required. I should like to know from the Minister what brought about the change in departmental policy regarding seeking orders from abroad?  Before we left office we had discussions with the senior officers in the Department with a view to expanding the yards by getting custom from outside the country.  We felt it was possible to do so.  We were making inquiries with a view to getting additional custom for the yards and boat-building activities.  I have no doubt that had we remained in office the position would be much different from what it is.</P>

      <P>There will be a loss of some 50 jobs.  This is a very big problem.  It is all right for the Minister because he is cushioned away in Dublin and has little or no recourse to fishermen.

      <P>I am satisfied that the policy of doing away with employment in remote parts of the country along with the southern and western seaboards is a step in the wrong direction. As Deputy Begley mentioned, the workforce in the three yards have come together and asked their unions and public representatives of all creeds to try to bring pressure to bear on the Minister with a view to getting him to change his decision.  As far as the workers are concerned, there is no politics in this.  Their bread and butter is in it.</P>
      <P>It is peculiar to note, reading through the memorandum from the Workers' Union of Ireland, that the union responsible for workers in the yard were not notified of this change until last month. Why were they not told months ago? Why were they not brought in as representatives of the workers and why was the situation not discussed with them?  Why not discuss the position with them?  I wonder if the Minister was anxious that there should be a loss.  At least, it gives him the opportunity of coming here and saying that it would be too much to expect the taxpayers to foot the bill to the extent of £1 million in order to subsidise the three boatyards.  I do not know how much it costs the taxpayer to subsidise the workers in other industries.</P>

      <P>The figures show that in the boatyards concerned there was a loss in 1971, a gain in each of the years 1972 to 1975, a relatively small loss in 1976 and that after the Minister assumed office the level of the loss increased so that, according to him, the loss for last year will exceed the seven figure mark.  Taking the seventies, the boatyards showed an overall gain in the five years since 1971, but as soon as <Col N="1049" /> there is a loss the Minister adopts a pessimistic attitude and says that we must rationalise, that we must close down the boatyards because we must not ask the taxpayers to subsidise them.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister took office we have not heard any complaint from him regarding overmanning at the yards and from the information at my disposal which, in regard to Baltimore is first hand, there is no indication of overmanning.  Therefore, instead of bringing in this kind of measure the Minister would be better employed in the drawing up of plans to modernise the yards.  Obviously, capital is needed in order to enable them to compete with private yards or with yards in any part of the world.  If this were done we would be able not only to maintain our workforce but to increase and expand it.  I do not consider it necessary for me to take up any more time on this matter.  There are several Deputies from the three constituencies concerned waiting to make their contributions to this motion.  In essence the message is to keep the yards open and to expand them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, it is a waste of time pursuing this matter.  We may take it that the Minister did not promise an inquiry despite what was said by Senator McGowan at that meeting.  The reason for my being anxious that an inquiry be held is that the issue before us is totally confused.  There is a ludicrous situation of a board for the promotion of fishing, BIM, who have gradually participated in the enlargement of this industry to a point that would have frightened them a few years ago when I was accusing them of lacking in imagination and of setting targets that were too low.  To my mind their targets are still too low, but what is ludicrous about the situation is that BIM have been attempting to run two shows simultaneously.  It is not good business practice that the board charged with the promotion of the fishing industry and the related onshore ancillary services should be charged also with the provision <Col N="1051" /> of money by way of loans and grants for the purchasers of boats and should tell prospective boat buyers that the boats are being sold from the BIM yards.  This has been to the disadvantage of fishermen, who could have bought their boats at the private yards the Minister has lauded so much.  But there was pressure brought to bear on them to buy at BIM yards when it suited the board to build more boats.  Why has the squeeze situation been in operation so much in recent times?  Why has there not been in the past two or three years any seeking of new orders?  On the north-west coast I am aware of eight prospective customers who are known to everybody in that part of the country but not one of whom has been approached on behalf of BIM to have a boat built at the board's yard.  One of the eight has approached the yard asking that the people there, that is at Killybegs, should be allowed build the boat for him.  This is the situation despite all the inefficiency that has resulted from the lack of management, not only in terms of the long distance from Dublin but by the decimation of the staff at Killybegs.  I cannot speak with the same knowledge of Baltimore or Dingle but I expect that the pattern in those yards is similar to that at Killybegs.</P>
      <P>Up to three years ago the boatyards were showing a profit.  We have known for some time that steel was the component of the future so far as boats are concerned, though some fishermen still prefer wooden boats.  On the other hand, fishermen are awaiting the launching of wooden boats which they were pushed into buying by BIM.  At the same time they were quoted for steel hulls, the construction of which we had no knowledge or experience.  Those steel hulls were imported from Holland at a time when similar hulls could be bought in England for less money.  The board were aware of this fact as were the fishermen who were awaiting the boats but they could not do anything about the matter at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that three years ago, as a result of the knowledge that steel would become important to our growing fleet, a reputable English steel <Col N="1052" /> construction firm made a specific proposition to import from England unfinished steel hulls and to establish the expertise to construct steel hulls here for BIM or any other yard?  Why were they ignored?  Why were we prepared to pay so much more money to Holland for similar hulls?  In 1977 the Minister, who was wise then but whose wisdom has since diminished, promised at the launching by BIM in Killybegs of two fully fitted steel hulls that we would expand into steel.  What has happened since?  The Minister may try to explain by quoting a loss of £500,000 in 1977, £1 million in 1978 and an expected loss this year of £1 million.</P>
    <P>In 1976 the naval architect was given different duties in BIM.  Up to September 1978 his services had not been replaced. The design draughtsman died and was not replaced until last September.  The assistant engineer left in mid-1977 and he has not yet been replaced.  The yard engineer in Killybegs left in mid-June 1977 and he has not been replaced.  The apprentice training officer left two years ago and he has not been replaced.  At that time it had obviously been determined that there was to be an end to the yards.  I disagree with the Minister when he says that the yards are not closing. They may not physically close but surely the Minister will not try to convince anybody that the six workers remaining in Dingle will be effective; that ten workers out of 67 in Baltimore can do anything but caretake in the hope that the yard will be revived; that 34 out of 114 workers in Killybegs will be capable of building boats or overhauling them. Let us face the fact that the yards are being closed.  Let us not fool ourselves that in these days of modern methods such a small number of workers in yards on our west coast can do anything else but pass the time and fritter away some more money.</P>
    <P>This sad situation began in 1976. During the time the losses were accumulating we commenced building the largest wooden craft ever built in this country.  Our present situation is the result of the omissions I have mentioned plus many more which I shall not mention tonight.  What were the Minister and <Col N="1053" /> his Department doing at that time? What were the Department and the board doing at that time in relation to the private yards?  Not so long ago I asked the Minister if it had come to his notice that private yards who were endeavouring to expand to meet the new needs of today were being brushed off by the IDA, not because the IDA considered their projects worthless but because the finger had been put on them by BIM or by the Department.  The Minister replied that he was not aware of the matter.  Today the Minister tells us how good these yards are and how they are thriving.  One small yard in my constituency proves that there is something wrong with the management structure.  It was owned by BIM and they closed it down.  Subsequently, a private firm took it over and worked it successfully.  Today we have no assurance that private enterprise will take over these other yards.  I want the Minister to investigate this sorry affair and to consider the incompatibility of BIM's two jobs&mdash;the running of the yards and funding.  This is something we want in a hurry.  Let this be done by a private individual on his own or in conjunction with the State.  We still need timber boats and in some cases the fishermen still want them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>After Question Time today I submitted a question for immediate answer and the Ceann Comhairle said that he had disallowed the Private Notice Question as it did not satisfy the criteria of urgency under Standing Orders.  I asked the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy if he will state why, in view of his recent statement on oil supplies, filling stations in the country have had to close at 6 o'clock each day and all day on Saturday and Sunday while customers are rationed to an inadequate supply of petrol even when the stations are open, and if he is also aware that supplies of fuel oil are being refused to domestic customers, schools and farmers and if it is his opinion <Col N="1054" /> that all this is being caused by the oil companies refusing to release normal supplies pending substantial price increases. I had to accept the ruling of the Ceann Comhairle that this was not a matter of urgency, but if the Minister responsible or the Ceann Comhairle would come with me to the area where I live or anywhere else they would soon find out how urgent the matter is.</P>
      <P>Last week quite a number of people told me they were rationed to £2 or £3 worth of petrol and the managers of the petrol stations said they had not enough petrol to meet the demand.  They suggested they would make a register of customers and do their best to ensure that they got petrol.  I understand that greedy people who had very little else to do went around from station to station filling their tanks with whatever petrol they could get.  A petrol attendant told me yesterday about a man who kicked up a row when told that as he was a stranger he could only have £1 worth of petrol and it then transpired that the tank could only take 57p worth of petrol.  Such people cause trouble for themselves and everybody else and I am not very much interested in them.</P>
      <P>I am interested in the situation which has been created by the Minister responsible for this Department stating on a number of occasions reported on radio, television and in the newspapers that there is no real shortage of petrol and that if everybody bought normally everything would be all right.  His wonderful solution was the proposition that a restrictive sales order might be introduced by the Government and he is considering making an order to compel garages to sell a minimum of £5 worth of petrol at a time.  This was reported in the <i>Evening Press</i> on 2 April 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For some reason petrol is not being sent out to petrol stations.  It is my opinion that the oil companies are hoarding a large amount of petrol.  If we are to believe the CSO, as I suppose we must, twice as much petrol was imported last month as in the previous month and it would appear that very large supplies of petrol are being held in the country.  I would ask the Minister to confirm or deny that this is because a substantial <Col N="1055" /> price rise is pending and people want to make more millions on top of the many millions they have made on petrol supplies during the past few years.</P>
    <P>I usually fill the petrol tank in my car on Saturday afternoon and top it up on Monday or Tuesday.  I use £13 or £14 worth of petrol per week in the course of my work as a Member of this House. Last Saturday I called to the garage as usual at 2.30 and discovered that it was closed.  On making inquiries I discovered that it had been closed all day and would not open again until Monday.  I went to some other stations and it was explained to me that they had to ensure that their customers got a supply of petrol.  I met numerous people along the way who had the same story.  I ask the Minister to say whether there is a shortage of petrol.  If there is, why not ration it to ensure that everybody gets a fair share?  Why try to pass the buck to petrol stations, particularly to the attendants who have the almost impossible job of dealing with people?  The Minister should state categorically whether there is a shortage of petrol.  If so, will arrangements be made to ration petrol?  If there is not a shortage, will the Minister use the power of this House to ensure that petrol companies are not allowed to hold on to vast supplies of petrol in order to make a quick buck when the price rise comes?</P>
    <P>I have spoken to a number of proprietors of petrol stations and many of them have not received supplies for a fortnight.  When they contact the petrol companies they are told the petrol will be sent out, but it does not come.  I do not want to make a party political issue of this.  The problem affects everybody, but particularly those who are forced to use cars in going to and from work or use them in the course of their work.  The suggestion that people should have to buy £5 worth of petrol is ridiculous.  It is even more ridiculous that a Minister should state that there is not a grave shortage of petrol while the petrol is simply not available.  If the petrol is available, why is it not being distributed in the normal way?  Is there anything the Minister is prepared to do to ensure that the country does not grind to a halt <Col N="1056" /> because of the bungling of somebody in the Department or in the oil companies?</P>
    <P>I know the Minister made the comment that precedence should be given to hospitals and those requiring oil for industry. I will not quarrel with that.  I understand that behind the scenes a far more definite instruction was given and the position is that fuel oil is not to be issued for domestic purposes or for the heating of schools.  In fact, some old folks' homes have found it impossible to get fuel oil.  The man who buys a load and delivers it in my own area tells me that he will not get his supply and may go back to the horse and cart if he is to continue in business.  He is only one of many.  Farmers may get only 100 gallons of oil when they formerly got 500 gallons, although they will use that amount in less than two days in doing necessary work in this fine weather.  If there is a shortage of oil let us be told about it and let it be explained.  Who will get the oil and when will they get it?  Is it necessary to introduce a rationing system?  Rumour has led to the development of a black market in fuel oil.  I would hate to see the situation arise that arose during the war years where one could get anything one wanted for a huge price.  This should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>Everybody will understand if the Minister comes forward and sets out the position.  Simply to say at a dinner that there is no shortage and try to blame somebody else is not good enough.  The Minister must come out in the open and tell us what he knows about this.  It will be no reflection on the Government if there is an oil shortage due to circumstances outside their control.  I know the problems; I was a Member of the Government during the last severe shortage of oil and I know what steps must be taken to ensure that industry, farming and so on can be carried on.  Nobody will blame the Government for a fault that is not theirs, they will only blame the Government if the Minister continues to say that there is no shortage and blames somebody else for the fact that oil cannot be got.  Will the Minister of State let us have a plain statement of the situation if she can?  If not, will she ask the Minister to go on television and <Col N="1057" /> make a statement setting out the exact position?  Do not let us continue in the present situation where we do not know whether or not we are being conned by the petrol stations, the petrol companies, the Minister or the Government.  The Minister is reported in the <i>Evening Press</i> on 22 March 1979 as saying that there will be no petrol rationing, that there was no need for petrol rationing, that there is plenty to go around.</P>
    <P>I asked for this question to be raised because I found it difficult to get petrol. In a town near where I live two petrol stations have been closed for the last fortnight because they cannot get a supply of petrol.  Somebody is telling lies, and the only way to find out who is for those who are directly responsible to the House to make a statement which can be understood by everybody.  I would be glad for the information I am seeking.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of the oil companies to ensure that in the light of the overall oil supply situation Ireland gets a fair share of available supplies.  In the present situation this amounts to 95 per cent of our current requirements across the board. The oil companies have been left in no doubt by the Minister that it is their primary duty to meet our supply requirements up to the 95 per cent level of demand. My Department receive regular detailed reports on the reserve stocks which oil companies are obliged to hold under regulations which implement EEC directives on the maintenance of such stocks.  In accordance with the provisions of these regulations the companies must specify separately their stocks of the various oils, whether it is motor spirit, middle distillate or residual fuel oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister when addressing a conference or a dinner at the weekend, referred at some length to the imaginary crisis which had been reached in regard to our oil supplies.  The Minister urged reporters and members of the press and through them people throughout the country not to react to an artificial situation and not to create panic, in other <Col N="1058" /> words, not to go out panic buying or hoarding.  The Minister said at that gathering, that a sensational type of comment or speculative comment can lead to panic buying and to artificial shortages.</P>
    <P>This evening Deputy Tully stated that he did not want to make a political issue out of this matter nor did he want to create a panic situation.  The Deputy has done a tremendous job for people who wish to create a panic situation by his statement here tonight.  It was a mainly political statement not inclined to be helpful to the Minister or to the oil companies and definitely not to the consumer who may be really worried about the situation.  Speculative comment has led to panic buying and artificial shortages in the world spot markets for crude oil and oil products.  The Minister said at the weekend that he did not want to see this happen at local petrol stations, that there is no need for it, but that despite his recent assurances it seemed that some motorists were filling up their cars almost daily.  If other motorists on the road, including Deputy Tully, were to sheepishly follow this type of behaviour the end result would be the movement of petrol stocks from the pumps to the road, in other words from the tanks in our petrol stations to car tanks on the road or in garages.  The Minister also said that queues, artificial shortages and considerable destruction to the economy and to the individual motorist would follow if this happeneed.  The Minister also said that he knew and all of us would agree, that most motorists would adopt a sensible approach to this supply situation by using their cars economically, by driving at reasonable speed and by planning their journeys, and that in this way they would help to meet the needs of the situation as far as petrol is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned that the shortage to petrol stations and distributors throughout the country was an artificial shortage created by the petrol companies who were anxiously awaiting a huge increase in petrol prices and were therefore hoarding on the basis that the Minister would give in in the case of a crisis situation occurring.  In his Limerick speech the Minister also said that he had been under pressure to let oil <Col N="1059" /> prices rise and had been told that plenty of oil is available if one is willing to pay premium prices.  The Minister said that he would not acquisce to such pressure without a clear demonstration of the facts of the case being placed at his disposal, that some of these facts seldom emerge in the course of a public debate on oil prices, that the much publicised Rotterdam market and other spot markets accounted for as little as 5 per cent of the world's oil trade, that the major part of the world's oil business which some estimates put at 65 per cent was carried out on a contract basis and that this business was insulated from the worst excesses of rising spot market prices and often indirectly benefited from such movements.  The Minister also said that it should be remembered that some oil companies reported huge increases in profits when prices quadrupled in later 1973 and early 1974 following the oil embargo.  Finally he said:</P>
    <P>In truth I cannot allow the question of prices to dictate the availability of supplies and my Department have informed the oil companies that it is clearly their responsibility to ensure that Ireland gets a fair across the board allocation of oil products which should amount to about 95 per cent of our current requirements.</P>
    <P>The best estimate available to our Department at the moment on the question of oil supplies is that the overall shortfall is of the order of 5 per cent and that the outlook is for a gradual improvement. That is not to say, however, that no problem exists in regard to supplies. There is a problem but it is a problem which is of manageable proportions, given a sensible and prudent response by the public in their usage of energy.</P>
    <P>As regards the question raised by Deputy Tully in relation to the rationing of any oil product I think he would agree, as most sensible people would agree, that if the Minister were now to talk about rationing any oil products it would be fair to say it would cause a sort of panic situation and it would cause panic buying.  Panic buying is obviously <Col N="1060" /> the cause of shortages rather than any actual shortage being there.  There is no serious shortage at the moment as I have said and, therefore, people should not engage in panic buying.  Therefore, there is no question of rationing.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, rationing by the Minister would, of course, be a measure of last resort.  It would be cumbersome and difficult to administer quickly and could be justified only if supplies fell really short of our requirements.  As I said, that is not the case.  If Deputy Tully has specific complaints which he wishes to have brought to my attention, or to the attention of the Minister or the Department, they will be dealt with.  Let me remind him that in the past week or so, maybe ten days, many people have rung up with various complaints, whether they were ordinary members of the public, or people from our various institutions, or ordinary petrol retailers, and in each case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Tully talked about the matter the Minister raised of bringing in a £5 minimum petrol Order.  This is one of the options which would be <Col N="1062" /> considered by the Minister in the event of the situation becoming worse, or if he decided that a shortage situation demanded that such an order should be made.  The Minister has never been found wanting in this: if action needed to be taken he has always taken it.</P>

      <P>Uniform costing principles for railway undertakings, as established by EEC Regulation No. 2183/78, apply to international rail freight transport in full train loads with effect from 1 January 1979.  The calculation of costs is to be based primarily on the principle of variable costs.  There is also provision for calculating costs on a total cost basis and for the exchange of information in relation to costs between the participating undertakings on a confidential basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>At a meeting in June 1977 the EEC Council of Ministers decided that certain questions concerning civil aviation should be examined. The task of undertaking the examination was assigned to a working party on transport questions specially constituted for the study of questions concerning air transport.  The terms of reference were as follows:</P>
      <P> (1)  to identify those areas of Government activity in the field of air transport which would derive benefit from early attention within the Community framework and to draw up a priority list of items for examination,</P>
      <P>(2)  if necessary, to study what provisions the Council might adopt for air transport under Article 84 (2) of the Treaty of Rome,</P>
      <P>(3)  to examine what subjects the Council could ask the Commission to study in relation both to points (1) and (2) and to the application of the general provisions of the Treaty to Air Transport. </P>
      <P>The working party are pursuing their studies and Ireland has been represented at their meetings.  The Commission programme of work for 1979 states that it will, in the first half of this year, send to the Council a communication on the improvement of the general structure of civil aviation and the degree of competition in this sector in the Community. This communication is awaited.</P>
      <P>It would be premature at this stage to speculate on the implications for Ireland of any proposals which may emerge from these initiatives.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 20 February, 1979 the Council of Ministers (Transport) had before it a proposal for a Council directive on the limitation of noise emissions from subsonic aircraft.  The Council decided that the proposal needed further study.</P>

      <P>The respective roles of the institutions in the budgetary procedure are set out in the Treaties.</P>
      <P>The general difficulty which arose is that while amendments made by the Parliament to the draft budget stand accepted in Council if they are supported by at least 18 votes, any necessary overall increase in expenditure requires the support of 41 votes.  Thus there may be incompatibility between these two sets of voting.  The Council, therefore, in its discussion on this matter, considered ways and means of reorganising its internal procedure for considering Parliament's amendments to the draft budget, to ensure compatibility between its action on the amendments and the increase in expenditure which it is prepared to accept.</P>
      <P>The Budget Council, at its meeting on 22 March 1979 adopted a draft supplementary and amending budget which it is hoped will enable the 1979 budget to be implemented.  The draft supplementary and amending budget has now been forwarded to the European Parliament for its consideration.</P>
      <P>The Council also held an exchange of views on the internal procedure it will in future follow when examining amendments to the draft budget and when fixing the maximum rate of increase in expenditure. Eight delegations, including Ireland, undertook as far as the Council itself is concerned, to apply certain provisions with a view to establishing compatibility between the Council's attitude to the European Parliament's amendments and its attitude to the increasing of expenditure.  I have arranged to have the press release issued after the Council meeting giving a summary of the decisions taken and the text of the provisions referred to above tabled for the information of Deputies.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that these developments will resolve the problems referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed EEC directive on the quality of water for human consumption lays down standards for water supplied for drinking purposes and water used by the food and drink industries. The standards in the proposed EEC directive broadly correspond, with certain exceptions, to drinking water standards recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) which are already used as guidelines by local authorities in Ireland.  The proposed directive contains provisions which allow departures from the EEC standards involved to cater for exceptional geological or climatic conditions and other special circumstances.  Accordingly local authorities and public agencies concerned with the enforcement of food and drink standards should be able to ensure compliance with the requirements of the proposed directive.</P>
      <P>The EEC Council of Ministers agreed, in principle, on the proposed directive at a meeting on 19 December 1978 but the proposal has not yet been formally adopted by the Council.  The proposed directive will require the bringing into force by member states of any laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive within two years of the notification of its formal adoption.  The position in this country is such that it is expected that administrative arrangements will suffice.  The proposed directive will also require member states to ensure that the quality of water intended for human consumption complies with the relevant EEC standards within five years of such notification.</P>

Intervention by me in the case referred to by the Deputy would be inappropriate.  I understand however, from the agency that delays in the case <Col N="946" /> were due to the non-completion of the sale on the nominated date by the proposed purchaser and the nonpayment by him of moneys due for interest since that date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. G. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputies are referring to formal proposals by the Commission of the European Communities in relation to the harmonisation of social legislation in regard to road transport.  Certain proposals to make amendments and additions to the EEC Road Transport Regulation No. 543/69 (which provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the limitation of time spent driving, the timing and duration of breaks and rest periods), have been before the Council of Transport Ministers since 1976.  These proposals relate to the following matters:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P> (a)  a revised definition of the week for purposes of allowing the weekly <Col N="953" /> rest period of road transport workers;</P>
    <P>(b)  the introduction of rules for &ldquo;spreadovers&rdquo; which would regulate total working time of such workers, as compared with the present rules which relate primarily to driving time, daily and weekly rest periods and breaks;</P>
    <P>(c)  revised provisions for breaks;</P>
    <P>(d)  minimum annual leave for such workers; and</P>
    <P>(e)  reduction in frequency of the Annual Report on the Social Regulations.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>If the Deputies wish to have full details of the Commission's proposals some of which are very complex, I shall be glad to let them have them.</P>
    <P>While these proposals are still before the Council, there is no indication that any of them are likely to be adopted at an early date.  So far as Ireland is concerned we are, as Deputies are aware, in the process of &ldquo;phasing in&rdquo; the implementation of the existing social regulations, including the regulations relating to the tachograph, in the period up to 1 January 1981.</P>
