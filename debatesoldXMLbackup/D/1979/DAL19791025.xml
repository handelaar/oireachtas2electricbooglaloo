      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy get out of the wrong side of the bed this morning?  He seems to be unusually carnaptious. Taken together, they will provide us with a complete revision of the post-1922 landlord and tenant code and with the consolidation of that code to a very useful degree.</P>
      <P>Assuming that the Bill now before the House becomes law, the code will consist of three Ground Rents Acts, one of 1967 and the two of 1978 that I have just mentioned, the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971, which deals mainly with sporting leases, and the present measure, and will collectively be cited as the Landlord and Tenant Acts, 1967 to 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may fairly ask why a single consolidating measure is not before the House that would not only cover the <Col N="787" /> changes that are proposed in this Bill but that would also present the modern landlord and tenant code in a single enactment. The reason is twofold.  First, a degree of urgency attaches to one particular proposal in the Bill, with which I will be dealing in a few minutes, and this rules out the delay that a consolidating Bill would have involved, if only because of sheer size.  The Bill that is now before the House is already substantial enough. In the second place, the Landlord and Tenant Commission are still sitting.</P>
    <P>The changes in the law that the Bill proposes arise almost entirely from recommendations that have been made by the Commission and they may have further recommendations for changes in landlord and tenant law in the not too distant future.  This raises the possibility that further legislation may be necessary to bring to a conclusion the work of the commission in this area of the law.  In fact the commission, at the particular request of the Minister for Justice, recently examined certain specific matters that come within the scope of this Bill and I may have certain amendments to propose on the Committee Stage of the Bill, arising out of the findings of the commission in relation to those matters. Furthermore, the commission are currently concerned with a review of the pre-1922 statute law: in the main this is contained in the Landlord and Tenant Law Amendment Act, Ireland, 1860, known as Deasy's Act.  If the commission go on to recommend changes in Deasy's Act, the question of still further legislation would arise.  All in all, it is clear that we are not yet at the stage where the work of consolidating all the statute law of landlord and tenant can be tackled, and any consolidating Bill that might now be proposed would still be an interim measure.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, what we have before us goes a considerable distance as a consolidation measure.  Because the subject matter is necessarily of some complexity, I will deal in a general way only with the proposals in the Bill and with its background.  Its purpose is to up-date the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931 and the <Col N="788" /> Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958 on the basis of changes that have been recommended by the Landlord and Tenant Commission. Purely as a matter of consolidation, certain provisions of the Rent Restrictions Acts and of the 1963 Planning Act are also involved.</P>
    <P>The subject matter of the Bill extends to two main areas.  One area concerns the terms and conditions attaching to the renewal of occupational tenancies and to the award to a departing occupational tenant of compensation for improvements he may have made&mdash;this is the area covered by the Act of 1931.  The other area concerns the renewal of ground rent leases&mdash;this is the area covered by the Act of 1958.</P>
    <P>The Bill, of course, originated in the Seanad and has been passed by that House with two amendments, both of which were of a drafting nature.  I should acknowledge here the painstaking examination that the Bill received in the course of its passage through the House. I would also like to acknowledge the hard work and the dedication of the Senators who helped in giving that phase of the Bill its present legal purity.  I refer particularly to Senators Alexis FitzGerald, Molony and Cooney, with assistance, from time to time, from other Senators.  I should also like to acknowledge the work of the Landlord and Tenant Commission whose recommendations give rise to the main changes in the law that are proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The background to the Bill is the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931.  The code of law we are concerned with could perhaps be said to have begun, not with the Act of 1931, but with the Town Tenants Act of 1906, which marked the first occasion on which legislative recognition was given to the claims of tenants of premises to have a measure of statutory protection.  However, the Act of 1906 was rather limited in its effects and the Act of 1931, which replaced it, was the real beginning of the modern landlord and tenant code.  That Act marked a watershed in the regulation of the relations between landlords and tenants. <Col N="789" /> It effectually recognised that the landlord and tenant relationship is one in which both parties have rights beyond the rights that are recognised in the contract of tenancy and that the tenant's rights should not be taken simply to disappear on the expiration of his tenancy. The Act conferred on tenants the right to a renewal of their tenancies.  In the context of landlord and tenant legislation such a renewal tenancy is referred to as a &ldquo;new tenancy&rdquo; where an occupational tenancy is concerned.  Where the renewal is the renewal of a ground rent lease the renewed lease is referred to as a &ldquo;reversionary lease&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before the passing of the 1931 Act, an urban tenant had no legal right to remain on in his property after his lease had expired and the landlord was entitled to recover possession even where the tenant had constructed the buildings himself, that is to say, even where a ground rent lease was involved.  The 1931 Act gave rights to tenants both in the case of ground rent tenancies, where the tenant himself had constructed or paid for the buildings, and in the case of occupational tenancies, where he had not. The rights given to ground rent leases under the 1931 Act were later extended by the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.</P>
    <P>Since some of the expressions which fall to be used in the course of this discussion, such as those I have just touched on, may be less than self-explanatory, perhaps a few further words of explanation may be useful.  An &ldquo;occupational tenancy&rdquo;, which may arise by way of a lease or any other form of agreement, is one where the landlord owns the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest, for example, a tenancy of a business premises or of a shop.  In such a case the landlord may or may not also own the ground on which the buildings stand. The tenant has not a claim to the ownership either of the buildings or of the ground and his interest is related primarily to his occupation of the premises.  The rent charged in such cases is, of course, higher than a ground rent <Col N="790" /> and is commonly called an &ldquo;occupational rent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The other kinds of tenancies with which this Bill is concerned could be grouped together under the general description of &ldquo;ground rent tenancies&rdquo;. The rent charged&mdash;a &ldquo;ground rent&rdquo;&mdash;is lower than an occupational rent and reflects the fact that the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo; interest in these cases belongs to the tenant, by virtue of his having either erected the buildings or of having paid for them.  The 1931 and 1958 Acts identified ground rent leases under the categories of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; in its simplest form is a lease under which the landlord leases the tenant a plot of land with a covenant in the lease that the tenant will build a house on the land.  There may, of course, be a number of variations of such an arrangement.  A &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; is a sub-lease under a building lease under which the sub-lessee in effect pays for the buildings on the property.  The Act of 1958 had already identified so many different categories of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; that these categories had become somewhat unwieldly, even before a number of new kinds of &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; were identified by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  One of the purposes of the 1978 No. 2 Ground Rents Act was to extend the right to purchase the fee simple to the lessees under these different kinds of ground rent leases, and it has done so under a much simplified classification. This gives the opportunity, which is taken in this Bill, of simplifying also the law relating to the grant of a reversionary lease&mdash;that is, a renewed building or proprietary lease as at present contained in the Acts of 1958 and 1971, and of dropping the expression &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; as they have already been dropped in relation to the acquisition of the fee simple in the 1978 No. 2 Act.</P>
    <P>I think I should make it clear at this point that while we will in Part III of this Bill be dealing with ground rent leases, we will not be concerned directly with leasehold enfranchisement or the <Col N="791" /> purchase of ground rents.  These matters are the subject of the 1978 No. 2 Act; what we are concerned with in this Bill is the renewal of expired ground rent leases and the general law of covenants in leases.  The 1978 No. 2 Act represents the Government's considered response to the ground rents problem and I do not envisage any proposals for substantial changes in the foreseeable future in the system of acquisition of the fee simple that was introduced by that Act.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the main changes in the law which are being proposed in the Bill stem for the most part from recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  I will deal first with the changes that are proposed in Parts I, II and IV of the Bill and that are of concern to occupational tenants, that is, those who do not own the &ldquo;bricks and mortar&rdquo;.  The right to a new tenancy is being given to business tenants of three years' standing in all cases, regardless of the term for which the existing tenancy was granted, and this right is also being given even where there has been an unforeseen or unplanned temporary break in business use during the three years, if the court considers it reasonable to disregard that break.</P>
    <P>At present, business tenants who hold on less than yearly tenancy, or on a lease for a term of less than a year, must show not only three years' continuous business use prior to the termination of their existing tenancies but also continuous occupation during the seven years preceding that termination, in order to have the right to a new tenancy. This change is being proposed in Part II of the Bill.  Furthermore, in Part I of the Bill the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; is being widened to include cultural, charitable and sporting organisations, while it is also being made clear in the same context that local authorities may acquire rights as business tenants.</P>
    <P>The provision enabling a temporary break in business use to be disregarded is designed to prevent tenants from being excluded from the right to a new tenancy because of a casual break arising from such causes as illness, fire damage or <Col N="792" /> structural alterations.  On the other hand, the Bill does not propose to prevent parties from making arrangements that are expressly designed to be, and to remain, outside the scope of this legislation.  Such arrangements outside the scope of the legislation may of course be made under the law as it stands, as a recent decision of the Supreme Court has made clear.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should make the point that this Bill, like the Act of 1931, must leave room for arrangements where rights of renewal do not accrue; must take account, that is, of circumstances where no letting arrangement at all can be contemplated if renewal rights are to be raised.  One such circumstance, for example, is the case of shop concessions within hotel premises where the hotel proprietor for obvious reasons must be in control of the situation &mdash; he must for instance be in a position to insist on a certain standard of service since otherwise his own business suffers.</P>
    <P>Another type of occupational tenant, apart from the business tenant, is the tenant of living accommodation.  In this regard, a further change that is proposed in the Bill is that an occupational tenant is being given the right to a new tenancy of a dwelling after 20 years' continuous occupation by himself or by his predecessors in title.  This entitlement is sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;long occupation equity&rdquo;.  At present, there must be 30 years' continuous occupation without any sale of the tenant's interest during that period.</P>
    <P>In addition, provisions are being included in the Bill to ensure that a tenant, whether a business tenant or otherwise, will not inadvertently lose the right to a new tenancy through failure to claim that new tenancy within the time-limits provided: the onus will be on the landlord to give notice of the termination of the previous tenancy and the tenant's right to claim a new tenancy will survive until after that notice has been given.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important single area of change that is proposed in the Bill relates to the terms on which a new tenancy will be granted where those terms fall to be fixed by the court in the <Col N="793" /> absence of agreement between the parties. At present, where the court fixes the terms of a new tenancy that tenancy is normally for a 21-year term: under the Bill it will be for 35 years unless the tenant opts for a shorter term.  In addition, the rent on renewal under the Bill will be subject to review at the instance of either the landlord or the tenant at intervals of five years instead of remaining unaltered throughout the term of the new tenancy. Although the Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended at the time they made their first report the introduction of rent reviews at seven-year intervals to cater for the inflationary situation and the longer terms now proposed, it is much more usual nowadays in tenancies negotiated between landlords and tenants to have reviews at intervals of five years or even less.  Hence reviews at intervals of five years are proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The present state of the law in this area is satisfactory neither to landlord nor to tenant.  The decision of the Supreme Court given in 1977 in the case of Byrne <i>v.</i> Loftus means, in effect, that while the tenant can obtain the grant of a new tenancy for a 21-year term at a fixed rent, that rent may nevertheless be very high at the time it is fixed.  It is higher, and it may be very much higher, than it would be under a tenancy that provided for reviews of the rent at regular intervals and accordingly that fixed rent may represent a real burden on the tenant.  Consequently a change in the law to provide for periodic reviews of the rent where a new tenancy is granted is something to which a degree of urgency attaches.</P>
    <P>A further change that is proposed relates to the time when a new tenancy may be obtained.  Under the 1931 Act the right to a new tenancy can arise only in or about the time of termination of the previous tenancy.  It is now proposed that a new tenancy may be claimed and granted as soon as the necessary conditions are satisfied, although the new tenancy is not to commence until the existing tenancy has terminated.  This <Col N="794" /> should have important benefits in terms of security of tenure.</P>
    <P>Other proposals, in Part IV of the Bill, concern changes in the law relating to the procedure to be followed where a tenant wishes to carry out improvements and where he is to qualify for compensation for those improvements in the event that he is leaving the premises when his tenancy terminates.  At present an occupational tenant is not entitled to such compensation where he has failed to serve an improvement notice on his landlord. The Bill proposes that compensation be allowed even where that notice has not been served, provided certain conditions are satisfied, of which the one I may mention is a condition that the landlord has not been prejudiced by non-service. It is also proposed that a tenant should be empowered to carry out improvements even where the landlord objects, except where the landlord is due to recover possession of the premises within the following five years.</P>
    <P>Certain changes of a somewhat technical nature are proposed in Part I of the Bill whose effect will be to extend the right to a new occupational tenancy to Government Departments, to certain business tenants outside urban areas and to business tenants of housing authorities, as well as to persons who in certain cases have not at present the right to a new tenancy by reason of having formed a private company or a trading company to carry on the business.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill, as I have indicated, contains the provisions dealing with the right of a tenant to carry out improvements and with compensation for improvements. Part IV of the Bill also proposes, in section 60, a new provision that is designed to facilitate re-development in the case of worn-out buildings or in the case of areas that are in need of re-development.  This is a proposal to enable a landlord, subject to certain stringent conditions, to terminate an occupational tenancy so as to regain possession, before the lease expires, of buildings that are obsolete or that are in an obsolete area as defined in the Planning <Col N="795" /> Acts.  It can happen occasionally that a sitting tenant in such a building will not give up possession except for exorbitant compensation, or cannot be induced to move at all.  In this way he can hold up re-development or reconstruction schemes for whole areas.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant Commission gave close attention to this problem and came to the conclusion that in such a situation a limited right to terminate a tenancy should be given, although only under the most stringent conditions.  Accordingly the Bill proposes to allow the court to order the termination of a tenancy, with safeguards for the tenant such as to ensure against abuse of the provision.  In the first place it must be reasonable to make the order terminating the tenancy.  In addition the relevant tenancy must have not less than three years and not more than 25 years to run.  Compensation must be paid for loss of the tenancy and for any further hardship to the tenant.</P>
    <P>Additional compensation is provided for the tenant in the form of a share of the financial benefit that accrues to the landlord from obtaining possession of the property.  At least six months' notice of termination must be given to the tenant and every termination order would be subject to a stay of one year.  In every case the landlord will be required to have a development scheme that includes the property and for which planning permission has been granted, and either the buildings themselves must be obsolete or they must be in an obsolete area as defined in the 1963 Planning Act.</P>
    <P>I need not, I think, enlarge at too great length on the proposals in Part III of the Bill which concerns reversionary leases, that is, renewals of ground rent leases. This area of the law is at present covered in the main by the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958.  The proposals in Part III of the Bill involve two main changes in this area of the law. One of these changes I have already mentioned, that is that the expressions &ldquo;building lease&rdquo; and &ldquo;proprietary lease&rdquo; are being abandoned in favour of the simplified classification of ground rent <Col N="796" /> leases that is set out in the No. 2 Ground Rents Act of 1978: this is the significance of the references to the No. 2 Act that appear in section 30 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The other main change is that the right to a reversionary lease is being extended to all the classes of ground rent lessees who have the right to purchase the fee simple under the 1978 No. 2 Ground Rents Act.  This includes not only the classes of lessees who have that right under the Acts of 1958 and 1971 but also the additional classes of lessees who are given the right to purchase the fee simple by the Ground Rents Acts of 1967 and 1978.  The reason for the extension is, of course, that we cannot have certain classes of ground rent lessees who have the right to a reversionary lease and certain other classes who do not.</P>
    <P>The alternative to that extension would be to abolish the right to a reversionary lease altogether and to leave ground rent lessees with the right of purchase only.  However, it would be wrong, in principle, to take away the alternative right to a reversionary lease from those classes of lessees who already have that right under the Acts of 1958 and 1971.  It would put those lessees in the position of being compelled to buy out the fee simple in order to preserve their security in their properties and, as was made clear in the course of the debates on the 1978 No. 2 Ground Rents Act, it was never the intention to compel ground rent lessees to purchase. Such lessees are being left with their freedom of choice.</P>
    <P>Part V re-enacts with drafting changes the provisions in Part VI of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, which provide certain reliefs for tenants against covenan in leases of tenements.  The expression &ldquo;tenement&rdquo; is defined in section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill, which contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, calls for comment at this stage only in relation to two matters.  One of these is section 70 of the Bill.  Section 70 <Col N="797" /> proposes that ground rent tenants of the State should have the right to buy out the fee simple of their dwellinghouses under the purchase scheme provided by the No. 2 Ground Rents Act of 1978, subject only to the public interest.  The same right is also being given to ground rent tenants; who hold under leases given by a harbour authority or by the Commissioners of Irish Lights and who have not that right under the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>Ground rents of dwellinghouses held from the State or from the other bodies I have mentioned did present a difficulty at the time last year's ground rents legislation was in progress and the Minister for Justice expressed his intention at that time of finding an acceptable solution.  What the Bill proposes is that ground rent tenants who hold their dwellinghouses from the State, or from one of the other bodies I have mentioned, shall have the right to buy out the fee simple except where the State authority concerned is satisfied that acquisition of the fee simple by the ground rent tenant would not in a particular case be in the public interest and where the State authority certifies accordingly.</P>
    <P>The other matter I should mention in connection with Part VI of the Bill is that section 60 of the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1931 is not being re-enacted.  Section 60 of the 1931 Act provides for the grant of long leases of building ground in certain circumstances.  The section is highly complicated.  No case under its provisions has ever been brought before the courts.  The section appears to have been devised originally rather as a means of bringing derelict land into development than as a regulator of relations between landlords and tenants.  As such it has no proper place at all in landlord and tenant legislation.  At all events, since the section has never operated, it is better that its complicated provisions be removed from the law.</P>
    <P>The foregoing are the main changes that the Bill proposes.  A number of lesser changes are also proposed and Deputies will, I trust, agree that it will be <Col N="798" /> appropriate to deal with these as they arise on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to refer to one matter on the subject of which I gave an undertaking to the Seanad during the Bill's passage through that House.  That matter is the position of the State under the Bill, which is dealt with in section 4.  This was, in fact, the topic which gave rise to the keenest debate in the Seanad.  An amendment was moved in that House which sought to delete section 4 from the Bill, and that amendment was withdrawn on foot of an undertaking by me to re-examine the position before proceeding with the Bill in this House.  This I have done.  As a result of that examination I may be moving an amendment on Committee Stage to cater for tenants of the State in one particular situation.  It is fair to say that the credit for that must go to Senator Alexis FitzGerald, who was concerned with the position of tenants as outlined by him on that occasion.  It is my intention to move an amendment to take care of the problems he raised.  Apart from this, however, no change in the section as it stands is either necessary or desirable.  I think that some Members of the Seanad were genuinely under the impression that section 4 of the Bill is an innovation in the law.  I would emphasise that it is not: it is simply declaratory of the position in law as that position has been understood since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I have already suggested that this Bill is itself a tribute to the work of the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice I wish now to pay tribute formally to the members of the Commission and in particular to their esteemed Chairman, Mr. Justice Conroy, whose work during the past quarter of a century and more in the area of the landlord and tenant code has become almost legendary.</P>
    <P>The commission will, I expect, proceed with their general examination of both the non-statutory and statutory provisions of landlord and tenant law.  I look forward to a successful conclusion to the Commission's work with the <Col N="799" /> prospect in due course of a major Bill which will propose a comprehensive, modern code of landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and ask that it be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to deal with legislation and issues affecting landlords and tenants.  I welcome with slightly less alacrity some aspects of this Bill.  The Bill is not merely about those issues contained within its various sections; it is also about issues and elements which are omitted.  The proposed legislation is in many respects a missed opportunity.  Some of the sections are worthy of commendation but one gets the impression of a Bill which is, apart from being technical, slight in its impact on this area, a Bill which is not fundamentally relevant to the major issues presently of concern to both landlords and tenants.  Therefore, it is of doubtful impact in relation to the totality of this problem.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Bill is the third and final instalment of the trilogy of measures giving effect to the Government's present thinking in relation to this area and that it tends to act as the final chapter on the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978 and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a gentleman and he has been very courteous in respect of the contributions made by Members of the Seanad.  I do not wish to lower the tone of the debate but feel obliged to say that the Minister was categoric when he referred in the Seanad and in this House to &ldquo;this final instalment of legislation for the foreseeable future&rdquo;.  One, therefore, gets the impression that the Minister is not thinking of further proposals in this area.  I find that a little surprising in view of certain contracts and commitments entered into not too long ago which, if carried out, would have a major and beneficial effect in this area.  It is germane to say that some of these commitments which are not going to be enacted could only be considered as missed opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> For example, I refer to a letter circlated on 7 June 1977 to the various interest groups, notably the National Flat Dwellers' Association, which made certain promises.  I am disappointed that these promises have not been kept and there is no indication that they are likely to be kept.  The letter reads:</P>
    <P>It is our view that legislation should be enacted to provide protection for tenants of flats or houses, but at the same time to ensure that landlords do get a fair return on their investment....</P>
    <P>That is very fair.  This letter was written by Senator Eoin Ryan, who was the national director of elections for Fianna Fáil who were then in opposition.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>We would be in favour of setting up tribunals to which the Landlord and the Tenant could have recourse for the purpose of fixing fair rents and deciding disputes between the parties.</P>
    <P>A reference on page 2 of the letter, which would be accepted as being wise and sensible, reads:</P>
    <P>We are totally opposed to discrimination against tenants on the grounds of marital status, colour, religion or sex.</P>
    <P>We are accordingly basically in favour of your suggestion for the charter of rights and we are prepared to introduce appropriate legislation in this field.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is nothing equivocal about that statement.  The charter of rights referred to contains eight points as follows:</P>
    <P>1.  Legislation to be enacted granting tenants of private rented accommodation security of tenure.</P>
    <P>2.  Illegal eviction and harassment of tenants to be made a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>3.  The establishment of statutory minimum standards for the letting of rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>4.  Neutral Tribunals to be established with statutory powers to arbitrate <Col N="801" /> in landlord tenant disputes on application, with power to make binding rulings.</P>
    <P>5.  Tribunals to have power to fix fair rents and to rule on validity of Notice-to-Quit issued by landlords.</P>
    <P>6.  Legislation to be enacted preventing discrimination against tenants on grounds of marital status, children, occupation, nationality, religion or sex.</P>
    <P>7.  The immediate enactment of legislation enforcing uniform safety standards for private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>8.  The recognition by the ESB and the Gas Companies of all private tenants as consumers, who enjoy the same right registered consumers have of direct dealings with the ESB and the Gas Companies.</P>
    <P>Again the paragraph said that the Government are basically in favour of the suggestion for the charter of rights. Would the Minister indicate whether or not there are proposals presently on the stocks for the introduction of legislation which would bring these unequivocal comments about?  If there are not, then I must suggest to him that the pledge&mdash;which was certainly effective politically but, more important than that, was a positive, progressive list of helpful suggestions in this area&mdash;and the way in which it was presented could only be considered to be a massive deceit and that it was not the intention of the Government to introduce that legislation. Any evidence that we have to date indicates that it is not, because on the occasion when the Labour Party, supported by ourselves, brought forward a proposal for this independent tribunal the Government voted unanimously against it.  So I am a little dubious about the extent to which we will see further action in this area.  I suggest that the finality of the Minister's speech certainly does not allow for the likelihood of legislation in the near future in these areas and they are important omissions. <Col N="802" /> What the Minister has said tends to negative and undo to some extent a lot of the good work and presumed good intentions of the Government and that is extremely regrettable.</P>
    <P>I will be able to show in my remarks that the Bill is largely cosmetic and tinkers with a major and growing social area of basic need without any likelihood of bringing about the kind of change we all want.  One of the major effects would be to liberalise the commercial landlord and tenant law by making it easier for business tenants to obtain new tenancies on reasonable terms.  Section 5, subsections 2, 3 and 4 and also section 13, subsections 1, 2 and 3 of the Bill refer to this.  There can be no doubt that one of the by-products of this legislation will be to complete the process of dismantling rent control initiated by Fianna Fáil in the 1960 and 1967 Rent Acts.  Section 60 refers to this and I intend to deal with that later.  It seems that this section can be used by landlords to secure vacant possession from all tenants presently protected by the Rent Acts and a close examination of the protection which a tenant might have in those circumstances is not of great consolation.  The compensation referred to and the various protective measures are very likely to be passed on to those who benefit from the development which would take place in the context of the vacant possession achieved by utilising this section.</P>
    <P>The Bill itself is worded in a manner which tends to make it difficult to distinguish between residential and business tenants.  I do not know whether there is any degree of deliberateness about that but I would hope there is not.  The easiest method of distinguishing between them is by reference to provisions for leases. Business tenants are normally on fixed leases.  Residential tenants are not; a specific provision is made for renewal of leases.  The Minister has an opportunity here because of the likelihood that this is going to be the last word we are going to hear for some time in this chamber on landlord and tenant legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Obviously I must have touched a raw nerve somewhere.  I am very familiar with the Bill drawn up by the Minister for Justice at the time, Mr. Cooney.  Times have changed since then. More important than that, certain promises and commitments were entered into and were hawked around the flats in the Rathmines area by Deputy Briscoe and his colleagues to great effect.

      <P>I look forward to a successful conclusion to the commission's work with the prospect in due course of a major Bill which will propose a comprehensive, modern code of landlord and tenant law.</P>
      <P>when in the introduction he referred to the problems of delay implicit in such a major Bill.  I would not consider it a recipe for instant legislation and certainly the problems posed by major Bills which were referred to both in the Seanad and here did not inhibit the very rapid publication of the promises mentioned by me earlier on.  There is a time for equivocating and a time for not equivocating.  All I can say is that I am disappointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of the pattern unfortunately.  I only hope that when we get the chance on that side of the House&mdash;which I hope will not be long more&mdash;we will deliver on those things that we promise now.  I mean that.  It is in the interests of the people.  It is a shameful exercise for politicians of any party to make promises that they do not deliver on and the example set by this Government is exceptional in that regard.  Never was so much promised to so many and never was so little delivered.  This is only one area where there are 350,000 tenants in private rented accommodation, the vast majority of whom never got the benefit of the rates abolition and for whom this Bill is not in any way helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make a couple of suggestions which I would ask the Minister to consider. I believe, as does the National Flatdwellers Association and the Private <Col N="805" /> Landlords Association, that the time has come to introduce a proposal which would allow the rent payable by tenants in private rented accommodation to be offset in part or in whole against income tax.  The benefits of such a proposal are very many and would help the Minister for example in achieving at least a good statistical base for the kind of legislation which is before us.  I will show in a minute that the base we have and the research that has been done on this Bill is inadequate in that respect based on the 1977 census.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to get into inadequacies, I do not know what income tax relief has to do with this Bill.  It is utterly irrelevant.  It is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entitled to discuss what he thinks might be in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to dwell on it.  I just want to make suggestions which are meant constructively and they may reflect a wider vision of this problem than the Minister has at this stage.  It reflects my concern with ensuring that we are aware that all landlords and all tenants are somehow known about, that they are on one central register, that we can legislate for them in the light of all the available facts.  At present part of the problem is that we do not even know how many tenants and landlords there are and this is one way of finding out.  There are other advantages relating to the offsetting of rent against income tax and, for what it is worth, this party would wish to see that done and if we get the opportunity we will do so for all the positive advantages which both the tenants and the landlords both accept at this stage.  I say also, as a corollary to this, that there should therefore be and will be enabled to be, without any great Exchequer revenue being siphoned away, a major grants package for landlords to improve their properties, because the Bill refers in whole or in part to various calibres of <Col N="806" /> property in the cities and towns.  The Minister is well aware, as is everybody, that there are grey areas here of major dissatisfaction.</P>
      <P>In many respects this is the Cinderella area of the housing sector and it is not realistic for the Minister to pretend that this is essentially a matter for Justice and exclusively a matter for reform.  It is also a matter relating to housing stock.  I believe we can facilitate landlords in improving their property by offering the kind of rewards and incentives which are apparently quite acceptable in the private housing sector or the local authority sector, where subsidies of various kinds are paid.  To the tenant and landlord there are none, with the single exception of the £600 improvement grant.  I am asking for a fund of about £30 million or £40 million, which money would already be in hand due to the new insights which the Revenue Commissioners would have from the offsetting of rent against income tax.</P>
      <P>There should be strict enforcement of landlord registration, yet this is not mentioned in the Bill.  How can one relate in a legislative matter to an area where we shy away even from maintaining the basic standards which are necessary and acquiring the basic information?  It is not too much to ask that such a measure should be included in the Bill.  Is it that we are afraid of what would happen if we tried to enforce the fairly meagre standards which are there already?</P>
      <P>There should be stronger provisions covering security of tenure.  We are all familiar with areas where people are extremely mobile and migration from one area to another is often reflected in a type of social malaise in that people do not keep their houses in the best fashion and there is a breakdown of community spirit.  People do not have a great commitment to their area because they do not believe they will be there for a great length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interests of landlord and tenant are not mutually exclusive.  They are compatible with each other and there should be harmony in this area.  Up to now the State has been the tenant as being <Col N="807" /> in a kind of twilight area, perhaps, between marriage and the acquisition of a house.  The attention of this Government has been largely concerned&mdash;and rightly so in many respects&mdash;to ensure the maximum number of privately owned houses.  There are, however, people who for one reason or another decide to live in private rented accommodation and will do so indefinitely.  We must introduce a set of conditions and standards according to which they will be treated as they are entitled and not as birds of passage.  The latter attitude is reflected in this Bill and in other such legislation.  There should be statutory minimum safety and other standards for the letting of accommodation and equality of treatment by the various supply services, such as those mentioned in the charter of rights to which glib commitments were made in June 1977 by the present Government, then in Opposition.</P>
    <P>We believe legislation should be introduced outlawing discrimination in this area on the grounds of family size, colour or creed.  The Minister will not deny that it is little short of a social scandal that there is at present major discrimination against people simply because they have children.  I know that landlords have problems in regard to families because they can cause more difficulties, but it is surely unacceptable in our society that a person having a child or two children is discriminated against <i>per se</i>?  A process of checks and balances could be operated whereby that discrimination would be outlawed and the landlord would be compensated to the extent compatible with recognition of what families in occupancy mean in terms of cost.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that coloured students are treated in an inequitable fashion by some people.  It is only fair to say that there are thousands of landlords and landladies who deal in a fair, just and Christian fashion with people who come to the door.  Often law is a reaction to a crisis and in this case the Government have said that they are unequivocally opposed to this type of discrimination. I want to know if we will see <Col N="808" /> some action.  Such a move would be hailed as just and wise and would not entail any capital expenditure or great outpouring of revenue.  It would be a commitment to social justice.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of increasing the number of private rented units and I would ask the Minister to recognise the need to build blocks of flats containing small units, perhaps in traditional flat dwelling areas.  I do not see any reason why local authorities should be disbarred in this area.  Presumably such developments would be revenue generating and this would assist the local authorities in social housing.  It appears at present that the cream of the market is taken by one sector of the community and the local authorities carry the can for difficult areas.  Some attention to the landlord and tenant area in the context of housing stock and housing policy is fundamental. This is not an isolated case which can be dealt with on its own; it is part of the housing programme.</P>
    <P>There are trends on the Continent which indicate that we may have a situation in which more and more people will not see a flat in terms of a short-term occupancy while looking for a home.  There are many people who want to live in flats.  I am told we have the highest rate of home ownership in Europe.  This is a good thing and anyone who wishes to buy a home should be encouraged.  We should not, however, be lax in our standards in relation to people who wish to live in flats.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant Commission have been sitting since 1951 and I join the Minister in saying that their contribution in this area is extremely useful. I am at variance with the Minister when he appears to indicate that the general thrust and commitment of Government policy and the vision which permeates this is somehow related to any deliberations which the commission may have.  I would not like to see a commission used, as has been the case in the past, as an excuse for inaction or inertia.  The Minister must govern, not just adjudicate on options presented by commissions at unspecified times.  He must face up to his <Col N="809" /> responsibilities now and make decisions which he believes to be right.  The commission may help in that job but it would be unacceptable to wait an indefinite length of time for deliberations, which might not be in the form the Minister desires, before action would be taken. We should get away from the idea of using commissions, review bodies and boards of inquiry as a crutch for inaction. There is a little of that thinking here, particularly when we visualise the amount of legislative attention given to this area since 1951.  It might be psychologically harmful to the presumed desire of the Government for action in this area that we have a commission who have not been given a final date by which they should report or on which they should expire.</P>
    <P>Some bodies&mdash;not this one, perhaps&mdash;tend to perpetuate themselves beyond the time when they may be necessary.  The work this commission is doing is good and is useful and I do not wish it to be used in this House, particularly when the commission cannot defend themselves as an excuse for omissions or for lack of inspiration or insight on the opposite side.  Such commitments were no problem two years ago.</P>
    <P>None of the essential items I have referred to, and which are the major causes of concern in this area, has been dealt with in the Bill.  That is regrettable. The Minister has an opportunity here to reconsider the matter and, if necessary, to introduce other legislation at an early date.  Perhaps he would be good enough to refer to that point when he is replying.</P>
    <P>There are strong reasons for believing that the research that went into the background of the Bill, both qualitative and quantitative, was inadequate because apparently it is the final instalment of a trilogy of legislation which I assume was meant to deal comprehensively with this area.  It does not deal with the central issues and some of the underlying assumptions on a statistical level are of dubious calibre.  For instance, if one considers the question of the supply of dwellings and the use of the 1971 <Col N="810" /> Census and its definition of a housing unit, one will see that the housing unit referred to is a self-contained individual dwelling.  That is used as a statistical base for the thinking behind the Bill.  Unfortunately, the housing unit of the 1971 Census is no longer the predominant social feature in this area.  Most of the housing units now are multi-dwelling units where there are bed-sitters and a number of flats.  The size of the problem may be greater than we expect and the indications are that that is the case.</P>
    <P>Recently we heard of crises in relation to student accommodation and the 1979 Census indicated we were out of line in this area.  I believe the scale of the problem is much more substantial than the Minister may think, due to the lack of accurate statistical information available to him.  The fact is that the supply of flat accommodation is not keeping pace with demand, and if we look at the figures that are available we will see that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the supply of rented accommodation, in 1946 there were 161,092 unfurnished dwellings.  This figure fell to just over 100,000 in 1961 and to 65,000 in 1971.  The reasons for that are not difficult to establish.  There was an increase in the number of furnished dwellings from approximately 12,000 in 1946 to nearly 16,000 in 1961 and to almost 32,000 in 1971.  Obviously the rent implications there are germane.  The total stock has fallen certainly in relation to the growth in population and the development in the area of private rented accommodation has been allowed to go ahead on a free-wheeling basis as if it was just a question of pure <i>laissez-faire</i> economics when, in fact, it is an intrinsic and essential part of housing policy, or at least should be.  People who live in flats are living in their homes.  The State has certain obligations here and it is not good enough for us to refuse to face up to them.  The State has tried to face up to them in the local authority sector, and in the private sector various commitments have been entered into and financial resources have been applied.  However, this has been the Cinderella area and that must be changed.  It must be considered <Col N="811" /> as an essential part of the total housing policy.</P>
    <P>Total private rented accommodation as a percentage of the total stock has fallen dramatically from 30 per cent in 1946, to 21 per cent in 1961 and to 15 per cent at present.  Obviously, some of this is due to the healthy development that more people are buying their own homes, but much of it is due to other reasons.  One of those reasons is that it is more difficult to get private rented accommodation. There is not enough available and standards may have declined, because where the resource is scarce there will be a more casual approach by Government with regard to the implementation of standards.  At present it is a backwater and that should be changed.  On the other hand, having regard to our increasing population and the question of emigration&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been waiting for the Deputy to deal with the Bill.  He is dealing with the question of housing generally and it is not relevant at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair.  I merely wanted to say that the Bill does not deal with the issues because it does not have the insight that is necessary.  Private rented accommodation is a major area of concern and this Bill does little about it.  The effect of the Bill will be to finalise the decontrolling of rents and I refer the House to section 60. The Conroy Commission indicated that, if anything, rent control should be extended. Presumably the details of the Bill will be discussed on Committee Stage and I do not intend now to go into the matter in too much detail.  The effect of the provisions in the Bill will be that a landlord can obtain vacant possession more easily.  In section 60 (5) the compensation is a question of monetary award which, I have no doubt, will be seen as a charge or a cost to be passed on to whoever takes up the development.</P>
      <P>Whether one is for or against decontrol is not fundamentally important.  We just want to know what will be the effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> If the effect is to terminate by 1981 decontrol in areas that are presently controlled, we should know about it.  It should not be done almost by nondeliberate subterfuge; I presume that is not the intention.  We have here a substantial windfall for the landlord.  I am not against windfalls for anybody but we must also be concerned about security of tenure.  I do not see that in the Bill.  There are one or two references to it but they refer largely to tenants who are fairly well established.  What will happen to tenants who are on very short leases?  The vast majority have such leases but there is no concern for them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the supply of furnished and unfurnished accommodation, one sees that there is a major social and economic problem that is not being dealt with.  In that respect this Bill is a thing of little substance.  The question should be whether in two to four years this and the other two Bills will have made a significant difference in all the areas involved.  I do not think there will be any such change because the Bill avoids the main issues.</P>
    <P>I have explained that there has been a large percentage drop in the furnished and unfurnished dwellings available.  The demand for housing has increased significantly in the past ten or 15 years with a rise in the number of households from 676,000 in 1961 to 726,000 in 1971.  A recent estimate of population trends carried out by a Mr. T. Keating of the Central Statistics Office indicated that, in the absence of a renewal of emigration, the population could rise. We know from the recent census that that is almost certain to be the case. Therefore, the Bill should do something positive to encourage the creation of more private rented accommodation and to encourage certain standards for both landlord and tenant, so that the landlord will have a certain return on his investment and the tenant will have certain standards in relation to security of tenure and type of accommodation. These basic issues are causing concern, but the Bill before us does not show any concern for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> This morning the Minister in his introductory remarks interposed a paragraph which he did not refer to in the Seanad.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>I think I should make it clear at this point that, while we will in Part III of this Bill be dealing with ground rent leases, we will not be concerned directly with leasehold enfranchisement or the purchase of ground rents.  These matters are the subject of the 1978 No. 2 Act; what we are concerned with in the Bill is the renewal of expired ground rent leases and the general law of covenants in leases. The 1978 No. 2 Act represents the Government's considered response to the ground rents problem and I do not envisage any proposals for substantial changes in the forseeable future in the system of acquisition of the fee simple that was introduced by that Act.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad the Minister said at column 461 that:</P>
    <P>It was never the intention that ground rent legislation should manoeuvre tenants into the position of being forced to exercise their rights of purchase.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <P>Will the Deputy give full reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1979, as debated on 7 March 1979, at column 461 of the Seanad Official Report for that date.  None of us would want anyone to be forced into doing anything but the Minister knows the meaning of language as well as I, and the proposal or commitment of the Government in the manifesto was that the Government would introduce a scheme which would lead to the abolition of ground rents.  That was a positive, unequivocal, unambiguous statement&mdash;that it would lead to the abolition of ground rents.  That is not being done and the Minister in his comments in the Seanad clearly said that he accepts that this will not do away with ground rents, because they do not want to force people into it. <Col N="814" /> The commitment in the manifesto does not allow for the existence of ground rents after a certain length of time.  This is evidence again of double standards. By the reference the Minister made in his speech this morning he cannot duck the responsibility here.  This is another promise which has not been kept.  The legislation introduced to deal with this was helpful and was of use to some people, and possibly was a good measure, assuming that one accepts the morality of the concept of ground rents, but it does not do what the Government said it would.  The statement in the Seanad to which I referred is an admission by the Minister that there is no intention to introduce a scheme which will lead unequivocally to the total abolition of ground rents.  We all know that it will not happen and it was a shame to raise it in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the issues which is not dealt with in the Bill is the lack of basic information. There are probably 350,000 people in private rented accommodation and many are living in unfit conditions. It seems that when a measure is introduced they do not get the benefit of it. I understand that the cost to the taxpayer of rates abolition on houses let in flats was about £8.5 million in 1978 and most of that money was not passed on to the tenant.  The Government would perhaps have liked that to happen, but it did not happen.  It was a subsidy to a small minority and it did not benefit the people, as promised by the Government. Judging from the statistical information in relation to the problems in the area provided by the 1971 Census and its definition of a housing unit, or the national pattern of numbers of dwellings where there is apparently no adequate research, there appears to be a great laxity in our approach to this.  A survey was carried out recently by the National Flatdwellers' Association in the Grove Park area of Dublin showed some pretty horrific statistics in relation to, for instance, fire prevention measures.  Fire extinguishers were not provided in the vast majority of these dwellings.  The vast majority of the flats were not registered and the flats were provided without reference <Col N="815" /> to the planning laws.  It is time to try to deal with this issue, but not to using a sledgehammer on landlords.  If the landlords closed their doors to tenants tomorrow and put them out on the streets, the Government would be faced with an insurmountable problem.  It is time to say that this is a legitimate area of housing policy.  Let us therefore respond to it in the way in which we have tried to respond in other areas.  Let us put the resources into it and introduce a system which will ensure certain standards for both landlord and tenant.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us is basically responding to fairly minute areas of concern at this stage.  That remark is based on my discussions with the various interest groups during the last few days. They are quite adamant that the Bill is irrelevant and that there are other more important things that they need which should be covered under the Bill.  In Dublin alone there are in excess of 120,000 tenants living in private rented accommodation and the scale of the problem is not reflected in the Bill.  This is a wonderful opportunity for a Government to do something dramatic, and we had hoped for that when we heard the sounds that were made in June 1977.</P>
    <P>These problems occur both in Dublin and in urban areas.  I pay tribute to the Carlow Branch of Young Fine Gael who carried out a survey on rented accommodation in Carlow town in May 1979. Even in a place like Carlow, where one would imagine that the scale of the problem would not be enormous, Mr. D. McDonnell, the Chairperson and Mr. Richard Daly, the National Chairperson of Young Fine Gael, say that flats in general were in the main unhygienic and unsafe and were certainly not of the standard expected in modern times. They did a thorough professional survey and credit is due to them for making an effort in this area.  They made a full list of recommendations and those recommendations are almost without exception the same recommendations that came up in the charter of reforms sought for by the National Flatdwellers' Association, and which were so glibly described as <Col N="816" /> being absolutely acceptable to this Government when they were seeking the votes of the people just over two-and-a half years ago.</P>
    <P>Whether it be Carlow or Grove Park the problems are the same and they are no mystery.  No public representative can be blind to them.  Housing is undoubtedly the major problem for any urban Deputy.  Housing is a question of people living in flats, in bad accommodation. I have met landlords who are genuinely good people wanting to provide decent accommodation and who are often living in penury themselves, who have houses and do not know what to do with them; they cannot maintain them.  They are on various kinds of restricted rent and so on and there is a whole area here needing attention which is not being dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is a positive role for the landlord. There was a time&mdash;I hope it is going&mdash;when the landlord was a figure of oppression.  I think it is time that concept was ended.  The landlord provides a basic amenity and that is how it should be.  In my view there is no need for the State to take over total responsibility in this area.  As in relation to private builders there is a role for private enterprise in the area of the provision of homes, whether private houses or rented accommodation.  The State has a responsibility to ensure that such provision is hedged around with minimum guarantees for people even under the Constitution. When we come to the Committee Stage we can tease out more of these issues.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the National Law Reform Group also seek many of the reforms which I refer to and which are not in the Bill.  In a letter which they wrote to the Minister for Justice on 19 April 1979 they referred to seven specific reforms among them the question of revision of restricted rent, the removal of rent control from the landlord's own home, and the subsidisation of the rent of the poor and needy in the private sector.  They demand that rent at least in part should be offset against tax which is <i>verbatim</i> the proposal in the urban <Col N="817" /> affairs policy document approved at our own Ard Fheis last year&mdash;the establishment of a national private rental sector authority&mdash;which presumably is not too far removed from the tribunals we referred to&mdash;and that a national private tenancy agreement should be introduced to cover all living accommodation. Finally, they ask the Government to make grants available to restore property&mdash;very reasonable demands from a pretty responsible organisation so far as I know.  These demands if implemented in the most part would undoubtedly allow for the bringing about of far more enlightened and progressive reforms in this area than the fairly meagre proposals in the Bill will introduce.</P>
    <P>When one gets landlords and tenants saying the same thing one would imagine this was a recipe for instant action by a Government.  If this Government could find it possible to have lobby groups on opposite sides of the table thinking together on many of the issues of the day they would breathe a sigh of relief.  You find, for example, that they are willing to accept a national understanding of gigantic proportion,&mdash;subsequently condemned by the EEC&mdash;with a sigh of relief when we knew well it did not meet what they requested in the beginning and yet they found it possible to make progress there.  Here is a case where both landlords and tenants are saying the same thing.  Yet, all we get in most respects is silence from the opposite side of the House despite the promises we had.  That is a pity because there is the possibility of political action which would be welcomed all around.  The Government will not upset any group by the introduction of the measures we are discussing this morning.  That is something significant in this society and in the context of the lobby system as it operates today.  There is a positive role for the landlords and an input to be made here.  There is the possibility which has not been grasped of progress being made in the area.  The question of rent control is germane to the Bill.  In section 60 it seems to me there is an open door to decontrol.  The Minister might spend a <Col N="818" /> few minutes in reply in dealing with whether or not the Government believes that the section will bring this about and if it does whether it is a good thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to your coming into the Chair I indicated that my reading, naive or innocent as I may be, of section 60 is that it is likely to bring about decontrol in that area.  That is what I was trying to develop when I was asking the Minister to be good enough to comment on that when he gets a change. I am not alone in this view.  If the Chair looks at it more closely I think he will find I am probably right.  So, I want to know from the Minister in due course whether or not my interpretation of section 60 as a decontrolling measure is correct and if so whether it is Government policy, because if decontrol is to take place or if the question of control is at issue at all, I think a more comprehensive view of it should be taken.  There is not much point in controlling rents if we do not control prices in the private housing area including the price of land.  That is the issue.</P>

Is that right or not?  If it is right, is it Government policy?  What do the Government feel about rent control or the termination of it&mdash;no more than that?  There is a long history of rent control which we could go into and which I think is very relevant because it is germane to section 60.  Is this a backdoor method of decontrolling rents?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I remain extremely concerned about that section and I would like more than the negative to reassure me.  It is my belief that the opportunity exists for a much more easily achieved termination of tenancy if this section is adopted.  If I am wrong I would be pleased to hear a statement to that effect. If tenancies can be more easily terminated, it is clear that, in effect, we are talking about decontrolling rents.  If the Minister is permitted to do so, and if he sees fit, he can deal with that later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of serious issues arise in relation to this.  I should like to mention the way in which the private rented sector are encouraged to achieve court orders for the purposes of getting effective evictions.  I am not sure that this Bill, or any amendment to it, will be able to tackle that problem but it is part of the total scenario.  It is a problem I have when dealing with this legislation.  I contend that the legislation is inadequate because it is not comprehensive enough. It deals with an area which has extremely wide ramifications but talking <Col N="825" /> about some of those ramifications leaves one open to the accusation of not being relevant.  Accordingly, the Bill should be extended and if there is no possibility of the amendments which we will table being accepted I would like a commitment to introduce legislation soon to ensure a new deal for landlords and tenants along the lines I mentioned.</P>
    <P>I hope my remarks are interpreted as being constructive and positive proposals for enlightened reform in this area which would coincide with pledges made by the Government prior to the last election.  I had hoped to deal with the question of rent de-control at some length but, apparently, it is not relevant. This is a reflection on the rather blinkered thinking we have in this House on occasions when an issue of fundamental social policy such as housing has to be dealt with in a confined manner. I can recall the same attitude prevailing on similar legislation.  It is impossible to get an over-view because of the alleged prior right of order in the House when, in fact, what one wants to do is to make a basic point that the narrow confines of a Bill are not adequate to deal with the problems of today. That is the epitome of the problem of this House, that we are not responding in the way we should be in general.  Perhaps that is also why we seem to be more and more irrelevant.</P>
    <P>With those sentiments I should like to ask the Minister to be good enough in his own time to comment on those points on which he can, ignore those which he sees as irrelevant, and I wish him luck with those provisions he wishes to continue to enact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Eileen Desmond, Labour spokesperson for Justice, is occupied in Strasbourg and I speak on this Bill on her behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a proper sense a Bill dealing with landlord and tenant law should hardly be the preserve of the Department of Justice in the first place.  On balance there are many sections of this Bill to be welcomed.  They fall into two categories, <Col N="826" /> the first being that of business and commercial leases and the other residential leases.  In both instances they regulate the market and, to that extent, are involved in the business activities of the country or the housing market activities of the country.</P>
    <P>There is a lot to be said for decrying the fact that the Government at this late stage, despite repeated questions in this House, have not indicated the long-term or indeed short-term designation of overall, effective ministerial responsibility for housing, including the provision and regulation of the supply of flats. I know the Minister of State has confined his remarks to a comparatively short introductory speech.  I share with him the view that this is an immensely technical and complex Bill which perhaps, having regard to the debate which took place in the Seanad, would have been better served by the Oireachtas had we set up a select committee to go through it on Committee Stage.  I regret that the time of this House will be taken up at some considerable length on Committee Stage because the number of sections involved and the implications of any one section dictate that Committee Stage is when these will be teased out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take up the Deputy's point and say that I shall examine his suggestion to see what could be done about it, because I thoroughly agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister of State.  It implies an extra workload on all of us, but I would suggest that the balance in favour of such a suggestion is that it would enable the Oireachtas to get on with other items of business long overdue in this House. Indeed, it would enable the Department of Justice to bring forward other legislation ready for debate.  I am glad the Minister of State has seen fit to investigate my suggestion&mdash;and I accept that that is all he has undertaken to do&mdash;of a select committee, because it is necessary that we go into the <Col N="827" /> technicalities involved in some of these areas.</P>
      <P>The Schedule of repeal of enactments and the number of Acts crossreferenced throughout this Bill indicate the enormous amount of legislation centered around property over the last 100 years.  The relationship between wealth, poverty and property, and the necessity for any society, particularly a democracy, to regulate it are clearly demonstrated by the numerous attempts of the Legislature to intervene and to interfere in the market in order to readjust the balance that very quickly can be disturbed due to market forces.  What we are seeing in the business sector of this Bill is an attempt to redress the lack of balance brought about in the renting of commercial properties by virtue of the provision of the right of a 21-year lease at a fixed rent.  That lack of balance was brought about because the legislators at that time did not foresee that inflationary forces would make nonsense of fixed rents over a 21-year period.  The reason I refer to that is to state quite clearly and categorically that, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, we regard it as pointless to talk in terms of regulating the residential housing market with which this Bill is concerned by means of Department of Justice legislation unless the same Government Department charged with implementing this kind of legislation has some control over the supply of units onto the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience of attempts to achieve rent control in this country has demonstrated that part of the housing stock has undoubtedly suffered as a result of the introduction of rent control without there being a constant review of the housing market itself.  The Conroy Commission have demonstrated over many years the complexity of the whole operation of trying to intervene, by means of Department of Justice legislation alone, in the area of supply and demand of rented accommodation. Indeed, there was the recent experience in Britain of legislation brought in by the Labour members of the Greater London Council, with the same kind of motivation, which attempted <Col N="828" /> to regulate the conditions of the supply of residential housing to tenants without also taking into account the nature of the supply of such residential units.  This very quickly made a bad situation worse.</P>
    <P>This is a preface to the remarks I want to make about the total absence of any commitment to dealing with tenants' needs in terms of getting residential accommodation, in respect of which this Bill provided a unique opportunity.  I make those remarks for this reason, that those of us in the Labour Party who propose a control and regulation of the housing market, so that injustices do not take place in the housing field, do so in the clear knowledge that it is not an easy thing to do and that certainly it cannot be simplistic or slogan solutions.</P>
    <P>The positive provisions of this Bill should be welcomed at this stage.  There is no doubt in the minds of most people with whom we have consulted that the situation brought about by it in relation to business and commercial leases constitutes a positive improvement on the law as it stands.  Both sides in the commercial world, landlords and tenants alike, welcome such proposals.  Indeed, in that context, the enlargement of the definition of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; is to be welcomed.  My direct experience as a member of Dublin Corporation when we attempted to ensure that the Olympia Theatre would not be lost to this city centred around the legal implications of the lease that Olympia Productions Limited held on those premises.  The original definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; was a very narrow one.  The present proposal to enlarge the definition so as to incorporate charitable and, in effect, noncommercial activities in the definition of &ldquo;business&rdquo; is a positive one.  In the final analysis what the Olympia Theatre people had to do in order to retain their rights to tenancy renewal was to maintain what was in effect a kind of farce, the running of the bar of the theatre in those premises in order to continue to survive and hold on to their rights of tenancy under existing landlord and tenant legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> Committee Stage&mdash;whether that be in Select Committee or elsewhere&mdash;is when the full implications of this Bill can be examined by this House.  Indeed, we are indebted to the other House where much of that work has been done already.  In that context I would be concerned at the possible lack of flexibility in the nature of rent reviews that may be in the 35-year lease, in the idea of confining it to five-year rent reviews.  Since we are moving into the market of property a landlord and tenant should be enabled to have the flexibility to opt for seven-year reviews, three-year reviews and so on because of inflation in property values. Legislation intended to preserve some degree of equity within a market which literally is fluctuating from month to month should provide within that parameter of an objective for social equity and justice a flexibility that does not have people tied down in distortions of the market value of a property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the five-year period is fixed it is fixed by the court. For example, if a landlord and tenant want to come in for a review for a lesser period that is a matter for agreement between them.  The five-year period operates only where the court comes in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  My reading of it is that only in the absence of agreement do they resort to court.  I will take whatever correction comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's interpretation is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the court should be enabled to have more flexibility in the range of years that it dictates and not be tied to five.  There is already such inflexibility in the landlord and tenant laws that there are great distortions because the market value of property rises and falls so quickly that it is hard for any law passed to keep pace with it unless that law has inbuilt flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let my remarks not be misunderstood in principle.  This is an advance on what <Col N="830" /> was here before.  The enlargement of the definition of the word &ldquo;business&rdquo; and the rights of tenancy, the access to tenancy, the way in which tenancy is determined and the rent review clauses are improvements. Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to comment on my one regret, which is that this necessary legislation has taken so long to come to the floor of both Houses.  To my knowledge the business and property community have been looking for it for a long time.  I do not know who is against it.  It is not contentious legislation, it is in the interest of everybody.  Under the old system, while the landlord was penalised by having a low rent towards the end of the 21-year period, tenants who got a new lease at the beginning of a 21-period had to pay over the odds in their rent because the court attempted to adjust in some fashion the value of the landlord's interest. Therefore, it was not satisfactory to either party.  It was a deterrent to commercial activity and business.</P>
    <P>As Labour Party spokesman on the Environment I must state that it was a positive instrument in bringing about planning blight in parts of our towns and cities.  The impact of landlord and tenant legislation on our towns and cities in planning terms has never been properly evaluated.  In the commercial sector as much as in the residential sector much of the visual blight that exists around the cities and towns is a direct product of the inflexibility that has existed in the past. In so far as this legislation will remove that inflexibility and enable landlords to obtain a reasonable rent from their property and, more important, enable secure tenants to carry out improvements without fear of objection or lack of compensation in the event of losing the tenancy at some future date, it is a positive measure.</P>
    <P>In principle, therefore, on the commercial side of the leases with which this legislation concerns itself there is a general welcome for this Bill.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said on the residential side, and the problem is much greater than this Bill encompasses.  The problem relates really more to the fact <Col N="831" /> that we have no Minister or Government Department with effective responsibility for the private rented residential sector. The tragedy of that is not that speakers in this House will stray away from the point on particular legislation.  That is a minor irritant when it occurs and it does not occur wilfully.  The tragedy is that there are an increasing number of young people looking for accommodation on the one hand and an increasing number of people of limited economic means who need accommodation desperately and who are totally at the mercy of the irrational market forces.  The whole history of rent legislation in this country, both after independence and before, was and is still centred around the political necessity of the Legislature of the land to intervene in the markets when the social injustice becomes intolerable.  The first Rent Acts were introduced in 1906, and the major Rent Control Acts in 1915 were introduced largely because the housing markets had gone totally berserk and the demand was greatly in excess of supply with a consequent escalation in rents beyond the normal means of people to pay and certainly beyond the average 20 per cent of income that one should allocate for housing in one shape or another.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was drafted originally&mdash;and it was drafted largely by the last administration, as the Minister has inferred, and that is in no way a slight on him bringing it forward in this period&mdash;and since it is concerned essentially with the commercial side of leases, the housing market in the private rented sector which is partially covered by this Bill has gone totally out of balance.  The demand is totally in excess of supply and we have politically no Minister who can come into the House and say, &ldquo;I am the Minister responsible for that.  I have legislative responsibility to solve this problem&rdquo;.  The tragedy of this legislation is that it misses an opportunity which, as the Minister of State has said, will not come again soon because this is the last landlord and tenant legislation that this administration proposed to bring in.</P>
    <P>What do the flatdwellers do?  To <Col N="832" /> whom do they turn?  On the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Bill which gave effect to the de-rating of residential property I asked a range of questions in relation to flatdwellers and how they would benefit under the provisions as was promised.  In fairness to the people who drafted that Bill, an attempt was made to achieve this, but because administrative and political responsibility is divided between the Department of Justice, and the Department of the Environment, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners at Central Government level, and at local level amongst the local housing authorities, no effective action is being taken at the moment by the State, in total contrast to the effective action taken in the past on behalf of private residents and tenants.  The consequence is that great injustice and exploitation have taken place in this city.  Every Deputy in this House, particularly urban Deputies, including the Minister of State in his clinic on Saturday morning, will be met by people who have not enough points to qualify for local authority housing.  Last Sunday I was met by a young couple&mdash;bear with me for a moment a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am staying on the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Sean Browne">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a bit outside it at the moment. The provision of local authority housing does not arise on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to prove that many Deputies, including myself, have as part of their problem arising directly out of the housing markets with which this Bill will propose to deal in part, cases such as the one I want to illustrate. A couple have been told that they will have to get out of a flat they are in because she is due to have a baby in January of next year.  This Bill does absolutely nothing for her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is perhaps overloaded technically in many areas and the Minister of State has said that there are no proposals for any other Bills.  I believe if certain provisions in this Bill are enacted and effectively operated by a combination <Col N="833" /> of local authorities and private property owners a bad housing situation will be made much worse.  I share Deputy Keating's view in relation to the possible interpretation of section 60. When we get to Committee Stage we can go through it at some length.</P>
    <P>The House should realise that one effect of this Bill when enacted is that a number of controls will be removed.  A tenant in a controlled property, who enjoys his rights under previous Landlord and Tenant legislation which this Bill proposes to repeal, will find his position changed.  Subsection (2) (b) of section 60 states:</P>
    <P>... the landlord has a scheme for the development of property which includes the tenement, being development for which planning permission has been granted, the Court may... terminate the tenancy.</P>
    <P>I am a former member of Dublin Corporation and I have a fair degree of professional knowledge of what is happening in the property world in this city. My understanding of this subsection is that it will make viable certain property development projects which previously were not because the protected tenants in those properties said they wanted to live in the areas in which they were brought up, the church they always went to was next door and so on.</P>
    <P>Right through the Bill there is reference to compensation.  We are told that the landlord must compensate and so forth.  Subsection (3) of section 60 states:</P>
    <P>Where a tenancy is terminated under this section the tenant shall be entitled, on quitting the tenement, to be paid by the landlord compensation for the termination of the tenancy in accordance with this section.</P>
    <P>I have looked through the definition section for a definition of compensation to see what is meant by it but I could not find it.  There is no reference to &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; between &ldquo;business&rdquo; and &ldquo;controlled dwellings&rdquo; in the definition section. It is not clear to me on what basis <Col N="834" /> that compensation will be arrived at. Developers have developed parts of the city and compensated controlled tenants who willingly gave up their tenancies because the developers were able to provide alternative accommodation which met with the satisfaction of the tenants involved.  Those tenants willingly moved to other accommodation.  This has certainly happened in areas of Dublin too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) might help the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It still does not define it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that that is where it will be decided.  I would have preferred if the courts were given far more direction by the House in relation to the principle of compensation so that the section could read that if somebody is a controlled tenant of limited means and a landlord chooses to exercise this right under section 60, compensation will be deemed to be, if the tenant so chooses, alternative accommodation in an adjoining area.  That would make the wishes of everybody in the House much clearer than the type of phraseology in subsection (5).  We can discuss that further on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section will have a very great impact on this city.  If the demand for commercial office accommodation remains at the steady level it has over the last few years &mdash; the combined RICS and the property survey of <i>The Irish Times</i> indicate that, and this is reinforced by the growth in services generally in the Dublin area &mdash; I can see certain parts of the city subjected to increased property development.  I believe that is the reason why this section is in the Bill.  When a Department of Justice make such a provision do they have any sense of what the planning implications might be of this?  When the Department of Justice draft this type of legislation now do they have any further expertise about the <Col N="835" /> nature of the property market and the nature of urban development than their predecessors had?  Is this intervention in the property market being done without reference to other factors and without consulting with the agencies and groups who have expertise in assessing what the impact will be of some of the provisions?</P>
    <P>The business community have survived for many years with a very bad landlord and tenant system of property relations.  Some individuals have been severely penalised and others have unjustly benefited from it and got subsidies from their landlords to carry on profitable commercial business without paying economic rents for the places where they carried on their business.  The business community, in the main, have survived.  The damage which has been done has been largely in terms of planning. The serious political charge which can be laid at the Government, who are responsible for bringing in this Bill, is that they have seen fit to give priority to rectifying the injustices which need to be rectified without apparently giving equal status to the problems of people attempting to rent residences in the private sector.  I hope that the Minister of State, who should be aware of these problems from experience in his constituency, will give a clear indication at some stage in the course of the debate of the Government's policy in relation to legal responsibilities for the private rent sector.  Undoubtedly this sector is now totally out of balance with a consequent enormous degree of hardship and social injustice.</P>
    <P>The problem is compounded by the fact that, judging from the census figures in gross terms and the details of those figures as they apply to urban areas with regard particularly to immigration to urban areas from other parts of the country, the situation will become worse rapidly.  The Minister of State must be receiving representations from Fianna Fáil Deputies about this situation.  I trust that he will consider again the whole question of the Government's commitment while in opposition to the private rent sector who are not protected by any degree of rent control.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="836" /> The net effect of the residential provisions of this Bill will be to weaken further the control of those tenants who already enjoy some such control.  If those provisions are taken up by the market a further demand will be put on the housing market in general but that market cannot accommodate any further demand unless major financial provisions are made to ensure an increase in supply.  The Minister for Justice can say rightly that this is not a matter for his Department but he should not be in a position to bring in legislation of this kind without at least having a scientific and a detailed understanding of what is likely to be the impact of the legislation in terms of property, planning and housing.</P>
    <P>In political terms the lesson for those young people who have come to this city this autumn either to start work or to follow courses in third level education must be fairly clear regarding the Government's priorities since 1977.  On balance every action taken by Fianna Fáil since their return to office has profited either the landlord or the private owner-occupier to the exclusion and indeed to the exacerbation of the flatdweller or of anybody else renting accommodation. In so far as this Bill is concerned with the residential sector of rented property it will weaken the position of the tenant and strengthen further the position of the landlord.  That is the net effect of Fianna Fáil in office.  The widening gap between them and their commitment&mdash;a commitment made prior to the last election&mdash;is a political scandal to which they must respond.  I suggest seriously and without rancour that a situation in which students are virtually camping in their class-rooms because of their inability to find accommodation and in which young couples are being evicted because of their having children for the first time will force this Government, despite the present course of action, to do something drastic and without delay.  But I advise the Minister not to wait until matters become desperate to take some action.  The situation is bad enough now.  Is there not a way in which some of the provisions of <Col N="837" /> the flatdwellers charter could be incorporated into this Bill between now and Committee Stage?  Is there not a way, for example, that their rights in relation to being treated as separate customers by the ESB and by other utilities cannot be guaranteed in legislation?  Is it not possible that some proposals for a rent tribunal or for a system of evaluation or of access to the courts or of a definition of the kind of courts be built in to protect the rights of tenants so that at the time of the next election the Minister's party will be in a position at least to say that they attempted to honour some of the commitments made by Senator E. Ryan on behalf of Fianna Fáil?  It is not for me to suggest how Fianna Fáil should order their affairs.</P>
    <P>Down through the years they have demonstrated their ability in that area but my concern is&mdash;and this remark might be relevant also to the Home Office in Britain&mdash;that when the housing market becomes so unbalanced as must happen in this city, the situation will be such that the Government might panic into drafting legislation which in the short term might appear to solve the problem but which in the long term would make the situation worse.  The private rent sector is in a state of total collapse.  Anybody who has spoken to any young person who has been seeking accommodation in this city in the past four or five weeks will know how bad the situation is.  I know of one person who queued for three hours in order to see a flat.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to think again about the Department's commitment as indicated by him, that is, to draw a line on the landlord and tenant legislation and to say that is it for the foreseable future.  On behalf of those thousands of people who, effectively, are homeless because of not being able to find rented accommodation, I say to the Minister that he has a moral and a political responsibility to do something to ease the situation immediately.  I trust that at some stage during the passage of the Bill, but not necessarily at the conclusion of Second Stage, the Minister <Col N="838" /> will indicate his readiness to deal quickly with the situation.  As evidence of that the Minister should indicate what he reckons are the possibilities within the confines of this legislation of attempting to give tenants some degree of protection, particularly those in furnished accommodation, who do not even have the same rights as consumers with the ESB as a landlord has.  There is an urgent need to look at that question and at how this legislation can be amended or added to in order to give rights to tenants which they do not have at present.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify what the Government's thinking is in relation to overall ministerial responsibility for the private rented housing sector.  Who is the Minister responsible in real terms?  I know that there are two Ministers involved but would the Minister not consider, in order to effectively resolve this problem, that total responsibility for this sector should be transferred to the Department of the Environment or from the Department of the Environment in part back to the Department of Justice in full?</P>
    <P>This legislation is very long.  There are many provisions in it which are positive and are therefore welcome as far as we are concerned.  The implications of many of the sections can be assured only on Committee Stage.  I share the view expressed by the Minister in relation to the work done in the Seanad in this regard.  I regret that the position of the private tenant in a controlled dwelling is being weakened by this and no rights are being conferred on tenants in the furnished housing sector at a time when they desperately need them.  In guiding this legislation through the House I hope the Minister will recognise this gap and give an indication of the Government's commitment to honour their pledges of 1977.</P>

      <P>This is the third time since I came to the House that I have spoken on a Bill dealing with landlords and tenants.  The two Acts already passed complied with commitments given by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1977 prior to the election.  Some people feel <Col N="839" /> that we went away from that and that it is only what is stated in writing that can be quoted today.  While some people feel, two years later, that we reneged in that, the general public do not think so.  At a meeting the other night at which this was discussed it was generally felt that, while ACRA still argue about the people who forced this on politicians, they admit they got a good deal.</P>

      <P>What we said in the manifesto was that we would provide a scheme that would lead to the abolition of existing residential ground rents.  This is the third Bill we have had about this. The first one did away with future ground rents, the second made it easy to lead towards abolition and the third deals with the technical detail.  I cannot recall the Minister saying that there would be no further amendments.  I recall him saying that the Deasy's Act could be amended and that there could be further amendments arising out of that.  He did not close the door, as other speakers said.</P>
      <P>This Bill is intended to give effect to the Government's proposals in the area of tenant and landlord law.  Some of the points raised were irrelevant.  As regards the problem of students getting accommodation, some of the students admitted that if they had come to the city earlier they could have solved those problems.  I am not saying that is the total answer.  I am not sure how a Minister can write into a Bill dealing with landlords and tenants how people can get accommodation if they come to the city early.  Very few students are now living on the campus or on the roadways in Belfield. They have been fixed up.</P>

      <P>A point raised was the fees involved in trying to buy out the fee simple.  People wanted that and it was provided for in previous Bills.  It is wrong to say that no system was set up to make it easy.  It is quite simple now, as Deputies are aware.  Deputy Keating is well aware that people in his constituency are buying out their ground rents.  I live in his constituency and I have bought mine out.  I did not vote for him, but perhaps next time.  One pays £5 to the Land Registry.  In the past if one could not locate the landlord there were numerous problems.  It was almost impossible for an individual to study what he had to do.  He would have had to refer back to previous Bills.  It is now a simple process and the residents' association in Deputy Keating's area are very happy with it.</P>

      <P>It is a wonder the Deputy did not mention the roadway as that is the problem in his area.  The Minister pointed out that one of the reasons why this is not a consolidating Bill is that he would be delaying the matter and people would then criticise the delay.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission are still meeting and have not yet come up with their final conclusions. The point was made that we should not bother with commissions, but surely if matters were not gone into in detail we would not have good legislation.  The Act of 1931 was the first one dealing with landlord legislation.  There was another one in 1958.  This is the third in two years which this Government have brought in.  Surely that is progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> As regards the terms of the conditions attached to the renewal of occupational tenancies, I understood from the Minister&mdash;we are talking about people who live in a house but do not own the bricks and mortar&mdash;that this Bill will secure their interest in those houses and extend the period of time they can stay in the houses.  In another part of the Bill we are giving compensation for any improvements they have made.  Up to 1931, and more recently, people could improve their homes and if their leases expired they could be thrown out.  A landlord must now adhere to the wishes of his tenant and take account of improvements done.</P>
    <P>As a tenant can now bring the matter of renewal of tenancy to court, he is likely to get a much better deal than in the past.  The Minister referred to the 21 year limit of lease extension which has now been extended to 35 years.  If the matter goes to court and is fixed as day one, the result could be an astronomical rent, but this could be reviewed every five years instead of seven, which is much fairer to the tenant.  The rent will be linked in some way to inflation rather than imposing a large rent which may be out of touch with the times.  In regard to business tenants, a new tenancy is given for three years, regardless of the terms under which the existing tenancies were granted.  This would also apply to people with short leases.  It has been stated that the Bill deals only with long-term tenancy agreements but under this section, though I may be wrong, a person on a short lease could at least have a renewal for another three years with some right of holding on to the premises he is occupying.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals fairly with landlords.  In the case cited, of an hotel or some such business where the tenant is unsatisfactory, or something detrimental to the business is being carried on in the premises, the owner has the right to examine the person's fitness for that tenancy and if he is not satisfactory the landlord may discontinue that lease, thus <Col N="842" /> enabling him to obtain a satisfactory tenant.  In the Bill the right is given to a tenant with 20 years' continuous occupation of a dwellinghouse to a new tenancy up to 30 years.  This protects the tenant. If a person inadvertently, through illness or old age, loses the right to a tenancy, the landlord can no longer put him out. Under the old Act, a tenant could be put out if his rent was 12 months in arrears and the later legislation provided that he could be sued for non-payment of debts. This present Bill strengthens a tenant's hand.  For example, the landlord must give an extension of the lease to an elderly tenant on a long lease who inadvertently misses the running out of the lease.  Under the 1931 Act there had to be absence from a house for five years before anything could be done, but now prior to termination of a tenancy the question of a tenancy under new conditions, giving more security of tenure, can be examined.</P>
    <P>Regarding tenants building extensions or making improvements in houses, in the past unless an approval notice was served on the landlord they could not expect compensation.  There is one section I did not understand.  It concerns the landlord being prejudiced by non-service of notice.  Perhaps the Minister would explain later.  In the case of a landlord trying to evict a tenant and refusing to allow a planning application that landlord can now be overruled, except under some conditions, and the tenant can go ahead and renovate the house.</P>
    <P>Under Part I of the Bill, if a house owner tries to hold out in an area where this means a blocking of necessary improvements to many, refusing compensation offered, there are stringent conditions to make sure that there will be no loopholes in the law.  It would be unfair for someone to be able to stop a major development, which could be in the interests of many, by refusing adequate compensation.  The conditions mentioned of six months' notice and adequate compensation are fair enough.</P>
    <P>In section 69 of the Bill the State should have the right to buy the fee simple of dwellinghouses under the purchase <Col N="843" /> scheme of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, subject only to the public interest.  There are technical points involved here which may be dealt with in a further Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has paid a well-earned tribute to the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  This is the third Bill which the Government have brought before the House and they are examining further ways of improving landlord and tenant legislation, whether by amendments to this Bill or in a future Bill.  This is not a closed shop situation.  The two Bills already passed are recognised as being of tremendous benefit.  There are provisions safeguarding the rights of tenants and, in some ways, the rights of landlords. It is only fair that landlords should be considered to some degree and not taken always to be wrong; they are not all bad.  In years gone by they got their bad reputation probably because of loopholes in the law but the Bills passed and being passed in the House have gone a long way to repairing that position.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues mentioned the problem of tenants attempting to get or getting court orders being evicted and being compelled to take whatever accommodation is offered.  This is a major problem.  There are frequently such cases under Dublin Corporation and other corporations where people are being evicted and homeless people are squatting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> By and large this Bill updates the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.  It is based largely on recommendations made by the Landlord and Tenant Commission.  I should like to join with the Minister of State and other speakers who thanked Judge Conroy <Col N="844" /> and the other members of that Commission for the work they did over the years within their terms of reference.  They worked hard on the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1931, and updated it as proposed in the Bill before us.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1931, which it is now proposed to repeal, it is appropriate to say a word of congratulation to the people who put that Bill on the Statute Book a long time ago.  It was then very enlightened legislation. It often occurs to me that, in those days, very good work was done in many fields.  As I say, it is appropriate to congratulate the people who enacted the 1931 Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us is good so far as it goes, but it does not go nearly far enough.  Nor does it deal with a variety of problems which have arisen.  I have thanked Judge Conroy and his commission, but it is necessary to point out that the commission were appointed in January 1966, and that the two reports we now have before us were submitted by the commission to the then Minister for Justice in 1967-68.  The terms of reference given to the commission are limited.  There are three of them: to inquire into the working of the law relating to landlords and tenants other than the Rent Restrictions Act, 1960, and to recommend such amendments in the law as the commission think proper; to furnish a report on the provisions relating to the grant of new tenancies under Part III of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and on other aspects of the law which, in the opinion of the Commission, should be given priority; whether persons other than those given a right to a reversionary lease by the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, should be given that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is pretty clear that the commission regarded their terms of reference as an invitation to look into the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and to update that Act, and to look at the entitlement of persons to reversionary leases.  They dealt with those two matters, and broadly they are what we are dealing with now.  Over the years there was a <Col N="845" /> tendency here towards private ownership. That seemed to be the trend developing over a good number of years. People wanted to own their own houses and their own business premises.  In recent years that tendency seemed to be disappearing.  In years to come we will see a situation developing where more and more people will be living in rented accommodation.  More and more people will be living in flats or in apartments.</P>
    <P>I say that because it seems to me that the purchase or acquisition of a house is rapidly going beyond the capacity of young people.  I will not get into a lengthy or detailed discussion on the price of houses, but I think what I am about to say is relevant.  If a climate is being created where more and more people will be living in rented accommodation, the contractual relationships between landlord and tenant will increase. Furthermore, if we are to have an increase in the number of apartment residences, or flats, that will create a different sort of problem with which our present landlord and tenant law does not deal.  That development will take place because houses have doubled in price in the past three or four years.  The policy of the Government at present appears to be against building local authority houses.  That is indicated in White Paper after White Paper.  If you will bear with me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is doing its best, but we are straying from the Bill which does not deal with the provision or the cost of houses. I have allowed the Deputy to make his point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan-Monaghan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan-Monaghan):</i> The landlord and tenant law will have to be updated and modernised to meet the new situation with which we are confronted.  I am not putting the blame for the increase in the price of houses on any shoulders.  I am simply saying the price of a house has increased on average from £12,076 to £22,000, according to official figures. That will put the acquisition of a house <Col N="846" /> beyond the capacity of the average man, or woman, or married couple wanting to acquire a house.  I will say no more about that.</P>
      <P>Government policy as enunciated in multi-coloured papers over the past few years appears to be that there is less necessity for the building of local authority houses and that people should look after themselves.  If that is so&mdash;and it appears to me to be the case&mdash;the landlord and tenant law needs to be updated. It is not good enough to update an Act introduced in 1931 and not deal with the modern situation as we know it.  I mention in particular the flatland situation in Dublin, the multi-apartment buildings, and so on.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference of the Landlord and Tenant Commission need to be updated.  They need new terms of reference and a request should be made to them to deal with present problems. Deputy Keating went through a letter written by Senator Eoin Ryan on 7 June 1977 to the National Flatdwellers' Association.  It is a very detailed document. It seemed to have a solution for every problem that might beset tenants. It would be a good idea to submit that document to the Landlord and Tenant Commission as a term of reference and ask them to study it and come up with proposals to discuss it.  It dealt with the problems that prevail in Dublin and other cities and in many of our towns, which should be dealt with by the Landlord and Tenant Commission in the year 1979.  They reported promptly on the terms of reference given to them in 1966, but they need new terms of reference now.  It would appear as if Senator Eoin Ryan had at his disposal some back-up services.  He seemed to have all the solutions in 1977 but none of them appears in this measure, which is a great pity and will be a great disappointment to those who accepted his proposals in 1977 and expected that they would be implemented.</P>
      <P>This measure is simply an updating of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, dealing largely with the renewal of business tenancies which have expired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> As Deputy Quinn said, it does a good job in that area.  We can discuss it in detail on Committee Stage.  It goes some of the way towards altering the terms of renewal of residential leases, but it does not deal with the young people who are housed in unsatisfactory flats in Dublin. There is nothing in it for the people who cannot even get these flats because they have children.</P>
    <P>If the position is as I see it, that is, a move from ownership to rented accommodation, the law of landlord and tenant must be equitable to both sides and must give a fair return to landlords.  If a fair and reasonable return is not given to landlords they will not make accommodation available.  If the Government are not going to make accommodation available in the form of local authority housing and if people who want houses cannot provide them out of their own funds, the people who need houses will be in a bad way if the law of landlord and tenant discourages or prohibits the building or provision of houses by the private sector.</P>
    <P>It has been said and accepted by the Minister of State that this is a complicated measure.  It is a highly technical Bill.  It can truly be said that it is a Committee Stage Bill.  I do not propose to go into it section by section.  I intend to refer to a few of the major provisions which need amendment.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister of State that he should postpone Committee Stage for at least three or four weeks, if he does not refer the Bill, as he is thinking of doing, to a select committee, as some Deputies, including himself, are engaged on other matters at present.  I have a list of amendments but it will take some time to get them down.  We would not be prepared to take Committee Stage and do justice to it earlier than three weeks from today.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to a discussion in the Seanad on section 4, the section which exempts the State from the obligation to give a new tenancy.  In other words, a person who takes a lease <Col N="848" /> from the State for five, ten or 20 years and builds up a business is not entitled to a new tenancy on the termination of the lease.  If he had taken a lease from a private individual or a company, he would be entitled to a new tenancy.  The same difficulty will arise for a person who rents or leases his dwelling from the State and resides in it for 20 or 25 years, that is, he will not be entitled to a new tenancy as he would be if he had taken the letting from a private individual. That exemption is wrong.  There was no such exemption in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>This special treatment for the State first crept into an Act introduced by the present Government a couple of years ago.  The first time it appeared in statutory form was in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978.  The Minister of State said that this was always the law; that the Senators seemed to think that it was an innovation but that that was not so.  My understanding is that it does not appear in the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, that it never appeared in any statutory form before, and that the Landlord and Tenant Commission have not asked or recommended that the law be changed. When he said that the State enjoyed this exemption since the foundation of the State, I imagine that the Minister of State had in mind some old maxim that it is not possible to prescribe against the Crown or that one cannot acquire a squatter's title or a title by prescription against the Crown, or that the ordinary man had no rights against the Crown. That must be the rule that the Minister of State is relying on.</P>
    <P>If a Government Department rent premises as business premises to a citizen, they are enjoying rents that ordinary landlords enjoy and should be bound by the law in the same way as everybody else.  Indeed the State is in a much better position to find alternative accommodation than the tenant it ejects. I propose to put down an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with this.  A great hardship will be caused if section 4 is allowed to stand because a person <Col N="849" /> might take a lease from an ordinary private citizen for 50 years and the State could come along and buy the landlord's interest.  Then the tenant would find himself dealing not with the landlord he contracted with but with the State and he would have lost whatever rights he would have been entitled to exercise under this Act, and that is unjust.  The Minister of State says that he proposes to introduce an amendment dealing with one part of section 4.  I think what the Minister intends to do is to take away from the State the right to this exemption if it purchased the landlord's interest.  I may be wrong but that is what I think he is going to do because as it is now it is so outrageous that it could not stand up at all.  The only way to deal with this problem is to delete section 4 from the Bill altogether.  That is the right way to do it and we will have more about that on Committee Stage.  It is entirely unjust and wrong.</P>
    <P>Section 5 defines a tenement.  That definition is not wide enough.  For example, it defines a tenement as land covered either entirely or partially with buildings. In modern times there could be things like an arena attached to a garage for the sale of cars which, although it is not covered with buildings, is an area that is used for business.  There could be a scrap yard or various other areas that are not covered with buildings but which are used in the very same way.  That needs amendment and again we will deal with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that of course the Bill visualises a situation where a person would not be entitled to the benefit of the Act in regard to the renewal of tenancies and that it was not intended to prevent that.  The Minister now has changed section 13 of the Bill.  It is a different section now from that in the Bill as drafted in 1977.  It is provided that a person who is in occupation of a business premises for three years is entitled to a new tenancy.  It goes on to say that unforeseen breaks can be disregarded if the court thinks that they should be disregarded.  But we all know that over the years leases for two years and nine months are given and then there is a <Col N="850" /> break and then there is another lease for two years and nine months given and, in the heel of the hunt, a tenant could have several of these leases for two years and nine months and he would never be entitled to a new lease and could be thrown out by the back of the neck at any time. That is unreasonable.  This two years and nine months is simply a stunt to contract out of the Act and that should not be allowed.  By writing &ldquo;unforeseen&rdquo; into the Bill the Minister is encouraging that very thing.  An unforeseen break would be a break occasioned by a fire or by illness or something else but it would not be an unforeseen break if the lease is only for two years and nine months and the person is then obliged to vacate the premises for a couple of weeks and then another tenancy is given to him.  That sort of thing goes on and I would suggest that the Minister look at that.  We will be dealing with that on Committee Stage, too.</P>
    <P>Under the law as it stands a lease which expired by effluxion of time or on a certain specified event was renewed in or about the time that it expired.  That has been changed in section 20 of the Bill.  If I take a lease of a premises for 21 years today I can apparently, under section 20, immediately apply for a new tenancy, and serve notice that I am going to apply for a tenancy in 20 years' time. That seems a bit ridiculous.  The right way to deal with that would be to give a lease for 50 years if that was the intention but it seems a bit absurd that a person who gets a lease for 20 years could immediately apply for a new lease on the expiration of that lease although the circumstances prevailing at the time of the real expiration of the lease could be totally different.  That needs looking into.</P>
    <P>Under the 1931 Act a tenant had to give notice within a certain limited time of the expiration of the lease of his intention to apply for a new lease and if he did not he forfeited his right to a new lease. That brought many injustices and something approaching sharp practice; very often because a tenant did not know that his lease had expired because it was either in a bank or a solicitor's office or in his own safe and might have been <Col N="851" /> drawn up in his father's or grandfather's time, he did not serve the notice and lost his right to a new tenancy and this was very strictly observed.  I believe that has been changed now and the court has been given fairly wide powers to extend the time.  But a better provision would be that a landlord must serve a notice on the tenant informing him that his lease has expired.  I think I am right in saying that this is in the Bill and I approve of that.  On receipt of this notice the tenant must claim a new tenancy within a month.  A month is too short.  A person could be away, with travel being so easy even though it is very expensive.  A person might be out of the country on holiday or on business and the notice might be served on him in his absence and therefore one month is too short.</P>
    <P>There is another thing in the Bill that is wrong and needs looking into.  If a business tenant or indeed a residential tenant holds under a lease which expires, then he is entitled to a new tenancy if he bring himself within the Act but if a person is a yearly tenant or a quarterly tenant, a monthly or a weekly tenant for 30 years or longer or for any length of time, he does not have the opportunity of applying for a new tenancy unless a notice to quit is served.  If the landlord sits tight and does not serve a notice to quit this man can never convert his weekly, monthly, quarterly or yearly tenancy into a lease.  He should be given the right, if he is otherwise qualified by length of time, to apply for a new tenancy.  I have outlined the position as I understand it and if I am wrong I will be told so.</P>
    <P>Section 23 refers to gross rent and states that the rent shall be the gross rent less certain reductions.  It is not clear from the section what date should be taken by the court for the assessment of the gross rent and any allowance for improvements and it is suggested that having regard to continuing inflation an appropriate date should be stipulated so that the court will not be faced with the almost impossible task of trying to assess a rent for a new tenancy commencing <Col N="852" /> at some time which they must guess.  A date should be fixed at which the gross rent should be taken.</P>
    <P>We will go through the Bill section by section on Committee Stage and I have given the Minister notice of some matters of a major nature which need to be dealt with.  The Bill is disappointing in that it is not a modern instrument and does not deal with the situation as we now find it.  It only updates a measure of 1931 which was introduced in entirely different circumstances.  We boast of the fact that we have the youngest population in Europe and we hear time and again that 50 per cent of our population are or soon will be under the age of 25. The Bill does not take account of that situation as it should.  Apartments and multi-dwellings were not known to the same extent in 1931 as they are now and they should have been provided for in the Bill.  It is a lazy effort and it is not an answer to say that it is a Bill which was largely introduced by an administration of which I was a member.  I throw the ball back to the Minister's court because he or a very important member of his party had all the answers in 1977.  He now appears to have brushed them to one side and relied on reports produced in 1967 and 1968.</P>

      <P>This Bill, which we all welcome, is rather complex.  As the Minister pointed out, it is the third part of legislation consolidating already existing Acts.  The Minister must be complimented for bringing forward this Bill reasonably quickly and discharging another promise contained in the Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole area of landlord and tenant has always been one of contention and still is.  Perhaps this is not too surprising when one reflects on our history and on the many unjust actions of landlords and their agents during the last century and in the earlier part of this century.  Great feelings of mistrust and hatred which were entrenched many years ago take time to heal.  Even today in modern Ireland, particularly in this city, there are still a great many injustices against tenants and some unscrupulous landlords <Col N="853" /> behave as if they were totally immune to the existing laws of the land.</P>
    <P>Most Dáil Deputies, especially in the Dublin area, will be only too well aware of the difficulties facing the average young person or married couple seeking rented accommodation.  A couple who have children find it increasingly hard to obtain any accommodation except at an exorbitant rent and very often in extremely bad conditions.  There is no doubt that young people are being exploited. The average young person is often too timid, frightened or quiet to do anything but pay the rent demanded or, alternatively, start all over again seeking accommodation.  This happens quite regularly and we are all aware of such cases.  On the other hand, it is strangely in contrast with the views and experiences of so many decent and respectable landlords who play the game fairly and honestly.  Such decent landlords often feel that the law is constantly militating against them and gives them very little room for manoeuvre with their own property.  The Act imposing fixed rents is probably the most unjust and immoral law existing today.</P>
    <P>With such a large influx of population to the cities, it is vitally important that sufficient rent accommodation is available.  That accommodation should be of good standard and available at a reasonable rent.  It must be borne in mind that landlords letting accommodation for residential or commercial purposes do so in the interests of profit in order to make a living.  That is normal. Like a tenant a landlord also wishes to have a quiet life with few problems while, at the same time, he wishes to gain something financially at the end of the day.  That is a quite acceptable objective of any landlord and nobody can fault that.  I am afraid that landlords may consider it is becoming too difficult to let their premises and may fear that the law may be turning a little too much in favour of tenants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware of such cases.  When I refer to this aspect I have in mind the many decent, honourable landlords in the city and earlier today Deputy Keating acknowledged that point.  It is not too often that I agree with the Deputy but I do in this instance.  We must be realistic and accept that very often there are rights and wrongs on both sides.  The law must act fairly at all times between tenants and landlords.  Otherwise there is a real danger that accommodation may become even more scarce.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that, due to the developments and changes in our society it is desirable and necessary to review our laws, to make the necessary amendments and to legislate to suit the times. We have reached such a stage and we have before the House a new Bill in addition to other measures, all of them consolidating the Acts dealing with landlords and tenants.  It is difficult to go through all the relevant Acts and a person would need to have a legal mind to understand and interpret the various legal and constitutional measures.  As the Minister pointed out, this Bill is a consolidating measure and, for that reason, it must be welcomed by all.</P>
      <P>One of the most important proposals in the Bill relates to business leases and what are recognised in this context as occupational tenancies.  Too often in the past the courts have had some difficulty in setting new rents for such tenancies and many people found it very difficult to adjust to a new rent fixed by the courts.  On the other hand, the courts had to take into account a number of considerations, mainly the compensating factor for the benefit of the landlord as fixed rents had to remain for a period of 21 years.  Rents that were fixed in the late sixties and early seventies are far too low by today's standards.  Likewise, during a period of higher inflation the courts could easily err on the other side and, of course, this would be to the disadvantage of the tenants.  For that reason this Bill should be welcomed by all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision to relax the qualifying conditions for a new tenancy is a move in the right direction.  This will lead to a <Col N="855" /> more responsible approach by both parties. In the past too many premises were let on a short-term basis and it was inevitable that at the end of the lease disputes would arise between the landlord and tenant.  We had the situation where all kinds of legalities and technicalities were brought into play.  Now a landlord must decide whether to let his property on an investment basis.  This will give the tenant a fair opportunity and will achieve a better agreement and more goodwill between both parties.  An element of ill-will in any tenancy agreement follows misunderstanding, whether deliberate or otherwise, relating to the responsibility of carrying out repairs to premises.  At present far too many buildings, commercial as well as residential, are in a shocking state of disrepair and decay.  This capital city is blighted in an obscene way in this regard.  Unfortunately families are living in housing conditions that are a shame to those responsible.  I have referred to this on other occasions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that we have far too much rented accommodation in old buildings and I hope this matter will be covered in some way in the future.  I look forward to the time when a penal taxation of some kind will be imposed in respect of buildings that are held for speculative purposes or otherwise.  There are far too many derelict buildings in the city.  I am aware of this because I deal with the problem every day of the week.  The matter did not arise today or yesterday.  The <Col N="856" /> problem has been with us for many years.</P>
      <P>In this Bill there is provision for the tenant to carry out repairs. This also specifies the time limit in which these repairs should be carried out.  The important point in this regard is that the right be given to the courts to insert conditions in a new tenancy where they consider it appropriate, where the partners to the lease fail to agree on measures which can subsequently be inserted and be agreed upon with the assistance of the court.  This is a good aspect in a very mild Bill as it adds a fair dimension to understanding between landlord and tenant.</P>
      <P>I am very much in favour of setting up special committees and commissions to investigate matters.  Some earlier speakers felt that there was no real necessity for commissions.  I am rather surprised at this because as we all know commissions comprise experts and people who specialise in certain aspects of things.  Judge Conroy and the Landlord and Tenant Commission are to be congratulated on their various submissions following their investigation.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill in general and it is not contentious.  There will be a number of amendments on Committee Stage and I feel that the Bill will be more deeply debated at Committee level.  This Bill is long overdue, it is very necessary and I would like it to have a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick is probably the one man present today who knows more than any other Member about the landlord and tenant legislation because he was in Government when the original was drafted.  During the Seanad contributions, tribute was paid to all sides and the feeling from the Seanad debates was that this was everybody's child.  When Deputy David Andrews wound up the debate he was very generous in stating, as reported in the Seanad Report of Wednesday, 2 May, 1979 that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cooney's views in this regard have prevailed and it is only proper that I should thank him for <Col N="857" /> bringing the matter to the attention of the House and, having done so, to give credit where credit is due and acknowledge the authorship to which Senator Cooney's name must be attached.</P>
    <P>Nobody could say that we did not recognise the contribution made by the former Government in this consolidation measure.  As has been stated by the Minister of State this is one of a trilogy. Certain things arise under this Bill and a number of things were said this morning by Deputy Keating which require an answer.  The Deputy referred to my alleged promises to flatdwellers in Rathmines.  The Flatdwellers' Association availed of an opportunity to make their representations to the Conroy Commission.  I would make it clear that when the Minister for Justice was spokesman for Justice in Opposition, I met the Flatdwellers' Association with him and we were most careful not to give any commitments which we could not stand over.  Deputy Keating said that we gave solemn commitments to the Flatdwellers' Association and that is just not true.  There is a problem in relation to flatdwellers' in the city and we know how difficult it is for students to get accommodation. However, the chief cause of this problem is none other than the Flatdwellers' Association who have harassed legitimate landlords to such an extent that they just do not want anything to do with students.</P>
    <P>I am referring to statements affecting myself which were made by Deputy Keating this morning and I feel entitled to reply to them.  The Deputy said that I had given assurances to the flatdwellers in my constituency during the last election campaign, that I had given solemn witness to the fact that we would do all sorts of things.  I deny that.  I did not wish to interrupt the Deputy while he was speaking but I feel that I have a right to reply to the allegations.  The true cause of the problem is the Flatdwellers' Association whom the Deputy represented here this morning, who put up a candidate in the local elections in the Rathmines area but failed to get him <Col N="858" /> elected.  These people are mainly responsible for this tremendous problem, the shortage of flats in Dublin.  Because of the harassment of the landlords, they are increasing their rates and are pricing students out of the market, because they do not want students who seem to have a tendency to go to the Flatdwellers' Association when they have a problem.</P>

I have stated the position and I am not intimidated by the Flatdwellers' Association who have a tendency to intimidate.  I recall receiving a phone call from them at 1.20 a.m. in relation to an eviction case in my constituency. They said that I had said that they could call me at any time.  I inquired as to the problem and asked how long it had been going on.  It had been going on since 2 o'clock the previous afternoon.  I asked why they had called me at that time and they said it was because I had said that they could call me at any time. I went around the next morning to the place in question and the landlady complained to me that the female tenant was bringing in boyfriends and that she objected to it in her house.  She also showed me where her electricity meter had been scratched and marked and alleged that money was being taken from the meter.</P>

The best advice I can give to the Flatdwellers' Association is not to harass landlords and to try to get something done.</P>
      <P>Landlords who are not carrying out their duties as landlords should be taken very strictly in hand.  There are some very bad landlords in this city.  I would put them in the criminal class.  Only recently I was in Rathmines to see an old man and his wife.  The wife was confined to bed.  The house was reeking with damp.  They are paying a rent of about £11 per week.  The landlord who lives in the country comes up to collect the rent. I have already reported the misery of the people living in these conditions to Dublin Corporation with a view to having proceedings taken against the landlord to compel him to make the house habitable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall obey the Chair.  I would not take away from Deputy Keating's sincerity but sometimes he is sincerely wrong and in many instances here he appears to be wrong.  One must accept that there are rights and wrongs on both sides.  The previous Government recognised this.  I should like to see the Minister using his utmost energy to hasten the setting up of a rents tribunal which is badly needed.  There are poor landlords as well.  There are people renting houses on a 99-year lease at a rent of £4, £5, or £6.  Landlords cannot maintain houses like that.  The tenants, as Deputy Fitzpatrick as a practising solicitor will know, can do as they like. The responsibility is on the landlord to maintain his property, maintain the outside walls, the roof and so on.  A landlord can go bankrupt.  To use the words of Seantor Alexis FitzGerald who put it so well in the Seanad, a landlord may be held up to ransom and may have to get rid of a house at any price because the longer he holds on the nearer he will be to &ldquo;going broke&rdquo;.  So, he will sell a house for £3,000 or £4,000 which would normally fetch £20,000 or £30,000 on the market just to get rid of it.  The tenant who is being advised of his rights knows this.  Such problems also exist and this Bill tries to put to rights some aspects of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with two main areas, one, as the Minister said, concerning the terms and conditions attaching to the renewal of occupational tenancies and to the award to a departing occupational tenant of compensation for improvements he may have made.  The other area concerns the renewal of ground rent leases, the area covered by the Act of 1958.  These are the two main areas. Deputy Keating said that the short-term tenant also had certain rights.  I agree but let me equate the short-term tenant with the case of the company that takes on an employee for a three-month period in an arrangement where either side can give notice to the other.  If a landlord takes in a tenant and loses his rights over the property thereafter within a certain period, if the tenant turns out to be unruly, that is just too bad for the landlord; <Col N="861" /> he made a bad choice.  That discourages more and more people from renting property.  We must encourage landlords to let property by ensuring that they also have rights and that all the rights are not on one side.  If you provide for the rights of the tenant and not for the rights of the landlord you will throw out the baby with the water.</P>
    <P>Without dwelling on it I am very sympathetic to the point that Deputy Keating made that income tax relief should be allowed to people renting property in the same way as in the case of somebody buying a home.  The Deputy seemed to be confused when he talked about the bebefits of the abolition of rates not being passed on to the tenant. This is not true in all cases.  There are many cases where the benefit has been passed on to the tenant, particularly where the rents were separate from the rates.  Many landlords, quite rightly, kept the two items separate so as to ensure that when the rates were savagely increased they did not suffer the brunt of the tenant's anger.  I would think that a large proportion of tenants got immediate rates relief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect, I saw many a bill paid by a tenant which had the rates set out separately from the rent. As a former flat dweller, my rates were separate from my rent.  Deputy Quinn knows this system exists in many instances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there are unscrupulous landlords who batten on unfortunate tenants but I think that the Deputy would agree also that there are certain tenants who rule out the possibility of landlords letting property because of the tenants' conduct.  If Deputy Quinn had a house to let in flats he would be very particular about the kind of tenants he took in, himself being <Col N="862" /> an architect and a man who would go to great pains to make sure when he had good accommodation to offer at a reasonable rent that it would not be abused, that there would be no bottle parties there.  He would be fairly selective. If it turned out that some unfortunate tenant, corrupted at university or somewhere else took drugs and drink and held parties there and if the Deputy came in and saw his carpet and wallpaper being destroyed he would be very glad to know that he had certain rights.  He would have all sorts of agreements drafted by solicitors to protect his rights.</P>
      <P>We want that protection.  We are talking of perhaps 5 per cent, or less, of students who cause many problems.  I am deeply concerned about the problem in Dublin caused mainly by the Flatdwellers' Association harassment. Unless they stop, the situation will become worse.  They are creating problems; they are throwing the baby out with the water.  Many people are now seeking permission to convert their property into offices because they have &ldquo;had enough&rdquo; of flats.  Good flats and houses are beginning to fall apart because of the treatment they are getting.  I could bring Deputy Quinn or Deputy Keating to a house straight away and show them what happened to it; it has been literally wrecked by tenants. The rents being charged by the landlords are such that they would never recover the money it would take to rapair the house.</P>

The Chair was a little more lenient with the Deputy in some of the comments he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to the rights of tenants under short leases.  It is very important, just as it is for somebody who <Col N="863" /> seeks a job and the employer, to have a right to end an arrangement on due notice by either side, or after a trial period.  A landlord must also have a trial period after which a tenant, if he or she behaves, has certain rights.  A number of measures which we introduced were welcomed in the House.  The legislation dealing with the abolition of ground rents, for example, was one of the big issues dealt with by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is possible that there is not the same demand to abolish ground rents as existed some years ago but the setting of the legal fee at £5 was a move in the right direction.  It must be remembered that under our Constitution no one has a right to confiscate.  People must be compensated but that would cost a lot of money.  I accept that this is irritating but it is not a big issue.  My mother for years was not happy about paying ground rent but we have created a condition under which people like her can buy out that ground rent at a reasonable figure.  That is an indication of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to join in the tributes paid to the Conroy Commission.  As was stated in the Seanad, Judge Conroy has become a legendary figure in his own time for the work he put into that commission. It should be borne in mind that such commissions are available for members of the public to send submissions to.  It is regrettable that Deputy Keating did not make submissions because, in the course of his contribution today, he seemed to be at variance with the work that has been done.  The commission interviewed many people and listened to many complaints.  I have tremendous admiration for those who address commissions in an effort to improve <Col N="864" /> a situation.  I should like to pay tribute to the Flatdwellers' Association who made a submission to that commission. I hope the commission will be a continuing process because we can always update legislation.  I expect to be slated by the Flatdwellers' Association for my comments about them but I am anxious that my comments are seen as being constructive.  They are intended to be helpful.  It was not my intention to deny people accommodation.  We have a responsibility to provide accommodation. I should like to make reference to some of the contributions made on this Bill in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I was anxious to refer to something which Senator FitzGerald said, a quote that would flatter him.  That Senator said that it was splendid that we have such ample opportunity to disagree on everything as everybody was accusing everybody else of having drafted the document.  He said that that meant that there could not be any possible discredit to anybody accepting a proposal from the other side, assuming that the other side intended contributing to the debate. That was an excellent piece of good English.  This Bill is the collective wisdom of two Governments, not just of the Conroy Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating was a little too critical of the Bill.  When dealing with section 4 Senator FitzGerald made a good case for amending it but on the other hand, the Minister made a better case for retaining it.  In simple justice, one must accept that landlords of premises which are due to be torn down for urban renewal should be compensated in a reasonable way without, as Senator FitzGerald said, being held up to ransom.  Courts must have guidelines to determine the amount of fair compensation. I accept that some landlords have had certain tenants over a barrel because it would be too expensive for them to move their long established businesses elsewhere, whether it is a shoemaker shop or a dry cleaning establishment. That happens when a big enterprise moves into an area because the value of property increases.  A good example is Wood Quay.  When the new civic offices are erected there the adjoining properties will increase in value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. White</b> asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the estimated stock of herring in the Celtic Sea, and the estimated quantity taken by foreign trawlers in 1978 when ostensibly fishing for mackerel.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that 1,276 tonnes of herring were taken by foreign vessels during 1978-79 season as a by-catch of mackerel fishing which is allowed up to a maximum of 5 per cent. These catches together with an estimated catch of 2,725 tonnes by Irish vessels had the effect of reducing the stock by the end of the season to an estimated 5,000-6,000 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum stock level recommended by the scientists before fishing is allowed to resume is 40,000 tonnes.  It will be seen therefore that this stock is in <Col N="867" /> a very critical state and that any fishing effort at this stage will seriously prejudice the recovery of this herring fishery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that 1,276 tons were supposed to have been taken.  The Dutch have permission to fish up to 5 per cent.  Is the Minister aware that the Dutch and other EEC boats are supposed to be catching a much larger percentage?  What proof has the Minister that it is not 500,000 tonnes because the Dutch catch herrings and cover them up with mackerel in the holds of their ships?  Would the Minister not give a guarantee that all fishing by Dutch and other EEC trawlers will stop immediately until there is proper supervision, or will he guarantee compensation for the south-eastern inshore fishermen who have no alternative source of fishing or of earning their living available to them for the next six months?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reply to the main thrust of the Deputy's supplementary question which related to the by-catch operation of other EEC countries, particularly that of the Germans and Dutch.  I propose to raise this in a very substantial way at next Monday's meeting of the Council of Ministers.  I have already probed the ground in this area.  I am hopeful there will be a result which will mean the abolition of any by-catch in regard to herring by any boat in the Irish Sea, in the Celtic Sea, so that there would be a total ban operating there, not alone as far as Irish fishermen are concerned, but also as far as outside fishermen are concerned, in other words, no herring caught in the Celtic Sea.  That is my objective in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may be seeking a total ban and perhaps he is right in that; I am not certain.  But is the Minister aware that herrings are being sold at £1.50 to £2 each in Germany?  If the Minister does not get his way next <Col N="868" /> week could he not arrange to have fishery protection officers on each Dutch or EEC boat that comes in here to fish? If they are playing the game and catching only 5 per cent, as they are allowed, they could have no objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been a number of boardings by Irish naval vessel officers of Dutch and German vessels&mdash;this is not part of the question&mdash;over the past number of months.  In no case were they found to be exceeding the by-catch.  But I am still satisfied&mdash;and I take it this is the sense of what the Deputy is saying&mdash;that the abolition of the by-catch provision is the only real way to deal with that and this we are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is one of the reasons I share the Deputy's concern. We will be moving on Monday next to have the 5 per cent by-catch entirely removed, so that removes exactly the Deputy's qualms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

Has the Minister any plans to do anything about this serious problem which stays with us?</P>

      <P>There was a very full statement in the newspapers.  As far as BIM are concerned, all the repayments will be looked at sympathetically and there will be a deferment of repayment in any cases of hardship.  The closure in regard to the Celtic Sea is in the interests of the conservation of the herring fisheries for the benefit of the fishermen concerned.  The fishermen recognise this, although Deputy L'Estrange may not. The closure of the Celtic Sea was first introduced, rightly, by the Coalition Government three years ago.  We are maintaining that closure.  I hope that all will take a responsible attitude in this matter because the conservation of fish stocks is basic to the conservation of fishing peoples and the communities in which they are involved.  The whole thing is interlocked and I am satisfied that the responsible people in our fishing communities recognise what I am saying as being absolutely right.</P>

They are not satisfied when Dutch boats can come in, sweep up the herrings, and get away with them with no proper supervision while Irishmen are prosecuted if they go out to fish for herring. Is that not true?  We have no way of guaranteeing that they took 170,000. They could have taken 500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Deasy</b> asked the Minister for Tourism and Transport the percentage by which the Government subsidy to CIE has increased since 1972 compared to the general increase in Government expenditure and the cost of living, and the approximate cost of CIE fares and charges if Government subsidisation had been maintained at its 1972 level in real terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The subvention paid to CIE in 1978 was £37.7 million compared to £8.3 million in 1972-73, that is, an increase of 354 per cent.  I understand from the Central Statistics Office that total current expenditure by Central Government in the same period rose from £658 million to £2,509 million, an increase of 281 per cent, and that the consumer price index rose from 138.65 to 307.7, an increase of 122 per cent.  It will be seen from these figures that the subvention to CIE has been increased to a much greater extent than the general level of Government spending or the general cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the increase in the CIE subvention since 1972-73 had been restricted to the <Col N="881" /> rate of increase in the consumer price index, the subvention in 1978 would have been £18.4 million, that is, £19.3 million less than the actual subvention paid.  It is not possible to indicate precisely the extent to which CIE fares and rates would have increased in that event, because of the hypothetical and intangible considerations involved including the likelihood of consumer resistance and the fact that the level of business in the various CIE services would have been affected differently.  It is clear, however, that if the subvention to CIE had been increased to a lesser extent, the levels of fares and rates would now be much higher then they are.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that when CIE were set up the then Fianna Fáil Government promised, to quote their words, a &ldquo;more efficient and cheaper service&rdquo;?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 13, 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>On 31 May 1979 I issued a statement announcing that the Government had decided on the electrification of the Dublin rail service from Howth to Bray at an estimated cost of £46 million. There are no proposals at this stage for the electrification of the line between Howth Junction and Balbriggan or between Bray and Greystones.</P>
      <P>I understand from CIE that detailed design work on the Howth-Bray project is under way and that approximately 20 people are now engaged full-time in this work.  Employment for about 280 persons will be provided during the course of implementation of the project and the expected completion date is the end of 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the possible extension of the existing suburban network, the Transport Consultative Commission which I established in September 1978 are giving priority consideration to urban road and rail passenger services and will no doubt take account of all such <Col N="884" /> proposals including proposals for a rail rapid transit system for Dublin, prepared for CIE by a firm of consultants.  I would expect that the commission's examination of these matters will include consideration of all relevant factors including the effects of population growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recent population returns for the area between Greystones and Bray, the massive growth of population in that area and the tremendous increase in commuter traffic between Greystones, Bray and Dublin would the Minister have a further look at the apparent rejection of the proposal to electrify the Bray to Greystones section? This seems to warrant a re-examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no suggestion of rejecting anything.  The Government decided on what was put before them by CIE, the electrification of the Howth-Bray line.  They came to a decision they would do this.  In so far as the other areas mentioned in those questions are concerned the Deputy can take it that surburban rail services to the north of Howth and to the south of Bray and also the existing bus services along those particular routes will be dovetailed with the electrified rail system.  I believe this will be a very considerable help.</P>

      <P>I do not want to fall out with you over this but the Minister gave a reply in which he more or less shoved the entire weight of exercising a discretion and judgment in this matter on to a <Col N="885" /> commission.

The Government took a decision, which the Opposition had stated on numerous occasions would not be taken, on the electrification of the Howth-Bray line. With regard to this consultative commission I already stated on numerous occasions that they were considering the whole situation in relation to urban areas, particularly Dublin, and within their considerations would be the question of the other aspects in the report I have referred to.</P>

I am aware they did not seek to have it extended to Balbriggan or Greystones.

The rail services from Balbriggan and Greystones, and also the bus services which are running in those areas, will be integrated in this and I have no doubt will be able to deal with any extra passengers that are likely to need these services.</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 13, is the Minister aware that the current expenditure by Dublin County Council on the south-Dublin main arterial route is £1 million per mile?  Having regard to such enormous expenditure on that dual-carriageway, is it not ludicrous that electrification of the rail system should cease at Bray especially when there will be a massive growth in commuter traffic coming on to that dual carriageway and which will have to use private cars to come from the major growth area of Greystones to Dublin and when CIE are using data <Col N="888" /> that is based on the 1971 census which, consequently, is out of date?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>A formal investigation under the Merchant Shipping Acts into a shipping casualty is normally held only when an Irish-registered vessel is involved. In this collision, which occurred outside Irish territorial waters, no Irish ship was involved.  An investigation into the collision would be a matter for the Government of the country in which the ships are registered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

      <P>The system of marine search and rescue in the State involves a number of rescue agencies, whose activities in any marine emergency are co-ordinated by the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Shannon Airport. The agencies are: The Naval Service, The Air Corps, The Coast Life Saving Service, The Coast Radio Stations at Valentia and Malin Head, and a number of port radio installations, The Garda Síochána, Shannon Air Rescue Co-ordination Centre (if aircraft are in distress in maritime areas), The Royal National Lifeboat Institution.</P>

      <P>The position about medium frequency radio coverage off the south-east coast is that there are a number of marine radio stations on the west coast of Britain which, like Valentia and Malin Head, maintain a constant listening watch in accordance with international arrangements. These stations provide ample coverage for shipping in the south-east area and there would be no point in duplicating the already adequate facilities by providing a further manned coast radio station to serve the area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of granting increases in redundancy compensation payable under the Transport Acts has been examined in my Department as sympathetically as possible on a number of occasions over the past few years, but it was concluded on each occasion that provision for better terms would not be justifiable.  The main reasons were:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Firstly, there is a basic difference between normal retirement pension and redundancy compensation.  A retirement pension is normally earned by the completion of 40 years' service while redundancy payments are intended to compensate the redundant employee for loss of employment and are intended to cushion the effects of what is hoped to be only temporary unemployment.</P>
      <P>Secondly, under the national redundancy scheme redundant employees now receive a lump sum payment only, whereas the special provisions of the Transport Acts provide for annual sum payments for life in the case of an employee with over five years' service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly the compensation provisions of the Transport Act, 1958, were very generous, the maximum amount of compensation being an annual sum equivalent to two-thirds of pay at the time of redundancy, and were not to my knowledge equalled in any other country. The compensation, which continues for life, is not affected by social welfare benefits and is not subject to abatement in respect of earnings from other employment apart from employment with <Col N="901" /> a Government Department, local authority, statutory body or State-sponsored company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the Minister's inhibitions about accepting index linking or any improvements in this fairly small pension, would he be willing to consider individual cases where other supplementary incomes of the various recipients of this pension might be so small as to mean that they were very hard pressed, because £6 to £9 a week is very little? Presumably when the figure was set it was intended to relate to the cost of living and costs generally.  Daily that money is becoming increasingly insignificant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot single out individuals in the circumstances he has outlined.  Other bodies would be more concerned with that aspect than my Department.  The legislation has laid down a particular level which, as I mentioned in my reply, is generous, the maximum amount of compensation being an annual sum equivalent to two-thirds of pay at the time of redundancy.  I could not change that for individuals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said by the Opposition that the Bill does nothing to improve the housing situation.  The purpose of the Bill is not to improve the housing situation but to update contractual arrangements, to consolidate existing legislation and to improve it in some instances.  One of the arguments during the debate in the Seanad on section 4 of the Bill related to an amendment which sought to bring the State under the same control as others.  As agreed with Senator Alexis FitzGerald, the Minister will be introducing an amendment on this section.  When Senator Cooney was Minister for Justice he incorporated section 4 into the Bill on the same basis as did the present Minister for Justice, that is, to protect the majority of people.  Harbours, airports and so on have to be protected and should not be subject to the provisions that apply to private companies.</P>
      <P>When I referred to the £5 legal fee as being all that was involved in the buying of ground rents, Deputy Keating disagreed that there were many people buying out their ground rents.  My information is that, despite a concerted attempt by ACRA and Fine Gael for the legalisation of the non-payment of ground rents, 3,000 applications have already been processed and 10,000 applications are awaiting processing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating confused the availability of flats with the laws governing flats.  This Bill has nothing to do with the availability of flats.  I believe that the control of rents should be handed over to the Department of the Environment as they are more suited to this function.  I urge the Minister to have this function handed over to the Department of the Environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CiaranMurphy" hpid="Mr. C. Murphy Mr. C. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, 1979.  A commitment was given that the Government would look at the situation in relation to landlord and tenant law.  The effect of that commitment has been a trilogy of Bills.  The first one was the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978 and the second one was the Landlord and Tenants (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act. This Bill completes a 50- to 60-year period of the landlord and tenant code. This is a very complex field and it is only proper that a commission should examine the whole situation.  I pay tribute <Col N="930" /> to the work of the commission and exhort that they press on with their deliberations, because, as time goes on, new changes will come.</P>
      <P>This is a Committee Stage Bill, the central theme of which offers a formula for the renewal of expired ground rent leases and deals with the general law governing ground rent leases.  Many representations have been made to me, not alone under this Act but in regard to the law on covenants, even to the extent of asking that a Private Members' Bill be introduced to cover an individualistic point.  People on all sides of the House recognise the urgent need for such legislation.  The Minister said in his Second Reading speech, that it would probably have been much better to have had a single consolidating measure, but that this would take time and the situation was urgent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change from what I term the old ten-year situation, where a tenant had to be in occupation for the immediate three years prior to the date of termination and also for the seven preceding years.  This has been changed to a much more satisfactory time factor of three years of business tenancy, which is a wonderful step forward and a big breakthrough.  The Bill also allows for an unplanned break within this three-year period; if the court considers such a break to have reasonable grounds, it would be exempt from the three-year period, which is welcome.</P>
      <P>The definition of the term &ldquo;business&rdquo; has been widened in scope to encompass local authorities.  These have difficulties with existing accommodation and have to try to take out some form of occupation agreements.  I am glad that they are encompassed, together with various sporting, cultural and charitable organisations.  I hope the Minister, in his reply, will deal with this aspect in more detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill clearly augments the right of occupational tenants, giving them a new tenancy, after 20 years' continuous occupation, of up to 35 years, instead of the present 21 years.  This extension of the period is very welcome as offering, not alone security of tenure to the individual <Col N="931" /> involved, but an opportunity for him to raise finance on the collateral, or on the strength of this lease.  With the present situation of the 21-year extension, after fixing the money adjustment, no consideration could be given to renewals at intervals of so many years, so people on year one of a 21-year extension might have to pay an exorbitant or rather, up-market price simply because a court would have to permit that to compensate the landlord.  The provision of rent review after a five-year period will ease considerably the situation for an occupational tenant.</P>
    <P>In the area of tenant improvements, in the event of the tenant leaving the tenancy on termination of a lease, previously there was a precondition attached that an improvement notice had to be served on the landlord.  This advance notice is no longer essential and cognisance may be taken of work and improvements done by the tenant.  This must have the welcome effect of maintaining and improving existing housing stock.  Furthermore, under the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill a tenant can carry out improvements, even against the wishes of the landlord, if it is deemed that the landlord's objections have not sufficient substance.</P>
    <P>The Bill also recognises the necessity for urban and commercial renewal.  We have had situations where a tenant with a definite agreement has been able to hold up what would be genuine progress, or genuine renewal of an urban or commercial nature of a whole area.  I welcome that changes are being made only on very stringent conditions, relevant to the landlord and that any form of bogus effort is avoided, only a genuine effort on the part of the landlord to develop the property being accepted.  I am glad to see that planning permission is embodied in this and that the rights of such a tenant are protected and further enshrined.  Progress cannot be hindered beyond a certain level, but if a tenant has an extremely good lease&mdash;I cannot remember the exact details&mdash;he might be entitled to some form of percentage of what might amass in the cash property <Col N="932" /> value of that area.  This is a considerable advancement and strengthening of his position.</P>
    <P>As I said before, I found the Bill to be extremely complex, complicated and legalistic, very difficult for a lay person to examine with a high degree of accuracy. There are few of us with the necessary training for that.  I would compliment those who have done such good work in preparing this piece of legislation. I once more pay tribute to the commission and join with many members in their appreciation of the work of the chairman, Mr. Justice Conroy.  I look forward to hearing and perhaps participating in the teasing out of the various matters on Committee Stage because that is where the real factors will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>With those few words I welcome the completion of this trinity of bills which honours a commitment already made and is a factor which will see the revision of the past 50 or 60 years' landlord and tenant law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I would like to say a few words about the Landlord and Tenant Commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Conroy.  Many of the men who worked with him and who are no longer with us left behind this legislative monument by their hard work and unpaid efforts on behalf of the community. We know because of our history that the very mention of the word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; can be quite emotive.  I am glad the Minister has brought in this interim legislation.  One might ask why there is no consolidating Bill before the House but that will come eventually.  In the meantime we have this Bill which is highly technical and, as somebody in the Seanad said, more a Committee Stage Bill.  At the same time it is another step in the programme of the State to bring about equity in ground rents, equity which in real terms will mean fair play both for the tenant and the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the landlord the fact that he owns a patch of ground and gets a rent for it is not the most important thing.  Very often the landlord is in fact the planning authority.  Because of his <Col N="933" /> decision or whim he can rule out a project planned for that piece of land by refusing to grant a new lease.  In this city of ours there is much obsolescence so far as property is concerned and much of this can be attributed to landlords who want to hold on to the land because they realise the property they own will grow more valuable all the time.  Therefore no attempt is made to keep property in good condition.  It may be said that in one case there is a very large foreign landlord agency operating here and, while not to our liking generally, in fairness to them their property is always well maintained because they have been very strict landlords.  The tenants, whether they were commercial or domestic, were not very impressed but at the same time, by their adherence to a strict code of maintenance of buildings, they ensured that their property was well kept.  On the other hand we have people who do not want the property well kept and in some cases will not even bother to collect the ground rent.  They realise that month by month the property is getting into worse condition and will have to be pulled down eventually extinguishing the ground rent but leaving a nice site for a prestigious office block or other building. So there is more to it than the mere granting of a lease or paying of ground rent.</P>
    <P>The Minister said earlier on that in his trilogy of Bills and Acts and possible further legislation which will be necessary we will eventually forge a process which not alone will give a tenant justice in his dealings with landlords but will also give the landlord justice.  It will also play a very important part in our whole planning process.  I hope that in the not too distant future we will have a real system of control of ground rents apart from whatever financial return the landlord will get.  I am not against the landlords making a profit provided it is a just profit and can be justified whether it be in the law courts or in the court of public opinion.  This is what is aimed at in this further Bill here today.</P>
    <P>The Bill may be amended as the Minister mentioned and some may be thinking of further amendments.  I look <Col N="934" /> on the Bill as a planning control as well as being equitable legislation.  Some years ago in Dublin a valuable piece of land was held by the local authority and under the old legislation they had to sell out at a nominal sum to the people who wanted to develop the area and I suddenly realised how powerful the landlord had become because, although he had not broken the law, he had used it very cleverly on his own behalf.  It is a reflection on us if we cannot draft legislation in such a way that it will be used for the common good and not just for the good of the people who happen to own the land.  This is a very technical Bill and not a very easy one for the layman to examine or contribute to but we should ensure that not alone will it be fair to the landlord and to the tenant but that it will be for the common good.</P>
    <P>The rights of property are subject to the common good and the community is entitled to the full protection of the law. The interest of the mass of the people should not in any way be injured because we strive in the first place to ensure that the landlord is given an equitable position.  The tenant in most cases will not be able to influence the development of an area very much; if he keeps his house in order and keeps up its appearance that is as much as he can afford to do.  There are some very big landlords and some big property deals going on all the time.  Many of these landlords are non-nationals.  We are part of the EEC and must not be insular in outlook but we should see that our legislation cannot be abused by anyone.</P>
    <P>Many sites in this city may have become derelict because of economic forces and lack of money for development, but there are those who want to see property become obsolescent so that it will have to be pulled down eventually and a new lease created for a new project.  I am not against development but it should be in the interest of the community at large.  We should be jealous of our rights as citizens and perfect our legislation so that it will be effective in ensuring justice for both landlord and tenant and prevent anyone using the <Col N="935" /> law to further his own narrow interests.</P>
    <P>I have seen many changes in dealings with landlords.  Some years ago the renewal of a lease was a source of great worry, especially in the case of a domestic tenant.  People want to own the land on which their house stands and the Government have made it possible to buy out ground rent fairly easily.  I know there is a school of thought which would abolish ground rent altogether, even without compensation.  I do not support that view because if the ground landlord has spent money on improvements he should be given his just reward.  Let us make sure, however, that he will not laugh all the way to the bank at the expense of people who have to compensate him in an unjust way.  Many an unfortunate tenant would try to pay up rather than have any trouble.  We should stand firm on this and tell both landlord and tenant that we will not be unfair and that each has a contribution to make towards the community in general.  We must ensure that the law is held to be sacrosanct and must try by every action, both inside and outside this House, to bring home to people that the national Parliament is serious in its efforts to draw up effective legislation.  The very word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; can be emotive in this country and it is up to us to fashion this Bill as a weapon of justice for landlord and tenant.  The Minister mentioned that there may be further legislation.  The Government are aware that the landlord and tenant problem must be dealt with as quickly as possible but we cannot finalise the legislation in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In cases of doubt as to ownership of land, the local authority could be given guardianship of that land until such time as ownership is established.  It should not be allowed to lie vacant because the landlord is unknown.  If one wishes to prosecute under the Derelict Sites Act it is often impossible to find out who owns the land in question.  It must be cleared up at the expense of the local authority but only a certain amount can be done. Local authority guardianship of such land would prevent cities and towns from a general air of obsolescence in <Col N="936" /> cases where landlords do not want to do anything with their sites.  There was the famous case in London of a building which was never let because the landlord felt that the level of potential rents would get higher every year.  The local authority there had to devise some legislation to compel him to let the building.  Here we have landlords who will hold on to sites without developing them or else wait until they get whatever kind of planning permission they want. The landlord and tenant aspect is central to this problem.</P>
    <P>This Bill may be more for the lawyer than the layman, but the layman also has a part to play.  I may suggest some amendments to the Minister because I feel the Bill could cover planning and development as well as the landlord and tenant area.  It may help to remove friction which exists between landlords and tenants, though this has reduced in scale during the past 20 or 30 years.  This Bill will improve the lot of the tenant, the landlord and the whole community.  I shall speak again on this Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. D. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis na Teachtaí a labhair ar an mBille seo.  Táim anbhuíoch díobh go léir.</P>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who spoke on this complex Bill. Deputies Keating, Quinn, Aherne, Fitzpatrick, Vincent Brady, Briscoe, Murphy and Moore spoke and I am grateful to them for their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in my introductory remarks, the purpose of the Bill is to up-date the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, and the Landlord and Tenant (Reversionary Leases) Act, 1958, on the basis of the changes recommended by the Landlord and Tenant Commission. Purely as a matter of consolidation, certain provisions of the Rent Restrictions Act and of the 1963 Planning Act have been included.  We are consolidating the Acts I have named and we are improving in some respects a number of the sections contained in them.  In addition, we have deleted certain sections of the <Col N="937" /> legislation we are now consolidating where it was found that the legislation was too complicated to operate or where it was not used since its introduction.  It could have been described as redundant legislation and, consequently, it was not consolidated into the proposed legal instrument we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>This is a consolidation measure.  What was good in 1931 need not necessarily be bad in 1979, as has been suggested. What was relevant in 1931 can be just as relevant today.  Deputy Fitzpatrick is a solicitor and undoubtedly he brought his experience to bear in his contribution. He said that the 1931 Act was a very good Act.  As he admitted himself, when his Government were in power they produced the legislation we are discussing now, they included in it the ground rent legislation and they proposed to include it in one package.  Fianna Fáil came to power and we decided to separate the two measures.  We decided to have ground rent legislation on its own account and we now have this legislation which consolidates the Acts of 1931 and 1958.  We considered it would be more efficient to do this.  It was just a matter of opinion.</P>
    <P>The legislation we are discussing here was in draft form during the twilight days of the term of office of the National Coalition and much of what we are discussing was contained in that draft legislation.  We found what the Coalition did to be acceptable with regard to this matter and we believed it was the proper way to proceed.  This is not to underrate the originality of the thinking of the present Minister with regard to the legislation before us.  He charged his officials to examine the legislation to see if it could be improved and the officials, with the concurrence of the Minister, decided that the Bill needed betterment.  That is what we have done.</P>
    <P>This matter was debated in the Seanad.  With the greatest respect to the Dáil, I must say that the Seanad has some of the best legal brains in the Oireachtas.  I am thinking specifically of Senator Alexis FitzGerald.  His knowledge of this kind of legislation is <Col N="938" /> absolutely invaluable in the case of any Bill going before the Seanad.  The value of his and other contributions and the contributions today in this House have been extremely worth while.  This Bill has been improved very considerably as a result of all the stages I have outlined and eventually, when it is passed, it will prove a very worth-while measure.</P>
    <P>I do not want to undervalue the contributions by Members of the Dáil.  They have been most valuable.  Deputy Moore mentioned the layman's approach to this subject.  I do not think that makes any difference whatever.  I do not think that a professional mind necessarily produces good legislation.  The man who goes among the people daily can bring valuable experience to bear when we are discussing legislation of this kind.  That experience and the knowledge of the professionals complement one another.</P>
    <P>We have been discussing this Bill all day.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, the way to deal with each section is on Committee Stage.  It would be a physical endurance test, to say the least, to have to deal with all sections now, because this very complicated legislation contains 83 sections.  I am not being discourteous or disrespectful to those Members who contributed so ably to this debate today and I wish to tell them that I shall deal in depth with whatever points of view they may wish to put forward on Committee Stage.  If I do not give all the answers they require now it is not because of discourtesy but rather a desire to deal with the matter in more depth on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite, including Deputy Keating and Deputy Quinn, mentioned the National Private Rental Law Reform Group, which is an association of rent controlled landlords, and the National Flatdwellers Association.  Certainly the name of the National Flatdwellers Association was thrown around with some abandon by both sides of the House.  I have no personal experience of dealing with the National Flatdwellers Association and I do not intend to enter into a controversy about them.  But I made inquiries in the Department of <Col N="939" /> Justice and neither of these organisations made any attempt to see either the Minister for Justice or myself in relation to this Bill.  Deputy Keating may say that he articulated the views of the National Flatdwellers Association here and that is a fair point to make.  As Deputies know the door of the Department of Justice is always open to organisations like these to discuss their views on what should be contained in any legislation which might affect them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They made a submission to the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that, but one must distinguish between the functions of the Law Reform Commission and the functions of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keating's contribution is similar to contributions that I made on a number of occasions from the backbenches of Fianna Fáil in and out of Government.  No one can deny that his submission is based on an urgent wish for social justice for people living in poor housing conditions.  Nobody can deny that in Dublin some people are living in housing conditions which would be more appropriate to the Dublin of the 1920's before the Fianna Fáil Government did something in the early 1930's to wipe out the appalling tragedy that was in the centre of the city.  Today some people are still living in similar conditions, and that is one of the tragedies of life.  I do not know whether they bring the condition on themselves or whether the landlords out of ignorance or because they are speculators produce the condition.  When people go into these flats they go into them with their eyes open.  If the flat is in very poor condition the people should not go into them.  On the other hand if a flat which has been lived in by the same person for a number of years has deteriorated it is either the flatdweller's or the landlord's fault that the flat has not been improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Keating's contribution shows his undoubted awareness of the problems.  If we were to deny that these <Col N="940" /> conditions exist we would be deluding ourselves, but things have improved and the social conditions of today are far better than the conditions that prevailed 20 or 30 years ago.  There is an air of prosperity abroad, but whether that prosperity is shared evenly is a subject for another day's debate.  Deputy Keating's contribution might also be the subject of another day's debate.  We cannot dismiss the Deputy's contribution because it was not quite relevant to the Bill before us as that would not be fair.</P>
    <P>The Bill updates the 1931 and 1958 Landlord and Tenants Acts and it does not purport to deal with shortages of accommodation whether it be private rented accommodation or otherwise.  I agree with the proposal put forward by Deputy Keating in relation to the provision of local authority flatdwellings for young people who cannot get flats in the ordinary way because they have just got married and are perhaps expecting a baby and the landlords will not have them.  In those circumstances the local authorities might consider the production of temporary dwelling units for these people at a reasonable rent.  The rent generally asked for in an ordinary private rented flat is exorbitant and these people find it harder to buy their own homes.  I applaud Deputy Keating for putting forward that idea, even if it is not original.  I welcome any progress in that regard, even though it is not directly relevant to this legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred in some detail to a letter by Senator Eoin Ryan who is our party Director of Elections about flatdwellers and about the suggestion of setting up rent tribunals.  As the Chair pointed out, and as I point out, this is really a matter for legislation in the area of rent control, which is a separate code from the landlord and tenant code.  The Deputy also mentioned the question of discrimination and urged that there should not be any discrimination by landlords against tenants because of their race, colour, sex or creed.  There is no suggestion that these rights are in any way being infringed under this Bill, as might be implied by <Col N="941" /> Deputy Keating's contributions.  Senator Ryan's letter might have been written arising from the previous four-and-a-half years of inactivity in this area.  I imagine that the letter by Senator Ryan was written out of a sense of the need to get the job moving.  We are getting on with the job.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald might not believe that we are getting on with the job, but let us be clear about it: this is the third of three pieces of legislation on the subject we are discussing.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is misinterpreting me there.

      <P>I think Senator Eoin Ryan's letter was based on a desire to put right what was left undone in the previous four-and-a-half years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that in my contribution.  Deputy Keating mentioned section 60 of the Bill and asked about repossession from a tenant protected by the rent Acts.  As I pointed out, section 60 cannot be used to repossess from a rent Act protected tenant. The tenant must hold under a release for between three and 25 years. No rent controlled tenant would hold under such a lease.  I refer him specifically to section 60 (2) in that regard.  Deputy Keating brought up another point which was not unreasonable but whether it was relevant on this occasion is another matter. He spoke of offsetting rent against income tax.  That is a very fine point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that the State should intervene in relation to flat dwellings and try to prevent the reduction in the stock of such dwellings. I do not know if the State should intervene. The rent Acts are produced by the State and flat dwellings operate under the State.  In the cirucmstances that was direct intervention and whether that is a good or a bad thing I do not know.  I think the State should continue to do its best in regard to the production of more single house units and get away from the production of flat units, particularly high rise flat units.  My view is that with our increasing population we should be producing good houses with small gardens for the mass of the people.</P>
      <P>Section 60 was referred to extensively by a number of Deputies who in some way tried to impute that it was unfair to the tenant.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The section was introduced to deal with compensation on the termination of a tenancy in obsolete buildings.  If we want decent housing accommodation why should we complain about getting tenants out of obsolete buildings which are perhaps in danger of falling down?  That is what we are talking about.  When the landlord wishes to develop the area the tenant is very well protected.  There is no question of his rights being undermined in any regard. The landlord must apply for planning permission and while that application is being processed the tenant will have an opportunity either to protest against or concur with permission being granted. That is one line of defence.  The application will go to the local authority.  If it is appealed it will go to An Bord Pleanála and the tenant can have a second bite at the cherry.  Thus there are two lines of defence open to the tenant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that before the tenant has to leave the premises the landlord has to go through this procedure and seek planning permission for the area where the tenant is situated.  If the landlord succeeds with the local authority the tenant has the right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála. When the landlord gets planning permission he deals with the tenant.  If they cannot agree between themselves the court takes over and decides how the tenant should be treated.  I would be very concerned if I felt that either a tenant or a landlord were unjustly treated under this section.  There is a fair balance in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fine point which I will deal with in greater detail on Committee Stage.  In my view section 60 is fairly couched in the interests of the landlord and tenant because in the final analysis when a court awards compensation for the termination of a tenancy the measure of the compensation will primarily be related to the financial loss, damage or expense which the tenant sustains or incurs.  It was suggested that in the circumstances the tenant should be rehoused immediately by the landlord. That is a reasonable point but I imagine a court in the circumstances will take into consideration in compensating the tenant the cost of a new house and of <Col N="946" /> replacing the tenant as near as possible to the position he was in in the tenement which is the subject of the litigation.  In my view section 60 has a fair balance.  I have no doubt that that point of view will be argued against on Committee Stage when we will have the usual friction between the Opposition and the Government side.  I am grateful to Deputy Keating for his contribution.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn suggested that the Bill be sent to a select committee.  There is a lot of merit in that suggestion.  This is a big Bill which will take up a lot of the time of the House on Committee Stage. A lot of time was devoted to it in the Seanad by the worthy legal luminaries there.  Some fine, obtuse and obscure points were brought up in the Seanad and they were gone into in detail.  I do not know whether the time of this House should be taken up with the Committee Stage of a complex Bill like this.  I will bring this matter to the attention of the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip and I have no doubt that Deputies Quinn and Keating will refer it to the Chief Whips of their parties.  I would be willing to deal with this Bill in a select committee because I believe it would be dealt with more efficiently and speedily.  If it was sent to a select committee the House could proceed to deal with other legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quinn welcomed certain provisions of the Bill, particularly those in relation to business leases in the commercial world generally in Dublin.  He referred specifically to the section which deals with the 21-year lease.  The difficulty there was that up to recently under a 21-year lease a rent had to be fixed for 21 years.  The rent was at a grossly inflated rate to make it worth the landlord's while to lease the property.  The Landlord and Tenant Commission recommended that there should be a rent review every seven years but the Government took the view that in the event of a court adjudicating on this the period of the rent review should be five years.  We are all aware that the value of money depreciates annually and for that reason I believe a five-year review was a proper one.  I should like to state that the Bill is for the use of landlords and tenants <Col N="947" /> in relation to their rights.  The courts will have to be given some guidelines in relation to this matter.  I believe the decision to permit a rent review every five years represents a considerable improvement.  However, the points raised in relation to that can be considered in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quinn raised the question of young couples trying to procure housing accommodation, a matter which is not strictly relevant to the Bill.  It is my view that, generally speaking, people are fairly treated by landlords but some very mean people will not take in a young couple who have a baby.  That is unfortunate.  In addition, I am aware that some landlords when they hear that one of their tenants is expecting a baby seek to evict them. That is all in the general area of social justice.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that I should include in this Bill a flatdwellers' charter and a provision for the setting up of a rents tribunal.  Much as I would like such a charter to be incorporated, with all its attendant good, I must point out that such a suggestion is not relevant to this Bill.  It may be relevant to the housing Acts or some other Acts for which the Minister for Justice is not responsible.  I shall deal with the question of a rents tribunal in more detail before concluding.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Quinn that overall responsibility for the private rental sector might be contained in one area, might be taken out of the Department of Justice and placed with the Department of the Environment, or with some section of that latter Department.  I understand that that situation has been examined. I am grateful to Deputy Quinn and I have no doubt that when we reach Committee Stage he will bring undoubted knowledge gleaned from his professional life as an architect to bear on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy B. Ahern was correct in saying that this Bill is not the end of landlord and tenant legislation generally. There will be a gap between this and the next Bill.  Nobody denies that, but we hope it will not be a long one.  We would <Col N="948" /> hope in time to consolidate the totality of landlord and tenant legislation in one Bill.  Indeed nor is it the end of the prospect of the flatdwellers' charter which has been bandied about here by Deputies opposite.  But I should think that the legislation required by Deputies opposite in this respect might be incorporated in a Bill to be introduced by some other Minister than the Minister for Justice.  The Deputy wanted a number of definitions&mdash;an occupational tenancy is one where the landlord owns the bricks and mortar interest and a ground rent tenancy is one where the tenant owns the bricks and mortar interest. I am not quite certain what point he was making there, but if the Deputy would like to discuss the matter further with me I shall be glad to help him in that regard.  I think Deputy Ahern referred also to section 48 of the Bill and said that the landlord could be prejudiced by the non-service of notice, for example, if (a) he could have done the improvement himself more effectively or at less cost by securing an improvements undertaking, or (b) if he would have been entitled to sustain an improvements objection had a notice been served on him. That answer might help the Deputy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, who brought his experience of legal practice in rural Ireland to bear on the Bill, made the point that it is good as far as it goes but that it does not go far enough.  He mentioned also the Landlord and Tenant Commission appointed in January, 1966, which had produced a number of reports within a fairly short space of time thereafter.  The Bill with which we are dealing and previous legislation was produced on the basis of recommendations of the Landlord and Tenant Commission. We are, in the main, now enacting that legislation, some people might say belatedly, but nonetheless it is being done.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal specifically with section 4, which I know will cause a lot of controversy when it comes to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  This relates to the question of the State's exemption from this legislation: in other words, that the State in its capacity as a lessor or immediate <Col N="949" /> lessor of any premises, will not be bound by the landlord and tenant code.  Perhaps I may refer to a few notes here.  Up to mid-1976 it was generally held that the Landlord and Tenant Acts did not bind the State as lessor and all previous legislation in this area was drafted on that assumption.  Proceedings that were taken in 1976 by a tenant of the State led to that assumption being called in question for the first time.  The provision in section 4 simply resolves the doubt that arose in that case although this doubt has never been given the authority of any court decision.  Certainly we take the view that there is no reason to fear for the position of tenants of the State.  Assuming that section 4 stands in the Bill when enacted into law, the situation of such tenants will remain what it always has been: on the basis that the State is and always was exempt. If there are difficulties for tenants of the State those difficulties would surely have been brought to notice long before now. Indeed, a State authority must be more awake to any criticism of its operations than a private landlord since it can so readily come under public scrutiny.  The reasons for the exemption of the State, as landlord, from the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts lies in the recognition that the role of the State as a landlord is not the same as that of a private individual or corporation. Whereas in the latter case the ownership and leasing of lands and property represents an entrepreneurial activity motivated by profit, the State is normally involved in the ownership and leasing of lands and property incidental only to its administration of such lands and property, possession of which by the State is necessary in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might be permitted to give couple of examples of what I am speaking about and to which Deputy Briscoe in his worthy contribution adverted.  The first is that of the Minister for Tourism and Transport, who owns tracks of land in the vicinity of the three State airports, ownership of which is necessary in order to ensure against development of the land in a manner that would inhibit airport operations.  The second example is <Col N="950" /> that of the Minister for Defence, who holds lands adjacent to certain military installations for purposes similar to those I have outlined in connection with airport operations.  Additionally, most leases of land made by or on behalf of the Minister for Defence include a proviso that possession of the lands may be recovered at any time if military exigencies so demand.</P>
    <P>That is not to suggest for one moment that it is not my intention to put right a feature again adverted to in the Seanad, that is the situation where a tenant is a tenant of a private landlord and the private landlord is bought out by the State, and the tenant finds himself in a rather invidious position.  It is my intention to examine the possibility of introducing an amendment ensuring that tenants' rights in those circumstances are protected.  But, let us be clear about it: when a tenant becomes a tenant of the State he goes into a property or properties knowing the State to be the owner and in those circumstances goes in with his eyes open.  Again, in those circumstances he must accept on his legal advice the restrictions placed on him.  On the other hand, if a tenant goes into a premises belonging to a private individual and thereafter the State takes him over in those circumstances he is entitled to protection.  It is my intention to take a very serious look at section 4 to ensure that such individuals' rights are protected.</P>
    <P>I am most grateful to the Deputies who contributed.  I should not like it to be thought that by virtue of my not dealing with some of the points I am in any way dismissing them.  Quite the contrary. It is my intention to revert to many of the points I may not have touched on on this occasion, and that is not out of any discourtesy to the Deputies who so ably contributed.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>With a view to investigating the possibility of establishing a new economic source of energy a five-year programme for fusion research formed part of the initial programme of the European Atomic Energy Council (EURATOM) on its establishment in 1958.  This has since been followed up by a number of pluriannual programmes adopted by the EEC Council of Ministers on the proposal of the Commission.</P>
      <P>Ireland supported the programme adopted by the Council of Ministers in March 1976 subsequently varied to include the construction and initial operation of the Joint European Torus (JET), a large experimental nuclear project which will enable fusion research work to be extended up to conditions close to those in which a commercial reactor would operate.  In May 1976 the Government formally authorised signature of an agreement whereby Ireland became a member of the joint undertaking to implement the JET Project.</P>
      <P>A new five-year (1979-1983) Research Programme in the field of controlled nuclear fusion intended to take over from the earlier programme has been presented by the European Commission for decision by the Council of Ministers.  This programme which is still under consideration comprises the construction and assembly of JET and a complementing general fusion research programme.  In line with the Government's policy on fusion research Ireland has so far supported adoption of the programme.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the Dublin inner city.  I have not had a request from Dublin Corporation to designate inner city areas in order to enable them to grant, at their discretion, rates remission on industrial buildings.  Moreover, I do not consider that this incentive would contribute significantly to the industrial development of this area.</P>
      <P>The most serious obstacle to the promotion of industrial development in the Dublin inner city are the shortage of suitable sites and the high cost of land. The Deputy will be aware that the Industrial Development Authority are at present undertaking an extensive programme of site acquisition and factory construction in the area.  To date the authority have acquired almost ten acres of land and have constructed 3,562 sq. metres of factory space.  A further 19,192 sq. metres of factory space is planned.  The IDA expect that these factories will, when occupied, provide work for 1,200 persons, the authority also plan to grant aid the creation of a further 800 jobs at other inner city locations over the next two years.</P>
      <P>The Government announced in May 1979 that they had decided to establish an Inner City Group which would report to the Minister for Economic Planning and Development and whose main function would be to develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the inner city.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 10 July to a question about the use of chemicals in livestock rearing and food production generally and about the protection of consumer health in this regard.  I pointed out then that, while I have certain control functions regarding chemical pesticide residues in fruit and vegetables and the use of antibiotics in animal production, the question of consumer health protection is primarily a matter for the Minister for Health.  Since then, I have announced my intention to make regulations controlling the availability of antibiotics for use in animal husbandry. These are intended to minimise the risk of undesirable residues being found in foodstuffs of animal origin.  The farming community is constantly being urged by my Department when using chemical preparations in the course of their work, to respect the manufacturers' instructions with regard to the method of administration and the withdrawal period to be allowed to elapse afterwards.</P>
      <P>A certain amount of monitoring of foodstuffs for harmful residues is at present being carried out by my Department and also by the private sector of the food industry, for example, at milk processing plants, and certain EEC legislation now in the pipeline will require an intensification of this activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 358 and 359 together.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any new motorway plans for Dublin city and county.  The Dublin City and County Manager was requested on 13 October 1976 to review the motorway plans for the Dublin area recommended in the Dublin Transportation Study.  Following this request, discussions were held with the manager to clarify the type of review required.  At these discussions the manager was informed of concern in regard to the cost, environmental and energy factors involved in the proposed motorway system.  No further policy discussions have been held with the corporation on the manager's review.</P>
      <P>In his review, which I received on 18 January 1978 the manager stated that the best approach would be to build all-purpose roads to a reduced standard on the proposed lines of the motorways, which would be capable of upgrading to motorway standard at a later date if it is so decided.  He indicated that the matter would be considered by the elected members of the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>The manager's review was then considered by the three road authorities concerned, Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  Dublin County Council adopted the manager's review.  Dublin Corporation on 26 February 1979 adopted in principle the manager's review, including the recommendations in the review for deferment of a decision on the Royal Canal route and postponing the Fairview spur which were proposed in the Dublin Transportation Study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> The corporation, by resolution dated 2 July 1979, proposed to amend the 1976 Dublin City Draft Development Plan to incorporate, <i>inter alia</i>, the road proposals approved in principle on 26 February 1979.  These amendments are currently on public display, and representations received will be considered by the city council before the final revision of the new plan for the city is approved.</P>
    <P>I understand from Dublin Corporation that present indications are that approximately 100 houses may be directly affected in their administrative area by the proposed Eastern By-Pass.</P>
    <P>I have no information on the number of houses that would be affected by the revised proposals in the manager's review for the construction of all-purpose roads on the balance of the motorway lines proposed in the Dublin Transportation Study.</P>

The current proposal envisages that the Exchequer would not be required to meet any part of the cost of the project.</P>
      <P>There is a specific procedure provided in section 4 of the Bill referred to for dealing with objections to toll schemes but, pending its enactment, the question of my receiving objections to any particular toll scheme would not arise.</P>
