      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if his attention has been drawn to a newspaper report (details supplied) concerning a statement purported to have been made by the Government Press Secretary relating to a Dublin advertising agency on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party; if the Press Secretary made the statement referred to and if he will indicate the particular rules governing civil servants which permit action in the political field such as this.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it a correct inference from what the Taoiseach has said that the Government Press Secretary was misreported in <i>The Irish Press</i> by indirect quotations as making a statement in relation to Fianna Fáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>When I met the British Prime Minister in London on 10 May we had a brief discussion on Northern Ireland in the course of which the Prime Minister indicated that she hoped her Government and herself would have time to become familiar with all aspects of the situation.  We agreed that a further meeting could be envisaged for a suitable occasion in the future to discuss matters of common interest. That remains the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not time the Government made their position quite clear on Northern Ireland? Does the Taoiseach not agree that Ministers calling for British withdrawal and Members of the House who were former members of that party saying there is no difference now between&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harte must know that it is not a question of whether it is serious or otherwise.  It is a question of whether it is in order.  The question relates to the Queen's speech and the Deputy is now proceeding to ask questions about Northern Ireland initiatives, which is not the question on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the question on the Order Paper.  I am asking the Taoiseach if it is the Government's intention to take any initiative on Northern Ireland? With respect to you, I have heard debates here at Question Time on a group water scheme for Ballydehob.  This is a very serious matter and I would like, with your permission, to pursue it.  The Government are almost two years in office.  They waited on a change of Government in Great Britain to see what would happen.  Are we now to wait another two years before the Government will make up their minds and tell us what will happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will agree with me that the initiative is required from the British Government. That initiative was not expected in the light of the uncertainty leading up to the British general election, which was anticipated in October and ultimately took place only a few weeks ago.  The British Prime Minister indicated to me that she would like time for the Secretary of State in Northern Ireland, initially, and for herself, ultimately, to get a fuller knowledge of the whole situation.  I thought that was a reasonable suggestion from her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a very negative approach for the Taoiseach to say that he will wait on the British Government and the British Prime Minister to make up their minds, we will call on the British army to withdraw their guarantees to the Unionist community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not the way in which the policy of this Government differs from that of their predecessors in this area, bearing in mind that during the Twentieth Dáil the Taoiseach repeatedly asked the then Taoiseach for an initiative on the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

      <P>I shall be meeting some heads of Government, informally, at the signing of the Treaty governing the accession of Greece to the European Communities.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that such meetings would be useful in deciding on the priorities to be followed during the Irish Presidency of the Council? Would the Taoiseach indicate what such priorities would be?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that meetings arranged now would have much effect on the priorities.  In any event I do not think meetings between heads of Government should take place hastily: there should not be any question of &ldquo;dropping in&rdquo; if anything substantial has to be discussed.  Our initiatives will be made known at the proper time.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this is the time to be considering the priorities to be pursued by us during the Irish Presidency, which occurs, after all, at infrequent intervals? Could not bilateral meetings be helpful in setting out the prospects of success for such priorities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service (Mr. MacSharry) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fees due to census enumerators are being paid on an instalment basis.  To date three such payments have been made in practically all cases and a fourth is about to be issued.  A fifth and final instalment will be made as soon as possible but this must await an overall assessment of each enumerator's work and must also take account of liability for income tax and social security deductions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>There has not been any delay.  In almost all cases three instalments have been paid.  In cases where it has not been paid they were not entitled to it because of the amount of work they had to do in the first place.  If the Deputy would sit down I would reply to him, if he does not mind.  All fourth instalments due will be paid in early June and the fifth and final instalment must await the assessment of the enumerator's work, because it is a bonus for the work they have done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to compare these two sets of examinations because of the difference in the programmes and structures on which they are respectively based.  It is our view, however, that a grade in a subject at ordinary level in the leaving certificate examination is higher than the corresponding grade in that subject at the GCE ordinary level examination but lower than the corresponding grade in the GCE &ldquo;A&rdquo; level examination and that a grade in a subject at higher level in the leaving certificate examination approximates to a corresponding grade in the GCE &ldquo;A&rdquo; level examination. <Col N="1044" /> The acceptance, in Northern Ireland and England, of leaving certificate examination results depends on the standards required by many different institutions.

      <P>It is estimated that about 300 teachers over and above normal requirements will be available from the beginning of the school year 1979-80 for further improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio. These teachers are not an identifiable group within the total number expected to be available, which number is expected to include about 250 persons &mdash;some trained abroad and some returning to the service after interruption&mdash;who will be in addition to the number of 935 teachers completing training this year who were referred to in Question No. 6 of Thursday, 22 March 1979.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of this rule in the matter of the payment of capitation grant in respect of a suspended student depends, <Col N="1051" /> of course, on the particular circumstances of the case in question, for example, the number of actual attendances recorded, the length of the period of suspension, the decision ultimately taken in regard to the removal of the suspension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have for many years actively encouraged the use of newspapers as a classroom resource in appropriate circumstances.  This encouragement is given in the context of in-service courses and of work on resources and methodology during inspection. There are also official recommendations in regard to subjects such as Irish and civics.  Newspapers are considered appropriate as support materials in many areas of curriculum, such as modern languages, economics, geography, business organisation, home economics.  Excerpts from newspapers of the past are frequently used as source materials in the teaching of history and have, in fact, appeared on examination papers.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to encourage continuation and extension of this policy as appropriate.  It must be borne in mind, however, that the choice and use of classroom resources is primarily a matter for the individual teacher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state his policy in relation to the Irish language requirement for appointment of permanent posts (administrative and teaching) in (a) Regional Colleges, (b) National Institute for Higher Education, (c) Universities, (d) Colleges of Universities, (e) St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and (f) Colleges of Technology and if he will specify the requirements in respect of Irish for each post.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education to state the Irish language requirements in respect of all permanent teaching posts in regional technical colleges and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>In the case of higher teaching posts in the regional technical colleges and in the colleges of technology a condition of eligibility for appointment is the possession of the Ceard Teastas Gaeilge or a pass in a special oral Irish test conducted by an inspector of the Department  of Education.  In the case of administrative posts a knowledge of Irish of a standard to the satisfaction of the Department is required.</P>
      <P>Appointments to the staffs of the universities, university colleges and St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, are made in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions and the Minister for Education has no function in relation to the specification of the condition on eligibility for such appointments.</P>
      <P>The National Institute for Higher Education have not yet been established on a statutory basis.  The current practice in relation to the making of appointments to the staffs is that Irish is not specified as a requirement for either administrative or teaching posts except where it is considered essential for a particular post (e.g. a post in the area of Irish studies).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some regional colleges and university colleges are finding it difficult to recruit senior teaching staff because some of the applicants for whole-time permanent posts have not the necessary Irish qualification?  Would he consider changing the regulation to allow very <Col N="1059" /> highly qualified people to be appointed in a whole-time capacity in such colleges without the relevant Irish qualification as specified in the regulations but be given the opportunity to acquire the required Irish language level within say the subsequent three years?  Would he not agree that where specialised posts are concerned at the senior level in RTCs and colleges of technology there is need for more flexibility in the appointment of such staff?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the problem of the colleges in this regard and I have no plans for change but the Deputy may be assured that he will find me very ready to facilitate people who make a study of the Irish language in order to qualify themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not see that where a board of management of a regional technical college have to appoint a person with lower academic qualifications to a whole-time permanent post because he has the Irish qualification a person with a higher qualification and higher academic standing may not in the circumstances of the appointment and in the context of his application be eligible for appointment as a full-time, permanent lecturer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a system, I think, whereby the person who is not fully qualified at the time but indicates that he or she is willing to undertake the necessary Irish studies, may be appointed to a temporary, whole-time post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to differ.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Joseph Brennan">

      <P>We cannot get into an argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, the position is that where a permanent whole-time post is under consideration a person with the relevant Irish qualification must be appointed, assuming he is suitable, even though his being suitable means that a person more suitable may not get the post which I would consider a most unfortunate position.  Would the Minister agree?</P>

      <P>The information requested in section (a) of the question is given in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, will be circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>In so far as concerns sections (b) and (c) a statement of policy in relation to the relevant issues will be made in the White Paper to be prepared by the end of 1979.  I may add in reference to additional places to be provided in institutions of higher education that the Higher Education Authority has commissioned studies in this regard which, it is anticipated, will also be available by the end of 1979.</P>

      <P>In connection with the preparation of the public estimates of expenditure for 1979 the Higher Education Authority made proposals in regard to financial provision for the universities and other institutions designated for the purpose of the Higher Education Authority Act, 1971.  The authority also furnished observations on paragraph 7.33 in the Green Paper <i>Development for Full Employment</i> in which reference was made to the fees charged to students in third level educational institutions.</P>

      <P>The post was advertised in late April and early May of last year.  The board of the college decided not to make an appointment as a result of that competition. The board has appointed one of the college professors as Acting Director pending the readvertisement of the post of Director.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education the teaching and administrative posts under the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee which are held in an acting or temporary capacity; when each post became vacant and when it is proposed to have them filled on a permanent basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the information which has been made available to my Department, there are 21 teachers employed in an acting or temporary basis under the City of Dublin VEC. The majority of these appointments became operative in the current school year.  The main reason for this position is that the appointees do not hold the academic or technical qualifications prescribed for permanent appointment, that they lack the necessary qualifications in Irish or that the need for permanent whole-time appointments has not been fully established to the satisfaction of my Department.  It is expected that these posts can be filled on a permanent basis by the opening of the 1979-80 school year.</P>
      <P>Two teachers are serving as acting principals and two as acting vice-principals during the secondment of officers to other duties.</P>
      <P>There are 14 administrative posts which are filled on an acting or temporary basis.  One of these is the post of chief executive officer, which is held by a school principal in an acting capacity, pending the filling of the post in the normal way through the Local Appointments Commission.  Two further posts, that of senior clerk and college secretary, which are filled on an acting basis by junior staff, have been readvertised recently and it is expected that permanent appointments can be made soon. The other 11 posts are in the clerk-typist grade in which there are temporary appointments pending the availability of fully qualified candidates.</P>

      <P>Before formal sanction can be conveyed for such appointments it is necessary to ensure that all the statutory requirements have been fully complied with in the matter of the level of post, suitability of qualifications, selection procedures, and so on.  The time which such consideration takes varies from case to case depending on circumstances.

      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I wish to raise some matters on the Adjournment; firstly, the manner of distribution of EEC moneys to candidates running for the EEC election, for which this Government through their Council of Ministers' representation, have a direct responsibility.  I also wish to raise the question of voting regulations so far as the secrecy of the ballot is concerned.  I already had an unsatisfactory, <Col N="1102" /> misleading and confusing reply about this matter last week.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is simple and straightforward.  The form of drafting is <Col N="1103" /> rather complicated for the reasons which I shall give later on.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to remove an obstacle in the way of legislation to deal with university reorganisation.  Article 18 (4) of the Constitution stipulates that three Members each shall be elected to the Seanad by the National University of Ireland and by the University of Dublin.  A proposal to establish independent universities at Dublin, Cork and Galway in place of the National University of Ireland involves an alteration in the arrangements for the election of Members to the Seanad.  It may be argued that the arrangements for the election of Members to the Seanad in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (i) and (ii) of section 4 of Article 18 would automatically lapse to the relevant extent if one or both of the named universities ceased to exist.  In this connection, the following considerations arise&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the alternative arrangement, if any, which should be made for the election of Members in substitution for those Members which would otherwise be elected by the institution which ceased to exist: an amendment of the Constitution would be necessary for the purpose of allowing such an alternative arrangement to be made;</P>
    <P>(ii)  would it be permissible, in the absence of an appropriate amendment of Article 18 (4) of the Constitution, to enact legislation which would have the effect of altering the provision in that section of Article (18) for the election of Members to the Seanad?</P>
    <P>(iii) Could Article 18 of the Constitution be invoked to prohibit the dissolution by law of a university mentioned in Article 18 (4)?</P>
    <P>It is in the context of these considerations that it was decided to introduce this Seventh Amendment of the Constitution Bill to enable legislation to be enacted in due course dealing with university reorganisation.  The details of such reorganisation will be set out in the relevant legislation and discussion on it will take place in the debates dealing with the promotion of the legislation. <Col N="1104" /> The matter does not arise for detailed debate in connection with this Bill.  I consider it appropriate, however, to indicate in general terms the reasons for the introduction of such legislation and the form which it would take.  Before doing so I propose to make reference to the reasons for the complications associated with the drafting of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition to making provision for the possibility of the introducing at a future date of an alternative form of election of Members to the Seanad by new universities and other specified institutions of higher education, it is necessary to provide for considerations such as the following&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the preservation of the eligibility of existing Members of the Seanad elected on the university franchise during the period from the date of the acceptance of the referendum proposal and the end of the period for which the Members had been elected;</P>
    <P>(b)  the occurrence of a vacancy in the relevant university panel necessitating a by-election before the total legislative process had been completed; this process would deal with the revised arrangements for university senate representation in the Seanad following acceptance of the referendum proposal;</P>
    <P>(c)  the synchronisation of legislation for university reorganisation and the arrangements to be made by law for alternative provision for representation in the Seanad of university and other higher education institutions.</P>
    <P>The Bill as drafted takes considerations such as the foregoing into account and allows for a smooth transition from the existing arrangements to a new situation.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the subsequent legislation to be introduced after acceptance of the referendum proposal to amend Article 18 of the Constitution. This proposed legislation would comprise two Bills:</P>
    <P>(i)  A Bill to dissolve the National University of Ireland and to establish new independent universities, to be introduced by the Minister for Education;</P>
    <P>(ii) A Bill to provide by law for the election of six members to the Seanad by the institutions of higher education <Col N="1105" /> specified by law.  This Bill would be introduced by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>It would not be appropriate for me to enter now into a detailed discussion of the provisions of these Bills to which I have referred, nor am I in a position to do so.  The time for such discussion will be when the relevant Bills are being debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The present position is that the National University of Ireland (NUI) have three constituent colleges, University College, Dublin (UCD), University College, Cork (UCC) and University College, Galway (UCG).  It is proposed that NUI will be dissolved and that its constituent colleges will become independent universities at Dublin, Cork and Galway.  St. Patrick's College, Maynooth and the Colleges of Education, St. Patrick's, Drumcondra, Dublin, Our Lady of Mercy, Carysfort, Blackrock, County Dublin and Mary Immaculate, Limerick are recognised colleges of the National University.  The proposed legislation dealing with university reorganisation will also determine the future status of these colleges.</P>
    <P>The legislation dealing with the election of members to the Seanad by the institutions of higher education after the NUI has been dissolved, and new independent universities have been established, will set out how such elections will take place.  It will be in the course of the debate on the relevant legislation that the appropriate arrangements to be made for these elections will be discussed.</P>
    <P>I should conclude, accordingly, by saying that the present Bill is for the purpose of enabling legislation to be introduced in due course for the reorganisation of university structures, and that such legislation is strongly urged by the authorities of the university colleges.  It is widely hoped and expected that the present Bill will be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas in time to have the proposed referendum on the same date&mdash;5 July next&mdash;as the referendum on the sixth amendment of the Constitution dealing with adoption.  I confidently recommend the Bill to the House and I request the co-operation of the Deputies for a speedy passage for it.</P>
    <Col N="1106" />
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no disagreement on this side of the House in relation to the passage of this Bill.  We accept the need for a constitutional amendment in relation to the dissolution of the NUI and the subsequent setting up of independent universities in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  Debate on the future structure of universities will take place when the relevant legislation comes before the House.</P>
      <P>I am not very satisfied with the wording of the present Bill.  Article 18.4 paragraph (i) states that three shall be elected by the National University of Ireland and paragraph (ii) states that three shall be elected by the University of Dublin.  The whole of Article 18.4 now becomes paragraph 1 of the new Article and two new paragraphs are being added.  It is stated that provision may be made by law for the election.  The retention of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not good drafting and it would be preferable to include in Article 18.4, paragraphs (i) and (ii), after the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; the qualifying words &ldquo;unless otherwise provided for by legislation&rdquo;.  As it stands, it will not read correctly and may be open to misinterpretation and action in the courts when other legislation affecting the universities has been passed.  I would ask the Minister to consider these reservations.</P>
      <P>It is stated that provision may be made by law for the election, on a franchise and in the manner to be provided by law, by one or more of the institutions.  I understand the need for the reference to the law but I wonder what the Minister means when he speaks about a possible new type of franchise.  He referred to the possibility of the introduction at a future date of an alternative form of election of Members to the Seanad.  What has he in mind concerning a new method of election? I am not saying there is not need for a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the 1977 Seanad election the NUI had an electorate of 41,187 and the total poll from that university was 20,882, which is fractionally above 50 per cent.  I consider this a very low percentage poll. The University of Dublin had a total electorate of 8,007 and the valid poll was 5,528, a somewhat better percentage. <Col N="1107" /> Even taking into account the difficulty of getting ballot papers to graduates who may have changed addresses, there should be some obligation on a graduate to seek to have his vote recorded and to seek to have his ballot paper delivered to him.  I expect that the Seanad election as it relates to the university panel is the only election in which votes may be cast by post though the graduates are not living in the State.  To that extent the election must be unique.  A vote may be cast by a graduate living in any part of the world so long as he is in receipt of a ballot paper.  Is it the intention of the Minister to limit the vote of graduates on the basis of a residential qualification or is it the Minister's intention to limit the vote to the extent, for instance, that if a graduate has not voted in two consecutive Seanad elections, he will be disqualified from voting?  What change in the method of voting is envisaged?  Will the change be radical?  Is it intended to have an internal system of election, say, from the staffs?  I am perplexed by what the Minister has in mind and, consequently, I should like to hear from him in this regard.</P>
    <P>I value the representation of university members in the Seanad.  They have contributed much to debate down through the years in that House.  Their independence has been seen to be genuine.  In many cases, but not in all cases, they have been seen to be above politics and to contribute without the constraints of a party Whip.  That was the role that was intended originally for members of the Seanad.  That House was intended to be a vocational chamber but because of the workings of party politics it is, by and large, with the honourable exception of the university seats, a political body.  The Seanad would be a better place as a legislative assembly if it were a vocational assembly.  While appreciating the legislative problems that a Seanad in the role which was intended originally for it could create for a Government by way, for instance, of holding up legislation, the long-term interest of the country would be served better if that House were vocational in the true meaning of that word.  Though I <Col N="1108" /> would not really like to see the present legislative powers of the Seanad being changed I would advocate some attempt to re-establish the Seanad on a vocational basis.  I regret that the Government on this occasion have not considered the Seanad as a whole rather than concentrating only on the university seat question in the proposed referendum.  It is not often that we have the opportunity here of discussing the role and the effectiveness or otherwise of the Seanad.  Greater use could be made of the Seanad by way of the initiation of more legislation there.  We have not used the Seanad to the extent that the Constitution provides for.  Consequently, the country has lost an effective forum for discussing legislation.  Successive Governments have failed to use that House as an initiating assembly for Bills.</P>
    <P>On the question of university reorganisation, the last Government mooted the question of independence for the universities at Cork, Galway and Dublin and for the dissolution of the NUI.  It is the intention of this Government to go ahead with that idea and I look forward to the relevant legislation being brought before the House.</P>
    <P>The lack of reference in the Minister's speech to St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, is somewhat mystifying especially in the context of university reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so but it is not mentioned in the context of independence. The Minister has not indicated any intention to grant independent status to that college.  I am wondering whether he has taken advice on the matter.  The role of St. Patrick's College should be discussed here and the question of its future status should be discussed in public so that its potential role might be understood, that its role as the national seminary and its role also as a lay university might be understood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have preferred the Minister to have been more specific regarding his intentions for the future of the college because there is need for a clear legislative definition of its place in the university system.</P>
      <P>I understand that the original wishes of the authorities there, the Hierarchy, indicated a preference for independence though recent Press reports seem to indicate that the position of the college as a constituent college of UCD may now be considered preferable.  I do not mind one way or the other but some clarification is needed in respect of a number of matters.  For instance, there is the question of funding and accountability.  In relation to the lay university functions of the college there is the question of the role of the HEA.  The powers which they may or may not have in relation to the funding of the college have been questioned and need to be clarified here in a legislative capacity.  There is the question also of the use to which the funds should be put.  So far as I am concerned we could not give enough funds to any third-level educational college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for greater funding for all universities is accepted fully but there is a need to know the role of the HEA in relation to Maynooth college and for satisfactory accountability. I am not saying for a moment that moneys so far have not been accounted for but there is a need for more clarity in respect of the funding of the lay university at St. Patrick's College.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the need for clarification relates to the vexed question of appointments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not deal with it in depth, but merely say that the lay university established in St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, should have the same equitable appointment system as exists in the other constituent colleges of the National University of Ireland and that lack of an equitable system in the eyes of many teachers, many lecturers, is unfortunate.  The Irish Federation of University teachers, especially, have expressed reservations about the appointment system.  The High Court case of two lecturers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall desist.  Another matter dealt with by the Bill before us is the matter of the grouping, or otherwise, in relation to the Seanad election.  I quote the Bill &ldquo;A member or members of Seanad Eireann may be elected under this subsection by institutions grouped together or by a single institution&rdquo;.  I understand the need for drafting the Bill, pending legislation.  There are a number of alternatives open to the Minister.  I should like some insight into the Minister's intention.  Does he intend giving geographical representation?  For instance, may we expect a Senator to be elected from Galway and a Senator to be elected from Cork, or is it intended to group the newly formed independent universities for the purpose of electing, say, three Senators?  Is it intended to group the colleges receiving degree recognition from the National Council for Educational Awards for the purpose of electing, say, one Senator?  What mechanism does the Minister intend using?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a difficult problem.  There is a <Col N="1111" /> need to ensure representation from Trinity College that would be acceptable to the House.  At present, there are three Senators for 8,000 graduates, whereas the NUI have only three Senators for an electorate of 41,000 graduates.  Nevertheless, the contribution of Trinity College down the years has been very welcome, and valued by us as politicians.</P>
    <P>I should, also, like to see representation from the west of Ireland in the form of a representative from University College, Galway, and representation being assured for the graduates from the degree holders of the NCEA.  The rise of the non-university third-level sector is welcomed by all in this House as something we value as a society which is growing, maturing and meeting the demands of European life today.  We value it and should recognise it by representation in the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I do not envy the Minister's task in bringing about a satisfactory grouping, whether it is to be on a geographic, a university, or a non-university basis.  We should have a discussion on the Minister's intention here today.</P>
    <P>I should like, also, to discuss the time schedule in relation to the legislation governing the reorganisation.  When may we expect this legislation?  Will it be in this Dáil or years ahead?  May we have assurance from the Minister that the legislation will be made effective before the next general election?  I trust it is not intended to leave the matter on the long finger, the constitutional reform having been brought about.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the future of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, and the Colleges of Education&mdash;St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, Our Lady of Mercy College, Carysfort, and the Mary Immaculate College in Limerick&mdash;which are recognised by the National University of Ireland.  What is the intention in respect of these colleges?  Is it intended to give them constituent college recognition, or is it intended that they be allowed to have independent structures, or to be grouped together and connected with one or more of our universities?</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the <Col N="1112" /> proceedings.  We can discuss the matter on Committee Stage, but would the Minister consider the possibility of amending the words used in the Bill, in order to achieve a more satisfactory wording?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is no small matter to be amending a constitution and it is some time, to put it mildly, since a constitutional amendment was introduced by a Minister for Education.  Although I do not object to this happening, it strikes me that the Taoiseach having basic, overall charge of the Constitution, it might be regarded as more appropriate for him to introduce the amendment. However, I am not going to raise any quarrel on that issue, and am glad to see the Minister for Education here with this amendment.  In passing, it might be worth noting that the office he holds was held at an earlier stage by a university representative from the Oireachtas, the late Professor Eoin MacNeill.  He was not a university representative of the Oireachtas, but was elected by the graduates of the National University of Ireland after the Redistribution Act of 1918, to represent them at Westminster. Good man though he was, he saw fit not to take up that onerous responsibility in Westminster, but it is a fact that the present Minister for Education, in political lineage at any rate, is one of a chain of men one of whom owed at least part of his political career to the graduates of a university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second thing which we need to take into account here is that we are not only amending the Constitution, which is a serious thing in itself.  If I may be more accurate, we are not only offering the people of Ireland the opportunity to amend the Constitution; we are offering them the opportunity of amending it in a particular way and we are introducing&mdash;or giving them the opportunity of introducing&mdash;into the Constitution a new principle.  The new principle involved is that the election of a certain number of Members of the Oireachtas hitherto carried out by university graduates should henceforth be carried out not only by university graduates but by graduates from other institutions.  I do not propose the extension of the principle <Col N="1113" /> of educational representation, if one may put it thus, in the Oireachtas, but it needs examination and it can be talked about in some detail.</P>
    <P>To some extent we are dealing here with a pig in a poke.  We have not been told in any great detail, or in any detail at all, about the Minister's precise intentions in relation to the distribution of the six seats which are currently voted for by the graduates of Dublin University and the National University of Ireland.  I suspect that the major debate that will take place will be on whatever formula the Minister chooses to adopt when the Minister for the Environment brings in the appropriate legislation.  The debate will in turn centre on the issue of whether one should have representation by institutions or whether one should have a large global constituency electing the required total number of members.  I propose to reserve my position on this issue because the Minister has not adverted to it and perhaps it is not even strictly relevant, but I daresay that this will be where the major debate will take place.</P>
    <P>Even at this stage it is possible to indicate at least some of the options open to the Minister.  The National University of Ireland have three constituent colleges and Dublin University have one.  If each of these institutions together with their associated colleges were to be given one seat to themselves that would leave two seats of the six for grabs, as it were. Even that would, as a solution, lay itself open to objections from some sources in that it would give some institutions far greater representation for a graduate than others.  No doubt the Minister for Education and the Minister for the Environment will be grappling with these problems and will let us know the result of their deliberations in due course.  No doubt they will be getting plenty of free advice on the matter both from the universities and the other institutions of higher education concerned.</P>
    <P>The principle which we are discussing and offering the people of Ireland the opportunity to amend through this legislation is a very old one.  It is none the less odd for being old, but it is old.  It goes back in relation to Irish Parliaments to <Col N="1114" /> 1613 when the University of Dublin obtained the right of returning two Members to Parliament.  This right continued until the Union of Great Britain and Ireland in 1800 when only one Member was returned to the Imperial Parliament and the right of voting for MPs was, initially at any rate, confined to Provost, Fellows and scholars.  The situation continued unchanged until 1832 when the Irish Reform Act created a new situation under which the University of Dublin obtained the right of returning two Members of Parliament and the right of voting was extended to include ex-Fellows and those who had obtained the degree of Master of Arts or higher degrees in the University.  In order to have the right to vote on this register of Dublin University from 1832 onwards you had to pay £1 a year, the equivalent then, I suppose, of the 2 per cent levy or something like that.  It must have been quite a lot of money in 1832 but, presumably, not too much for the well-heeled university graduates of that time.</P>
    <P>In 1918 the Redistribution Act added the National University of Ireland to the category of institutions entitled to elect representatives to the British Parliament. Professor Eoin MacNeill was one of those representatives.  Events took a rapid course of change after 1918 and in 1922 the question arose for the first time as to whether the university representation which had hitherto existed in relation to the British Parliament should be transferred to the native Irish Parliament, Dáil Éireann.  It is interesting to note that in that debate there was not a division.  Various people spoke on the resolution in connection with the Constitution which was involved at that point.  Some people were against it but there was not sufficient weight of opinion to divide the House on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to look at some of the rationale for introducing this mechanism into the Dáil at that time.  One of the possible objections raised to university representation in the Dáil was that people would have plural votes, that they would be entitled to vote both in their natural geographical constituencies and in their university constituencies.  I <Col N="1115" /> suspect that one of the reasons why this constitutional amendment had such an easy passage was that the right of plural voting was abolished.  In other words, graduates of the universities concerned had to make up their minds whether they were going to vote in their university constituencies or in their geographical constituencies.  Once having made up their minds they were not permitted to vote in both.</P>
    <P>The proposer of the amendment to the Constitution on the principle of university representatives was Professor William Magennis, who made a fairly detailed speech in support of his various proposals and stressed two points which were to recur in the general debate on this process over the years.  The first was the rightful voice of education in politics. The Official Report of 4 October 1922, column 1109, Volume 1, reports him as saying:</P>
    <P>Now you have in this, the University representation, an opportunity to go back to an earlier conception of the social fabric, in alignment of its elements. In the old Gaelic days an t-ollamh&mdash;the professor&mdash;was next to the King.  I think without asking for social privileges such as were attached to that office, that we might at any rate do something here in our institutions that would mark a public sense of the Gaelic spirit's desire to honour education&mdash;the great spiritual, the great vitalising influence.</P>
    <P>This was one very strong strand of the debate at that time.  It was backed up by another strand which was an argument which held not so much force then as it does now, even though today it still does not hold as much force as it ought.  It was that in giving particular political representation to universities one is not really legislating for an élite since the universities were less and less the preserve of an élite.  In a way it is sad to look back to 1922 and 1934 and the other years of these debates and to read in the statements made the degree of misapprehension under which very well-known and very well-educated people themselves were about the accessibility of university <Col N="1116" /> education to the ordinary mass of the people.  Contrasted with the 1830s it was certainly very substantially greater but not as great as it might have been and not as great as it is today.  It might be argued that even today university education is not as accessible to many people even as some of the politicians and statesmen who spoke in the 1920s and 1930s thought it was then.</P>
    <P>To give an indication of the general impression, I will quote from the debates concerned.  When Professor Magennis was advancing his case, he said, at column 1108 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>I look forward to the time</P>
    <P>&mdash;He was anticipating rather than stating the situation that existed&mdash;</P>
    <P>when the university graduate voter, in this University representation that I venture to claim for you, shall include every stratum of the population, when he shall have&mdash;and there is no incompatability whatever in it&mdash;men of every walk of life, engaged in all varieties of occupation, who have received this university stamp as a result of higher studies, and of having undergone what we claim, at least&mdash;the broadening and widening influence of university study and university culture.</P>
    <P>Later on, especially in 1934 when the question of removing the seats from the Dáil came up, some of the speakers were similarly insistent as part of their defence that the university electorate was by now no means an elite.  In 1934, for example, there was one Fianna Fáil Deputy&mdash;I believe his name was Tom Kelly&mdash;who objected, though not so strenuously as to vote against it, to his Government's proposal to abolish the university seats in the Dáil.  He quoted the speech of Thomas Davis to the College Historical Society in 1840 and in particular his phrase, &ldquo;I tell you, gentlemen of Trinity College the peasant boys will soon put to the proof your title to lead them&rdquo;.  At the time Deputy McGilligan was under the touching if somewhat inaccurate belief that 90 per cent of the students and graduates of universities were the sons of peasants or the sons of peasants at one remove.  Deputy Costello went so far as <Col N="1117" /> to aver at column 527, Volume 52, of 1936, &ldquo;Everybody at the present moment in this country has an equal opportunity of getting into university&rdquo;.  Sadly, of course, it was not true in 1936 and it is not true today.</P>
    <P>The proponents of university representation in the Dáil were lucky because they were not seriosly opposed in 1922.  In 1934 there was a very different situation.  There was a Fianna Fáil Government in power.  They were not in power by very much and had considerable difficulty with the Seanad as then constituted.  Their difficulty was not only confined to the Seanad but to the university representatives in the Dáil who were making the then Government's majority somewhat more precarious than it otherwise might have been.  It is not difficult to see in the sequence of events that occurred in the mid-thirties and late thirties part of a very deliberate logic by the Fianna Fáil Government of the time to remove some of the political problems that faced them in their early years in Government.  In doing so they had some rationale because the question of giving university representation in the Dáil was very much, certainly by the thirties, a concept which it would be difficult to defend wholeheartedly.  The problem was that at that stage the Seanad was going through a sea of fire.  The simple option which might have solved the problem of transferring them from the Dáil to the Seanad did not exist.  It existed in 1937 and was put into operation at that time. At the time they were abolised in the Dáil it was not altogether quite as easy.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the political logic of the needs of the Government of the day, it is difficult to deny that, if you have a Seanad in which there is <i>ab initio</i> the question of indirect representation, universities have as much of a right to be represented there as anybody else, especially in a situation in which the Seanad is supposed to be a vocational body.</P>
    <P>The question of plural voting has not been abolished.  It is technically possible in this day and age for one person, assuming he were Taoiseach, to have at least 14 votes for the Oireachtas.  He has <Col N="1118" /> 11 in that he nominates directly on his own word 11 Members to the Seanad. He has one in his geographical constituency where he resides.  He has another, either as a Member of the Dáil or as a member of a local authority, and he could have two more if he were a graduate of the two universities.  That is a fair amount of plural voting and it is technically possible for one man to exercise all those votes, some of them very important votes, in an Oireachtas election. Granted that the Seanad is allegedly a vocational body, there seems to be no reason why the universities should not have the right of representation transferred from there to here.</P>
    <P>In passing, I must refer to one aspect of this problem which was dealt with by Deputy E. Collins when he pointed out that the University Senators had a reputation of being independent, that they were in some sense above politics. It is true that some University Senators have had the good reputation of being above politics.  It is also true that many of them have been extremely political.  I would deprecate&mdash;and I imagine Deputy Collins would too&mdash;any suggestion that politics was something to be above. Independent University Senators are free from the tyranny and constraints of the party whip but they are not free ultimately from the right to vote and the obligation to vote.  Voting is a political action whether you take a party whip or not.  The best Independent Senators that I have known have not been shy to exercise that right and that responsibility which they have been put there to do.</P>
    <P>Politics embraces people outside the political parties as well as inside them.  If there was a wider acceptance of the fact that the stuff of politics is the stuff of daily existence and the bread and butter issues that affect people in their ordinary everyday lives we might have a healthier political climate.</P>
    <P>The question in relation to representation of the universities in particular is one that has also excited a fair amount of argument from time to time.  It is interesting to note that one of the few people to oppose the 1922 development in the Constitution was the then Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Thomas <Col N="1119" /> Johnson, who said at column 1117, Volume 1:</P>
    <P>The education test is put forward, but I maintain that the fact that men or women have graduated in a University does not fit them any more for the selection of representatives than the fact that men have become fathers, and women have become mothers, or men have done military service, or men have gone to sea.</P>
    <P>At column 1120 of the same debate, Deputy Sears asked: If the universities, why not the churches, the farmers, the trade unions, the teachers?  Later on in the same debate Cathal O'Shannon, who was a Labour Deputy, in an intervention which to some extent mirrors what the Minister has brought before us today, said at column 1126: &ldquo;But in that whole educational body, I would want to insist that everybody connected with education activity throughout the country should form the Constituency for representation&rdquo;.  So the Minister's proposal has a lineage and it is an honourable one.  If education is a constituency it should be a constituency not unnaturally cribbed and confined.  The Government in 1922 was, interestingly enough, divided on the issue and perhaps not surprisingly.  Deputy O'Higgins came in at column 1121 to say:</P>
    <P>Deputies will probably hear with a certain relief that there is no official attitude on this particular question,</P>
    <P>A column later he was venturing into the realms of prophecy with the statement:</P>
    <P>The National University may, for instance, break up into several Universities.</P>
    <P>This was in 1922 so the Minister's action in that regard also has a lineage which goes back as far as 1922.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proportionality of the voting within the six seats which are at present disposed of by the two true universities, the situation has changed over the years.  When Deputy Sean T. O'Kelly was introducing the Constitution Amendment (No.23) Bill in 1934 to delete university representation from the <Col N="1120" /> Dáil he pointed out that in Dublin University one Dáil Deputy was elected by 1,087 people; in the National University of Ireland one Deputy was elected by 1,552 people and nationally one Deputy was elected by 11,699 people. The case he made for abolition of the university seats in the Dáil, for all that if may have been prompted by the Government's political needs at the time, was a fairly strong one and he saw fit to reply at the time specifically and in advance to the potential accusation that in doing this the Government were doing down the Protestant minority in this country.  It is not unreasonable to assume in fact that the original 1922 amendment which gave three seats to Trinity College, despite its relatively small number of graduates, may have been the result of some behind the scenes discussions and agreement between the statesmen of that time.  Certainly, reading through the debates, it is very difficult to escape the impression that there had been some prior discussion on the basis of which university representation was to be given to Dublin University in the Dáil as part of an effort at the very beginning of the foundation of the State to assure Northern Irish men and women, many of whom went to Trinity and were graduates of Trinity, that the new State had something to offer them, that it was not concerned to discriminate against them and that it would, if anything, give them representation in the Parliament of the country out of all proportion to their numbers.  Deputy O'Kelly, when he was introducing the Bill, referred specifically to this problem and referred to the potential accusation that abolishing university representation in the Dáil would be a blow against relationships between North and South. At column 481 of Volume 52 he said:</P>
    <P>To make such a claim now is but to plead that the interests of the minority are not identical with those of the nation as a whole, and any fears which members of that minority may have felt as to their treatment at the hands of their fellow-citizens must have been dispelled long ago.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to Deputy O'Kelly there may still, from time to time, be <Col N="1121" /> fears that have not been dispelled but that is by the way.  The fact is that it was seen then as an issue important enough by the Government of the day for them to make specific reference to it.  The most telling speech on that occasion in that debate was made by the late Deputy Lemass in Volume 52, column 518 and 519, in which, with a very cool and devastating logic, he demolished the claims of the universities for special representation in the Dáil.  There is also the general question and the secondary question of whether or not the universities are entitled to be represented in the Seanad.  Deputy Lemass at the time was referring to the Dáil and the way he put it was this:</P>
    <P>The question which this House has got to answer is: why a graduate of one of our Universities, whether he lives in this country or outside it, whether he pays his taxes to our Exchequer or to some foreign Exchequer, should have the same rights of representation in this House as ten persons who are not graduates?</P>
    <P>He went on at column 519:</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to secure equality of political rights in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass's speech provoked indignation of a high degree on the opposite side of the House and provoked statements such as I imagine few university Members of the Oireachtas would want to stand over today.  One of them, Professor Alton, at column 529 of the same volume said:</P>
    <P>This doctrine of the same rights and that all men are equal, is not true to life or nature.  It is false physiologically and it leads to political disaster.</P>
    <P>That was a fairly extreme statement for a university professor in 1936 as I am sure the Minister for Education would agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of themes lying behind this whole question <Col N="1122" /> of university representation in the Oireachtas and before I conclude I would like to mention them both very briefly.  One I have already referred to and I will refer to it briefly again and that is the question of the North.  The other question, ironically enough, was the role of the late President Eamon de Valera who, though Chancellor of the National University of Ireland at the time, was promoting legislation which effectively denied its graduates representation in the Dáil.  There were politics in this, of course, of a high degree and it is ironic to note that some of the university representatives in the Dáil who are members of the Fianna Fáil Party were prevailed upon to vote themselves out of office.  This was an act of self-abnegation on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party which I do not think has happened before or is likely to happen again for a long time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>They may well have been and Deputy Kelly will no doubt instruct us on the medicinal processes that were arrived at after that.  It is interesting to note of course&mdash;and this was adduced by the Government of the time&mdash;that Convocation of the National University, which is the assembly of all the graduates of the National University, passed a resolution urging that the university seats be abolished from the Dáil. On the other hand it is fair when we talk about Convocation of the National University to remember that as the body representing all the graduates of the university it is a very unwieldy one; it can effectively be led and controlled by a relatively small group of people and its policies can be so directed as well and I suspect very much that that is what happened in this case.  The Senate of the National University itself discussed the matter and there was a division within the Senate on the matter in which the Chancellor of the University was in the minority, or so we are led to believe. These currents and eddies were going backwards and forwards through all the debates on this legislation.  In fact, one speaker in 1922 referred to the fact at column 1120 of volume 1;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> One Professor could do as much damage as it would take one million Professors to make good in twenty years.</P>
    <P>From later exchanges it was plain that the Deputy he was referring to was in fact Deputy de Valera and he was corrected on the point that Deputy de Valera, the late President, had never been a professor in the National University of Ireland although he had applied for a job in University College, Cork, for which he was recommended by my grandfather and which he failed to get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not much more to say but I will make a few more points. One of them is in relation to the role of universities in politics.  I do not believe that there is anything ignoble in people in the universities being involved in politics or anything ignoble in people who are elected by the universities to be actual or professing politicians of whatever party.  One of the sub-themes that echoes through the debates on the whole question of university representation has been the attitude of Governments in power to particular universities. In fact, Deputy Lemass in his speech advised one university which he did not name but which from the context was plainly Trinity College to welcome the legislation abolishing the university representation in the Dáil because he said that the fact that they were effectively a pocket borough for one political party did them no service at all in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years later, another Fianna Fáil Minister, the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, during a debate on the legislation necessary to correct certain appointments <Col N="1124" /> in University College, Dublin, referred to the management of that institution as a &ldquo;Fine Gael junta&rdquo;.  It is not entirely unknown for universities and politics to become intermingled. Underlying it all is one fundamental point which I should like to bring to the attention of the Minister and urge on him in the context of the Bill.  A particular aspect of the representation of Trinity, in particular in 1922, and I daresay also in 1937, was the intention of the legislators on both occasions to give some kind of a voice in the National Parliament to Irish citizens who happened to have been born and bred in Northern Ireland.  The decision in 1934 to abolish university representation in the Dáil was seen by some people as an attack on that principle, on Trinity College and, indeed, on the Protestant minority in general.</P>
    <P>Professor Eoin O'Neill, in his speech reported in the Official Report of 23 April, 1936, Volume 61, column 1509, stated:</P>
    <P>In my belief this Bill was brought in here simply and solely as an attack on Trinity College.  And so, the cry goes up: &ldquo;Is Trinity ever to be forgiven?&rdquo; Through Trinity it is an attack on the Protestant minority.  This whole ramp is an anti-Protestant move.  We are engaged in a Protestant man-hunt. That is the bald fact.  As I regard this Bill and this policy, it is a Protestant man-hunt that is being indulged in by the so-called followers of Wolfe Tone.</P>
    <P>Harsh words, even for 1936 and for Professor O'Neill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>Not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but it is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will suspend judgment on the truth or otherwise of it and I am sure the Minister will be glad to comment on it.  I have quoted that statement for the purpose of bringing the attention of the House to the fact that the <Col N="1125" /> representation of Trinity specifically has been seen by many people over many years as an indirect form of representation for our Northern brethren in the central democratic institution of the State.</P>
      <P>I would argue that if the individual representation of Trinity is to be removed&mdash;we have no indication yet whether it is or not&mdash;could the Minister give us some indication of his further intentions in this regard?  Would he envisage, perhaps, the possibility of using this particular mechanism to extend the right of representation generally accorded to university graduates to graduates either of universities or of other institutions in the North of Ireland who are Irish citizens?  It seems to me, if there is any argument at all for institutional representation or for limiting the representation of a certain number of seats to particular institutions, that we have an opportunity of affording to Irish men and women born and bred in the northern part of this country who hold Irish passports, who are not ashamed to describe themselves as Irish, who are the graduates of Irish educational institutions, a right to vote directly in elections for Members of one House of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to consider that as a possibility and, if necessary, to organise discussions with the relevant institutions concerned to see what degree of goodwill there be for such a proposal. At present we have the anomalous situation whereby graduates of Irish universities in this part of the island who may or may not be Irish citizens&mdash;there is no effective way of policing that register to make sure that they all are, despite the best efforts of the university authorities&mdash;and may not be living in Ireland are entitled to vote for Members of the Oireachtas whereas graduates of other Irish institutions who are Irish citizens born and bred and may want to vote for Members of this Oireachtas are not entitled to do so because they live in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment which would make this possible would be in the Schedule and this can be discussed again on Committee Stage.  It would be quite simple, <Col N="1126" /> one would simply delete the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; or &ldquo;sa Stáit&rdquo; and replace them with the words &ldquo;in Éirinn&rdquo; or &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo;.  That would not tie the Minister's hands and it would make it possible for him to make a genuine openhanded gesture to the people I have described.  It would make it possible for him to make a gesture that was both political and educational towards anybody born, bred and educated on this island who might like to claim the same rights in relation to university representation and educational representation in the Seanad as the graduates of any other institution in the State as we currently know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with the terms of the Bill I should like to put this Article of the Constitution which we are proposing to amend in its historical perspective.  I did not hear the contributions of the Minister and Deputy Collins and I missed most of Deputy Horgan's contribution and therefore, I do not know whether anybody has yet told the House in so many words that, as is so lamentably often the case here, we are dealing with something which was left behind by the English and which they themselves have long since scrapped.  University representation existed in the British Parliament until 1945.  The late A. P. Herbert was the most distinguished among an otherwise rather undistinguished lot of persons and he represented the University of Oxford for a long time.  That situation did not survive the Second World War; in 1945, with a lot of other things, it was swept away.  It was put into the 1922 Constitution here, characteristically without any flummery, a great deal more simply and more effectively from the drafting point of view than it was in the 1937 Constitution. The 1922 Constitution did not name any particular university; it simply spoke of the universities which existed in the State at that time.  Of course, that boiled down to the same thing, but it was an altogether preferable drafting mechanism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Article which conferred a separate franchise on the universities which was exercisable through seats in the Dáil and not in the Seanad, was <Col N="1127" /> struck out of the Constitution in 1936; but when the new Constitution surfaced the following year, lo and behold, the Paddys were still attached to the university seats, they could not be done away with.  As far as I know that did not exist anywhere else in Europe except in the country to be free from which we had, according to the received orthodoxy, struggled unremittingly for 700 years. However, like the smallest and most trivial bits of gold braid which the British had stuck on to institutions here, like the title of Alderman in borough councils, the chains, the cocked hats and the coaches, we naturally, being Paddys and being led by a party and an orthodoxy which was convinced that was the right description for us, had to hold on to special representations for the universities.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much point in arguing this nowadays in the sense that I have the authority of the Taoiseach for saying that if one gives a dog a bone it is quite hard to get it away from him, as he is discovering as he examines his bleeding fingers over the last six months or so.  It is hard to get a dog off a bone, and the bigger the dog gets the more powerful will the struggle become.  The total university electorate in this State, or outside the State, is extremely large.  I think the university voters value their votes.  I do not want at all to belittle mine&mdash;I am glad to have it&mdash;but I recognise it for what it is, namely, an anachronistic privilege.  I sat in the Seanad for four-and-a-half-years.  I did not get in there through the university vote; quite likely I would never have made it through the university vote in the way that Deputy Horgan did, by a blitz campaign of unparalleled assiduity and, let me add, brilliance.  But I would not have despised a seat in the Seanad even had it come through the universities. Had I sat in the Seanad as a university Senator I still would not have been so craven as to deny that the existence of such a representation was an anachronism defensible only by Paddys to Paddys in terms which only Paddys understand, namely, that the English left it behind them and anything they could <Col N="1128" /> do or did is more than good enough for us.  I protest for the hundredth time in the House against that attitude of mind which is second nature to the party opposite, absolutely second nature to them. It is outrageous that this matter could be solemnly brought up again in 1979 without the Government&mdash;particularly when it is the Government of the Legion of the Rearguard, the Soldiers of Destiny&mdash;sitting down and asking themselves what is it about universities which gives them the right to six seats in the National Parliament&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And it would be a healthier Dáil if the people on the far side would do so more often.  This is not the first occasion on which we have seen instances of trotting lamely along behind the English; I would not mind, only wearing cast-off clothes of the English, the fashion of which they themselves changed over 30 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter comes before us in the context of the Minister's proposed amendment without any consideration about whether the Seanad fulfils a serious function at all or not.  How often do we get a chance to discuss the other House?  If a Deputy so much as mentions a Senator in this House in the ordinary way, he is sat on by the Chair&mdash;&mdash; mind you, another old English convention&mdash;on the grounds that it is breach of privilege, if you please, if you are not offended. We would have the Speaker thundering on the door with his mace in a moment; Gold Stick-in-Waiting would be up on your back if one were to persist in referring, while speaking in one House, to the members of the other. <Col N="1129" /> Naturally all these ceremonies are more than good enough for us.  We should be honoured to be allowed to ape these conventions.</P>
    <P>Very seldom do we get a chance to discuss the Seanad and when we do, we should ask ourselves, what is that House there for at all?  Does it fulfil any serious function?  Could it perhaps be got to fulfil a serious function?  I know it is easy for me to say that, having managed to get out of the Seanad and into the Dáil; and I do not want to close off too many options, although I must confess I would regret it if I ever found myself on the Seanad trail again.  But since we get so few opportunities to discuss the matter, we might spend a minute or two asking ourselves if anything could be made of the Seanad, perhaps specifically in the context of the changing of representation, the shifting of the basis of representation which this amendment is designed to achieve.  The Seanad has no serious power.  At most it has an embarrassment value.  Even the embarrassment value is slight because of the distribution of political strength in the Seanad.  I think the last occasion on which the Seanad made a nuisance of itself to any Government was in 1959, at the time of the first of Fianna Fáil's two efforts to give us the English election system.  I forget who was the Minister for Local Government then.  Perhaps it was Deputy Boland who will go down in history for two futile efforts, trying to gaelicise the Army and to anglicise the voting system.  At any rate Fianna Fáil's first effort to anglicise the voting system was defeated by the people in 1959 in an extraordinary display of political maturity because, on the same day they voted that down, they put the Fianna Fáil Leader into the Phoenix Park as President; I should say a display of political discrimination&mdash;perhaps that is the wrong word to use because it is ambiguous but I mean the capacity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Seanad on that occasion threw out the Constitution Amendment Bill which was a severe embarrassment.  But that was 20 years ago and it has not happened since.  The Seanad has the useful function of giving a Government breathing space and of hearing Senators' suggestions which, provided the debate takes place early enough in the year and amendments are politically non-contentious, may possibly be incorporated, and I suppose frequently do get incorporated, in the legislation.  But is it useful enough?  Would the same function not be fulfilled by adapting Dáil procedures so as to include a further stage of a Bill, a kind of extern stage of a Bill on which committees or outsiders might sit and give evidence?  That would be an equally possible alternative and would save the expense of having a second House.  But if we are going to have a second House at all, we owe it to the dignity of that House to furnish it with some element in its structures or functions which would make it more useful than it is at present.  At present its function&mdash;and I do not at all despise this&mdash;is to ease beginners into serious politics and ease others out of it.  That is an extremely useful function; it is a kind of political AnCO at the beginning of political life; it is a kind of social service, I suppose, in a sense, at the other end.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but the Deputy would have to make his contribution a little relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, I appreciate that you have been generous.  While I appreciate that, let me say that an indirectly elected House cannot in a democracy hold a veto over a directly elected House.  I do not suggest and would resent any suggestion that the Seanad ought to have any extra power in the sense of being able to block legislation or override the will of the Dáil.  Nonetheless if the Seanad could be improved as a feature of the Legislature by alterations in the methods of its elections and in the recruitment to it of different kinds of people&mdash;let me give credit if it is deserved; it probably is the intention of the present amendment to bring some new blood or new sources into the Seanad via the institutions of higher education other than the universities. But it seems to me to be a terribly marginal thing.  It really is another feature of the perpetual fiddling that goes on in this country while Rome is burning.  I do not want to stray away from this subject, but it is analogous to a Minister being on the far side of the world while there is an oil crisis here, with other Ministers worrying about the &ldquo;national objectives&rdquo; to which they themselves have made no personal contribution in 50 or 60 years of life, not one, and going on about national aspirations when the economy is falling into ruins around us.  This is what I call fiddling while Rome burns.  We have a serious chance of looking at the Seanad and doing something about its composition. Although I accept the necessity for the change being made here within the very narrow boundaries of those six seats, this change is a minimal one, and is pitifully small compared with what could be done and what needs to be done in regard to Seanad representation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to university representation, if I were constructing a Seanad from scratch I do not believe that I would be led by anything the English did in their own country or here.  I would start from scratch and do it from what seems to me to be first principles.  I <Col N="1133" /> would expect Deputy Collins, Deputy Horgan and everybody else to do it from first principles too, and to debate it with me on that level also.  Since we have got this relic which the English left behind them, this oxidising statue with birds perched on its shoulders, in our political institutions, let us try and make something useful of it.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest problems we have here, apart from that of unemployment and emigration, which apparently are always with us, is the problem of social tensions and the industrial tensions, which are only a symptom of those.  I would ask myself whether this second House, even if it cannot override the Dáil, could not be given some role in the easing of those industrial and social tensions. I find that this was an expressed part of the purpose of having the House organised in the way it is and having it divided into vocational panels.  I find there is a labour panel, an agricultural panel, an industrial panel, a cultural panel and an administrative panel.  These are all intended to represent broad spheres of vocational and social interests.  I do not quarrel with that way of doing it. Who do we find fills those seats?  These seats are filled&mdash;and cannot be otherwise filled, because of the electorate&mdash;by politicos.  I do not despise politicos, I am one myself and I value my years in the Seanad.  I do not want to say anything which might lead one to think that I disparaged either it or the senatorship.  I am deeply grateful for that.</P>
    <P>I wonder now, while looking around me, and finding that farmers are snarling at the trade unions, the trade unions are snarling at the farmers and both of them are snarling at the Government &mdash;everybody seems to be snarling at the Government except the IRA, which is giving them very little bother at the moment&mdash;now that the social and the industrial tensions are so conspicuous in society and since they are also so powerful I ask myself whether or not all these interests and groups are the ones who are calling the shots here.  Everybody is calling the shots except the Government. Since that seems to be the case why not acknowledge their power, their influence <Col N="1134" /> and their status in society, bring them in under this roof and allow them to sit down in an institutional setting which recognises their function as part of the law-making and ruling organisation of the country.  It would not be a function which would override the functions of this House.  It could not be that; but it would be one likely to be more fruitful than the function which they are at present discharging, which is simply that of extremely high-powered, very articulate, increasingly angry pressure groups, in all cases, no doubt, sincerely representing the best interests of their members.  As the Ministers opposite are constantly lecturing us&mdash;once elections are over&mdash;in pressing those interests forward they tend to neglect the overall interests of the country.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why we should not organise the Seanad, particularly since the Constitution tells us to do so on truly vocational lines.  At the moment it is organised in such a way that the agricultural panel has nine Senators, some of whom are there because they have been Deputies and some who will not be there any longer after they have become Deputies, and various others who have knowledge and experience of agriculture, but who are not representative figures of the world they are supposed to represent.  They do not represent anybody.  They may be farmers, they may be mart managers, they may be veterinary surgeons or people with experience; but they do not represent farming interests and they do not represent the people, vocationally speaking, who are clamouring when they find a levy imposed on them and with whom the Government seem to argue in regard to the question of taxation.</P>
    <P>Similarly, on the Labour side, there are 11 Labour Senators.  I am open to correction in this, but I believe only the couple of Senators who sit on the Labour party benches are representative trade union leaders.  The ones on the Fianna Fáil benches and the ones on the Fine Gael benches are not.  I cannot see, when we are making this extremely marginal change, which will only have the effect of giving the vote to graduates of the NIHE, colleges of technology and <Col N="1135" /> so forth, and allowing them to elect people to the Seanad who may already be qualified for election by reason of being simultanuously graduates of NUI or Trinity College, why we cannot look more deeply at what goes on in the Seanad and ask ourselves if the Seanad might help in some way to ease the social and industrial tensions we suffer from by reorganising the way in which the Seanad membership is elected.</P>
    <P>Let me say to the Dáil that unlike the provisions in regard to Dáil Éireann, which are laid down in Article 16, which provides about constituencies, constituencies not having fewer than three seats, the way in which the constituencies must be evenly spread in regard to population, and so on, there are virtually no provisions in regard to the Seanad election.  The drafters of the Constitution left it open to the Oireachtas to prescribe by law what should be the composition of the Seanad.  Nothing is prescribed in the Constitution except the provision of the five interest groups, but how those groups are to be elected, who is to elect them, is not in the Constitution.  There is no rigidity about the matter in the Constitution. It is not in the Constitution that the electorate must be the outgoing Seanad, the incoming Dáil plus all county councillors and county boroughs.  That is not in the Constitution. That is an ordinary Act of Parliament which can be repealed overnight without the necessity for a referendum.</P>
    <P>Article 18 of the Constitution deals with the Seanad.  Even if that article were to stand by itself along with this very marginal change, which I acknowledge is designed to secure an even representation between institutions, many of which are no longer, strictly speaking, universities, we should be trying to extend the vocational panels and the vocational benches of the Seanad to incorporate people who speak for someone, leaders of the professional, social and vocational interests which correspond to the benches in which they sit.  We should be trying to do that.  Then these groups would get to know one another.  They would respect each other and understand each other's problems.  It would <Col N="1136" /> give them a status and a prestige which would make it easier for any Government to deal with them, to negotiate with them and to expect in turn a certain modicum or measure of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Let me not be taken as accusing any of these bodies of irresponsibility, but if they were formally built into the Oireachtas structure it would tend to ensure a certain constant level of responsibility, of mutual respect between these groups and between them and the Government.  I think that would be helpful. I mentioned Article 18, but one of the most forgotten Articles, Article 19, deals with the Seanad.  There are some never-visited Articles in the Constitution, like rooms in an old house.  The hings squeak noisily when you open the door.  Article 19 is such a room.  It is brief:</P>
    <P>Provision may be made by law for the direct election of any functional or vocational group or association or council of so many members of Seanad Éireann as may be fixed by such law in substitution for an equal number of the members to be elected from the corresponding panels of candidates constituted under Article 18 of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Constitution specifically provides for the possibility I am advocating, and in case it may be thought that that was done by an oversight, let me cite the former President of the Executive Council and Taoiseach, the late Mr. de Valera, when he was speaking in the Dáil on the Constitution on 1 June 1937, reported at column 1471-2, Volume 67.  He moved Article 19 and when Deputy McGilligan put a question to him he said:</P>
    <P>In the case of the Seanad, you have functional or vocational groups and statutory bodies like the universities that might be trusted themselves to elect direct.  That, I think, would be the better way it could be done, though it may take some time.  If there was a voluntary development in that direction I think most people would welcome it.  We do know what is going to be the result, so that we leave it open here to put that scheme into operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> In other words, the Dáil liked that and they passed this Article without further debate, but it is worth recalling that the substitution for the system of election by politicians, which guarantees that only politicians would get elected, of one of direct representation from the middle of these functional vocational groups was envisaged by the man who produced this Constitution, with all its strength and with all its weaknesses.</P>
    <P>I believe that was a good idea and since it does not require a constitutional amendment it could be done by an ordinary Act of the Oireachtas, and it should be given serious consideration. The Government I worked for were no exception, but there always has been a great disinclination by Governments to experiment.  What is shameful about saying: &ldquo;We will try this and if it does not work we will try something else&rdquo;? All Governments seem to be afraid to experiment.  I cannot guarantee that to activate Article 19 would produce a better Seanad.  I have not said that it would, but there are strong reasons to think that it might.  Why not try it?</P>
    <P>Perhaps it would lead to the problem Deputy Horgan outlined in regard to the 1936 Seanad being asked to vote for its own abolition.  What would you do with all the people who hold Seanad seats and who could never hope to get Seanad seats under a new dispensation?  My answer is that some of those seats could be left behind and let the best men fill them.  In other words, I would not abolish the whole of the Oireachtas sub-panels but I would reduce them to a proportion of the total panels now occupied. There are 43 panels and I would leave two seats in each panel for nomination by the Oireachtas or election in the traditional manner by county councillors.  I would let 33 be elected from the heart of the farmers' organisations, the trade unions, employers' organisations and so forth.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that would not work very well but there are strong reasons for trying it. If it did not work we should not be ashamed to say that we had intended well, we had powerful reasons to advance in its favour, we had tried it in good faith and we should try something <Col N="1138" /> else.  I do not think anyone would make political capital out of such a failure.  Sir, you have been&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge it gladly. Let me make some points on the draft of the Bill.  I suppose the Minister would have been surprised if I were not critical about it.  This is the second time in the past three months that we have had a messy constitutional amendment&mdash;I had to say that on the Bill in regard to the validating of adoption orders.  This could have been done more neatly, more elegantly.  The following are my objections. I do not object to the substance of what is aimed at here, but I have some objections to the legislative technique.</P>
      <P>Let me observe, before I say anything about that, that the technique which has been adopted will simply have the effect of deferring decisions on which bodies will elect Senators besides the NUI and Dublin University.  I can see a lot of political sense in deferring decisions because I have no doubt that if the Government were to say they propose to give a vote to graduates of the NIHE and the colleges of technology, there would be instant demands&mdash;and I do not say they would not be justified&mdash;from colleges of music, colleges of art, colleges of journalism, commercial colleges and so forth saying: &ldquo;We run third level education centres. We do not take people until they have finished secondary schooling and we feel that this confinement of the Seanad vote to NIHE graduates and graduates of the colleges of technology is unfair.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say that if that case were made I would be completely on the side of such institutes of third level education.  If there is any case at all for giving parliamentary representation to graduates of third level institutions it should be given to all third level institutions, the hotel and catering trade, the whole lot.  I should not like to find myself having to defend any criterion which would separate those who might confer a national benefit if they were in the Seanad from those who might not confer such a benefit.  I would be in favour of <Col N="1139" /> throwing it open to all institutions which are educational in even the broadest sense, not just the academic sense which we are always urging we should get away from.</P>
    <P>However, I can see that there is not any such intention here and perhaps that was the Government's motive in not showing their hand.  It would have been preferable to have removed from the Constitution altogether any reference to universities and to insert in substitution for Article 18.4: &ldquo;Six shall be elected by institutions of higher education&rdquo;.  To make myself clear, I do not see any immediate objection to a constitutional amendment which would make Article 18.4 read:</P>
    <P>The elected members of Seanad Éireann shall be elected as follows: (i) six shall be elected by institutions of higher education.  (ii) Forty-three shall be elected from panels of candidates constituted as hereinafter provided.</P>
    <P>Consequently you would have to adapt section 6 because it mentions the universities. It says at the moment that the Members of Seanad Éireann to be elected by the universities shall be elected on a franchise and in a manner to be provided by law.  I would make a consequential change which would read that &ldquo;the Members of Seanad Éireann to be elected by the institutions of higher education shall be elected on a franchise and in a manner to be provided by law&rdquo;. End of story.</P>
    <P>Unless there is something very subtle which I have overlooked, that seems to me to be a much clearer, simpler way of doing this job and one which seems to me to meet the professed objective just as fully.  Equally it would permit the Government to hold their hand until they saw fit in terms of saying which institutions of higher education were to benefit under the section and which were not.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to have to say this and I do not mean to be hurtful to the Minister's Department or to any draftsman in his Department or in any other office who may have been concerned with the draft of this, but it seems to me to be an intensely <Col N="1140" /> messy way of achieving a very simple objective.  You are leaving behind the specific mention of NUI and Dublin University in Article 18.4 but you are purporting in the new subsection 3º to allow either or both of these to be dissolved. Not only are you doing that but you are mentioning them again in the new subsection 2º (i).  That is a messy way of doing it.  I appeal to the Minister to ask his people to look at this again and see whether a simpler suggestion such as I have outlined would not meet the point in a clearer way.  I do not want to be positive about it.  Perhaps I have overlooked something.</P>
    <P>Even if we leave the amendment as it stands there are a couple of things which need to be said about it.  Part II. 2º, i, reads in its final three lines:</P>
    <P>of so many members of Seanad Éireann as may be fixed by law in substitution for an equal number of the members to be elected pursuant to paragraphs i and ii of the said subsection 1º.</P>
    <P>If the intention is to make two seats available of the six for the NIHE or the colleges of technology, and so on, they are to be subtracted from six, leaving four behind.  In other words, there is to be an equality in the substitution.  You can take two out of the six and use them for institutions which previously had no franchise.</P>
    <P>As it stands, the subsection does not say that the two taken away from the six are to be taken evenly away from the six. I do not understand it as drafted to mean an even number must be taken away from the NUI and Trinity.  It seems to me not to exclude the meaning that both of the new seats could be taken from the NUI allocation or both could be taken from the Dublin University allocation. Perhaps I am wrong about that, but that is how it reads to me.  I do not believe that was the Government's intention.</P>
    <P>I have always agreed strongly with the point of view which I know both Deputy Collins and Deputy Horgan share, that is, that because of its association with the minority, Trinity may have had reason, and certainly the northern part of it feels it has reason, to suspect <Col N="1141" /> the goodwill and good faith of this State. Therefore there is a special case why one should lean over backwards to show what favour one can, consistent with not being unfair to others, to that side of the Irish people.  I absolutely agree about that and, as Miles na gCopaleen would have said, I was saying it at a time when it was neither profitable nor popular.</P>
    <P>At the same time, where you find such an enormous disparity in a graduate population as now exists between the NUI graduate population and that of Dublin University, and where you find simultaneously that Dublin University, much to its credit, has very quickly lost or gone a very long way towards losing the kind of exclusivist association with the minority which once upon a time it had, you have to ask yourselves whether any serious reason still supports attributing to that university a representation equal to that of the NUI.  I hope that by those tortuous few sentences I have not succeeded in obscuring my meaning, which is, that I am all for leaning over backwards in every possible way consistent with fairness to other people to show favour, not just goodwill but absolute favour, towards the minority, not just on account of the North of Ireland but because of the minority we have within the borders of this State and whom we are supposed to cherish like everybody else; but that where you find that the association of Dublin University with the minority has become a great deal weaker&mdash;it is weaker in the sense that of course the minority still tend to go there but the numbers of other people going there have become so preponderant&mdash;that increasingly that association is only an historical one rather than an actual one&mdash;and where you find simultaneously that the graduate population of the NUI has become so gigantic, so very heavily preponderant compared with Dublin University representation,  I am not so sure that you can any longer make quite such a strong case for giving each of them three seats.</P>
    <P>I have no particularly strong feelings about that one way or the other, but I cannot imagine that at this moment it is the Government's intention to reduce the representation of these universities unevenly <Col N="1142" /> and to reduce the Trinity representation by comparison with the NUI representation.  If that is not their intention, in other words if they intend that the representation of other institutions of higher education should be contributed in equal proportion by both the existing universities, this subsection should be drafted more clearly.</P>
    <P>There is drafting problem in subsection 3º.  There is, if I may say to the Minister, who I know will understand me, a &ldquo;hapax legomenon&rdquo; in constitutional usage in that subsection.  So far as I know, there never has been the phrase used in the Constitution before, &ldquo;invoked to prohibit&rdquo;, in the context of legislation being ruled out.  I am subject to correction by the draftsman but I do not think one speaks of &ldquo;prohibiting&rdquo; legislation.  The phrase is too rough to use about a constraint placed by the Constitution on the National Parliament. The expression &ldquo;invoked to prohibit&rdquo; appears in Article 40 of the Constitution in the context of the Defence Forces.  In Article 40.4.6º it reads&mdash;and it appeared in virtually identical terms in the Saorstat Éireann Constitution&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nothing in this section, however, shall be invoked to prohibit, control or interfere with any act of the Defence Forces during the existence of a state of war or armed rebellion.</P>
    <P>That is an absolutely appropriate usage. You can try to invoke something to prohibit the Army from requisitioning tractors, or commandeering motor vehicles and making barricades out of them, from billeting troops in private houses. These are situations in which one can imagine somebody trying to invoke the law against them in order to prohibit them from doing that.  The constitutional rule says that you cannot invoke the Constitution to prohibit acts of the Defence Forces in time of war or armed rebellion.  I do not think the expression &ldquo;invoked to prohibit&rdquo; is an appropriate usage when what is being invoked is the Constitution and what are being prohibited are this House, the other House and the President&mdash;in other words, the Oireachtas.  It is an inelegant and unhappy usage.  I do not think there <Col N="1143" /> is a precedent for it.  If there is I will apologise.  I cannot call one to mind.</P>
    <P>Let me suggest as an alternative the formula in Article 40.  Article 40.1. is the Article which prescribes the equality of all citizens before the law.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>This shall not be held to mean that the State shall not in its enactments have due regard to differences of capacity, physical and moral, and of social function.</P>
    <P>It would be a more elegant expression to use in the new subsection 3º that this section shall not be held to mean that either or both of the universities here mentioned may not be dissolved by law. It would be more in conformity with constitutional usage and a less rude formulation if it read something like: shall not be held to mean or shall not be deemed to prevent or something of that kind.  &ldquo;Invoked to prohibit&rdquo; is an unusual usage.</P>
    <P>There is another little point I want to mention.  It is a similar point to that which arose on the constitutional amendment in regard to adoption.  If the Constitution is amended, we must not forget that once the new edition of the Constitution is published what we will have is a unitary, seamless document which will be interpreted by the courts as if every line had been enacted by the people on that July day in 1937.  The courts have become extremely minute&mdash;some would say unrealistic&mdash;in the exactitude and in the niggling closeness with which they scrutinise the phraseology of constitutional sections and compare them one with the other in order to extract what they take to be the sense from them.  Where there is a special subsection in part of the Constitution which says that a thing mentioned in that section is not to be deemed to be entrenched, is not to be deemed to be put in aspic forever merely because it is mentioned there, to a lawyer that opens up the implication that other things mentioned elsewhere in the Constitution which do not have that entrenching subsection attached to them are not, in fact, so entrenched. <Col N="1144" /> I do not want to fox the Minister with this.  By going out of our way in Article 18 to make it clear that an element mentioned in the Constitution is not protected from abolition, namely, the universities, you are inviting the implication that other things mentioned in the Constitution are protected from abolition, such as a census or a jury or the name of the city of Dublin.  Of course I am all in favour of entrenching juries against abolition but we should know what we are doing here.  We should realise that a legislative technique like this will fall into the hands of lawyers. Once the Minister sees this legislation off nobody will ever look at it again except a lawyer.  He is going to ask himself, what can be made out of this?  He will ask whether it is now open to him to argue&mdash;which it was not before&mdash;that merely because the universities attach to them a constitutional subsection which emphasises that the mere mention of them in the Constitution does not guarantee them survival, that where such a special clause does not occur in other parts of the Constitution that the thing is guaranteed survival, that it has a special entrenchment in the form of the particular institution was in in 1937.</P>
    <P>I do not see the danger there.  I mentioned juries and the census&mdash;they are the two that are most important and that come first to mind.  I would be very sorry to see either of them done away with, for perfectly obvious reasons.  We should not lightheartedly throw in a device like this into a law that is so hard to change without being alive to the impact it will have for the legal mind thereafter.  A lawyer may be arguing a point that has nothing whatever to do with the universities or the Seanad but he will use this as a criterion on which to base his argument in regard to a totally different matter.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say about the draft of this Bill.  I can assure the Minister that, whatever I may have said that was contentious in the first part of my speech, I put forward in a non-contentious way those suggestions in regard to the drafting.  I will encourage Deputy Collins, our party spokesman on this matter, to put down some amendments <Col N="1145" /> to accommodate the drafting improvements which I think are needed.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that we are not amending an ordinary law that can be changed next week.  We are amending the Constitution and that has not yet been changed six times.  We should impose on ourselves higher standards of tidiness, accuracy and verbal effectiveness in amending the Constitution than we do in ordinary legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Wilson)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to deal with Deputy Collins' suggestion about the use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in Article 18.4 i and ii.  The provision as set out remains until the legislation for the revised election basis becomes law.  It could not be amended now for the period until the new legislation comes into force.  That is quite obvious. In my original statement I think I pointed out that that was one of the things we had to cover, namely, the position that will exist until such time as the people accept the amendment, if they do, and until the new legislation for election of Members to Seanad Eireann is on the Statute Book That is the reason for the use of the format we have adopted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins referred to the words, &ldquo;any other institutions of higher education in this State&rdquo;.  It is intended that other graduates will have votes.  As I stated already, this whole matter will be debated and discussed when we come to deal with the specific legislation.  The whole question of whether there should be representation in Seanad Eireann for the universities has been debated during a long period and I do not think there is unanimity in any political party about it. Obviously Deputy Kelly does not agree that there should be.  He regards it as a remant of British imperialism.  If something is good it should be assessed on its merits whatever its provenance. No doubt we will have an opportunity to discuss that point later in the Bill which will be brought in by the Minister for the Environment.  Finally, Deputy Collins came down on giving representation to the Seanad.  He hoped for a more vocational Seanad and expressed the wish that the Seanad be used for initiating Bills.</P>

      <P>And long before I came near the Oireachtas.  I wish to comment on the reference by Deputy Collins to the Seanad being a political body.  I am in total agreement with what Deputy Horgan said: belonging to a political party is something that one should be proud of.  We should encourage young people to regard it as the noble vocation that it is.  Some people refer to it as if it had something to do with a house of ill fame.  In fact, people should be very proud of taking part in the political process in a democracy.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy up to a point but I want to say a man does not necessarily lose his expertise in agriculture, or administration, or industry, or in the cultural or educational fields by giving his allegiance to a political party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I think we are a disorderly race and some kind of constraint is good for us.  The Deputy raised the matter of Maynooth and even mentioned appointments there until the Chair took an interest in what he was saying.  As I said in my opening speech, the legislation for the dissolution of the National University of Ireland, if and when the people accept the amendment of the Constitution, will outline the status of the various recognised colleges that I mentioned.  Within that context we will be dealing with the further question raised by Deputy Collins of whether institutions for the purpose of university <Col N="1147" /> representation will be grouped together or treated as single institutions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Collins asked when the legislation is likely and mentioned the ubiquitous long finger.  I assure him and the House that it is my intention to go ahead with the legislation as quickly as possible.  His final question was about the colleges of education and that was covered in the introduction of this Second Stage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Horgan referred to the importance of the task of amending the Constitution and asked why it was not the Taoiseach who was introducing this Bill. All I can say is that I feel that I am an inadequate substitute&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he decided that I should do it.  The Deputy said he was not opposed to the idea of other institutions of higher education having a vote but that it was something that required discussion and I am satisfied that full opportunity for such discussion will be available in the relevant legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that was implied in what the Deputy said.  The debate will take place on that and it will be a major debate on how the six seats will be allocated. I was more than interested in the historical excursus of the Deputy where he traced the idea of representation from 1930.  I could not help thinking, when he was quoting Deputy Maginnis&mdash;I think&mdash;and saying that in those days an t-ollamh stood next to the king that it would have been a very dangerous place for an t-ollamh to be in the period to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Horgan also referred to accessibility in the twenties and thirties of this century and said it was better than accessibility to third level education had been in the 19th century.  I agree.  He <Col N="1148" /> also said that while it is not perfect now it is better than it was in the twenties and thirties.  There is progression.  I thank the Deputy for the historical excursus, which I found very interesting and it was totally in place in this debate.  I am wondering whether there was 50 per cent nominations to the Seanad at one time&mdash;the Deputy spoke about the democratic principle&mdash;I think there was 50 per cent nomination by the President of the Executive Council at one time.  I should be very pleased indeed to think that the Leader of the then Opposition, Deputy Johnson and his deputy and ally, Deputy Cathal O'Shannon, threw their shadows ahead and that I was in their line.  I have made a resolution that I shall bow to the portrait of the late Deputy Johnson each time I pass it in the corridor outside from now on.  I am grateful to Deputy Horgan for calling my attention to his having mentioned this possibility&mdash;he mentioned Cathal O'Shannon; I do not know which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHorgan1977" hpid="Mr. Horgan Mr. Horgan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Cathal O'Shannon who mentioned that.  Deputy Johnson was more severe on the universities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think perhaps being a soldier was as much a qualification as being a university graduate.  The Deputy referred to the Northern connection with Trinity College, Dublin.  There was a very strong Northern connection and I think, a very desirable one.  It did not change the very strongly held views of people who came from the Six Counties to Trinity but at least it must have had some kind of negative effect in that they did not think any more that we were a subhuman species which in a very close society some of them could have been led to believe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the numbers coming from that area to Dublin University have declined.  I think the university authorities have said that, and it is something I regret very much.  Every effort should be made, to the extent of trying to recruit if necessary, by our universities in Dublin to get some people from the Six Counties area to come here.  The reverse has been the case in regard to the New University of Ulster in Coleraine. <Col N="1149" /> In the Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan areas they have been encouraging people in the post-primary schools to go to the new university in Coleraine.  Unfortunately, the troubles interfered with this process when quite a few students had begun to go there.</P>
    <P>The whole question of Trinity and its connection with the minority is a quite different one today from what it was ten years ago.  Recently, on the occasion of a deputation from the heads of the university, the Provost of Trinity College said that he had substantial reasons now for calling it a national university.  It is no longer a university which attracts only one sector of the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Horgan suggested that there might be a possibility of allowing votes by substituting &ldquo;in Éirinn&rdquo; or &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; for &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;.  We had a discussion on this during the course of the NCEA Bill.  It is not possible to accept the amendment Deputy Horgan suggested might be made.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Kelly, he put on a wonderfully entertaining performance evoking the shade of A. P. Herbert, the glorious Liberal and playwright.  He waxed eloquent about the anachronism of university representation. I have already said that a good idea from whatever source, even from an imperialistic one, is not something we should take lightly.  In all the political parties there is no unanimity about the desirability of university representation. I take it that everybody would agree that, all in all, the Seanad representation from the universities has been worthwhile.  Some may have strayed from the pure Olympian heights of non-politics into political parties.  I see nothing wrong with that provided there is no pretence about it.  Voters are voting for somebody who is not committed to a political party.  It does not necessarily do them any harm to join a party, but it is as well that the electorate should know if they do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly was rejuvenated at times and the L and H was in full swing. He spoke about the straight vote being British and, under pressure, he admitted that proportional representation was British as well.  I do not know whether this means he would have to condemn <Col N="1150" /> both and think out some other ethereal way for electing Members to the Dáil and Seanad.  I liked his performance. The rejuvenated Deputy Kelly is a more amusing Deputy Kelly than the Savonarola whom we used to see with pale face and thin lips rounding up the Deputies when he was Chief Whip for the previous Government.</P>

      <P>Without mentioning the fiddler, he spoke about fiddling while Rome burned.  He assumed the role, in his pilgrim's progress, of creator.  He was creating a new Seanad and inviting Deputies Collins and Horgan to share in the act of creativity.  He spoke of the use of the various vocational panels in the Seanad to represent the people after whom the panels are named.  He thought this might be a useful way to reduce social and industrial tensions.  It was not relevant to what we are doing in amending the Constitution but he got, and gave, a certain amount of pleasure, in going through the gymnastics which all enjoyed.  At some stage he quoted Article 19.  Teachers' unions did have a vote and in the system of voting there is direct election by vocational groups.  I am not positive about that but I remember some people in a trade union referring to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly said he did not understand why the amendment was drafted in this way.  Had Deputy Kelly been here for my opening speech he would have heard what we had to take account of which influenced the wording of the drafting: the importance of preserving the eligibility of existing Members of the Seanad elected under the university franchise during the period from the date of the acceptance of the referendum proposal and the end of the period for which the Members had been elected. We did not want any lacuna there.  The draftsman had to cover the possibility of a vacancy occurring in the relevant university panel necessitating a by-election before the legislative process had been completed.  This process will deal with <Col N="1151" /> the revised arrangements for university representation in the Seanad following acceptance of the referendum proposal. This is the business of the Minister for the Environment and it is also important to synchronise the legislation for university reorganisation and the arrangements to be made by law for alternative provision for representation in the Seanad of the universities and other higher education institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly and other Deputies said that there were anomalies about the size of the electorate in the two universities that are mentioned in the Constitution, 40,000 plus in one case and about 8,000 in the other.  Deputy Kelly said he would favour leaning over backwards to help the minority.  One phrase which he took exception to was &ldquo;invoked to prohibit&rdquo;. It was on aesthetic grounds rather than as a constitutional lawyer that he objected to it.  He spoke about it being inelegant and unhappy, but he did not at any stage say that it would not hold water as a legal phrase.  I cannot agree to the change suggested by Deputy Kelly. There is no advantage in using the wording &ldquo;this shall not be held to mean that either or both universities&rdquo;.  I accept that in cases totally unrelated to this amendment of the Constitution lawyers and senior counsel might argue about the entrenchment of words in the Constitution. He said that when we say in our amendment that nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to prohibit dissolution, we are inviting lawyers to say that there is an implication that when something is entrenched or embedded in the Constitution it gives it a certain status.  Legal minds would probably do that, but they will do that anyway whether this amendment to the Constitution is accepted or not.</P>
    <P>I thank the three Deputies who contributed to the Second Stage debate.  It is important that the Bill should get through the Houses of the Oireachtas and get the signature of the President by the date mentioned by me in my opening speech, when we will have an opportunity of putting it to the people together with the amendment of the Constitution Bill on adoption.</P>

      <P>Section 6 is a new provision introduced by the Minister in this year's Budget that allows people who have repairs done to their houses or gardens to claim the labour costs of those repairs, within certain limitations, against income tax.  On the last day Deputy Bruton and I were arguing that because of the present critical situation in the energy field, for insulation purposes alone the Minister should include in the section the amendment that would allow materials as well as labour to be deducted.  When we were concluding on Wednesday night last the Minister had made the point that it would not be appropriate to include the amendment under this Finance Bill as section 6 is of a purely experimental nature, and its provisions may need to be changed, modified or improved in some way by the time it runs out at the end of April of next year, or the relief may be totally withdrawn.  The point the Minister made was that at the end of the period up to April 1980, we could look at the matter again and see if at that stage materials could be included.  I put an amendment to section 1 of the schedule which makes my point.  It is amendment No. 35 (a) which was circulated today.  The amendment is:</P>
      <P>In page 32, to delete lines 21 and 22, and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;qualifying work&rsquo; means any work of maintenance, repair, improvement or insulation of residential premises;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Lines 21 and 22 of page 32 of the Bill say that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;qualifying work&rdquo; means any work of maintenance, repair or improvement (including insulation) of residential premises;</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, 15 May the Minister for the Environment was asked a Question reported at column 537, Volume 314, of the Official Report as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Quinn asked the Minister for <Col N="1155" /> the Environment if it is proposed to make special energy conservation grants to house owners in order that they can reduce the level of heat loss in their homes and, if so, if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>Mr. Barrett: I do not propose to introduce a special scheme or grants to assist in energy conservation measures in private housing. However, as I have already announced, the cost of work consisting of attic insulation, cylinder lagging and draught-stripping of doors and windows, undertaken as part of a general improvement project on a private house, may be reckoned in calculating the appropriate amount of the grant in such a case under the existing house improvements grants scheme.</P>
    <P>I tried to find out whether the Department of the Environment consider insulation to be an &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; in this sense.  It appears that they do not and the insulation must be part of the general improvement in the structure.  As far as I know, specific encouragement is not given by any Department towards energy conservation.  The Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy operate a scheme whereby a grant is available in respect of 50 per cent of the cost of engaging consultants to advise industry on energy conservation.  This is part of a general improvement scheme but does not apply if the work is solely of an insulating nature.  The amendment seeks to make tax deductible the cost of insulation.</P>
    <P>The interview given by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy last Sunday helped to underline the fact that we are facing a critical situation in the energy field.  This is becoming evident to everybody.  Next winter we will not have 100 per cent of our requirements of home heating oil, but how severe the cut-back will be it is not possible to say at present.  We must use not more than 100 per cent of what we used in 1978 and probably much less than that.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to think again in terms of this year's Finance Bill <Col N="1156" /> instead of next year's one.  I think the Minister feels it is a good idea to encourage energy conservation and the insulating of houses but that he should see how this section operates this year and possibly extend it next year.  He has not said this but the implication is that next year he will consider improving the section dealing with insulation.  The urgency of the situation seems to indicate that the Minister should live a little dangerously and include this provision in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>We have no control over the production and transport of oil, and because such a falling proportion of our energy needs are refined in this country we have not full control over the refining capacity of our oil.  We have, however, control over the amount of energy we waste. Every Government Department should encourage and cajole, and maybe at times go further than that and use a stick, to ensure that the energy we have is used efficiently and for the benefit of all the people.  We should control the amount of energy we use by ensuring that our conservation measures have the effect of saving fuel.  I am talking about individual houses and industry generally, but this section of the Bill relates specifically to individual householders. The list of possible conservation measures which could be taken by them is not extensive.  It includes the lagging of roofs and water cylinders, the servicing of boilers and the sealing of doors and windows.  The double-glazing of windows does not appear to be as effective a method of conservation as was once thought.</P>
    <P>The beneficial effects of this amendment would be felt as early as next winter.  If the Minister decides next year that this section of the Finance Bill is working well and that he can see his way to accepting an amendment, the benefit will not be realised until the winter of 1981.  If the amendment is accepted now the benefit of the conservation measures will be felt next winter.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider this, possibly between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support part of the case made by Deputy Barry in relation to the cost of materials.  I find it very difficult to accept that we should have a blanket inclusion of materials in a concession of this kind and I will have more to say about the concession when we deal with the section.  It would be quite possible for a very wealthy person to build, for example, a totally reorganised kitchen abutting his original kitchen and instal a super de luxe split-level cooker built into the wall as part of the structure of the extension.  There might be other examples.  Some examples are, of course, very much more expensive than others.</P>
      <P>While I have some sympathy with that amendment I should hesitate to extend it on a blanket basis to all materials. However, in the light of the energy crisis facing us, and which obviously will be confronting us for some indeterminate time in the future, the Minister should consider making a specific exemption in relation to materials adjudged by the Department of the Environment or by whichever body are responsible in this area, as being materials conducive to the better insulation of houses.  If we fail to do this we may be putting ourselves in a situation in which the operation of this concession, even on an experimental basis, will be contributing to further energy losses and waste as, perhaps, there are made increasing numbers of inadequately designed and perhaps inadequately insulated extensions.  I am aware that the labour involved in insulation costs may be allowable under this section up to certain limits but the conservation problem is such that we should be taking specific steps to deal with it.  The scope of the section is much too wide.  If the Minister were to introduce something on an experimental basis, as is the intention presumably, he should be thinking of confining its application exclusively to work and materials in the context of the vital and urgent question of conservation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be obvious to Deputies that a Finance Bill is not a suitable vehicle for <Col N="1158" /> provisions in respect of grants for conservation or of grants for any other purpose. The furthest we can go in this section in the context of what we are talking of is in relation to tax allowances and insulation is provided for specifically in this section.  The real question is whether the section should go further in the case of insulation and provide for relief in respect of materials, as well as for labour.</P>
      <P>As I have said before, the primary purpose of the section is to assist in the creation of employment.  For that reason it was drafted on the basis of giving relief in respect of labour but not in respect of materials.  If materials of any kind are included, the provision would be open to some abuse.  Deputy Horgan recognises that, I think.  I indicated that the provision would be introduced on an experimental basis, but I can understand how Deputy Barry might have interpreted what I said as meaning that if there were to be changes they would not occur until next year.  However, what I intended to convey was that the provision would be operated on an experimental basis.  The question of what measures are necessary and advisable to assist in the area of the conservation of energy is one primarily for the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and also for the Minister for the Environment. If either or both of these Ministers acting together decide on certain schemes to improve the conservation of energy and if it is considered advisable as part of these schemes to provide a tax concession on the lines of that provided for in this section in respect of materials used, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the provision here could be amended accordingly.  It could be amended this year.  That is what I intended to convey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have gone as far as I can go in relation to a Finance Bill having regard to my function in dealing with this matter. The question of other measures is being considered by the other Ministers concerned but it is not for me to make a decision in that regard or to frame the Finance Bill in relation to any such decisions, because clearly there are involved aspects other than tax allowances. However, I wish to make it clear that if it <Col N="1159" /> appears advisable to make further provision in respect of tax allowances in the area of insulation and the conservation of energy in homes generally which would be furthered by a change in this provision, I am not saying that such change would not be made or that it would not be made this year.  I have gone as far as possible in trying to deal with the problem.  The primary object in relation to this section is to encourage the creation of certain kinds of employment. The special case that can be made in regard to the conservation of energy is one that I have recognised by including specifically the word &ldquo;insulation&rdquo; but not beyond the provision of relief in respect of labour.  To go further than that would be a matter that would have to be interrelated with proposals from my colleagues in regard to energy conservation generally.</P>

      <P>That problem could be met by providing for materials designated by the IIRS as suitable for insulation. My amendment, No. 35a, defines qualifying work as any work of maintenance, repair, improvement or insulation of residential premises.  My fear is that unless the words &ldquo;including insulation&rdquo; are taken out of the brackets in the section we may find ourselves with the same problem as the problem we have with the Department of the Environment in this regard.  I do not know whether the amendment should be taken with this section or with the Schedule, <Col N="1160" /> but the reason for tabling it is that the reference to improvement, including insulation, could be interpreted as meaning that insulation by itself would not qualify.  So far as the Department of the Environment are concerned insulation qualifies for a grant only when it is carried out as part of a general improvement. This provision could be interpreted in the same way because of the inclusion of the brackets around the words &ldquo;including insulation&rdquo;.  I am not making a big point of this now&mdash;the amendment will be reached later&mdash;but would merely underline the interpretation that can be given in Departments but which may not be in accordance with the intention of this House.</P>

      <P>My amendment will make that absolutely clear.  As regards the point made by the Minister that this section deals only with employment, I do not wish to detain the House, but it could be argued that, unless we get our energy situation as much under control as possible&mdash;and I would rate conservation very highly in that regard&mdash;the high cost of energy will be inflationary, and inflation is the No. 1 enemy of employment.  Anything we can do to cut down on our energy imports bill will have the effect of countering, to some extent, inflation, which, in turn, would help employment, so my amendments in that regard are not too far fetched.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 9, after line 25, to add a new subsection as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(5)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, <Col N="1161" /> a person shall be a registered person for the purposes of this section, if, on the commencement of this section, he is registered for the purposes of value-added tax.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If you turn to the second schedule of the Act you will see the reason for this amendment.  It gives the description of a registered person and shows the trouble he has in making a claim.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where an individual wishes to claim a deduction under section 6....</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;This is section 2 of the second schedule&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>... in respect of the labour cost of qualifying work carried out on or to be carried out by a registered person he shall make an application on the prescribed form to the Revenue Commissioners for a form on which to claim the deduction in this paragraph referred to as a claim form bearing the name of the registered person....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And so on.  There is a long list.  A registered person is defined as a person &ldquo;... to whom a certificate of registration has been issued and who has not been required, pursuant to paragraph 7, to return the said certificate and whose certificate of registration has not been cancelled pursuant to this paragraph.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why so much trouble is involved in making a claim under section 6 of this Act.  A person has to apply for a form to get a form, if you read section 2 (a).  He makes an application on the prescribed form&mdash;he must get that first&mdash;to the Revenue Commissioners for a form on which to claim.</P>
    <P>There are all sorts of claims made under various Tax Acts going back many years, for allowances which do not involve the amount of form-filling that is necessary under this section.  The purpose of my amendment is that a person already registered with the Revenue Commissioners for value-added tax should be exempt from the form-filling.  I think this is page 22 in the schedule. Suppose somebody is accepted as a registered person under the Act and he gets a form, fills it up and attempts to make a claim under this section and by the time the work is finished he has been <Col N="1162" /> de-registered by the Revenue Commissioners, what happens then?  Is the claim no longer valid?  Is he deprived of his tax benefit because the person from whom he wants to claim does not register, even though he, in good faith, has obtained a quotation from this person for the work necessary to be done?  What happens in that case?</P>
    <P>The second schedule to this, which I am seeking to amend, is extraordinarily cumbersome, almost designed to make it difficult for somebody to make a claim under section 6.  There is a whole list of things that have to be done and conditions that must be met before one is allowed to claim under this section.  Those people who are already registered under value-added tax should benefit without having to fill up all these forms.  It would simplify matters both from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners and of the customers&mdash;if you can call them customers in that sense.</P>
    <P>If I have an insurance policy and fill up my tax form, I do not think I should have to get a form to apply to the Revenue Commissioners to have a form to fill up to claim under that premium under the 1967 Finance Act, which I think covers it.  I can understand the Minister's desire&mdash;and this is almost an instinct, or certainly it is a very high priority with the Revenue Commissioners, that they should, in any new provisions which the Government propose to make&mdash;which are tax provisions allowing people to make a claim against tax&mdash;to endeavour as much as possible to foresee possible loopholes. However, the machinery very often used to see that loopholes never come into existence is so cumbersome that it has the effect of deterring people from seeking to make claims and benefit by a section of the Finance Bill from which it is the Government's intention that they should benefit.  This section is a case in point, where the Government have a priority of getting more people to work, increasing the amount of employment.  They devise a scheme which allows people to claim for repairs or improvements to their homes or their gardens.  They can claim the labour content of any improvements they make over £50 and under £450&mdash;I think these are the figures&mdash;as an allowance <Col N="1163" /> against their tax.  However, when they set up the machinery to do this, it is so difficult for the ordinary person to make a claim that many people will not bother to make a claim and the benefits from the Government's point of view, may not be realised.</P>
    <P>People see the amount of work they have to do in order to get the benefit. The average taxpayer on the 35 per cent band claiming 60 per cent of that is saving in tax £20 in the year.  If he has to go to Dublin Castle to get forms, fill them up, get the person who is going to do the painting, building or digging to fill up and countersign these forms, if there is a possibility of an inspector walking in on the job two or three times to see that the work is being done&mdash;and once the form has been lodged the inspector can come to question him about the form and the details supplied in it&mdash;and then he earns only £20 out of all that, he will shrug his shoulders and say &ldquo;I will put the painting job off until next year or I will do it myself&rdquo;.  The benefit from the Government's point of view is, therefore, lost.</P>
    <P>The Government may have in mind, although it is not written into the section or referred to anywhere or even hinted at, that they suspect that there are many people whom they regard as foxers who are maybe signing on at the labour exchange and then doing these relatively small or not so small jobs.  The Minister is trying to flush these out in getting householders to see that these people be registered and put on the Government's books.  If that is so the ordinary householder may consider that the game is not worth the candle.  He may be full of sympathy with the Government's point of view regarding people working and at the same time drawing unemployment benefit, but he may feel that £20 in 18 months is not worth his time getting these forms and filling them up with the haggling and arguing that may ensue with the person he is employing.</P>
    <P>My amendment probably does not go far enough, but it would be very much simpler if the Government would at least take the VAT people as not being involved in this.  They are already registered and they would not be involved <Col N="1164" /> in tax evasion of this type whatever else they might be doing.  It would be very much simpler if the Government would take the word of householders that they have had this work done, they have a receipt for it, the job cost, say, £180, the labour content is £60, and then allow the householders to claim that as an allowance against their tax without this long schedule, the forms that have to be filled and the work that has to be done to gain benefit under this section.  I would prefer to see everybody being allowed do as they are allowed with their insurance policies in this regard.  Failing that, the Government should at least exempt those who employ people who are already registered for VAT from the necessity to fill up forms under this new section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points put forward by Deputy Barry in relation to this section.  On Second Stage I supported a considerable amount of what he said, particularly regarding the bureaucratic rigmarole through which a person would have to go in order to get any relief under this section.  At the end of the year I will be interested to see the figures and those who benefit.  The number of conditions which a person will have to fulfil as either (1) a taxpayer in order to benefit and (2) a person becoming a registered contractor, will make the whole section inoperable.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the viewpoint of the Revenue Commissioners in their drafting of this section, but the idea of the section is to create jobs, and it has been drafted more with the idea of trying to catch people doing this type of job and not paying tax.  The idea behind the section is to give relief for expenditure on residential premises, but the real effect of the Second Schedule is to catch people who are not paying tax.</P>
      <P>This section is designed to give relief subject to a maximum of £450 on improvement to residential premises.  The kind of contractor who would be doing that type of work is the small, one-man show or maybe there are two people employed.  You are not going to get the big builders going around doing insulation and improvement jobs on houses.</P>

No one will be appointed a registered contractor of the type envisaged and the section will not fulfil the purpose for which it is intended.  There are various matters here which can be discussed on the section, but at this stage I tell the Minister that this section is not going to work if this bureaucratic thing has to be complied with before a person can qualify.  In the first place he is going to have to apply for a form in order to get another form.</P>

      <P>Section 2 (b) of the Second Schedule suggests that the Revenue Commissioners may not issue the second form if they think it should not be issued.  It is beyond my comprehension how they are going to be satisfied on this.  It states:</P>
      <P>Where an individual wishes to claim a deduction under section 6 in respect of the labour cost of qualifying work carried out or to be carried out by a registered person, he shall&mdash; ...</P>
      <P>(b) complete the claim form (which shall be issued to him by the Revenue Commissioners if they are satisfied that the form ought to be issued to the said individual),</P>
      <P>I do not know what the idea of the form is.  If he gets this other famous form he will then complete it, send it back and he may get his tax relief, but he may not get the second form if they are not satisfied that it should be issued to him.  Where are we going?  What is the basis for that section 2 (b)?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various points to which I drew attention on Second Stage and to which I shall return.  I understand the basis of all this drafting of the Second Schedule.  It is a problem that has come about as a result of sub-contractors' certificates <Col N="1166" /> of authorisation and how the Revenue Commissioners were left short by sections of the Finance Act, 1970, which set up the section on sub-contractors' certificates.  After a couple of years the situation was that 7,000 certificates were issued in the Dublin area and less than 10 per cent were returned to the annual account.  Consequently, as a result of the Finance Act, 1973, and the Finance Act, 1976, we now have a system regarding the issue of these sub-contractors' certificates which makes it fairly foolproof.  The Revenue Commissioners are trying to apply this system to the idea of a registered contractor.  Now we are going to have sub-contractors' certificates of authorisation and registered contractors' certificates.  We are going to have so many certificates banging around the place that the ordinary builder or handyman will not know what he is.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;registered person&rdquo; means a person to whom a certificate of registration has been issued and who has not been required pursuant to paragraph 7 to return the said certificate or whose certificate of registration has not been cancelled pursuant to that paragraph;</P>
    <P>How a person becomes a registered sub-contractor is outlined in the Second Schedule.  There are pages in the Schedule devoted to telling how a person can have registration withdrawn from him.  Yet under section 5 of the Schedule it appears simple for a person to become a registered contractor.  Section 5 (1) states that he must be resident in the State.  That is a very simple thing.  A person either is resident in the State or he is not.  Consequently, I see no need for sections 6, 7, 8 or 9 of the Second Schedule.  If a person is resident in the State that is a simple fact.  Section 5 states:</P>
    <P>5. (1) The Revenue Commissioners shall on application to them in that behalf on the prescribed form by a person issue to the person a certificate (referred to in section 6 and in this Schedule as &ldquo;a certificate of registration&rdquo;) if they are satisfied that the person or, in the case of a <Col N="1167" /> partnership each partner, is resident in the State.</P>
    <P>What could be more simple?</P>
    <P>The most alarming matter in this section is that there is no right of appeal for a person who applies to become a registered person.  The greatest thing wrong with the contractors' certificate of authorisation is that there is no right of appeal against the inspector of taxes. That is causing grave distress.  I am not saying that inspectors of taxes are not doing their jobs but in this section there is no right of appeal if a certificate of registration is refused.  If a person applying to become a registered contractor is not successful in his application he has no right of appeal.  There should be provision for appeal.</P>
    <P>Registered sub-contractors and those registered for VAT at the commencement of the operation of the Bill should automatically become registered contractors. It will have to be decided whether the section was designed to create jobs or to bring all those not now paying tax into the tax net.  I support the idea that this bureaucratic nonsense should be taken out of the Second Schedule.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the genesis of this idea and we look at its incorporation into the draft legislation before us, we can see a classic example of an idea that looks like a good one until somebody looked at it more closely.  It probably sprang fully armed from the head of the Minister for Economic Planning and Development.  If it did, and if it then went from there to the Cabinet and from there to the Revenue Commissioners, I subject that the Revenue Commissioners got into a state when they saw, as they would naturally see, the possibility for abuse that would exist in this system.  They decided they would have to do something about it and what they have done about it is contained in this section which Deputy P. Barry is <Col N="1168" /> seeking to simplify and make more reasonable.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the purpose of this section is to create jobs.  He frequently talks about creating jobs and frequently berates us for not talking about the need to create jobs.

With all the good will in the world&mdash;and I am prepared to approach this matter openly&mdash;this is a classic example of a simplistic way of Government thinking.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> I yield to nobody in my desire to catch people who are not paying their appropriate share of income tax and I salute the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  The system which Deputy Barry is trying to amend &mdash;and perhaps his amendment does not go far enough&mdash;is not one which will do more than scratch the surface of the problem.  The problem is a difficult one and I do not pretend to have an easy solution to it either, but I feel that I can somewhat sorrowfully guarantee the Minister that whatever scheme he sets up under this section, there will be people who will find a way out of touching ground on the tax debt which he is trying to establish for them.  The section is self-defeating in its laudable purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the question of creating enough jobs under this section, when asked what he meant by &ldquo;enough jobs&rdquo; Deputy Horgan went off at a tangent.  Nobody has ever suggested that, as a result of this section, the Government's employment targets are going to be realised.  The section is intended as a contribution towards the achievement of those targets.  Although Deputy Barry's amendment may be plausible, it has no relevance to the problem.  The fact that somebody is registered for VAT has little or no bearing on whether or not they are a registered contractor for the purpose of section 6.</P>
      <P>I must remind the House of something I said when replying to the debate on Second Stage.  There are only two conditions being laid down for the granting of the certificate by the Revenue Commissioners. They are that an application is to be made in the prescribed from and that the applicant is resident in the State. It is true that the second schedule is formidable. However, I suggest that there will be no problem for the <i>bona fide</i> contractor. It is a question of completing the prescribed form and being resident in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that there are a number of formidable-looking provisions relating to this matter in the second schedule.  In particular, Deputy McCreevy referred to paragraphs 7, 8 and 9.  As is obvious to anybody who looks at them, they are <Col N="1170" /> precautionary paragraphs.  The system provided for is open to abuse if people want to abuse it.  It is true to say although this is not contingent on the subcontractor system or is not an adjunct to it&mdash;that the experience of the Revenue Commissioners in dealing with the subcontractor problem shows through in the drafting of the schedule. Nevertheless, I agree that we ought to concentrate on the <i>bona fide</i> contractor. In his case the problem will, I hope, be of minimal proportions.</P>
    <P>The amendment is not relevant to the problem nor would it be helpful in overcoming the problem.  I have already indicated to the House on Second Stage that I shall be watching the operation of this section to see if the machinery is too bureaucratic and is hindering people from availing of the relief contained in the section.  I shall be having another look at the second schedule to see if it can be simplified.  Unless we take precautions, this scheme, intended to assist in the creation of employment, could end up as a method of legitimately and legally enabling people not to pay tax for which they would be liable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan-Monaghan</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the hopelessly inadequate allocation of finance by the Government to housing authorities in respect of new house starts for the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment has been brave enough&mdash;I will not put it any stronger that that&mdash;to put down an amendment to that motion deleting all words after &ldquo;Dail Éireann&rdquo; and inviting the House to welcome the generous provision made in the public capital programme for the current year for the maintenance of a high level of activity on local authority housing construction and notes an anticipated increase in the total number of new house completions this year arising from the Government's national housing programme. <Col N="1171" /> The Minister for the Environment is nothing if he is not brave in putting his name to that amendment.</P>
    <P>Every family is entitled to a house. Every family needs a house in order that it may live as a family and enjoy reasonable happiness and a reasonable standard of living.  Indeed, I will go further than that and I will say that society owes it to families who cannot provide a house for themselves to provide houses for them at public expense. It is particularly essential that young married couples starting off in life get an opportunity of starting off with a proper house so that they will be in a position to live in reasonable happiness, to bring up their families properly without unnecessary obstacles put in their way which would endanger their marriage.</P>
    <P>People who have no houses and who see no prospect of getting houses&mdash;and there are tens of thousands of them&mdash;are much more conscious now of their right to a house that they were some time ago. This right has been brought home to them by the fact that what I will call the well-heeled sector of our society appear to be moving into what it would be no exaggeration to call palatial dwellings all over the country.  That is bringing home to unfortunate people who have no house their plight.  It is making them more unhappy.  I would like to warn the Minister and indeed this Government that in running down the local authority housing programme they are embarking on a very dangerous policy which can bring nothing but unhappiness to this country and can only add to the industrial unrest and strife that we are experiencing at present.</P>
    <P>As far as I can ascertain there are about 35,000 families seeking houses from local housing authorities.  I cannot be deadly accurate about that figure but from such research as I have been able to do I think that local authorities would asknowledge that there are on their lists 35,000 families seeking houses.  If we take an average of four in a family, that means that 140,000 people are improperly and badly housed, living in wretched housing conditions and that <Col N="1172" /> these people cannot house themselves and see no hope of being able to house themselves.  Because the housing authorities have pushed off their lists people who have an income of £70 a week or more we may take it that the people the local authorities acknowledge as seeking houses from them are very deserving indeed.  I believe that if all the people and all the families who are genuinely unable to house themselves and who never will be able to house themselves because of facts which I will deal with later, including the cost of housing, were counted, the figure would not stop at 35,000 families; it would instead probably be double or more than double that figure.  That is the appalling situation that we find the local authority housing programme in at the moment. That is why I and other members of the Fine Gael Party have put down this resolution deploring the hopelessly inadequate allocation of funds to housing authorities this year in respect of new house starts.</P>
    <P>There are an acknowledged 140,000 people or thereabouts all over this country seeking houses&mdash;about 35,000 families.  I want to put on the record of this House where I believe those people are living at the moment.  They are living in grossly overcrowded dwellings shared by other families; they are living in flats which are quite unsuitable for the number of people living in them; or they are isolated small holders throughout the country living in hovels which were erected in the last century and which are certainly not suitable for human habitation. Recently I came across a young married couple who have been married for seven years and who are now expecting their first baby.  They are living in a three-bedroomed house with 11 other people, most of them adults.  That is hard to believe but it is a fact that 13 people, most of them grown up adults, are sharing a three-bedroomed house. Two of those people are a young married couple expecting their first baby. They have been married for seven years.</P>
    <P>I know of four other young couples who have been married for seven years, and who will not be able to house themselves but will not be supplied with a local authority house because they do <Col N="1173" /> not have any children.  There is something very heartless about writing young married couples off the housing list simply because they do not have any children.  It is possible that this does not happen in every local authority but I am aware that it is the situation in many. There are many reasons why a young couple may not have any children.  It is possible that such a couple are not prepared to start a family until they have a house or there may be medical reasons for a couple not having any children, It is inhuman to tell such couples annually that they do not qualify for a house simply because they do not have any children.</P>
    <P>The young couples I am thinking of have many difficulties and domestic problems without adding a final blow to them by stating that until such time as they have children they will not qualify for a house.  I know of a couple who have been married for up to ten years, have one child and live in a caravan on the family farm.  They have explained to me that they cannot have any more family because the amount of accommodation available to them is limited and they do not have a house to move into.  We must also consider the big percentage of couples who live in flats.  I am aware of three families who live in accommodation over shops, accommodation which was reckoned as unsuitable for one family.  Those families must live there because they cannot get a house.  It is not hard to imagine the effects of such difficulties on young married couples; they are appalling and damaging.  It is more difficult for women and children.  Is it any wonder that many young women must make regular trips to local doctors to get tablets for their nerves.  If they are not on such tablets they are on the pill or something else because they cannot afford to bring any more children into the world and expect them to grow up in the accommodation they live in.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I hope he will deal specifically with the category of people I am referring to, those who cannot afford to house themselves.  He must forget about the £1,000 grant and the certificate of reasonable value.  I do not want him to give details about such <Col N="1174" /> matters or about the number of houses that have been built by those on higher income.  For the purposes of this debate I am not concerned about such people.  I met a young couple in a lounge bar recently and they told me that after seven years of marriage they still had not got a house.  The lady pointed out that if they had a house they would not be spending as much time in lounge bars, the only place they could go for some privacy.</P>
    <P>What are the Government doing about this problem?  I do not think they appreciate the position because if they did they would have acted more speedily. In 1966 or 1969 Fianna Fáil published a White Paper stating that it was necessary to ease off on local authority house-building because there were other more important matters to be attended to.  Fianna Fáil lived up to that statement because they cut down on the number of local authority houses built. Fortunately, the National Coalition attacked this problem and the Minister for Local Government, under difficult circumstances, made a good job of improving that situation.  That Minister was criticised by Fianna Fáil for concentrating on building local authority houses but the facts have proved that the action he took was correct.  The Green Paper issued by Fianna Fáil this year repeats the prescription of the earlier Fianna Fáil White Paper, that the local authority housing lists would have to be investigated and people who could afford to build their own houses pushed off them.  There is no urgency expressed in that publication about the need to increase the number of local authority houses being built.  In the programme for national development for 1978-1981 the Government have the same prescription, cut down on local authority housing and get the people to rely on loans, low interest mortgages and grants.</P>
    <P>In 1978 only 6,000 local authority dwellings were completed and I believe that figure will show a reduction this year.  The number of starts this year will be a lot less than last year.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the allocation for local authority housing under the public capital programme for 1979.  It is stated there under the heading <Col N="1175" /> of local authority housing that the capital provision for 1979 is £86 million and that that, combined with a generally more favourable cash balance position for housing authorities in 1979, will enable building activity to continue at approximately the same level as 1978. That is wrong.  That amount of money could not possibly permit local authority building to proceed at the same rate as 1978.  Those who wrote it must have known that because it represents an increase of only 6.1 per cent over 1978. We know that inflation has gone sky high.  Even the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy on a radio programme on Sunday was hoping for a 10 per cent inflation rate.  We know also that the sort of inflation about which the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and the Government were speaking bears no comparison with that taking place in house building.</P>
    <P>I put down some questions to the Minister for Education and discovered that he, in his allocation for school building for 1979, has allowed for an inflation rate of 23.9 per cent.  We are aware that in regard to house building costs inflation is higher still.  I think the Government acknowledge it to be in excess of 28 per cent and no doubt they are cutting down that figure as much as possible.  The fact of the matter is that the allocation this year will build approximately 20 per cent fewer houses than were built last year.</P>
    <P>I posed a number of questions to the Minister for the Environment today tabled for written reply in the hope that I would receive replies today.  What I received were not replies, but I was put off; I did not get the replies I sought.  For example in Question No. 289 I asked the Minister to tell me:</P>
    <P>in respect of each housing authority, the number of new local authority house starts from and including 1970 to date.</P>
    <P>I was told the information requested by me is being compiled and will be forwarded to me as soon as it is available.  I wanted that information for his debate and of course the Minister <Col N="1176" /> knew that.  My question was tabled in time for written answer today, but that is the answer I received.  In another Question, No. 291, also tabled for written reply today I asked the Minister for the Environment:</P>
    <P>the financial allocation to each housing authority in respect of the years 1972 to 1979 inclusive and the amount requested by each such authority in the same years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred me to a 1978 reply in that respect and I suppose I should be grateful for that.</P>
    <P>As far as I can ascertain is seems that local authorities are being allocated about sufficient money this year to complete their commitments but, in respect of new starts, they will be cut back drastically.  My colleague, Deputy Harte, established that clearly in respect of Donegal in an adjournment debate in this House.  That is the position in regard to the allocation in the Capital Programme this year&mdash;a 6 per cent increase&mdash;when we know that there is a housing inflation rate of at least 28 per cent.  The Minister did appear to be conceding at Question Time the other day that there was a difficulty this year so far as new house starts were concerned. That does not surprise me in view of the allocation made.  The Minister has been telling us for some time that he is relying on low mortgage interest.  Low mortgage interest is of no use whatever to people who want to build a house, who have no site and no money.  It is confined to loans of £9,000 and not all of the £9,000 is subsidised; I understand that a figure of £5,600 or more is excluded and that there is a subsidy on the remainder.  It is confined to people who live already in a local authority house, or who are tenant-purchasers of a local authority house, or who have been on the housing list for 12 months and have two children.  I should like the Minister to tell us how many people who did not occupy local authority houses availed of this facility, how many people who were not already tenants of a local authority house availed of it.  It is a special case.  The people about whom I am concerned are those who are not even able to avail of that facility.  I am satisfied that low rate <Col N="1177" /> mortgage interest caters for special cases, people who live already in local authority houses, who have saved money, who want to improve their position and move into another house.  They are not in the category I am speaking about but it may be useful in the sense that it may get some of those people out of local authority houses and get some of the people about whom I am speaking into them.  But it is of no use to people who are unable to house themselves.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the SDA loans which are useless at present.  The maximum loan allowable is £9,000, costing approximately £23 per week to service.  We know that anybody who has not got a site, who wants to start from scratch and build a house will have a discrepancy between that figure of £9,000 and the cost of building the house of at least £7,000.  When one takes account of the cost of house building at present, of sites, it will be appreciated that the SDA loans operated by local authorities are worthless unless to people such as small farmers who are reasonably well-off, have their own sites and can do a lot of the work themselves.  They may be availed of also by people who are handy, who can undertake a lot of the work themselves.  But it is worthless to people starting from scratch, buying a site and wanting to build a house on it.  The Minister cannot deny that.  At present sites all over the country are exceptionally expensive and beyond the reach of most people.  I know they are dearer in some cases than in others.  Sites in one town are costing approximately £4,000 to £5,000 each and are serviced by water but not sewerage.  One rarely hears of a site going at less than £3,000 anywhere in the country.  When that is added to the cost of building a house, the mortgage interest or the SDA loan, it is almost valueless.</P>
    <P>I am talking about the people whose income will not permit them to house themselves.  The Minister may talk about a figure of £80 a week and say that people should be able to house themselves on that.  That might be possible if everybody was a good manager, if they manage their lives properly, were not extravagant, did not spend money foolishly, did not take a drink and <Col N="1178" /> perhaps did not back a horse.  However, we are not all good managers.  If the Government were good managers we would not have all the strikes we have and we would not have the economy in the mess it is in.  The Government are obviously not perfect; they are fallible. We are dealing with people who are looking for houses.  We are dealing with a cross-section of the community, good managers and bad managers.</P>
    <P>The Minister will possibly talk about loans available from building societies. A person who wants to house himself will have to borrow at least £16,000 from a building society which will cost that person almost £50 a week.  This is completely outside the reach of the people I am talking about.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister for the Environment today to tell me the allocation asked for and given in respect of each local authority for each year since 1970. He referred me to a question which gave me the information in respect of 1978 and told me the remainder of the information was being compiled.  I looked at the information given in relation to 1978 and I found that only a fraction of the allocation asked for was given.  I will take a few at random.  For example, Cavan asked for £340,000 and were given £120,000; Kerry asked for £1,017,000 and were given £470,000; Meath asked for £992,000 and were given £300,000, and Monaghan asked for £300,000 and were given £125,000.  It is no wonder we have so few houses being erected.</P>
    <P>A situation which could become dangerous is developing.  It is a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, the people who are well housed getting much better housing and the people who have no houses being put on the long finger.  In regard to house inflation, a modest house I know of was sold in October 1976 for £14,800.  I thought that was expensive then but another house in a worse part of the same road, opposite to a factory, was recently sold for £28,000.  I am told that in Leixlip houses which were going for £14,000 in the beginning of 1977 were going for £18,000 eight months ago and are now going for £24,000.  That type house price inflation needs to be looked into.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> I am not concerned with that in this debate.  I put down this motion to get the Minister to deal with the people who are the direct responsibility of himself, of the Government and of this House: those who are unable to house themselves and, unless they win the sweep or the pools, will never be able to house themselves. The policy the Government are embarking on can bring nothing but unrest.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister for Finance can ask people to tighten their belts and be responsible when there are 140,000 people without adequate housing and who cannot out of their own resources house themselves.  If we knew the true figure we would probably find that there are 200,000 people in that category.  The policy of the Minister for the Environment is to cut back on local authority finance.  The Minister for Education told me in reply to a question that the inflation for schools was 23 per cent.  The Minister for the Environment knows that house inflation was approximately 28 per cent.  I ask the Minister and the Government to reconsider their policy in regard to local authority housing, which they began in 1969, restated immediately after they came back to power in their Green Paper and their White Paper and which they are still implementing. This is an unjust policy, the same as the budget of 1978, which has brought us all the trouble we have at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;welcomes the generous provision made in the Public Capital Programme for the current year for the maintenance of a high level of activity on the local authority housing construction programme and notes an anticipated increase in the total number of new house completions this year arising from the Government's national housing programme.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public capital programme provision for local authority housing, including low-rise mortgages, in 1979 is £86 <Col N="1180" /> million.  This means that, excluding £4 million provided specifically for low-rise mortgages in respect of private houses and adding the normal amount of working overdraft, a total of more than £90 million will be available in 1979 for spending on the local authority housing construction programme.  This is a generous allocation.  Indeed, in current boom conditions in the building industry generally £90 million is probably as much as the local authority housing sector could absorb without causing an unacceptable level of overheating in the industry.</P>
    <P>In making this generous provision the Government had the objective of ensuring that the urgent housing needs of families and persons unable to provide their own accommodation will be dealt with on a priority basis.  Families with high incomes on waiting lists are encouraged to house themselves.  In making specific provision for low-rise mortgages the Government wanted to ensure the maximum possible use of this useful supplement to the normal local authority housing programme.  The subsidised loans made to eligible applicants to enable them to buy new or previously occupied houses have largely the same effect&mdash;although indirectly in some cases&mdash;as normal building by local authorities, but the cost to public funds, both in terms of capital and subsidy contributions, is significantly less than direct building by local authorities.  Bearing in mind the huge and constantly increasing cost of subsidies, and in fairness to taxpayers, it is essential to encourage maximum use of private enterprise in housing and to conserve the funds available for the local authority programme for rehousing applicants who genuinely need the heavily subsidised accommodation. There is no question, however, of forcing families without the necessary income levels to buy private houses.  Such families will be offered accommodation by housing authorities according to their degree of housing need.  With a view to meeting genuine needs the Government have maintained a steady output of houses for families and individuals on approved waiting lists.  The total of local authority housing completions and low-rise mortgages in 1978 was 6,791 compared <Col N="1181" /> with 6,635 in 1977 and 7,263 in 1976.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme provision of £86 million will enable completions, work in progress and employment on the national programme to be maintained in 1979 at a similar level to 1977 and 1978.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the impression which Opposition Deputies try to give that there has been a dramatic cut back on the local authority housing programme, performance in 1978 was good.  The average monthly total of local authority dwellings in progress in 1978 was 8,600 compared with 8,700 in 1977 and 8,200 in 1976.  The number of dwellings in progress at 31 January 1979 was 8,607, substantially higher than at 31 January 1976, when the Coalition Government had let the total number of houses fall steadily down to 8,357, and to 8,077 at the end of February 1976.  Average monthly employment on the programme in 1978 was 6,400, compared with 6,295 in 1977 and a mere 5,634 in 1976.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House deplores what it refers to as &ldquo;the hopelessly inadequate allocation of finance by the Government to housing authorities in respect of new house starts in the current year&rdquo;.  Do Opposition Deputies know precisely what the allocation for new starts in 1979 is?  I certainly do not.  I will not know until later in the year, when the pattern of actual spending has become clearer, how much can be allocated for new starts.  This depends on how much is spent on work in progress, and it is too early in the year yet to make any firm estimate of savings on moneys allocated for existing commitments.</P>
    <P>Certainly, on the basis of trends in expenditure during the past four months, these savings will be substantial&mdash;measured, I would expect, in terms of millions rather than hundreds of thousands of pounds.  All confirmed savings will be devoted to additional starts later this year.  This has been the pattern for the past six or seven years.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the procedure being operated in the allocation of moneys for local authority housing in 1979 is exactly the same as was used in the time of the Coalition Government except that we are putting greater <Col N="1182" /> emphasis on the relative urgency of housing needs in different areas in deciding how moneys are allocated for new work.</P>
    <P>It is a regular feature of this procedure every year to redistribute moneys which are surplus to the requirements of individual authorities because of factors such as the weather, withdrawal of contractors or local difficulties in the supply of skilled labour or materials.  The pattern of new starts since 1976 has tended to concentrate the largest number into the last quarter of the year.  The reason for this is obvious.  Housing authorities aim to get extra work in progress late in the year to qualify for financing commitments in the following year.  This in turn tends to overload the proportion of existing commitments as against new starts in the early part of the following year.</P>
    <P>There is no cause, however, for gloom in the figures for new work so far this year.  Out of the total allocations, amounting to £89.89 million, made to authorities so far this year, £22.4 million was allocated for new starts in 1979 compared with an equivalent figure last year of £21.5 million.  In addition to this amount housing authorities have been given specific authorisation to start more new work out of savings on commitments. As I have already said, these may be substantial because expenditure on the programme generally so far this year appears to have been at least £3 million to £4 million below what might have been expected.</P>
    <P>I am confident, therefore, that we will be able to finance sufficient new starts to enable the programme to continue at a steady high level into 1980.  The House will be aware that in recent years it has been the practice to set aside overall allocations for the major Dublin housing authorities in order to ensure orderly progress and an adequate level of starts for the major programmes which have been developed by these authorities.  This pre-emption in favour of the Dublin area of a substantial part of the resources for new work in any year is not without its repercussions in the rest of the country where some authorities have made such excellent progress with their programmes that their remaining needs are of a relatively low order of priority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> These authorities must temporarily accept a greater flow of available funds to others worse off than themselves. However, the relative urgency of housing needs is not the only constraint on the division of resources.  There must be orderly progression in the programme in every area.  Sudden expansion or contraction in the size of the programme under construction can disrupt the local building industry and can have unacceptable effects on employment.  I must aim to avoid both local overheating and any sudden reduction causing unemployment in an area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is inevitable, therefore, that some authorities will not be able to expand their output as rapidly as they would like.  It is not possible to accede to all demands for additional finance at any one time.  My aim is to achieve a fair and equitable distribution of available resources which will not unduly disturb the pattern of local employment.  By and large this is being done, as will be evident by the high level of employment maintained throughout 1978 in spite of the serious increase in tender prices during that year.</P>
      <P>I should like, now, to clear up some misapprehensions of Deputies opposite about particular area allocations.  First, I will take the Dublin area.  As the House will be aware, this area has been getting special treatment arising from the fact that separate overall allocations for Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council have been made at the beginning of each year.  This, in effect, preempts up to half of the available resources.  I have done this because of the large numbers still on the approved waiting lists and in spite of the sizeable reduction in the relative urgency of housing needs measured by the percentage of families of four persons or over on these lists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular, Dublin Corporation, with a 1979 allocation of one-third of all available resources&mdash;£30 million out of <Col N="1184" /> £90 million&mdash;have about 29 per cent of waiting list applicants.  This is generous treatment.  Last year they had £28.5 million and were unable to spend the full amount allocated to them since their debit balance notified to my Department was about £.5 million less than the authorised level.  Similarly Dublin County Council, on the figures notified to me, appear to have underspent on their total authorised allocation for 1978 by about £1.35 million.</P>
    <P>In the light of the 1978 figures, and bearing in mind the bad weather and conditions in the industry in the first quarter of the present year, I believe that both Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council will have difficulty in spending on their building programme all the moneys I have allocated to them.</P>
    <P>As regards Cork Corporation, they too have got a generous £3.4 million, taking account of their actual spending in 1978, which was £2½ million and bearing in mind also the very high demands at present on the building industry in the Cork area generally.  Cork Corporation have been slow in building up their programme and too fast an increase all at once in a very short time could cause difficulties.  The allocation of £3.4 million to them so far this year is not as much as they would have liked. Some savings on existing commitments are, however, already evident, and I am confident that these savings and an additional allocation to be decided later in the year will enable them to go ahead with a steady but sensible build-up of their programme.</P>
    <P>The situation in Donegal county, which we heard about last week, has been exaggerated out of all proportion. Donegal County Council have done very well indeed in recent years.  Outside of the Dublin area Donegal County Council have got the biggest county council allocation in the country so far this year&mdash;over £2 million.  On the figures furnished to my Department their spending for the first quarter is well below the authorised level.  They should therefore have estimated savings of a substantial order to add to the £275,000 allocation made to them for additional new work to be started by 31 July 1979.</P>

      <P>I would hope that they too will get substantially more later on when sufficient evidence is available to me in the mid-summer review of the pattern of savings on existing commitments in the first part of the year.  Any scheme which is genuinely needed or urgently required for rural cottages will be enabled to get under way by the late autumn, and perhaps earlier this year.</P>
      <P>The motives of Fine Gael Deputies who signed this motion in an attempt to create an impression of crisis in the programme are understandable a few weeks before the local and the Euro elections. If they have any genuine fears about their local programmes, they can rest easy in the knowledge that any humps in the programme will be ironed out later this year in the course of the normal review and redistribution of resources.</P>
      <P>Our local authority housing programme, supplemented by the low-rise mortgage scheme, and casual vacancies in existing council housing estates, should enable up to about 9,500 families to be offered alternative housing accommodation this year.  The estimated total number of all families of more than three persons on approved waiting lists is 9,400.</P>
      <P>Up to now, I have referred almost entirely to local authority housing in deference to the terms of the Opposition motion.  In drafting that motion, they carefully avoided any reference to the overall national housing programme and, in particular, to private housing.  In moving the amendment to the motion, I am confident that the Government's overall national housing programme cannot honestly be challenged.  Our achievements are self-evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to refer briefly to three main elements in our national housing programme, namely, total housing completions, public capital expenditure on housing and mortgage finance.  Table 1 of my Department's Quarterly Bulletin of Housing Statistics shows the trend in house completions.  In round figures, new house completions dropped by <Col N="1186" /> 2,900 between 1975 and 1976, when 24,000 houses were built.  Completions increased by 500 in 1977 and by a further 900 last year, when 25,400 houses were built.  Despite bad building weather during the first four months of 1979, almost 9,900 houses were completed in that period and present indications are that more than 25,500 houses will be completed this year.  The downward trend in housing activity, which was evident up to mid-1977 was reversed as a direct result of the effective action taken by the Government when we resumed office in July 1977.</P>
    <P>Table 14 of the last Quarterly Bulletin shows that public capital expenditure on housing dropped from £115 million in 1975 to £105 million in 1976 and to only £100 million in 1977&mdash;all this in a period of rapidly increasing housing costs.  This downward trend was reversed by an expenditure of £129 million last year and a provision this year of £165 million.  These figures illustrate very clearly the extent of the Government's financial support for the national housing programme.</P>
    <P>Regarding mortgages, I want to say without fear of contradiction that under this Government mortgage finance for the purchase of private houses has been more readily available and in far greater amounts than at any time in the country's history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;compared with 25,200 in 1976 and 24,500 in 1977.  The outlook for the present year is also very good.  The net inflow of funds to building societies so far this year has been exceptionally high with net deposits in the first four months totalling £82.9 million as against £27.9 million in the corresponding period of 1978.  The expected <Col N="1187" /> levels of advances by the associated banks and by assurance companies should again be adequate this year.  For their part, the Government's provision for house purchase and improvement loans at £44.5 million compares with an expenditure of only £17.7 million in 1977.  Further, the Government have indicated that for the first time the trustee savings banks will be empowered to make house purchase loans.</P>
      <P>The facts and figures I have mentioned can leave no genuine grounds for questioning the adequacy of the provision made in the public capital programme for the current year for the maintenance of a high level of activity on the local authority housing construction programme.  There is every reason also to anticipate a further increase again this year in total housing completions.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick was a little naïve when he accused the Government of running down the local authority housing programme.  He carefully overlooked the fact that under the National Coalition Government in which he was a Minister local authority housing output fell by no less than 28 per cent between 1975 and 1977, from 8,794 houses in 1975 to 6,333 houses in 1977.  This Government have stopped that decline.  The number of families rehoused by local authorities in new houses or under the low rise mortgage scheme was 6,635 in 1977 and 6,791 last year.  Output this year will be maintained at that level.  This is the sensible way of programming housing construction to avoid the peaks and slumps that occurred under the Government in which Deputy Fitzpatrick was a Minister.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick quoted a figure of 35,000 families awaiting rehousing by local authorities.  He said housing was needed by 140,000 persons or even more and he suggested, without any basis, that the real numbers would be far in excess of that.  The gross number of applicants on approved waiting lists given to me by the authorities is 27,392 at 30 September 1978 or about 30 per cent less than the number mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick.</P>

      <P>It is the return available to me for 30 September 1978.  Some Deputies are shouting about the amount available for new starts but I want to emphasise that they are talking about only the initial allocations.  It is not a new procedure to have further allocations after the first half of the year.  This has been going on for a number of years. It is wrong for anyone to judge the new starts on the figure which is already allocated. I have given instances where local authorities were unable to spend their initial allocations or their total allocations last year and in previous years. There is no doubt that there will be savings in many local authority housing areas and when these moneys are reallocated in accordance with the priority that exists in other areas for new starts there will be no cut-back whatever.  It should be remembered that local authorities have a tendency to start new houses towards the end of the year in order to have them included as commitments for the following year's allocation. Naturally the major percentage has to go for existing commitments.</P>
      <P>I want to emphasise that there is no cut-back in local authority housing.  The low rise mortgage facilities available are expected to provide approximately 500 more houses at local authority level this year.  I have no doubt that at the end of the year the total number of houses built will be as good as, and perhaps even better than, our performance in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find debates that centre around statistics being thrown across the table, one disproving the other, very difficult to follow and I do not want to get into that kind of debate.  However, one <Col N="1189" /> clarification with regard to official statistics is necessary and I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to clarify the point either this evening or at some stage in the debate.</P>
      <P>The Minister has seen fit to shift the basis of this debate from the public sector to the private sector and to proclaim the marvellous achievement of the highest ever number of privately built houses being achieved last year.  I checked these figures and it seems to me there could be an error in them.  In the December quarterly bulletin in Table 1 the figure for 1974 is 19,510 but in a subsequent table it drops to a lower number.  In 1978 the figure given is 19,371 but the Minister quoted from a table which showed the figure was higher.  I have not got the reference now but it would be helpful if we could get that clarified.  Earlier the Minister claimed that the actual completion of houses in the private sector last year was higher than at any other period.  I am just querying this matter and would be glad to have it clarified.</P>
      <P>This debate is really about the whole question of the Government's attitude to the elimination of homelessness in our society.  The Minister has carefully avoided any discussion about that central issue because any logical analysis of the figures presented in the debate or in reply to Parliamentary Questions or in the Statistical Bulletin shows that those people who are homeless and have reached the stage of officially describing themselves as homeless now find it more difficult to get housing either on the open market or by direct intervention of the State through public sector housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister himself has provided the basic figures in answer to a question from Deputy Dr. Browne dated 27 February this year for written reply in which he stated that the percentage of total new houses represented by local authority houses in 1975 and in each subsequent year were as follows: 1975, 32.7; 1976, 30.3; 1977, 25.8 and in 1978, 23.9.  At the end of the written reply there is a sentence stating: &ldquo;It is estimated that the percentage in 1979 will be of the same order as the percentage <Col N="1190" /> in the past two years&rdquo;, in other words, about 24 per cent.</P>
    <P>You can justify history depending on how far back you begin quoting statistics.  The Minister began all his statistics from 1977.  I shall not embarrass him or his party by going back to 1971 or 1966: Deputies know these figures.  In any case it will not get the people with whom we are concerned housed.  The issue is how we can make the maximum use, within the terms of this Government's mandate and economic policy and within the context of the Department of the Environment, of the housing capital resources made available by the Minister for Finance. Neither Fine Gael nor the Labour Party can change that allocation&mdash;much as we would like to.  Neither can we argue about the size of the allocation; it is made.  But what we can do, and what I should like to do is to say quite directly and clearly to the Minister and the Minister of State tonight that they are not being competent in the way in which the money is used, that it could be used more effectively in overall terms from a variety of points of view but, most important, from the point of view of people who depend on this House if they are ever to be properly housed.</P>
    <P>I should like to support what Deputy Fitzpatrick has said about increased pressure in regard to local authority houses.  Demand for such housing has increased.  The Minister in his attempted refutation of Deputy Fitzpatrick's claim that there are about 35,000 applicants on the housing list said that the actual figure was 27,392.  If memory serves me correctly that was in reply to a Parliamentary Question from myself and the significant thing which I got him to put firmly on record was that it was at 30 September.  The same Minister and the same Department in a written reply to my colleague, Deputy Horgan, provided a list without a total.  Deputy Fitzpatrick totalled it and it came out at the figure accurately quoted by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  So, we are talking about 35,000.  I hope that, in the interests of honesty and democracy, when the Minister of State speaks he will recognise that the figures Deputy Fitzpatrick quoted were figures supplied to <Col N="1191" /> Deputy Horgan and are accurate and that the Minister, perhaps by mistake, did not realise that coming from the Opposition spokesmen in Fine Gael were figures supplied by his own Department. If we are to deal in figures at least let us in this House on a quiet night share honesty about them and not try to claim that they are not the right figures. The Government of the day always have more resources on their side regarding figures than we can have and it does no credit to the process of democracy to begin to shuffle them in the way that was attempted tonight.</P>
    <P>I would be happy if that was the only argument I had about the Minister's competence in handling his Department, but it is not.  He was hardly on his feet defending the effect of the capital allocation of £86 million plus £4 million to which he referred&mdash;in round figures, £90 million&mdash;as against the 1978 allocation when he proceeded to say&mdash;and this is the Minister for housing, not the Minister for the construction industry&mdash;that it would be irresponsible of him as Minister if he made the allocation any greater.  I now quote what I heard: the official record may be somewhat different, but I think the sense of it was because it would cause an unacceptable level of overheating in the industry. While he was hardly on his feet, that was his priority&mdash;not the 35,000 applicants on the housing lists.  First, he disputed that there were so many on the lists, working on figures from last September. His first priority was to prevent overheating in the building industry.  From there on, you get the bias of Fianna Fáil in office because their primary responsibility in government is to the building industry.</P>
    <P>Later, he spoke about the three primary aims of the party in Government and again, if I am quoting him properly, he said they were overall housing completions, the level of public expenditure in the industry and finally availability of housing mortgage finance. He crowed about mortgage finance being so good.  It is good; it should be at 14.5 per cent interest without any Government subsidy for those people who can barely manage.  It is my firm <Col N="1192" /> belief that the present Minister and his backbenchers are using the public sector of the housing market as a subsidiary to the overall housing sector in such a way that the interests of people on the housing lists are secondary to the interests of the building industry to such an extent that the Minister will go so far as to say that he will not make more money available for fear of overheating the industry.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have said on numerous occasions that they are committed to promoting home ownership.  That is a laudable aim but it is a blanket aim and in the context of the kind of uneven and unjust society we have it can frequently mean that people who are well housed become better housed.  If there is a major ideological difference&mdash;I believe there is&mdash;between the Labour Party and Fianna Fáil it is that our commitment would be first and foremost to the elimination of homelessness.  The actions of the last 20 months since July 6, have made the achievement of that aim more difficult and have made the reality of homelessness more savage.  The questions being asked of public representatives of any party and of Fianna Fáil candidates who seek election to Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council or the Cork Corporation concern housing.  Yet housing is being shoved into a secondary position by this right-wing Government.</P>
    <P>The bias is there.  I have quoted the figures.  It is in the statements by the Minister.  It is compounded in 1979 by the fact that the abolition of rates combined with the £1,000 grant has given a fantastic subsidy to people who are already housed.  If local authority housing and new housing starts are about anything they are about eliminating homelessness.  We have lived with it for far too long.  So long as we continue to have the irrational economic system that we have, regrettably it will be there. Even within the confines of that irrational economic system it can be modified and minimised.  It was minimised at the height of our economic depression.  In a depression it is the weakest who are hit first.  If we have a depression&mdash;I hope we do not but there are sufficient indicators to suggest that <Col N="1193" /> many projections do not look healthy&mdash;it will be interesting to see if the Minister will stand up and crow so loudly about performances of his Department and contrast them in a boom time with their performance in a depression.  It is significant that the Minister chose 1975 as a base line.</P>
    <P>The money for local authority housing is not enough.  I accept that local authorities have been unable to spend all the money they got.  The Minister should have analysed the reasons why instead of saying that because they are not spending enough perhaps they do not really need it.  The fact is that they do need it.  They have a land bank which is greater in most instances than any of the private builders.  They have the demand and the statutory obligations but they are falling short in spending their allocations generally because of a number of factors within the building industry.</P>
    <P>The industry is overheated, and the tender prices coming in for other Government Departments are proving this quite dramatically&mdash;tender prices 30 per cent over and above what quantity surveyors estimate would be the reasonable value and cost of the contract. There is such a shortage of skilled men, particularly bricklayers and blocklayers, that some contractors have stated they will not tender for building works that have bricks specified in them as a construction material because they cannot guarantee the supply of labour or give an estimate of the cost.  Who is responsible for that?  Who is responsible for the shortage of skilled people in the building industry now?  This was an industry which traditionally had an obligation to take on apprentices.  This is an industry which did not always have the &ldquo;lump&rdquo; as a component of its economic system.  Perhaps more so than any other industry today this one is closest to the capitalist model of total open jungle warfare. There is much human suffering caused as a consequence both to small builders who go bankrupt and have to live at the edge of their nerves and at the discretion of their bank managers and to many building workers, some of whom are my constituents, who, at the age of 55 are crippled with arthritis or some <Col N="1194" /> other disease which has come as a result of their working conditions.</P>
    <P>The building industry is a jungle. Perhaps it is the last economic jungle in our society.  More than any other it demands some degree of public intervention and regulation to remove the peaks and the dips which have plagued it for so many years.  Is there any evidence that, other than recognising that there are peaks and dips, this Government, with their fantastic capacity by way of being the largest client within that industry, are doing anything to eliminate the peaks? There is not.  This brings me to my charge of incompetence with regard to the Department and the Minister who is politically responsible.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the figures which have been made available for public capital for the housing side in 1978 one will find that by and large all the public capital programme for local authority housing was taken up.  My figures show plus £.47 million going additionally to local authority housing.  In the capital allocation for the private sector, largely for loans and grants, the total being £57.7 million, there is a shortfall in the outturn of £11.9 million that was not spent in that sector.  If the Minister looks at the overall capital sums available to him he can afford to make more money available to the public authority housing programme without doing any damage to overall Government economic strategy, without having to go back to the Department of Finance for extra funds but by realistically looking at the sector for house purchase and reconstruction loans and asking why was £11 million not taken up.  The answers are there.  These loans are processed throughout the country.  The Minister has at his disposal people in the Custom House who have been working in this field for many years and have accumulated more wisdom, as distinct from knowledge, in these matters than is available to any politician who happens to be there.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Donnellan</b> asked the Minister for Finance the composition of the National Monuments Advisory Council, the number of meetings it has held in 1978 and to date in 1979, the matters on which (a) he has sought its advice and (b) it has given advice; and the work it has scheduled for the remainder of 1979.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Monuments Advisory Council is constituted in accordance with Section 15 (1) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954 and at present consists of 25 members.</P>
      <P>The full council held five meetings in 1978 and one to date in 1979.  In addition the Standing Committee of the council met six times in 1978 and twice to date in 1979.  (a) Since the beginning of 1978 the Commissioners of Public Works have sought the advice of the council in the following matters: (1) With larger areas of archaeological interest the council considered advisable to protect by the purchase of land; and what other means they might recommend for that purpose; (2) Whether proposed developments should be permitted on a number of sites which contained or were close to potential national monuments; (3) Proposals for the provision of visitor facilities at Glendalough. (4) Whether, and if so how, the role of local advisory committees should be amended in the light of experience. (b) In addition to advising on the matters detailed above the council advised on the preservation of a number of national monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that for the remainder of 1979 the National Monuments Advisory Council will continue its statutory function of advising the Commissioners of Public Works on matters arising on or relating to the carrying into execution of the provisions of the National Monuments Act, 1930 as amended by the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, <Col N="1084" /> 1954 and on other matters affecting national monuments and the protection and preservation thereof.  In addition it will, I expect, fulfil its functions as a prescribed body under the Planning Acts.</P>

      <P>A proposal for the drainage of the Shannon and some of its tributaries, including the Suck, is at present under consideration. A considerable amount of further investigation and design work would require to be done before it could be decided that a satisfactory drainage scheme would be feasible.</P>
      <P>The Lung River forms part of the Boyle catchment and a scheme for the drainage of that catchment has been prepared.  The necessary steps are being taken to comply with the requirements of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 as regards public exhibition, and confirmation by the Minister for Finance.  All going well, it is hoped that works under the scheme would commence in about a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The text of the circular which was issued on 27 January 1949, was as follows:</P>
      <P>Road Workers&mdash;Broken Time</P>
      <P>A Chara,</P>
      <P>I am directed by the Minister for Local Government to state that representations have been made to him from time to time regarding the loss of wages sustained by road workers due to inclement weather. With a view to an examination of the general position, an enquiry was addressed to each county council asking for particulars of the prevailing practice in regard to payment for broken time.  An analysis of the replies received indicates widely varying practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister feels that it would be desirable to secure as much uniformity as possible in this matter without however interfering with the position <Col N="1097" /> in counties where reasonably satisfactory arrangements are already in force.  Accordingly, he recommends that in any area in which equally or more advantageous conditions are not already in operation, the local authority should consider the advisability of making payment to the nearest half-day worked, that is, that payment be made for a half-day (morning or afternoon) irrespective of the actual time worked in the half-day, and that men reporting for work in the morning be paid for that half-day, even though weather conditions render work impossible.  Where men are asked to report again after the normal luncheon interval, any who do so would be paid for the second half of the day even though the weather does not in fact improve sufficiently to enable work to be done.</P>
    <P>It has also been represented to the Minister that road workers are frequently employed at considerable distances from their homes, even when work is available much nearer, and that this is a cause of grave hardship to the workers concerned during bad weather conditions.  The Minister would like the matter to be examined with a view to removing, so far as possible, any grievance in this respect. He also desires that the question of providing proper shelters for workers in pits and quarries should be considered. In this connection it is stated that present arrangements are generally inadequate; in many cases the shelters provided being neither weather, nor vermin proof.</P>
    <P>The Minister wishes that the terms of this circular letter be brought to the notice of the members of the County Council, and would be glad of a reply in due course indicating the action it is proposed to take on his recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett) Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reckonability of service days and the making of a superannuation award in the case of local authority manual workers is a matter for each local authority in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Superannuation) Act, 1956.  Where a person is aggrieved by failure or refusal of a local authority to grant an award or by the amount of an award granted, he has a right of appeal to me against the local authority decision.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me at this stage to give any general indications in this particular matter.  However, I am having the matter examined to see if any clarification is required.  If this is found to be necessary it can be considered in the context of a superannuation scheme as envisaged in the Local Government (Superannuation) Bill, 1979.</P>
