    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,750,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of December 1979 for a Grant to An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
      <P>There is also a supplementary estimate.</P>
      <P>Under the Arts Acts, 1951 and 1973, An Chomhairle Ealaíon is the main State body entrusted with responsibility for promoting the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts.  It is the principal channel of State funding for artistic enterprises and I regard it as of prime importance to ensure that it is well funded to fulfil that function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it can be fairly said that I have done so in 1978 and am doing so in 1979.  Between the main Estimate and <Col N="347" /> the Supplementary Estimate this year, I am giving the council an increase of over 40 per cent, one of the highest annual increases they have ever received.  Taken with last year's improved subvention, I have increased the grant to the council by about 75 per cent over the two years.</P>
    <P>This improved funding is essential if the council are to sustain the wide range of worthwhile activities in the arts which they have been vigorously promoting in recent years.  I recently appointed a new council under a distinguished chairman, Dr. James White, and with their efforts and the efforts of so many others who are engaged in the arts throughout the country, we can be assured that these funds will be put to very good account.</P>
    <P>The council are statutorily independent in relation to the disbursement by them of the annual grant-in-aid which they receive from the Oireachtas.  The appraisal and assessment of the competing merits of individual applicant bodies are by far the most daunting tasks which the council face.  The members of the council, who all operate in a voluntary and unpaid capacity, deserve our highest praise for the responsible and effective way in which they discharge this duty.</P>
    <P>The need for the Supplementary Estimate this year was borne in on me by the many theatre and arts enterprises which I found to be in difficulty and which the council did not have the money to assist.  Since last autumn, a study group has been reviewing the question of State aid to the arts with specific reference to some of the bodies which had made their difficulties known to me and to the Arts Council.  The extent and method by which further State aid might be given was considered by the group.  As the House knows, the Tániste announced in the budget that an extra £½ million would be made available, over and above what it had been found possible to allocate in the original Estimates.</P>
    <P>This should help towards meeting requirements especially where they are of a substantial capital nature.  I am advised that the council will be assisting the Olympia and Gaiety Theatres in <Col N="348" /> Dublin, the Wexford Opera Festival's project for an extension to the Theatre Royal, Wexford, the Cork Opera House, which has been in financial difficulties in recent years, and the Irish Ballet Company who hope to secure better accommodation. These are ventures well worthy of special financing by the council and I am happy to have been able to facilitate them by the provision of necessary funds.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the council had taken on the financing of the main State theatre enterprises: the Abbey and Peacock Theatres, the Irish Theatre Company&mdash;which is the State touring theatre company&mdash;the Gate Theatre, the Dublin Theatre Festival and the Irish Ballet Company.  These had been financed directly by the Department of Finance out of the Miscellaneous Expenses Vote, but the new arrangement is a natural and desirable development, enabling the expertise of the council to be brought to bear for the betterment of these companies.</P>
    <P>More recently, I understand that Bord Fáilte are arranging to pass over to the council most of the arts enterprises which were hitherto funded by the board.  The cultural nature of these enterprises and the fact that, in many cases, they were also funded by the Arts Council, makes such a move seem logical.  I am sure that they will thrive with the support and guidance of the council.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the council have joined with the Gulbenkian Foundation in two studies which should be of considerable assistance to them and to other agencies, both State and private, in determining a basis for assisting the arts.  The first was a general &ldquo;Report on the Arts in Ireland&rdquo; which has already provided a blueprint for action by the Council.  Earlier this year, a further report on the &ldquo;Arts in Education&rdquo; was published by the council to highlight the need for more consideration of the arts in our schools and centres of higher education.  One of the recommendations of the report was that the Department of Education should set up a committee to consider the arts in education and to liaise with an Arts Council Committee on this.  These committees are being set <Col N="349" /> up and I hope to see their work ensuring a better place in our curricula for the arts.  Another recommendation in that report was the appointment of a full-time Education officer with the Arts Council. I have recently approved this and the council have arranged for recruitment. To service its expanding activities, the council needed more staff.  I have approved the necessary additional posts and the council are recruiting for these extra posts&mdash;a drama officer, finance officer, second visual arts officer and clerical back-up staff.  The authorised staff of the council has increased from five to 16 since the 1973 Act was passed.</P>
    <P>It is not generally realised that there has been a modest scope for some job creation in the arts and the council have been alive to this possibility, not only in strengthening their own team, but in improving administration in grant-aided organisations.  This ensures that the council are better able to monitor and get the best value out of the funds they are disbursing.  It ensures also efficient and systematic management of the grants they are given.  The voluntary and honorary work of the members of these bodies is still the vital source of their success, but the employment of a full-time administrator, when warranted, can provide a valuable continuity of organisation in many cases.  I am thinking of examples such as the Music Association of Ireland, where the Arts Council grant was increased to enable a full-time administrator to be appointed and thereby develop the association's work in organising concerts and recitals throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This approach has been adopted too in jointly funding, with regional development organisations, the posts of regional arts officers.  Two have been appointed so far&mdash;in the mid-west and Galway-Mayo regions&mdash;and others are being planned for the near future.  These officers will act as animateurs, stimulating and guiding the arts organisations in their region to ensure a planned and coordinated approach to arts ventures.</P>
    <P>The joint work of An Chomhairle Ealaíon with the Arts Council of Northern Ireland deserves special praise and mention.  For several years now, the <Col N="350" /> two councils have worked together on joint ventures in the arts and I understand that this has been put on firmer footing with joint meetings of the two councils and joint funding of certain ventures. The Irish Theatre Company, for instance, receive a subvention from the Northern Council in respect of their tours to Belfast and other centres.  There is an arrangement for sharing of exhibitions across the Border and distinguished exhibitions have rotated, for instance, between the Ulster Museum and the Douglas Hyde Gallery here in Trinity College.  The two councils are also joined in the company which will manage Annaghmakerrig House, County Monaghan, the home of the late Sir Tyrone Guthrie, which is intended as an occasional residence for selected artists. I know that we would all wish such a cooperative approach every success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Estimate and in particular I welcome the increase in the grant-in-aid though in the context of the development of the arts in Ireland this amount is still small.  I doubt if anyone here would not welcome any moneys voted to the Arts Council having regard to the excellent work being carried out by that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation of artists in Ireland and of the arts generally in recent years has been a situation merely of survival.  This has been made clear in a number of recent annual reports published by the Arts Council.  We must consider the whole picture in a wider spectrum.  Local authorities should play a larger part in the arts by way of working jointly with the Arts Council in supporting the arts throughout the country.  Local authorities are permitted to provide moneys for the arts from their own sources but they have not done this to any extent.  Indeed, the Government decision to derate private houses and to control increases in the expenditure of local authorities results in effect in local <Col N="351" /> authorities being hindered in regard to providing moneys for the arts because the level of increase allowed each year is not sufficient for the other commitments of local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is time that a different approach was taken by the Arts Council and by the Government, through the Office of the Taoiseach, to allow local authorities special access to funds that would ensure that the arts would flourish.  A specific role that local authorities can play in this area is in relation to the provision of premises not only for the visual arts but for music and so on.  In many parts of the country drama and music groups do not have premises but local authorities are the ideal vehicles through which premises could and should be provided.  We should not shirk our responsibility to ask local authorities to play their part in providing these premises.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of premises is raised in the most recent report of the Arts Council, that is, their 1977 report.  They rate this matter as their highest priority.  Special funds should be made available to local authorities in order to facilitate them to help the arts in the broadest sense.</P>
    <P>It is said sometimes that the arts do not rate highly in our society.  That point was made forcibly by Ciaran Benson in his report on the place of art in Irish education.  In that excellent report Mr. Benson put forward 119 recommendations. We must ask why the arts are not appreciated by the public generally.  The fault lies with our education system in that neither at first nor second level education is there any priority given to the arts.  Neither is there scope for the development of any artistic bent in a young child.  The structure of our curriculum is too narrow.  It is designed towards examinations, to achieving points for university entrance.  Therefore, what is needed is a change in our education structure.  We need a radical change from the examination type system to a system in which there is concentration on the personality of the child, on the development of the personality as opposed to programming the child towards examinations.  Obviously the Taoiseach <Col N="352" /> has not full responsibility in this area but he has a part to play in it by reason of his position in relation to the Arts Council. An attempt has been made at primary school level to orientate the system towards the personal development of the child and a similar attempt should be made in respect of second level education.  This is very important if our educational system is to produce mature adults who will appreciate the environment in which they live, who will appreciate art in the broad sense.</P>
    <P>There have been some interesting developments recently.  For example, the establishment of the Mid-West Association has proved to be an excellent idea.  I am aware of the excellent work being done by Mr. Paul Funge, not only in relation to his appointment there, but in his work elsewhere.  The annual Gorey Arts Week for which he was responsible has been very successful.  He has done very good work.  The concept of developing an appreciation of arts based on regional development organisation is a sound one.  It sets an organisational structure firmly on the ground.  The Arts Council must work very hard to ensure that what has been done in the Mid-West Arts Association can be extended right across the country through the other regional development organisations and can be developed on a professional footing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a percentage of all public contracts should go towards the establishment of the arts whereby a portion of public contracts would be devoted to the visual arts or through promoting some works of art.  This would make the public more aware of the need for promoting the arts and bringing them more to the public rather than the present position where the public do not appreciate the arts in the broader sense.  The bursary system operated by the Arts Council is a sound one.  Many artists have benefited from it.  I believe it should be expanded especially in relation to young artists who, above all, need to be given financial encouragement. A new system could perhaps be devised which would allow the Arts Council to sponsor young artists in return for publication of their works, the purchase of their works or <Col N="353" /> the donation of a percentage of their works to hotels, local authorities or places where the public can see their work.  That positive type of involvement by the Arts Council could have a very beneficial effect on the artists in our society.</P>
    <P>The activity of the Arts Council in having joint meetings with the Northern Ireland Arts Council is excellent.  Cross-Border activity in this field is ideal. There are no political problems.  We should encourage joint exhibitions from Northern Ireland art galleries.  Choral societies and drama groups could come down here, as they do already to the Waterford Light Opera Festival.  We enjoy their presence.  The Taoiseach mentioned the establishment of the An-naghmakerrig House and the development of it.  That will have a lasting value. The late Sir Tyrone Guthrie's involvement there is very praiseworthy.  It must be cherished and developed in the coming years.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the functions of the Arts Council, which should be expanded, is the Ciste Colmcille, a benevolent fund for artists.  We should try to achieve a good standard of living for our artists.  We should realise they have a great part to play in our society. If we have not got a live culture with the people partaking in our arts and culture we cannot really say that we are a nation. A nation without a live culture is a weak nation and one which will not be able to face up to different crises.  It is vital that our artists are supported when they are young and when they are in poor circumstances.  The Ciste Colmcille should be expanded.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Arts Council in helping the Irish Theatre Company in various theatres throughout the country is very welcome.  On this occasion we should mention the lamented death of Micheál MacLiammoir who played such a major part in Irish arts since the establishment of the Gate Theatre.  His passing is a great tragedy for the Irish theatre.  The Government might consider establishing a Micheál MacLiammoir memorial.  I know that his work has been marked in a small way by the Arts Council.  Micheál MacLiammoir's love of Ireland and things Irish, especially the <Col N="354" /> Irish theatre, should be marked in a more national way.  The theatre should take the opportunity of establishing a fund for young artists.  The name of Micheál MacLiammoir would always be remembered by the establishment of such a bursary or scholarship.  This would not strain the Exchequer but the people of Ireland would cherish this very much.  This is the first occasion since Micheál MacLiammoir's death that we have had a chance in this House of mentioning his name in the context of the Arts Council.  I ask the Taoiseach to seriously consider making his dedication to the arts and the Irish theatre in a special way.</P>
    <P>The organisations which up to now were funded by Bord Fáilte will now be taken over by the Arts Council.  I hope the Arts Council will not diminish their interest in funding events which were formerly funded by Bord Fáilte.  I believe a three year guarantee of funding at the present level has been given by the Arts Council.  I do not like the concept of a three year guarantee of funding at the present level.  I would not like to feel that at the end of three years the Arts Council would lose interest in funding the events which were formerly funded by Bord Fáilte.  The Arts Council must appreciate the commercial value and the value to tourism of arts in the broad spectrum and ensure that whatever funds are needed by sponsors will continue to be given after the expiry of the three years.</P>
    <P>One of the principal recommendations of the Benson Report was that the Department of Education should establish an internal committee to look at the arts in education and to liaise with a committee of the Arts Council.  I understand that the Department have agreed to this procedure and that the committee is currently being set up.  I hope it is not a pigeon-holing exercise, not merely a committee being established, the outcome of whose deliberations we will never hear, because that is something to which we have become too used in Irish life.  I would hope there would be a time limit placed on the work of the committee and that their recommendations, when published, will be implemented. <Col N="355" /> The recommendations of the Benson Report are so wide-ranging and comprehensive that I regret the Taoiseach did not mention them in greater detail in his opening speech.  They recommend really a complete change of attitude within the Irish educational system.  The recommendations are profound, and perhaps the Taoiseach would discuss some of the major ones in his reply, especially those contained in section (A) of the Report.  If they are worthy of discussion in this House they will cost money, will involve manpower, and let us understand also that the future of our society depends on the money we spend in education encouraging the development of the child's appreciation of the arts in our society.</P>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach to make a statement on the Earlsfort Terrace concert hall which has been under consideration for some time.  I understand that the deliberations have been finalised and proposals submitted to the Department of Finance.  There is no question about the need for a concert hall in our capital city.  Certainly we should have a premier concert hall in the country.  I would ask the Taoiseach to examine the position and perhaps say something in that respect in his reply.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the various activities of the Arts Council.  They are doing good work with limited funds.  I appeal for greater emphasis on the arts and their development throughout the country, not merely centred in Dublin or in the major urban areas.  To concentrate on the arts in major areas only would be a mistake.  If we are to have a flourishing society, if we are to have a country that appreciates its culture and development, we must bring arts to the people.  We must bring arts in the broadest sense to our people and not merely adopt a dead approach to the subject.  Rather we must adopt a very positive one.  I might make mention of Joan Denise Moriarty whose Irish Ballet Company has made substantial achievements in a very difficult field of the arts, certainly not the most popular one.  However, there are many other areas.</P>
    <P>For instance, one thinks of films in which respect one hopes we might have <Col N="356" /> an Irish Film Board, that a Film Industry Bill might be enacted in this House providing funds for the making of films here, ensuring that we have a vibrant film industry.  In this context the work of Louis Marcus must be mentioned. He has attained international standing for his work in films.  There is tremendous potential in our society in all fields of the arts, from visual arts to film making, opera and dance.  Those people who can appreciate the arts have always enjoyed participating in them.  It is important that our children grow up to appreciate the arts and our culture.  In my opinion the present educational system does not allow for such appreciation. Above all I should like to emphasise the need to examine our educational system, to review it at second-level to being child-centred, concentrating on the developing child, allowing the growing man and woman to appreciate the arts. If we can achieve that then we shall have a flourishing culture and society in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this Estimate and the 40 per cent increased allocation to the arts I might point out the possible tendency for all parties to fall into some cosy consensus about the status of the arts in our society.  Frankly, I do not think that is the case.  I think there are major differences of emphasis between the parties in the way in which the arts are supported and developed in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to welcome the Taoiseach's presence in moving this Estimate.  It is significant in our society that the arts come under the responsibility of the Taoiseach and his Department.  It is significant also that the Taoiseach himself moved the Estimate.  However, I am somewhat disappointed that he did not avail of the opportunity more to demonstrate his party's reliance on the private sector in other areas <i>vis-á-vis</i> economic growth, or to take the same political opportunity perhaps to exhort the private sector to take on the role his party would envisage in the overall economy.  From my reading of his opening speech there is little exaltation by the Taoiseach of the role of the private sector in developing the arts.  Perhaps <Col N="357" /> this is at the base of many problems in our society today.  First of all there is no clear definition of the function of the arts in our society.  Consequently, we have no clear understanding of the role or indeed the identity of their patron in a modern society.  I believe that has led to a certain schizophrenia in regard to the State undertaking certain activities in supporting the arts and the private sector using the arts, crudely speaking, as a hedge against inflation in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>What we deserve in this House is a good debate on the arts, at some stage the production of a White Paper on the arts from the Taoiseach's Department and an elaboration of the role of the arts in our society over the next ten to 15 years.  In my view, and in the view of my party, without such definition the report on education in the arts will fall between a number of stools: for what is one educating people if there is no clear understanding of the role of the arts in our society?  It would be fair to say that our perception of the arts ranges from being able to present an acceptable face to illustrious foreign visitors to more directly being able to earn hard foreign currency by way of artistic activities.  Somewhere between those two extremes, surely, in the Ireland of 1979, there is a position that can be worked out stating that the arts constitute an integral part of our society.</P>
    <P>It is quite significant that both the Fine Gael spokesman and the Taoiseach have not paid enough attention to the role of the cultural worker.  They are one of the most vulnerable and exploited categories of workers in the EEC.  Full support must be given to the efforts of the Arts Council and to the status of other agencies attempting to define, improve and secure the conditions of cultural workers here.  By virtue of funding the Arts Council the State has taken upon itself, indirectly, the role of patron, through an autonomous body. We are congratulating ourselves on the amount of money we are spending, which I welcome, but could we not spend more money and get a positive social benefit in every sense of the word from the spending of it?</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Leas-Cheann  <Col N="358" /> Comhairle I will read an extract from the 1977 Annual Report of the Arts Council, because last year's has not yet been published.  Paragraph 2 of page 7 of the Report reads as follows:</P>
    <P>From a cursory comparison of the total grant for 1977 (£1.2 million) with the funds in 1976 (£990,000) it might appear that the 21 per cent increase in allocation should have been sufficient to tide arts organisations over short-term difficulties.  However, there are three main reasons why this apparently generous increase falls completely short of their actual requirements. In the first place, a proper level of funding has never been provided for arts activities, either at local or at national level.  A continual history of underfinancing has led to a precarious reliance by grant-aided bodies on bank borrowing, so much so that a significant proportion of the Council's funds must now be used to meet interest charges.  Secondly, inflation in the arts negated the value of most of the increased allocations granted during the year.  Finally, the number of organisations applying to the Council for support continues to grow, thereby increasing competition for already inadequate resources.  In these circumstances it is difficult even to contemplate the major developments that must be undertaken before arts activities can be financed in a manner commensurate with their needs.  The present expenditure of the Arts Council in Ireland works out at about 50p per head of population per year, while the <i>per capita</i> expenditure of our nearest neighbours is as follows: Northern Ireland&mdash;78p; England&mdash;89p; Scotland&mdash;£1.14; Wales&mdash;£1.41.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to denigrate the increase given we must put it in the proper context.  It is a 40 per cent increase on a very low base, and we are comparing ourselves with poor relations in the EEC which will probably become poorer when the public sector cuts begin to swing in Britain.  In 1977 terms, we spent the price of a pint per head of the population in promoting the arts.  It is hard to reconcile that tangible commitment to <Col N="359" /> the arts with the kind of verbal support that frequently emanates from all of us. When replying, will the Taoiseach give some indication of the likely development of the role of the arts in society as he and his Government envisage it? What kind of forward programming can be legitimately made by the Arts Council and what kind of forward planning can be made by people responsible for education in the arts?  Unless we can get that sort of framework we will just go from year to year.  Indeed the last two or three years in the arts have been crisis years in terms of finance.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will be the first to admit that his generous response of a Supplementary Estimate of £½ million was a reaction to the crisis management that the depression and inflation has forced upon those administering in the arts over the last three or four years.  While I was a member of Dublin Corporation I was party to some of the discussions with the Dublin Theatre festival and I was aware of the difficulties that that organisation encountered.  I welcome the increase, but it must be clearly set in its context.</P>
    <P>In order to establish the level of expenditure on the arts we must define its central importance in society.  We hold that the arts are an integral part of society for a number of reasons, not least of which is their commercial importance. It was estimated, for example, that between 1958 and 1974 the film industry alone brought sums in the region of £50 million into the country.  That was a considerable amount of money in those years.  If we integrate the role of the arts with the activities of Bord Fáilte in relation to tourism and development we will see that there is a commercial role for the arts that can be quantified. They are the minimal arguments that must come in a society which tends to put every value in tangible financial terms.  There are other values to be attached to the importance of the arts and they are central to our image of ourselves.  Anyone with a serious developed view of humanity must see that human beings are not mere economic beings and that their status and basic values demand that some form of artistic expression be encouraged.  The <Col N="360" /> more our society develops the more artistic expression is needed.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the Government are doing in relation to the arts.  The Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs is still in progress, and I spoke on it on behalf of our spokesman Deputy Liam Kavanagh who was successfully busy elsewhere.  I brought to the attention of the Minister who moved the Estimate the fact that while provision had been made in the Estimate for cultural activities, a major impediment to achieving cultural objectives was the fact that there was a queue of applicants wishing to sign cultural agreements with the Government, that had not been satisfied.  If we wish to present an image of Ireland's culture to our EEC neighbours and to other countries, we are being seriously hampered by the absence of formal cultural agreements which, in the world of diplomacy, are a prerequisite to exchanges of exhibitions and of various cultural forms of activity. I know that the Taoiseach is not directly responsible for these, but one cannot talk on the Estimate for the Arts Council without making reference to these cultural agreements.  I welcome an apparent increase in enthusiasm and activity for these agreements and for increasing the status of the administration responsible for this within the Government services.  However, a report that I am aware of causes me some concern.</P>
    <P>There seems to be an unnecessary emphasis on cultural agreements with our EEC partners to the exclusion of other applicants who wish to develop cultural agreements with us.  I respectfully suggest to the Taoiseach that an opportunity to develop cultural agreements with third countries&mdash;I mean countries outside the EEC&mdash;should not be turned down simply because we think we have not sufficient agreements with other EEC states.  By virtue of all our other activities we have considerable relations with the EEC countries, and it would be a mistake, therefore, to postpone applications for cultural agreements with other countries, and I particularly refer to the application of the Soviet Union for such an agreement.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Briscoe knows, in this House I have been critical of the denial <Col N="361" /> of human rights by the Soviet Union to some of its citizens.  However, in the context of the Helsinki pact, what is needed primarily is the strengthening and developing of communications with the signatories of that pact.  In so far as there are major ideological differences between us and the Soviet Union, a cultural agreement would go a long way towards helping us to understand each other's political systems, and this would be of considerable mutual benefit. Therefore, I strongly urge the Taoiseach not to postpone such a move until such time as he and the Government consider they have sufficient agreements with other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>We are about to assume the Presidency of the EEC.  We wish the Taoiseach every success on behalf of the Irish people.  With his interest in the arts, he should pursue the status of cultural workers in accordance with the draft EEC directive currently being discussed. A positive move in this matter would improve the role of the artist and the position of the artist, as distinct from the role of the arts, in Europe.  We have been tending to concentrate all our energies on the arts <i>per se</i>, and not on the creators of the arts, the performers, the writers and the painters.  During the term of our Presidency I should like the Taoiseach through the relevant Departments&mdash;Social Welfare would be one of them&mdash;to pursue that directive and to give it the sort of push that is needed.</P>
    <P>I understand we have only two cultural agreements of a substantial nature and there is an informal one with one of our EEC partners.  I can understand why in the past there was some reluctance to get these off the ground. The Labour Party welcome these increased activities and will give them every support.</P>
    <P>I will move now to the position of the arts at local level.  A unique provision in the 1973 Arts Act was that which enabled local authorities to spend money on the arts directly.  I had the pleasure to move on that loophole in Dublin Corporation with the active assistance of Deputy Briscoe and others.  I fear, however, that that provision which enabled us to raise a cultural budget in Dublin Corporation in 1975-76 of <Col N="362" /> £50,000, from which many organisations benefited, will be negated by the Local Government Act of this year unless the Taoiseach gives some indication to the Custom House that local authorities may include in their estimates each year a provision for the arts.</P>
    <P>In present conditions such a provision would be erased with a blue pencil by the Custom House.  Having taken upon himself the centralisation of local finance through the abolition of rates, the Taoiseach has removed a lot of the autonomy of local authorities in regard to the raising of money for the arts at local level.  There should be some counterbalancing in terms of finance so that local authorities can put money into the arts.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give some indication to the Minister for the Environment to provide guidelines for local authorities in this respect, what kind of percentage they should earmark for the arts, before the responsible officer in the Department of Finance begins to go berserk.</P>
    <P>If a move in this direction is not initiated, regional arts officers throughout the country will in future be unable to travel to Dublin every six weeks for meetings with the Arts Council, and the work of these important people will be frustrated totally.  If there is not some system of local funding for the arts, possibly equivalent to the Road Fund or to housing, we are not really being sincere in the way in which we want local authorities to get involved in financing the arts.</P>
    <P>This will create problems in a variety of ways for the Taoiseach and the Departments of the Environment and Finance, particularly because the Taoiseach apparently does not perceive any role for the private sector of the economy as a primary patron of the arts, the State apparently being the primary patron, even at local level, because he controls the degree of patronage which any local authority can exercise.  Therefore, subsequent to this year's local Government Act, it is necessary that some guideline should be given to the local authorities.  I can assure the Taoiseach that the increased Labour Party representation on local councils will be pressing for this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> Another question concerning the arts at local level is the provision of local venues.  I am glad to see the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the House, because his home county and Wexford town have provided an effective venue for the arts in the Wexford Arts Centre. That county has preserved a piece of the architectural fabric of that town, the old Corn Exchange, and the people there, after some pressure, resisted the temptation to paint one of the gable walls, ach sin scéal eile.  The preservation of such venues should be integrated with the policy of urban conservation, of obtaining new uses for old buildings, particularly of the scale and nature which cannot be used any more for the primary industrial activity for which they were originally designed and cannot be utilised for more obvious pressing social problems such as housing.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that in every town and city there are hundreds of such buildings, old mills and factories which are lying derelict or under-utilised.  By linking funds from the EEC Social Fund with our youth employment programme and the AnCO schemes in terms of developing projects for young people we could provide venues for the arts of varying standards of accommodation. Over a period of ten years we could carry out a programme which would result in us having local arts centres accessible to the vast bulk of our population and run and controlled by local voluntary committees, similar to the model that the people in Wexford have moved forward.  We need a programme for this; we need some initiative from the Government, through the Department of the Environment and the EEC Regional Fund and Social Fund.  With a 400 per cent increase in our representation in the Socialist Group we will have a slightly louder voice in that regard that we had before.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the role of the artist in our society.  We are very quick to laud artists when they are successful and even quicker to laud them when they are dead&mdash;I do not mean that in any disrespectful way&mdash;but we are not so quick to help the struggling artist. In fact, we know very little about the <Col N="364" /> struggling artist, whether it is the person who is anxious to act, paint or draw. One of the good things the Arts Council initiated was their commission of a report on the position and status of the artist, or cultural worker, to give him the EEC consensus title.  I gather that that report will reveal, among other things, that the average <i>per capita</i> income of the artist per annum in current terms derived from his or her activities in the arts is £1,500 and that most artists have to supplement their earnings by way of teaching or having their spouses or children fund their activities to bring them up to the average industrial wage of about £4,000.  That is simply in terms of the money that is taken by the artist but in real terms the number of hours put in by an artist must be enormous relative to what we regard as an average working week of 40 or 42 hours.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Taoiseach, and other Members, should talk to an artist who is anxious to be a full-time worker in the visual arts, for example.  I have been asked by such people how can they sign on at the local labour exchange. What category does a painter or sculptor enter into if he does not have work or money?  In effect, such people are outside our social system.  Either we take the arts seriously or we do not.  I believe that the Taoiseach takes the arts seriously and the granting of an extra £500,000 this year is a fair indication of his personal commitment.  However, at the other end of the scale artists are in a limbo land with regard to their integration into the social welfare code.  I hope that the Minister for Health and Social Welfare who obtained for himself the unique distinction of getting a tax exemption for artists' earnings where it mattered, at the top of the scale, will display the same type of creative concern for the vast majority of artists who happen to be at the other end of the scale.  I had hoped for that kind of initiative when I moved here, on behalf of the Joint Committee, a report dealing with such matters. I wish to repeat that request to the Taoiseach so that, hopefully, by next year's budget, the social welfare code will be broadened and extended to include artists.  I accept that that is not an easy stroke-of-the-pen type of decision <Col N="365" /> and that it will involve administrative difficulties.  I am aware that it cannot be done readily and that it will provoke all types of difficult queries from one Department to another.</P>

      <P>There are a fair few in this House but they are not looking for supplementary benefit.  However, something can be done immediately in relation to VAT and artists.  Many artists, particularly in the visual and writing fields, who thought they were exempt from taxation under Deputy Haughey's provision now find that they are being presented with bills for considerable sums under VAT.  It is hard to reconcile our political commitment to the arts within the context of our society when on the one hand we are making a 40 per cent increase in the capital provision for the arts and yet VAT is being clawed back on the other side.  That is the type of nonsensical circular transfer that increases the demand for public service employment on the one hand and which undermines the position of the artist on the other.  The nature of the work is that somebody can work for three years for an exhibition or write a book and then be subject to VAT which cannot be defrayed.  I am aware that discussions have taken place between the Revenue Commissioners and those responsible for administering the arts but, on behalf of the Labour Party and the cultural workers, I should like to ask the Taoiseach to ensure that there is a satisfactory outcome to those discussions so that his overall intent in promoting the funding of the arts can be given full effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the film industry.  In the context of that industry I should like to compliment the Arts Council on their decision last year to fund the Irish Film Theatre.  It is now a commercial venture and has repaid the loan to the Arts Council and I understand that it is currently in the process of opening a theatre in Cork.  The success of the Irish Film Theatre has demonstrated the commercial audience that exists here for the cinema.  In that context, we should recognise that, given the <Col N="366" /> audiences and given the commitment that many people have to the film industry generally as an art form, given the enormous expertise and skills that we have as a resource in RTE, we have been extremely negligent&mdash;and I mean all of us, when I say we&mdash;in not developing properly our film industry.</P>
    <P>There was a recent protest at the gates of these Houses by the cultural workers within the film industry.  This is an area from which we could derive much immediate commercial benefit&mdash;if we have to argue funding on those terms&mdash;the overspill effect of which would be to increase the level of artistic activity generally in our society, which would trickle out into the outer areas of the artistic world of our community, where the commercialism is much more reduced.  I am reminded of the argument made to me by a number of actors in the context of the campaign waged to save the Olympia Theatre.  They talked about the original decision of Yeats to come back at the last part of the last century and establish a theatre here, in the absence of anything other than music hall.  The forceful argument put forward by mature and, indeed, esteemed actors in our community was that, without theatres, there will be no actors to play in them; the actors will be forced to go away.  If you do not have a corpus of actors and theatres in which they can play, you will not have writers writing for them, set designers designing for them and all the other ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>What the Abbey Theatre was in the 19th century to the development of Irish drama and literature&mdash;on which we have all comfortably dined out since 1922 and independence, between Yeats summer schools, cultural tourism and promotion of the Irish image abroad and so on&mdash;applies to the national film industry, which is, in 20th-century terms, the equivalent to creating a physical stage and a physical theatre house.  If the industry is given the impetus that I sincerely believe does exist on this and the other side of the House, first of all, it will enable us to attract into this country film makers who will increase substantially the revenue brought in&mdash;£50 million in 1958 to 1974.  The activities of the national film studios will be <Col N="367" /> strengthened and increased on that level and we will get the expertise we require and have not already.</P>
    <P>There are models of the State itself becoming a patron of the film industry. The most obvious example is the Australian Federal Government and, indeed, what is not so well known some of the provincial Governments in Australia, or whatever their exact title is.  I quote from an editorial in <i>The Irish Press</i> of Friday, 25 May, on the film makers' protest:</P>
    <P>A shining example of what could be achieved by the kind of legislation believed to be on the way is provided by the Australian experience.  Irish audiences have seen a number of excellent Australian films here in recent years, &ldquo;Picnic At Hanging Rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Devil's Playground&rdquo; among them.  But what most people here do not realise is that the Australians have built their industry from nothing over the last ten to 15 years.</P>
    <P>They began by setting up the Australian Film Commission which provided enough &ldquo;front money&rdquo; for independent producers to get their projects off the ground, enabling them to borrow the rest of their budgets from banks and businesses.  Under this arrangement the A.F.C. is the last lender to be repaid when the box-office returns begin to come in.</P>
    <P>The editorial, which is familiar to some people in this House, goes on to talk about the utilisation of the basic resources of television producers and set designers in graphic arts.  We have that capacity here and there is no reason why it should not be fully utilised.</P>
    <P>We understand that the film industry is on the way, but I hope it will get from the Taoiseach the commitment needed. Finally, as my time must be nearly up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it does come under the provision for the arts.  I come back to the role of the artist and of the patron in the arts in our society.  One of the tragedies about this society, in an area in which I am personally and particularly interested&mdash;that of the visual arts&mdash;is that we have a fine National Gallery.  It is well funded, though obviously not as well as it would like.  It is well funded, not by any decision of these Houses but by the fortunate provision in a will of an Anglo-Irish individual, which has enabled the gallery to purchase many fine works and to develop a very fine collection, relative to its size.</P>
      <P>The Municipal Gallery&mdash;or the Hugh Lane Memorial Gallery as it now is&mdash;is badly in need of extension and is no longer, in effect, a modern art gallery, or a gallery of modern art, largely being centred on impressionist and expressionist works of the early 19th century. The biggest tragedy, perhaps, is that the finest collection of modern Irish art in this country&mdash;and it is a collection&mdash;is locked away from the public eye in one of the most expensively built edifices of this city&mdash;the headquarters of the Bank of Ireland.  This is a unique collection; it has been very well funded, as well it might from such a successful commercial organisation.  In a nutshell, it demonstrates the contradiction existing in our society between provision for the arts, the role of the patron, the status of the artist and access of the rest of the public to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the artists whose work now hangs in the building have been, or may now be, on the breadline.  They do not qualify for social welfare registration of any kind.  They would probably require permission to go in and see their own work, if they wanted to do so.  The bank, which is an enormously successful corporation, is effectively privately owned and has seen fit, in its own wisdom&mdash;and it was a good decision&mdash;to invest in the arts.  In fact, I would suggest that its investment has more than been recouped; the value of this collection now is probably well in <Col N="369" /> excess of what was expended upon it.  It is like South African rands, or gold, or jewellery, or diamonds, and is perceived as such by some of the bankers.  There is nothing necessarily wrong with that if you can release money from bankers for funding, although I do not agree with it. However, here, in a nutshell, not a stone's throw from this building, is the contradiction of the provision for the arts, particularly the visual arts.  There are two large pieces of sculpture outside the bank; there are probably 200 or 300 works of art in that bank, inaccessible to the public.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is the leader of a successful political party that has espoused private enterprise and its role in our society&mdash;not that I would disagree with that.  It is interesting that he has not seen fit, in moving this Estimate, to envisage any role whatever for that same sector which has been given such prominence in developing our economic structure, in the question of the provision for the arts. It is quite significant that this contradiction exists in the visual arts, as embodied in the Bank of Ireland Report.  I should like to see some logical consistency coming from the Fianna Fáil Party, if they are not in a position to make serious funds available for the arts, by way of finding the role of the State as primary patron&mdash;while I welcome the 40 per cent increase that has come.  The extract I read from last year's Arts Council Report demonstrates just how underfunded we are.  If that is not the case, then some direction, or activity, or financial incentive should be provided for the private sector and, uniquely, should be provided, so that all the private works of art that exist in the private collections are made available.  I am not talking about modern work; I am not talking about the wealth tax provisions&mdash;they are all gone now anyway&mdash;but those provisions that set up Russborough House and the rest.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we tend to be very superficial about the arts in this society and to be complimentary only about the successful arts.  There is no element of trust or encouragement in struggling artists; there is a lot of piggy back climbing on people who happen to be successful&mdash;in many cases successful despite <Col N="370" /> our lack of interest.  We must start seriously defining the role of the artist in our society and the role of the State as patron.  As far as the Labour Party is concerned, the State, in effect, has now become the patron&mdash;the public community has become the patron, and yet the funds are not available.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention to perhaps the most serious implication, namely, the implicit restriction on spending on the arts at local level and if I wanted to emphasise anything I said today I should like to emphasise that aspect.  I believe we will run into a considerable amount of difficulty there.</P>
    <P>The status of the artist as a cultural worker is in limbo.  The council will publish a report in a matter of months and there is a draft directive in circulation. Some work should be done on that. Many things are about to happen in the area of the arts.  Deputy Collins referred to the position of art education.  I have not referred to it because I think it is a specialist matter and my colleague, Deputy Horgan, is better qualified than I to discuss it.  One cannot be isolated from the other.  They all fit into the framework of the arts.  I hope that at some stage the Government will publish a White Paper now that the Arts Council have provided the basis for it.</P>
    <P>The Gulbenkian Report on the provision of the arts was a unique document in its time.  Another document entitled &ldquo;Art in Education&rdquo; contains many assumptions and recommendations, some of which I might not agree with but we are beginning to get the foundation of the picture of the arts in our society.  We should now make decisions about this matter.  That is the responsibility of the Government.  If the Government say, as I would expect them to say, that it is the role of the private sector primarily to be the patron, there should be some specific encouragement by way of tax relief, tax incentives and legislation enabling the provision of buildings and so on.  We should start moving towards decisions, and perhaps the best way to do that would be a White Paper on the arts, a discussion in this House and then the necessary legislative changes in the many Government Departments that may be affected directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right to begin by saying that I am sure everyone here admires the courtesy of the Taoiseach, who is the busiest man in the country, or should be, for staying here for so much of this debate.  Nobody would have faulted him if he had asked one of his junior Ministers to take his place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three or four points that I want to make which arise on this Estimate.  The first relates to the structure within which the Arts Council exists. It is about 12 years since the Devlin Committee was set up to make recommendations about reorganisation of the public service.  They recommended that a group of services which are, broadly speaking, of cultural importance should be brought together and placed under a single administrative organ or combined into a single administrative department. One of these was the National Gallery, another was the National Museum and another was the National Library.  The Arts Council was also part of the scheme and, although I do not believe it was appropriate, I think Roinn na Gaeltachta was also included.  It was a pity that scheme was shelved.  It is a great pity that the only changes that have been visible under this Government and the former Government have been those relating to the Department of the Public Services in the case of the Government I worked for, and which was recommended by Devlin, and in the case of this Government there were a few largely cosmetic changes, not one of which was recommended by Devlin. One would comb the pages of Devlin in vain for a recommendation that the Department of Local Government be retitled or that there should be a Minister for Economic Planning and Development separate from Finance.  It is a pity, when we go to the trouble of getting a distinguished public servant to spend some years making recommendations about the public service, that they should be almost universally ignored. Not only were they ignored but things were done, almost contemptuously, that were never envisaged or suggested by Devlin.  The suggestion for uniting this variety of services under a single administrative organ seems to have disappeared,  <Col N="372" /> and nobody seems to be pushing it.</P>
    <P>I must admit that one of the suggestions made by Devlin in this connection was that the new Department which he envisaged will be called the Department of National Culture.  I find that an offensive title, by reason of the association of that expression in foreign countries with dictatorships, and in Ireland with unlimited humbug as we talk about our national cultural heritage.  I should prefer not to use that phrase, and certainly would not like to see it enshrined in the name of a government department, but that would not be a reason for not uniting the services under a single political head, and I think the correct political head is the Taoiseach himself.  When John Costello was Taoiseach the Arts Council was his idea and the original Arts Act was sponsored by him in this House.  In the end it is to the Taoiseach's Department that many other cultural odds and ends eventually find their way. It would not be inappropriate to have this collection of services united, without giving them a title that would be offensive or silly, like the Department of National Culture, under the umbrella of the Taoiseach's Department which already has a number of them.</P>
    <P>I would add to the Devlin list the archaeological services which are now provided at public expense by at least three separate authorities.  Perhaps local authorities have archaeological services. I presume Dublin Corporation must have such services.  I hope they have some permanent archaeological advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the local authorities there are at least three others. There is the Department of Education via the National Museum; the Office of Public Works; and I understand Bord Fáilte also employ a small number of archaeologists.  That is a branch of science that is of obvious cultural importance  <Col N="373" /> and which should be united with the services I have mentioned under the same administrative umbrella.</P>
      <P>In this connection I must emphasise a point which I thought Deputy Quinn would make.  He seemed to approach it, and then sheered away from it.  Perhaps he would have made it better than I can. I must emphasise that you cannot parcel up a certain number of activities and interests and label them &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and separate them from a large number of other activities.  That is not possible, or at least it is only possible to an uncivilised mind.  There is not a visible frontier separating the arts from architecture, from archaeology or from learning, or at least if there is it is not one that anyone has defined or defended satisfactorily.  While the functions of the Arts Council must, in practice, be limited by the amount of money at their disposal, any conception of their functions which limits the council to arts in the narrowest sense, as traditionally understood, is a wrong conception.  I remember seeing the Taoiseach here about three months ago, for the undisclosed reason that the Minister who was due to answer the next lot of questions had not yet arrived, spending quite a lot of time debating with a questioner the matter of whether circuses ought to come under the umbrella of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  I am not sure that there are not stronger candidates for inclusion in the Arts Council's purview than circuses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I mention it only to make the point that I do not consider it a contemptible point of view that circuses should be included among the arts. There are candidates I would include which are now excluded, like town planning, which in most of their appearances have not got any strong relevances but nonetheless have a clear importance in the area of human existence we are talking about.  Any attempt to draw a firm boundary here will be a failure.</P>
      <P>If we ever get a unified administration of these services, library, gallery, museum, archaeological services, and so forth, under the same administrative group, it ought to include the film industry as well.  It is an absurd accident that the question of the appearance of the Film Industry Bill, if it ever does appear, should be debated by the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy and myself merely because it has an industrial dimension.  Of course it has an industrial dimension, like any art or craft, but its principal dimension is aesthetic.  I would consider that a very strong candidate for inclusion in the same administrative structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously misapprehensions about what the film industry is all about are held in very high places.  When the matter last surfaced here, until it surfaced again the day before yesterday, there was an editorial in <i>The Irish Press</i> which made a very strong plea for the Government to push ahead with a bit of action <Col N="375" /> in the field of the film industry.  It ended by saying the main importance of this was to inform the world a bit better about us.  If the only purpose of a Film Industry Bill and of setting up this entire structure is to make it a kind of celluloid Government Information Service, I would not propose to spend 6p on it.  It is not worth having a film industry if all it will do is inform the world about our staggering achievements in job creation, or in preserving the scenery, or in any of the other things in which we have a lot to apologise for.  It is not worth doing that.</P>
    <P>It is worth doing it if it will open up a possibility for self-expression and self-realisation to a generation of film makers &mdash;I am not altogether convinced it will, but if it will&mdash;and writers and all the other artists which the existence of a film industry is bound to encourage.  That must be the main reason for pushing ahead with this.  I do not overlook its employment potential, but that must be subsidiary.  If we are to have a film industry merely to create jobs, we could spend the money more advantageously and get better and quicker and more lasting results somewhere else.  It is essentially an aesthetic enterprise&mdash;I do not need to give a lecture about it&mdash;it should be looked at as that and not misunderstood. If we ever get one, it should be under the same unified administrative umbrella.</P>
    <P>This extended arts responsibility of the Taoiseach's Department should cover the question of the conservation of old town cores, old streetscapes and old buildings. Merely because the English have not got an administrative arrangement like that is not a good reason why we should not have one.  In France before you alter a classified building you have to get the permission of the Department of Beaux Arts.  In Italy it is the corresponding Belle Arti which accords or refuses permission.  They do not see anything funny, or odd, or eccentric in relating the question of a house facade which may be 100, 200 or 300 years old, or in referring the question of its aesthetic value or its right to survive, to <Col N="376" /> a department the main function of which lies in the field of arts.</P>
    <P>As I said a moment ago, we have so much to apologise for.  We have committed so many atrocities in the field of urban conservation, or in our failure to conserve.  We have committed so many massacres of things which were handed down to us by the generation which saw independence here in 1922.  Much that was worth seeing and preserving and keeping up and still living in, and which was here in our parents' time has now been swept away, and not swept away in order to give place to magnificent new towns, but swept away very often in order to make room for what still seem to be only car parks or derelict sites growing nettles.</P>
    <P>Our record in this respect is so abominable that we need not apologise for suggesting that there should be set up a Department with specific responsibility for maintaining what there remains to be maintained in public architecture.  The existing authorities in that regard have only a half responsibility, because a planning authority such as a county council or even the appeals authority must have regard to very many different factors such as traffic congestion, the lack of provision of public services in the place in which the application is made and the likely impact on the population in terms of a further 1,000 office workers coming into the street every day.  In addition, the authority must have regard to the aesthetic considerations&mdash;they must decide, for example, whether an old street should disappear&mdash;but we should have an authority concentrated absolutely on this area, one which has no other function but to ensure that not another brick is removed from a brick in a building in this State which, on the basis of aesthetic considerations, should not be removed.</P>
    <P>It would make one sick to hear the guff from Ministers and sometimes indeed from Opposition Deputies about our priceless cultural heritage.  What is left of our priceless cultural heritage? One need only walk around this city to have that question answered.  Consider what is happening to Lower Mount Street, to Holles Street or to Ely Place. One need only walk 100 yards from here <Col N="377" /> to find a row of six 18th-century houses at the corner of Ely Place which have been derelict since I was a student 25 years ago.  In the doorway of one of those houses the city council have been allowed to place a large type of container which perhaps controls traffic lights.  This is a large functional object which is inconsistent with the continued use of the door as a door.  It is an eyesore, but the people have become used to looking at something like that in the same way as one becomes accustomed to not having a lampshade, or to having a crack in a wall, in some part of one's house.  Yet we talk about our priceless cultural heritage.  People who live in such conditions should not talk about such matters until they succeed in providing some structure for defending our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>The function which An Chomhairle Ealaíon have under the 1951 Act of advising any member of the Government who may request advice on any matter is not utilised sufficiently.  A couple of months ago I referred here to the question of coinage.  I do not wish to resurrect at this point the scandal of the coinage, though there is still a lot of mileage to be had from that.  Perhaps I said too much on that other occasion, but I wish to make it clear that my criticism was not intended in any way as a reflection on the work of the artist who designed the coinage.  The point I wished to make was that the matter was one which cried out for the advice of the Arts Council.  I am confident that had the Arts Council been asked for advice in 1970, rather than to have the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, taking it on himself in his familiar Olympian way to know what is best for us not only in regard to how to make money but to how the coinage should look, they would have recommended that we initiate a procedure such as the procedure adopted in 1926 when the first coinage of the State was being planned.  The omission on the last occasion was scandalous.</P>
    <P>I am not pretending to be a competent critic in this area, but in the strict numismatic sense&mdash;and that is the sense in which I intended my remarks last time to be taken&mdash;the coinage was barbarised.   <Col N="378" /> Even from the 2/- piece and the 1/- which survived from the old coinage, some of the detail was scrapped.  The beading inside the edge of the coins was incontinently done away with.  On the old 1/- there was a bar on which the bull stood but on the new coin this line was shortened so that it would no longer connect with the edges of the coin.  These details were all integral parts of a design, and civilised people will not regard an artistic design as anything but an integral whole.  They will know that it cannot be successful to omit beading, for example, or to change the lettering and still have the same design.  Then there is the gross discordance in style between the modest but extremely well-designed animals of the old series, and the obscure hieratic symbols of the new bronze coinage.  The result is that we have a mess in terms of our coinage, whereas what we had before was regarded as the most beautiful coinage in Europe.  This mess could have been avoided if the Arts Council had been invoked by the Minister, and he would have invoked their advice if he had had a scrap of modesty or an iota of knowledge of these matters.</P>
    <P>From time to time the Arts Council are asked for advice, but one need only look around to realise that their advice is not sought often enough.  Occasionally, I understand, the Office of Public Works seek the advice of the Arts Council, but that office are one of the principal offenders in the general area we are talking of.  They should be seeking advice continually from the Arts Council.  While the Office of Public Works have done much extremely good and attractive work of all kinds, I must fault them in other regards.  They have an insensitive eye in many respects, particularly in regard to detail, and they allow some things to happen which would not happen in a country in which a civilised eye was more the rule, or in which people at least had enough humility to seek advice from someone who had a civilised eye. Outside this building, on Leinster Lawn, there are two lamps that have been there since the days when the building was the headquarters of the RDS in the last century. One of these lamps is near the gate and the other is in a corresponding position  <Col N="379" /> near the National Gallery wall.  Up to five years ago both of these lamps were in the condition in which cast iron lamps often are&mdash;the tops had fallen off them but in both instances the top was replaced by a tiny object which was poised 12 feet from the ground though it was hardly the size of a tumbler.  It was a tatty little glass object.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely giving an example of something that happened only a few feet away from us.  I asked the late Deputy Kenny if he would be prepared to look at this object, and having seen it he agreed that it was a most ignorant-looking production, and he ensured that the Office of Public Works replaced the glass object with an old lamp of appropriate size and shape.</P>

      <P>Another example of what I have in mind concerns the State Apartments at Dublin Castle which in terms of colours are barbarous.  The colouring is gaudy and garish.  The carpets are of a very fine design but they would seem to have been designed without having regard to the room in which they were to be laid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only giving homely examples of how we let ourselves down by showing that we lack an eye that is sensitive to aesthetic considerations.  We should require all office holders to take the advice of people whose business it is to concentrate on the aesthetic in life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to part from the Office of Public Works in good humour.  I have no wish to offend them, and I recognise that on the whole they are doing a good job, but on matters that have important aesthetic dimensions they should seek the advice of those who are qualified to give such advice.  Deputy Quinn has dealt adequately with the local <Col N="381" /> authorities matter.  I suggest that there be a form of provision whereby the State would undertake to indemnify for museum or gallery interests who may be hesitant about undertaking the loan of a collection for display here because of the consideration of the cost of insuring it. We are aware of the formidable problems which arose for the Government I worked for in the case of the collection of Irish treasures which has been in America for some time.  I do not know how one could compute the cost.  Obviously such collections are not replaceable.</P>
    <P>Obviously, when one is dealing with material which is unique, the ordinary considerations of insurance scarcely seem relevant.  Nevertheless, they are relevant in the sense that one has to put some kind of value on those things, one has to provide oneself with some kind of figure which will ease one's sense of loss, at least buy something else instead in the event that something unique is lost or destroyed.  I know that foreign galleries and museums who, happily, now are thinking in terms of sending collections around the world, may be deterred in our case by the cost of the necessary insurance premium.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Quinn mention the cultural agreement with the Soviet Union.  I would be a bit lukewarm about such a thing unless I could be assured that although what we might send would be purely cultural, that what we got back would also be purely cultural and that there was not any other element in it.  If I could be sure about that I would heartily support Deputy Quinn's point of view.</P>
    <P>I have evidence to suggest that his idea could have spectacular results. When I was in Paris about three years ago I saw an exhibition of prehistoric gold objects which came from Russia, which had been excavated in southern Russia in a period starting in the 18th century up to quite recently.  This was a collection of gold objects, all ornamental, which would literally take the sight out of one's eyes.  I had no conception that such a thing existed in the world.  It was a most fabulous collection of mirrors, brooches, weapons and decorations of all kinds.  I could not describe the magnificence of that collection which <Col N="382" /> western Europe scarcely knows about. That came from the Soviet Union and, as far as I could see, there were no strings attached to it.  If there were, the French managed to keep them out of sight.  If it were possible to get, <i>via</i> a cultural agreement with the Soviet Union, that collection, or even a fraction of it, it would be well worth having.  If the way towards that could be smoothed by the State undertaking a formal system of indemnity, which would involve the State in very substantial risks, it should be considered, and possibly even built, in order to give it legal force, into an amended Arts Act.  I want to repeat the appreciation, which I am sure the House feels, of the Taoiseach for having spent so long here this morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the increase in the amount of money made available over the last two years, which has been increased by 75 per cent.  I mention this because I did not hear it mentioned by any of the other speakers.  I would also like to express my satisfaction at the appointment of Dr. James White as the new chairman of the Arts Council.  It is a recognition that is due to him.  I am satisfied that a lot of the money which will be forthcoming will be largely due to his considerable influence and the confidence which the Taoiseach and Members of the House have in him. Nobody can say that he is a person who has been rewarded for political activities on behalf of any political party.  He has earned that post and I wish him many successful years in enlarging the activities of the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>My experience in Dublin Corporation in relation to the Arts Council has been one of co-operation with them.  Deputy Quinn can confirm this.  I suggested to the new chairman that he recommend to his directors that we meet at least twice a year to discuss common problems and how we can help each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was through Dublin Corporation&mdash;Deputy Quinn must take a lot of credit for this&mdash;that the Olympia Theatre was saved.  I was chairman of the cultural committee at that time and we worked very hard to see what way we could raise money to save the theatre.  We got in touch with the Arts <Col N="383" /> Council but they were very restricted in what they could do.  I would like to see the Arts Council being able to come to the immediate rescue if such a situation arises again.  There was a two-year lease to run on the Olympia Theatre at that time with no guarantee that the owners, who were in England, would renew the lease.  We were being asked to put down £100,000 of the ratepayers' money and gamble that they would renew the lease. We were advised by legal counsel that we could only do it as an act of trust, that if it was a business deal we were going into they would advise against it.  We took a chance with the ratepayers' money and were lucky that the gamble came off.  If it had not we would have had to face the consequences of our very brave action, which would have been called reckless.</P>
    <P>We had to make sure that we got certain guarantees.  It was a loan given to the theatre which possibly they will not be able to repay.  I would like to see the Arts Council being able to consider seriously acquiring the Gaiety Theatre. That theatre should not be put at risk. We have very few theatres in Dublin and, as Deputy Quinn quite rightly said, if all our theatre close down our writers close down, our actors emigrate and we lose them.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Quinn's anxiety to see artists who are not making a living qualifying for social welfare, when is an artist not an artist?  I do not envisage the chairman and the board of directors of the Arts Council sitting around the table adjudicating on who in their opinion is an artist and would qualify for social welfare and who would not.  Unfortunately, this is not on, although it is a nice idea.  Most people feel that an artist who is good has to suffer and if he suffers long enough he must be good.  There are many people who are artists only in their own eyes.  One of the measures I would take to try to do something about artists who are not making a living would be to get the Arts Council, perhaps for a year, to ensure that exhibitions would include works of lesser-known artists.  At all the exhibitions we go to, we see works of well-known artists.  If the exhibitions do not <Col N="384" /> have works of well-known artists people will not attend them.  I would like to see the Arts Council working more energetically towards getting people who do not consider their works worthy of hanging included in exhibitions which they are funding.</P>
    <P>With regard to the film industry, I have felt for a long time that the future of the film industry in Ireland is not in Ardmore.  Ardmore has been a bit of a white elephant.  We do not create the employment at Ardmore which we would if we had our own film industry.  I am thinking particularly here of some of the fine film makers like Bob Quinn who made &ldquo;Cloche&rdquo;, a wonderful film on sculpturing.  There was a debt of £1,000 hanging over that film.  The Arts Council have already made a considerable contribution towards it.  For my part I got the corporation to agree to show that film in libraries at least to young school children to help wipe out some of the debt.  But, if you like, we were taking up the slack of the Arts Council which we very much resented.  Local authorities will resent the Arts Council passing on bills to them which they feel the Arts Council should be paying.  But local authorities would be very glad to co-operate with the Arts Council in putting on exhibitions or other events that might not take place otherwise.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned also if the Government restricted the amount of money to local authorities and if we could not spend money on the arts in the manner in which we have been doing.  I do not accept that that will happen.  I would ask the Minister to ensure that there is no intention&mdash;I am sure there is not&mdash;of removing money from our budgets, which should be increased every year on the basis of increased allocations. We have made our money go far.  I know the major obligation on the Arts Council is to create new outlets for the arts and to encourage artists.  Going concerns do not necessarily qualify. Nevertheless recognition must be given in some small way to those artistic organisations and groups providing a service to our people in the sense of presenting the arts to them.</P>
    <P>I believe the Arts Council will make a very strong plea for our own film industry  <Col N="385" /> and that people like Bob Quinn and Louis Marcus will be sufficiently funded to enable them show films they make.  We could create far more employment in this country by a roving type of film industry rather than one set in a studio.  What happens in a studio setting is that all the technicians come from abroad; very few Irish technicians are engaged.  The real experts come in from abroad using the fantastic facility existing here.  But this does not afford us a real opportunity or outlet for our film industry. For example, people tend to think of a film industry as one constituted by the people who made, say, the successful &ldquo;French Connection&rdquo; or some other of those highly successful drama films.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the &ldquo;French Connection&rdquo; of the Deputy's party was all that successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose not; but not to worry, that is a decision that has been made.  We did not have the luck you people had.</P>
      <P>The short film, the artistic film is something for which there is a tremendous outlet.  For example, the films of Louis Marcus are famous.  Very recently I was in Lisbon at a cinema symposium when I heard people from many European countries discussing the problem of their State contributions.  We do not owe anyone a living but certainly we must endeavour to put whatever money is available where we feel it can do most good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to cultural arrangements with other countries, third countries, unfortunately we did have a bad experience with the Russians.  I was blamed for a Russian exhibition that never took place. I had not opened my mouth for or against that exhibition.  Even when it came to a vote, at which the chairman of the cultural committee was the person who voted first, I asked the secretary to record my vote last as I did not want to influence anybody.  Yet I was blamed for that.  At that stage they were insisting on an exhibition of pictures, through the Russian Embassy, when their representative would give no information at all to the curator of the gallery as to what <Col N="386" /> featured in the pictures, what type of pictures were coming and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we need the cultural agreement because of the chaos which resulted from that unfortunate incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because, as I recall, it was not even coming through the embassy. Although they were making representations, they were not doing it. They were even asking for us to pay for the exhibition ourselves, to make a contribution towards it, when all other countries with which we have cultural arrangements, such as Austria, pay entirely for any exhibitions that come here. We mount the exhibition and they pay. Anyway I have no objection to any cultural arrangement with any country and certainly not on ideological grounds provided there is freedom of culture within those countries; it is important that culture is not being crushed.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to note such a huge increase in the amount of the Estimate.  I am delighted at Dr. White's appointment. I know he will be entirely successful. I hope we will be able to take a long, hard look at the position and that recommendations will be put to the Government shortly in relation to theatres in any part of Ireland, good theatres that get into difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Estimate, just as I recall welcoming the 1973 Arts Bill in the Seanad.  While we probably should have taken a greater interest at an earlier date, obviously it is better late than never.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to stimulate interest in the arts, very difficult to get people to show their appreciation of them.  In this respect our fault lay mainly in the fact that over the years we did not endeavour to get our young people in school to cultivate this appreciation.  I welcome any subvention from Government funds to promote the examination of this question. We might ask ourselves: do our present difficulties in this country in which people seem to have got their sense of values all mixed up emanate from a false appreciation of the values <Col N="387" /> before us?  Has materialism taken over? Have people too much leisure time, too much money and have they not been, educated on how to spend that time and money, with resultant chaos on several fronts?  It is about time we took a look at ourselves and asked ourselves those questions.  For example, are our present outlets for spending this leisure time far too restricted?  How can we redress the imbalance obtaining?  Rather than being able to appreciate the fine things in life the only things to which we seem to be able to turn are the pubs and television which, of course, in some ways&mdash;television in particular&mdash;can have artistic merit.  But primarily it is an unimaginative way of spending leisure time and is leading to a decadent society.</P>
    <P>Therefore it behoves us all to encourage a greater appreciation of the arts.  It is difficult to know how to stimulate that interest or appreciation. Obviously we must begin with our young people in the schools.  Deputy Kelly referred to a very relevant point: that in such a position we must bring the arts to the people.  We had a very good example of that when we sent some of our art treasures to America.  That is a practice that should be encouraged.  Not alone should we send more of our art treasures abroad but we should encourage other nations, in Europe, the United States and elsewhere, to let us have an opportunity of looking at their treasures.  Such a practice would evoke great stimulation and appreciation here. I would ask the Taoiseach to bear that aspect in mind.</P>
    <P>I recall also that in the debate in the Seanad in 1973 it was advocated that we should send our existing art treasures in this capital city, where they are principally, around to provincial centres. That idea has been promoted to a certain degree and I should like to see it done on a larger scale.  It is obvious that one does not get the bulk of people from the country to come to Dublin merely to look at art forms or treasures but probably they would if they were put on display in local museums or civic centres.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;arts&rdquo; may have a broad outline but it is difficult to define it exactly.   <Col N="388" /> Far too often it is the prerogative of intellectuals.  We should endeavour to broaden the definition of what art forms mean.  It is far too narrow as it stands. Snobs and people with position and money are hogging the arts at the moment and the lower-income groups are not welcomed.  It is a social thing rather than a true artistic appreciation.</P>
    <P>One of the organisations which is most praiseworthy is the Irish Theatre group.  I was delighted to notice in the Taoiseach's Estimate speech that they are getting a subvention from the Arts Council in Northern Ireland.  That is a glowing example of cross-Border co-operation. I am glad to note that both our Arts Council and the Northern Ireland Arts Council have come together to preserve the ancestral home of Sir Tyrone Guthrie in County Monaghan and that they have set up a joint committee to manage that house.  The Irish Theatre Company have done great work in provincial centres which previously only had amateur productions.  These centres now have professional groups and they can see the top performers in the country.  They have evoked great interest, and the members of the company are delighted with the response they got in the last couple of years.  This group should be financed and promoted by the Government and the Arts Council to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Haughey, the present Minister for Health, brought in tax-free concessions for artists some years ago it was widely welcomed.  That was a stroke of genius, and the Minister must be given credit for it because it aided people who were in need.  As Deputy Briscoe said, we seem to have lived with long suffering artists all our lives.  We have seen more films from Hollywood and elsewhere depicting artists living on or below the bread line and we have great sympathy for those people.  However we can go from one extreme to the other.  I resent millionaires being allowed complete tax free concessions, and I feel that there should be some limit.  The tax system must be seen to be equitable.  I fully agree that struggling artists should be aided by way of tax concessions and so on, but it is wrong for successful authors and artists of any description who are <Col N="389" /> earning millions of pounds a year to get tax-free concessions.  That is not equitable.  Who is to say that such a person is more artistic than a blacksmith or a carpenter, for example, or than any artisan or tradesman?  To bring this system to its logical conclusion the richest men in the world could be living off the fat of the land without having to pay any taxation, and that is not fair. The time has come when the line must be drawn.  We cannot have an absolute <i>carte blanche</i> in relation to taxation.</P>

      <P>I have made my point. The Arts Bill of 1973 enables local authorities to make a subvention to various art forms within their areas. That is a laudable scheme but unfortunately far too many local authorities do not recognise that section of the 1973 Arts Act.  It would be far better if it were obligatory on all local authorities to give a certain proportion of their income to the various art forms in their area.  The voluntary idea has not worked.  Some groups are being discriminated against by their county councils.  If there are a lot of obtuse people in a local authority who do not see the relevance of the arts it is not fair that the people trying to promote artistic works should suffer because of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency in the last few months I propagated the idea that the local authority should give a certain subvention. They gave a very tiny amount in a most begruding manner.  Some weeks ago I asked a Question in the Dáil as to how many local authorities had agreed to make a financial subvention and in reply I was told that statistics on the matter could not be obtained.  I suggest that the majority of local authorities are not fulfilling their obligations in that regard.  However some are.  The Mayo County Council, for instance, have set up an arts committee within the council. Other local authorities should be advised to do the same thing, because the voluntary effort obviously has not been enough.  This year the Arts Council were <Col N="390" /> in touch with each local authority asking them to give this financial subvention, but they were not as successful as they should have been.  For that reason the allocation should be made statutory.</P>
    <P>Some urban councils are allowed to give 3p in a pound to local artistic forms and virtually every one of them does so, but county councils, which have a far greater source of revenue, do not do so. The Taoiseach might comment on that and might consider amending existing legislation to make this obligatory.  To harness the goodwill that is there we must get people to appreciate the arts, and how can we do that if we do not spend money on it initially?  Money is the key.  We are not any less appreciative than the continentals or other nations but the people are not getting the opportunity. There is an obligation on the Government and on the elected representatives from all sides of the House to see that people who could appreciate the arts do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the number of contributions during the debate was comparatively few, the contents have been quite impressive, comprehensive and generally helpful and constructive. When I am replying to a debate like this I always find a difficulty, when so many points have been made, how to go about them.  One is tempted to start to expound one's own musings and attitudes to the general points made.  It is only fair to the Deputies who contributed that to some extent an attempt should be made to deal with their contributions and the points made <i>seriatim.</i></P>
      <P>In general I agree with most of the sentiments expressed by Deputies opposite that we can all pay lip service to the arts and to the need for subvention of the arts, on the one hand to boast about our so-called great cultural heritage and our interest in the arts and then proceed to do nothing practical about that interest, certainly about giving them the kind of assistance that ought to be forthcoming.  When one speaks of assistance, I come to the point made by some speakers on whether it should come from the State or from private industry or from both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="391" /> Naturally, to some extent the State must be the leader in making finance available for the promotion of the arts and interest in the arts and, where necessary, for assisting artists who might otherwise find difficulty in making a living from their artistic talents.  However, it is important that private enterprise should be encouraged&mdash;indeed many do so without encouragement&mdash;to make finance available to assist artists and to help to maintain and, where it does not exist, inculcate an interest in artistic expression.</P>
    <P>It often happens that when a company run into temporary difficulties the first victim of these difficulties is what might be regarded as unnecessary expenditure. I am afraid that in the case of many private enterprises, assistance to the arts is generally regarded as unnecessary to the advancement of the enterprise.  However, it is only right that we should expect, especially from successful private organisations whether they be banks or other industrial activities, a degree of assistance to the Arts; and the greater the success, I suggest, the greater the assistance might be. Generally, many of our successful private companies make financial assistance available, in some cases by sponsoring private artists to produce works of visual art, whether they be paintings or sculptures, particularly in relation to the building of new premises by successful business enterprises.  That should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>It was suggested by Deputy Quinn that many such companies have baser motives and tend to use these investments, if one wishes to call them that, as a hedge against inflation.  I do not think that is true because in many cases&mdash;I do not say in all cases&mdash;the artists from whom they commission work are not very well known but in their opinion have much potential.  Therefore it is not a gilt-edged hedge against inflation when they commission works from artists of that kind.  Nevertheless, if they become famous, renowned either at home or abroad, if there is an accrued dividend well and good&mdash;companies like that deserve to get their profit, if they want profit from it; they deserve to get the gilt <Col N="392" /> on their investment by recognising the potential of developing artists early on.</P>
    <P>That brings me to a point made by all four speakers from the Opposition, the extent to which local authorities should assist in developing appreciation of the arts and, by developing such an appreciation, developing an interest in the works of artists, thereby developing the kind of income artists can make from their talents.  I will do all I can to promote an active interest by local authorities by way of making some of their funds available for that purpose.  I do not think I would go as far as Deputy Deasy suggested, that it ought to be made compulsory.  There is an enabling provision in legislation for this purpose, and though I agree that to some extent the capacity of local authorities to make voluntary provision may have been somewhat reduced by the fact that rates are no longer payable on private dwellings, within the ambit of the expenditure they can raise themselves and acquire from the Exchequer, there ought to be some provision for making assistance available for the arts whether by way of locations in which artistic works can be displayed or making subventions to exhibitions, or otherwise helping the livelihood and the continuation in existence of people who have artistic talent in our community.</P>
    <P>On the question of art in education, Deputies who mentioned it suggested it is a matter primarily for the Minister for Education.  Having been once Minister for Education, I always look back with a degree of sadness on my couple of years in that Department.  There were 101 things I wanted to do, many innovations, but by the time I got round to thinking of them I had been translated, as a famous Archbishop of Westminister, Dr. Fisher, said to me one time, from one ignorance to another.  I was introduced to him as Minister for Education but by then I had been translated to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  He said: &ldquo;I see you have been removed from one ignorance to another&rdquo;.  There was some truth in it because, I suppose, I was ignorant to some extent; I had not had enough experience in so many walks of life that I did not see the opportunities then that I do now of some <Col N="393" /> acknowledgment of these various walks of life when I was Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Even then&mdash;and this has been borne out since&mdash;there were so many demands on the funds given to any Department, and indeed on the Exchequer itself, that it was impossible, and is, to accede to them all.  To the extent I have succeeded since I became Taoiseach in improving the amount of money made available for the Arts Council, I am glad, but I acknowledge it is not nearly enough, certainly not nearly as much as I should like to give, not nearly as much as I know they could use.  They, too, have their multifarious demands, and I must compliment them on the manner in which they adjudicate, determine the allocation among the many requests and the requirements they have to meet in their difficult task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to the Earlsfort Terrace Concert Hall.  I understand the Arts Council have been involved in that.  They and RTE have submitted proposals, jointly and separately, in relation to the management and the general operation of the hall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Jointly and separately they have submitted proposals to the Department of Finance in relation to the management and the general operation of the hall.  The Deputy also mentioned the prospect of a memorial to Micheál Mac Liammóir.  We all took great pride in Micheál Mac Liammóir and I was glad we were able to honour him at least in the city of Dublin, which is not his native city, in a significant way before his death.  We often tend to honour those people long after they have died but a start has now been made on the creation of a bursary to commemorate his great contribution not only to Irish theatre but to Irish literature.  We all know that he had considerable talents in literature, poetry and prose generally.  I hope the Deputy forgives me if I do not refer to all the points he made because I should like to <Col N="394" /> go on to deal with some of the points made by Deputy Quinn.</P>
      <P>In opening his contribution, Deputy Quinn said there had been no clear definition of the function and role of the arts in our society.  It was partly for this purpose that I announced the setting up of a special group within the civil service to advise me immediately on the extent I should cover the demands being made by a number of theatres and artistic activities that were in dire need of funds.  I also established that group with a view to getting a general perspective of the extent we ought to assist and the contribution the arts were making to our society. It is difficult to avoid at this stage the old cliché, &ldquo;not by bread alone&rdquo;, but I am very conscious of that because even though I might describe myself inwardly as a relative Philistine I have a basic interest in promulgating the arts and trying to generate a livelier interest in the arts and artistic activity generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary to have cultural agreements for promoting cultural exchanges and activities between countries.  There are not many such agreements in operation and we ought to increase that number.  Deputy Quinn suggested having a cultural agreement with the USSR but there are many countries with whom we have had diplomatic relations for a longer period but with whom we have not yet made cultural agreements.  However, that is something worth while.  Reference was made to the exchange of works of art, especially works of antiquary art.  At present the Celtic Art Exhibition is in the United States and that exhibition, which was negotiated by Commissioner Burke, when Minister for Education, has done a tremendous amount of good for Ireland's artistic image.  The Minister for Education who has visited two or three centres where the exhibition was placed has told us of comments made by American people to the effect that Americans never really realised that Ireland had such a deep and valuable cultural tradition in this respect.  I would not like to see too much of that being done because, as Deputy Kelly stated, it is impossible to insure such items because one cannot insure what is priceless, one cannot put a premium on <Col N="395" /> a priceless article.  There is also a difficulty in leaving such articles abroad for too long and, apart from the security, there is always the risk of damage or total loss of these works in transit.</P>
    <P>With regard to the suggestion that we should move works of art around the country, I should like to point out that there is always a problem about the the location where such items as paintings are put.  There is the problem of air-conditioning, too much humidity, too much dryness and such locations must be carefully selected.  I support entirely the idea that these things should not all be located in Dublin or in the other areas of concentrated population.  We must bear in mind, however, the difficulty of moving such objects around, the conditions in which they are kept and the security problems.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned the film industry.  I should like to state that the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Energy will be introducing a Bill later this year which I hope will cope not only with the Ardmore Studios but with the creation of an indigenous film industry not so much simply to make money or to be used as a propaganda exercise or, as Deputy Kelly said, as a celluloid Government Information Service, but we would like it to be set up as an artistic enterprise for its own sake.</P>
    <P>I cannot comment on the design, or its obliteration, on the carpet before us, as Deputy Kelly did.  As he has drawn my attention to it it seems rather unnecessary that the beautiful Celtic design is in the centre where the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant and the Official Reporters sit, thereby obscured to most people. Notwithstanding the castigating of it by Deputy Kelly I still believe it is a beautiful carpet and is well designed and has a colouring which is well in tune with the location in which we find ourselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Deasy referred to Deputy Haughey's imaginative tax relief for people who produce work of artistic merit within the country.  He felt that that relief ought not to be available to millionaires but should assist the less well-off artists.  I agree, to a large extent, that assistance is needed for less well-off artists but the relief he mentioned had a two-fold purpose.  It was to attract people from abroad to live in Ireland thereby enhancing the artistic image of our country and it was also to get such people to generate whatever earnings they might make into the Irish economy.  If there are millionaires amongst that class I should imagine that their millions were made abroad rather than here, even since the relief was introduced. On the other hand, it would be very difficult to differentiate.  If we could devise a scale of differentiation the greater relief should be given to the artists who make the least amount of money.  However, as Deputy Quinn pointed out, some of the artists are not even in the tax bracket with the result that that relief would not be of much benefit to them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn also mentioned the question of social welfare assistance for such people who are badly off and who have artistic talent which may not have been recognised or may not have flourished to the point where they can command fees for their work which would give them a good standard of living. That is something which might be considered and I would favour a scheme whereby people on low income levels who are engaged in artistic activities but whose talents may not have developed to the point where they can command sufficient money for their work to make themselves independent of social welfare services can be encouraged.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is worth looking at but here again we come up against the difficulty of differentiating between different people, different forms of earnings and activities.  I suppose the Revenue Commissioners look upon any earnings as coming from some form of commercial  <Col N="397" /> activity, some form of work, professional or otherwise, which carries the obligation to pay tax on the remuneration for it.</P>
      <P>I do not think there are very many more specific points but in so far as I have not mentioned them in my reply, I shall take note of them certainly.  In general, I hope it will be possible to improve the rate of subvention that we make available.  I have been impressed, indeed, by the poundage&mdash;if you like to call it that&mdash;which Deputy Quinn mentioned. We are certainly at the lower end of the scale so far as these islands are concerned, on an average only about 50 per cent, which I think is something that ought to be improved and, in so far as we are able, it will be improved.

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £116,005,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1979 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office, for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Defence for the financial year 1979 is a nett sum of £116,005,000.  It contains provision for an average strength of 1,520 officers, 118 cadets and 13,000 men, that is, a total of 14,638 in the Permanent Defence Force.  At the end of December last the strength figure was 1,455 officers, 87 cadets and 12,210 men, that is, a total of 13,752.  The 1978 Estimate amounted to £105,536,000, including a sum of £5,335,000 which was transferred from the Vote for Remuneration to meet the cost of pay increases during 1978.  This Estimate, therefore, shows a net increase of £10,469,000 on the provision for last year.  However, the gross provision of £128,031,000 is an increase of £19,608,000 compared with the gross provision of £108,423,000 for 1978.  Receipts under subhead Z, Appropriations in Aid, are expected to show an increase of £9,139,000 compared with 1978.  Of the increased provision of £19,608,000, increased pay and allowances account for £2,082,000 and the balance of £17,526,000 is attributable to increased provisions for stores and equipment and increased prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pay provisions in the Estimate amount to £79,572,000.  The pay of all ranks has been revised in accordance with the terms of the 1978 National Agreement.  In addition, all ranks up to and including commandant have received further increases in line with the recent award to executive grades in the civil service, which, coupled with the second phase of the national agreement, gives an overall increase of some 10 per cent.  Officers in the ranks of lieutenant-colonel  <Col N="399" /> and upwards will benefit in due course from any increases that may be granted to higher civil service grades arising from the review of their pay by the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector.  It is my constant concern to ensure that personnel engaged on security type duties, which frequently entail long and arduous periods of service, are adequately compensated for their efforts.  To this end, as Deputies will be aware, the allowances for Border and other security duties have been substantially increased recently. Furthermore, I have introduced a new military service allowance for noncommissioned personnel and for junior officers up to the rank of captain to compensate them for the disabilities of military life.  Deputies will also know of my efforts over the past year to attract suitable personnel to the Naval Service. In this regard, Naval Service personnel, as well as benefiting from the increases which I have already mentioned, can also benefit from the payment of patrol duty allowance, the rates of which have also been increased.  There is a shortage of marine engineers in the Naval Service. I have recently made significant improvements in their conditions of service which, I hope, will be sufficient to attract qualified personnel to the service.  I am glad to say that the gratuities payable to members of the First Line Reserve and members of the FCA and Slua Muiri in respect of attendance at full time training were increased by 145 per cent in 1978. Also the grants payable to FCA and Slua Muiri Unit funds were increased by well over 100 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I have recently announced, the Government have approved in principle my proposals for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  I regard this as an important milestone in the history of the Defence Forces and I am confident that the proposals which have already been explained in some detail in the media will contribute most effectively to the development of both the permanent and reserve forces.  It is my intention to proceed with the reorganisation as a matter of priority and in fact the first phase, which involves the creation of a <Col N="400" /> new structure to cater for the separate development of the permanent and reserve elements will be implemented in the very near future.  The ground force elements of the Permanent Defence Force will consist essentially of an infantry brigade in each of the four Commands and an Eastern Command Infantry Force.  The peace establishments of the ground force elements will be increased eventually by about 1,100 all ranks, whilst the establishment of the Naval Service and the Air Corps will also be substantially increased.  The FCA, which will retain its existing corps structure with no reduction in its establishment, will be organised on a command basis, each command having a special staff with responsibility for training and administration under a Director of Reserve Forces.  An indication of the importance which I attach to the reserve forces, which include the first line, the FCA and the Slua Muiri, is the establishment for the first time of a Directorate of Reserve Forces whose primary responsibility will be the development, training and equipping of these elements.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to announce also that the Government have approved my proposals for the establishment of a Women's Service Corps.  The necessary amending Bill to permit the enlistment of women in the Defence Forces is being prepared and I intend to introduce it at the first opportunity.</P>
    <P>The increased level of expenditure on stores and equipment in the past few years is indicative of my determination to strengthen the capability of the Defence Forces which will benefit this year by provisions for increases amounting to £17,526,000 arising mainly under the following subheads:</P>
    <P>Subhead H&mdash;Defensive Equipment (£4,500,000)</P>
    <P>Subhead J&mdash;Mechanical Transport (£962,000)</P>
    <P>Subhead L&mdash;Petrol, Fuel, Oils etc. (£483,000)</P>
    <P>Subhead O1&mdash;General Stores (£2,216,000)</P>
    <P>Subhead O2&mdash;Helicopters (£500,000)</P>
    <P>Subhead P&mdash;Naval Stores (£6,363,000)</P>
    <P>Subhead S&mdash;Buildings (£1,390,000).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> I am determined that modern weaponry and equipment will be provided for the Defence Forces.  As an indication of what is intended, I would point out that the defensive equipment provided for this year includes additional tanks and armoured personnel carriers, artillery guns and mortars, artillery computer equipment, anti-tank missiles, laser rangefinders, and so on.  Provision is also included for substantial quantities of various types of ammunition.  It will be noted also that there is a considerable increase in the provision for mechanical transport.  This is intended to meet operational requirements and to continue the programme of renewal of the transport fleet.  As regards helicopters, provision is included for the acquisition of a training helicopter and for a down-payment on the purchase of a twin-engined helicopter with a capability of flying at night or in reduced visibility.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in May of last year the Dáil approved of the despatch of an Irish contingent for service as part of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL.  This force was established in March 1978 with the mandate of enabling the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, restoring international peace and security and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of their effective authority in the area.  An Irish contingent of 665 all ranks was despatched to the mission area in May and June 1978.  The contingent comprised the 43rd Infantry Battalion and eight officers who filled certain staff appointments at the Force Headquarters.  Subsequently, in October, a Headquarters Company comprising 104 Irish personnel joined the force.  The Irish contingent is rotated about every six months and already over 2,100 Irish troops have had service in Lebanon.  This figure includes about 750 personnel who are now serving there with the 2nd Headquarters Company and the 45th Infantry Battalion.</P>
    <P>I am very proud of the contribution that the Irish contingent is making in difficult circumstances to the United Nations peace-keeping operation in Lebanon.  I was glad to be able to visit our troops there in October last and to <Col N="402" /> see at first hand the conditions under which they are working.  I can assure Deputies that our officers and men are acquitting themselves well in a very noble cause&mdash;that of peace in the Middle East.  They have had significant success in their role as peace-keepers although not, unfortunately, without loss, as two Irish soldiers were killed in traffic accidents in Lebanon last year.</P>
    <P>Irish personnel have been subjected on a number of occasions to severe harassment by the so-called `de facto' forces in Lebanon.  This has taken the form of shelling of the Irish area of operations and the blockading of a number of observations posts in the enclave under the control of the `de facto' forces which are manned by Irish personnel.  The most serious incident occurred on 18 April 1979 when UNIFIL Headquarters at Naqoura came under artillery and machine gun fire from `de facto' forces resulting in injury to six Irish soldiers.  A further very serious incident occured on 9 May 1979 when Israeli troops entered the Irish area of operations in the vicinity of Shaqra.  Following diplomatic approaches, the situation was defused and the Israeli troops withdrew.  There have been further incidents of shelling in the Irish area of operations this month but the situation is now reported to be quiet.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that, following my visit, I was able to increase substantially the rates of overseas allowances payable to our troops in Lebanon.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing a contingent for service in Lebanon, this country has continued to contribute personnel to other United Nations missions in the Middle East and Cyprus.  Twenty-two Irish officers are serving with the United Nations Truce Supervisory Organisation, while one officer and four noncommissioned officers are serving in staff appointments with the United Nations Force in Cyprus.  In addition, Major-General Quinn of the Permanent Defence Force continues to fill the appointment of Commander of the United Nations Force in Cyprus.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recoupment of costs incurred in respect of the UN operation in Lebanon, payments amounting to almost £900,000 have so <Col N="403" /> far been received.  A further £2 million approximately is due in respect of troop costs for the period up to the 31st March 1979.  Claims totalling £1.8 million approximately in respect of equipment and services supplied are being prepared and will be presented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>A major activity of the Defence Forces during 1978 was assisting the Garda Síochána in internal security matters. The gardaí have primary responsibility for such matters and the activity of the Defence Forces in this field derives from their role of rendering aid to the civil power.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the Army's involvement in security duties, I would like to give a few statistics for 1978:</P>
    <P>(a) Over 4,800 military parties were supplied for checkpoint duties and helped to set up over 11,500 joint Garda-Army checkpoints.</P>
    <P>(b) More than 11,000 patrols were sent out into the road network along the Border.  These patrols are equipped with radio and can be directed by radio to the scene of a Border incident.</P>
    <P>(c) Escorts for explosives and blasting operations were provided on over 1,200 occasions.</P>
    <P>(d) About 180 requests for bomb disposal teams were handled.</P>
    <P>In addition, certain vital non-military installations are protected either by permanent military guards or by military patrols.  The Army also provides guards and escorts for civilian prisoners and movements of cash and helps in searches for arms, ammunition and explosives.</P>
    <P>These duties tax very considerably the manpower of the Permanent Defence Force.  Members of the First Line Reserve, An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí provide invaluable assistance to the Permanent Defence Force in discharging these duties and I should like to pay tribute to them and to all members of the Permanent Defence Force for the excellent manner in which they carry out their allotted tasks.</P>
    <P>As well as normal security duties, the Defence Forces have assisted the community in a variety of ways which should be specially mentioned.  Over 60 search and rescue missions were made by Air Corps aircraft during 1978 <Col N="404" /> resulting in the saving of 12 lives.  A number of calls were answered to bring relief to offshore islands and a total of 98 air ambulance missions were flown conveying seriously injured patients to specialist hospitals.  The Defence Forces also provided assistance in maintaining essential services during a number of industrial disputes and, of course, provided considerable assistance following the Whiddy Island disaster.</P>
    <P>I have constantly in mind the needs of both the Naval Service and the Air Corps in the context of their increased duties as a result of the introduction of the 200-mile fishery limit on 1 January 1977.  Both services have responded magnificently to the challenges posed by the greatly expanded area to be patrolled.</P>
    <P>A stern trawler was leased for a period of one year in 1977 to give the Naval Service immediate additional capability and an aircraft was chartered for a period of two-three years for the Air Corps to enable them to provide back-up surveillance.  It did not prove possible to lease an alternative vessel in 1978, but a second aircraft was leased for a period of three years to augment aerial surveillance.  However these measures were holding operations only. In the longer term a second all-weather fishery protection vessel was commissioned in January 1978.  Two further vessels are at present being constructed in Verolme Dockyard and it is hoped to have the first of these delivered in September 1979 and the second in early 1980.  It is also intended to order two further vessels of a new design which would be built and operational by 1982. It is the intention that these new vessels will have helicopter carrying facilities and thus provide the Naval Service with an enhanced capability for the patrol of the large area involved.</P>
    <P>Owing to the volume of tanker traffic around our coasts, the possibility always exists of oil pollution from an accident to one of these vessels.  Up to last year such accidents had occured in the main far from our shores.  However in October 1978 and in January 1979 two such accidents occurred close to our coast.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Brucellosis in humans is a general health problem in that it is associated with farmers, veterinarians and members of the general public, as well as with workers in meat factories.</P>
      <P>Information available from returns of prescribed diseases to the Department of Social Welfare and of infectious diseases to the Department of Health provides only a rough guide as to the extent of brucellosis as an occupational health hazard.  For this reason, I asked my industrial medical adviser, in co-operation with the Department of Social Medicine at TCD, to undertake a joint study on the problem of occupational brucellosis in the meat industry.  The study has been concluded and its results will be published shortly.</P>
      <P>The most effective long term approach to health protection against brucellosis is the eradication of the disease from the national herd, for which an intensive programme is in progress. However, as a result of the information available from the joint study about the exposure of workers in the meat industry, I have directed, as an interim arrangement, the preparation of guidelines for the industry which will, I expect, be issued to the industry within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>The guidelines set out detailed procedures to be observed in handling brucellosis reactors and condemned material.  When the final results of the study have been analysed I will consider whether further action, such as the making of statutory regulations in the matter, should be taken.</P>

      <P>That is not correct. For the Deputy's information, the Minister was so concerned about this, unlike his predecessors, that he asked for this report to be carried out.  As a result, he will be introducing guidelines which were not introduced up to now, and when the report is further analysed, he will then decide whether regulations are necessary.  In other words, I was cognisant of the fact that there was a problem and was prepared to take some positive action.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour whether he is aware of the overburdening of the Labour Court, its inability to process claims quickly enough, and consequently the long-protracted dispute regarding refuse disposal, and the ensuing danger to health from the thousands of tonnes of garbage presently littering Dublin streets; if he proposes to intervene, in view of the major health threat and the increasing anxieties of parents of small children who are now obliged to keep their children indoors due to bags of refuse littering the streets; and whether in view of the urgent and growing threat to public health, there is any prospect of a Government initiative to bring this dispute to a speedy resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the suggestion that the industrial dispute affecting  <Col N="409" /> refuse collection in Dublin was attributable to any inadequacies in the Labour Court.  In fact, the court issued its recommendation in this case on 15 March last, and the situation referred to in the question developed after that date. The terms of the court's recommendation were not accepted by the unions, and industrial action then took place.</P>
      <P>The parties to the dispute met on 28 May 1979 but settlement proposals which emerged were not acceptable to the workers involved.  Meetings between the parties have since been continuing, the latest of which commenced on Tuesday, 12 June.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

      <P>The second-level education needs of pupils living in Kill, County Kildare, are served by the Convent of Mercy Girls' Secondary School, the vocational school and the Christian Brothers' boys' secondary school in Naas.  Free transport to Naas is available to the Kill pupils to enable them to attend one of these schools.  Extensions are being provided to each of the three second-level schools in Naas.  I am satisfied that, pending the completion of the extensions, the three schools, taken together, will continue to be able to accomodate all second-level pupils in the area, including the pupils living in Kill.  The question of the provision of free transport to another centre does not, therefore, arise.</P>

The Minister did not even refer to that in his reply.

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and other Ministers met with representatives of the employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently to discuss the situation arising from the rejection of the national understanding.  In the light of these discussions the Government have given careful consideration to the appropriate measures which should be taken to ensure an orderly development of incomes in the economy.  As Deputies are by now aware, the Government have decided that, over the period of six months with effect from the expiry dates of the 1978 National Wage Agreement, a general increase of up to 7 per cent related to the cost of living increase from November to May may be negotiated. The pay guidelines which were the subject of a statement issued by the Government on Tuesday, clearly limit the circumstances under which claims for additional increases may be pursued.  It is also the intention that the guidelines will apply to increases in professional fees and directors' fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government consider that in the present and prospective international economic climate these interim arrangements are essential to ensure that the economy is not endangered by excessive pay or other income settlements.  The <Col N="421" /> Government are inviting representatives of the employers and of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to meetings at an early date to discuss how the period during which this interim pay arrangement is in force can best be used to settle longer-term measures designed to raise employment and promote the further development of the economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the Government proposed that the 7 per cent would apply to professional fees and directors' salaries.  How does he propose to ensure that professional fees rise by only 7 per cent in the period mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was mentioned on Tuesday last, and perhaps the Minister will confirm or deny, that firms seeking price increases in which there is a wage element of more than 7 per cent will not be granted those increases.  Is that definite Government policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, this is one method by which this might be enforced and I am sure there are other methods, as the Deputy will appreciate.  However, I would like to indicate that the meetings with the employer organisations and the ICTU have been arranged for Tuesday next.  In anticipation of these meetings, I do not wish to be too dogmatic about this matter.  The reactions of the groups concerned could be of relevance as to how this matter is treated.</P>

      <P>Have the Government any statutory authority to impose a maximum wage settlement?  If so, under <Col N="422" /> what Act do they have that authority?  Is the Minister happy that the statement made by the Government will bring about an improvement in the industrial situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>To the best of my knowledge the Government do not have statutory authority at the moment to apply a limit across the board.  As I indicated earlier, certain methods are open to the Government for enforcement of a norm of this kind.  The question of whether this announcement and arrangement by the Government would bring about an improvement in industrial relations, which I think is what the Deputy has in mind, depends on the reaction of various groups to this statement by the Government.  However, I remind the Deputy of what I said, that the purpose of this is to unable various groups involved to discuss how the period envisaged, the six months from the appropriate date of the expiration of the National Pay Agreement, can best be used to secure long-term measures to raise employment and promote the further development of the economy.  I remind the Deputy also of what I said about the existing and prospective international economic climate from which we cannot isolate ourselves.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the establishment of some sort of industrial peace is a first priority here if the other economic gains are to be achieved?  If that is so, would it not have been more appropriate for the Minister and his colleagues to have come to some arrangement in advance with the ICTU about this 7 per cent norm, as he calls it? Will he tell the House why the ICTU were not even advised or consulted on this in advance?</P>

      <P>The ICTU are, of course, being consulted as are the employers' organisations, as I indicated.  Of course I subscribe to the proposition that the advancement of interest of the people will be assisted greatly by industrial peace.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>One further point of clarification.  There is mention that public service parity claims or extra claims made before 1 June would stand. Also in the budget the Minister allowed £75 million for these claims plus any wage increases that might occur in the normal way for the public service in 1979.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government consider that the establishment of the Inner City Group and the decision to allocate an additional £1 million in 1979 towards a programme of work for the area represent an important commitment on their part towards alleviating the problems of the inner city.  The group will develop a programme of action by the various Departments and public agencies operating in the inner city and will advise me on how the additional £1 million allocated for 1979 can best be used.  The group will be willing to consider applications for assistance for inner city projects, and particularly for projects which create employment.  The vast bulk of public expenditure in the inner city is done, and will continue to be done, by existing public agencies and through their programmes.  The additional £1 million provided for 1979 is a special booster fund to speed up programmes and act as a stimulus to the action needed to deal with the problems of the inner-city area.</P>

      <P>I have indicated in my reply that the group will be willing to consider applications for assistance for inner city projects particularly those creating employment.  I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the statement issued which contained a summary of the recommendations and outlined the general approach to the scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the House and the country have been grievously disappointed by our performance within the EMS and that our pound today standing at 94.5 per cent of sterling is greatly at odds with what we were led to expect in several debates in this House?  Would he also agree that this effective devaluation against sterling is causing great inconvenience especially in Border counties and in travelling to England?  Does he propose to take any steps to reduce this inconvenience?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If anybody is disappointed with the performance of the Irish £ within the EMS, such a person is mistaken. The Irish £ is performing very well, and precisely as we had hoped within the EMS, and staying within the bands which is the whole object of the exercise to ensure stability of the various currencies within the bands.  The Deputy is aware that sterling is not within the EMS and that there has been a considerable strengthening of sterling in recent months for various reasons which I <Col N="430" /> need not go into.  It is important that people should understand that the strengthening of sterling is strengthening against all the currencies of the EMS and not against the Irish £.  In so far as the sterling appreciation is concerned, I am sure the Deputy knows this is presenting a number of problems to British exporters.  Let us imagine for a moment the reverse position and assume the Irish £ had appreciated that much over sterling, then there would be certain problems for us.  There is no reason at all to be disappointed with the performance of the Irish £ within the EMS.  It is performing precisely as we hoped it would.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. Mitchell Mr. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly there are temporary advantages from devaluing against the British £ but in the end it is a sign of great weakness.  Would the Minister agree that the inflation rate he has just announced to the House, the wage negotiations which have been going on, and so on, are greatly at variance with what he, his colleague, the Minister for Economic Planning and Development, and the Taoiseach told us would be necessary if we were to survive and do well in the context of the EMS? Would he further agree that our whole performance before going into the EMS and within it has been nothing short of a disaster?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary.  The implications in the Deputy's question would seem to be that we ought to be in line with sterling.  If we were, our inflationary problems would be added to considerably.  I must repeat, because the Deputy does not appear to understand it, that the Irish £ has performed precisely as it was intended to perform in the EMS.  It has stayed within the bands, within the upper half of the bands and that is what the object of the exercise was, not to have our £ floating up and down with sterling.  Therefore, our £ is performing exactly as we had hoped it would perform.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance in respect of each of the seven archaeological excavations stated in his reply to parliamentary Question No. 24 of 29 May where no report from the archaeologist in charge has been received in accordance with the provision of section 23 of the National Monuments Act, 1930: (i) the name of the archaeologist; (ii) the location of the excavation; (iii) the date of the excavation; (iv) the amount, if any, of State grants paid to the archaeologist and (v) if any further grant of public funds or excavation licence has been given to the archaeologist in question since the date upon which the report became due.</P>

      <P>Reports have since been received in respect of five of the seven archaeological excavations referred to in the question.</P>
      <P>On the two remaining excavations, one was conducted by Mr. L. de Paor, at St. Mel's Church, Ardagh, County Longford, in 1967 for which he was given a State grant of £3,600.  Since then, from 1970-1977, Mr. de Paor has conducted extensive excavations at Inish Cealtra monastic site, County Clare, which is a national monument in the care of the Commissioners of Public Works.  During that period State grants totalling £35,754 were paid to him and eight licences were issued to him in respect of these excavations.</P>
      <P>The other excavation was carried out by Dr. R.E. Glasscock in 1968-70 at two churches at Leigh, County Tipperary, and he received a State grant of £3,700 in respect of it.  No further grant from public funds or excavation licence has been given to him.</P>

      <P>I am unable to give this information in the form requested by the Deputy.  The returns made available by the Garda and other sources is collated under generic headings, such as opiates and barbiturates and these describe a considerable number of drugs.  According to the information available to me, the substances most commonly abused in this country are cannabis, opiates and barbiturates in that order.</P>
      <P>I have recently made a series of orders and regulations the effect of which was to bring the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977 fully into operation as from 1 May 1979. The controls now applicable under the Act provide a comprehensive and more flexible system for dealing with various aspects of the problem of drug abuse.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £116,005,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1979, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office, for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When we moved the adjournment of the debate I was referring to the large volume of tanker traffic around our coasts and the continuing possibility of oil pollution from an accident to one of those vessels.  I pointed out that up to last year such accidents had occurred in the main far from our shores.  However, in October 1978 and January 1979 two such accidents occurred close to our coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Christos Bitas</i> listed badly off the Rosslare Coast in October and it took the combined efforts of both ourselves and the British authorities to avert disaster. The Defence Forces, particularly the Naval Service, played a major role in this operation.  The Defence Forces were again called into action in the tragic <i>Betelgeuse</i> incident in January.  While it was unfortunately not possible to reduce the grave loss of life which occurred on this occasion the dangers of a major oil spillage had to be faced.  Units of the Army and the Naval Service responded with a will and, thanks to their splendid efforts, the effects of the incident were <Col N="438" /> combated and an even worse disaster averted.  Great credit is due to all who participated in both salvage operations.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to expand the Air Corps capability for air surveillance. The two aircraft on lease at present have a purchase option.  It has not yet been decided if this option will be exercised. The question of acquiring aircraft specially designed for us in a marine environment is at present under examination.</P>
    <P>A sum of over £7½ million has been provided in the Estimates for 1979 towards fishery protection.  There is also a provision of nearly £1 million to cover the cost of obtaining a replacement for the Dove aircraft.</P>
    <P>The Government decided recently that the Air Corps should be provided with a twin jet-engined transport aircraft and a contract for the supply of a Hawker Siddeley 125 Series 700 aircraft for delivery late in 1979 has been concluded with British Aerospace.  Pending delivery of the new aircraft a Hawker Siddeley 125 Series 600 aircraft has been leased from British Aerospace and was handed over to the Air Corps on 18 May 1979.  Air Corps personnel are at present undergoing training on this aircraft which it is expected, will go into service early in July.  This aircraft will be operated by the Air Corps on such duties as pilot training, search and rescue, air ambulance and, as necessary, the transport of Government Ministers and officials especially to European Community meetings in Europe.  In addition to the crew, the aircraft has seating for eight passengers.  I realise that this will provide an additional burden for the Air Corps, but I feel sure that they will cope with this task in the same efficient manner as they have coped with others in the past.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of games and sporting activities are, at present, catered for throughout the Army.  Sporting facilities and equipment have been greatly improved. Sports competitions are held at unit and command level, all-Army gymnastic competitions are held annually and adventure training is widely practised. Army teams competed in competitions organised by the International <Col N="439" /> Military Sports Council in 1978 in Italy, Norway and Finland.  The Defence Forces were the hosts for the cross-country championships which were held in Cork in March 1979 and these were very successful competitions.  It is expected that Army teams will participate in further events during 1979.</P>
    <P>The Army Equitation School had a very successful year in 1978.  Army riders and horses competed in 16 international shows including events in North America.  Captain Power was a member of the Irish team winning the Aga Khan Cup.  Captain Power also qualified for the world championship.  Army riders won 12 first places 13 second places, 16 third and 16 fourth places with a total of 124 places in international shows.  In addition 45 provincial horse shows and gymkhanas were attended at home.  The total prize money won in 1978 was £26,000.</P>
    <P>I have introduced a number of measures to encourage greater participation by members of the Permanent Defence Force in sporting activities.  In order that fully qualified Army personnel will be available for this purpose, two Army cadets have commenced a four year course of study at Thomond College, Limerick, leading to a degree in physical education.  It is intended that additional military personnel will be assigned to this course in future years.</P>
    <P>Pending the availability of qualified Army personnel, arrangements are being made for the employment on a full-time basis of four civilian physical education teachers.  I am hopeful that these teachers will be available to the Defence Forces at an early date.</P>
    <P>A total of 120 cadets and officers are undergoing various full-time courses at third level educational institutions.  In 1978 a cadet scheme was introduced for the purpose of providing the Naval Service with qualified marine engineers. Five cadets were appointed under this scheme and are undergoing full-time training in the Cork Regional Technical College.  Discussions have also taken place between officials of my Department and the college on the question of the provision of suitable courses at the <Col N="440" /> college for navigation cadets.  It is the practice to assign a number of personnel to courses of training in foreign military establishments and during 1978 such courses were attended in Britain, France, Germany and the United States.</P>
    <P>Members of the Permanent Defence who, in their own time, attend approved second level and third level courses of education are refunded the tuition and examination fees involved.  Noncommissioned officers and privates who undergo courses leading to the Department of Education day group certificate are refunded the cost of books and examination fees.</P>
    <P>A scheme whereby personnel are registered with AnCO as apprentices in various trades such as fitter, motor mechanic, sheet metal worker, bricklayer, plasterer and painter/decorator.  These personnel attend either full-time off-the-job training courses of day-release courses.  With a view to assisting Army personnel in finding civilian employment on discharge I have arranged for a number of resettlement courses to be run in Army workshops on a pilot basis.</P>
    <P>The drop in the strength of other ranks during 1978 was largely due to the fact that a substantial number of those enlisted during 1975 did not continue in service on completion of their three-year engagement.  The number of men enlisted for general service during 1975 when the last national recruiting campaign took place was 3,426.  A recruiting campaign was conducted during October and November 1978 and continued during January and February 1979.  The campaign involved the use of TV and press advertising with local recruiting measures in the commands. Recruiting publicity commenced again last month highlighting the generous pay and allowances being paid to military personnel.  I recently appointed an advertising agency to undertake an intensive recruiting campaign which should commence in the near future.  A separate recruiting campaign for the Naval Service is being conducted in view of the importance of that service.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana 1978 rinneadh iarrachtaí  chun úsáid na Gaeilge sna Fórsaí <Col N="441" /> Cosanta a leathnú agus go mór mhór chun fir óga ó na limistéirí Gaeltachta a spreagadh chun teacht isteach sna Buan Oglaigh.

    <P>The unprecedented sum of £4.240 million is being provided this year for building and maintenance works.  This represents an increase of almost 50 per cent on the allocation last year.  It will enable significant improvements to be made in the living and working conditions of the Defence Forces while, at the same time, contributing towards job creation.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that all unsuitable Army married quarters will be replaced by modern housing.  This is a big undertaking but a good start has been made. A scheme of 50 houses has just been completed at the Curragh Camp, and the question of building additional houses at the camp is under active consideration. Four houses were recently built at Arbour Hill, Dublin, and work has commenced on a scheme of 14 houses at McGee Barracks, Kildare.  A contract will shortly be placed for 20 houses at Dún Ui Mhaoiliosa, Galway. Earlier this year I inspected the married quarters at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, and decided to initiate a programme for the phased replacement of the quarters with modern dwellings.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="442" /> The first phase of the scheme, providing for 12 dwellings, should be commenced this year.  The question of erecting new married quarters at other locations is also under consideration.</P>
    <P>The single soldier is not being overlooked in the matter of improved living accommodation.  New billet buildings are under construction at Finner Camp, Dundalk Barracks, Gormanston Camp, Dún Ui Mhaoiliosa and Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy.  In other locations, existing billets continue to be improved, where practicable, by dividing large rooms into cubicles, the provision of individual bedhead lighting, installation of central heating and improvements to sanitary and ablution facilities.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to improvements in sporting facilities.  As part of the Department's building programme a fine new sports centre is at present being constructed at Finner Camp and the building of new squash courts at the Naval Base, Haulbowline, has just been completed.  I am particularly pleased to announce that the old pavilion at the Army Athletics Ground at the Phoenix Park is to be replaced by a new pavilion which will provide excellent modern amenities.  I expect that a contract for this building will be placed within the next couple of months.  I am also having consideration given to the question of providing new facilities at other centres.</P>
    <P>Significant works in progress at the Curragh Camp include a new cookhouse and dining hall complex to cater for all ranks at Pearse and MacDonagh Barracks. A transport maintenance complex is under construction at Clarke Barracks and I anticipate that a contract will shortly be placed for a Curragh Command vehicle workshops to cater for repairs.  Planning for the new Ceannt Barracks at the Curragh Camp is well advanced and I expect that a draft plan will soon be available.</P>
    <P>The facilities for the Air Corps at Casement Aerodrome are to be improved. A building development plan has been drawn up and work will commence as soon as possible on the building of a new technical stores and an extension to the apprentices' hostel.  The <Col N="443" /> question of carrying out further works is at present being considered.</P>
    <P>At the Naval Base, Haulbowline, improvements are being effected in the working conditions of civilian employees.  Further improvements at the dockyard and for accommodation for additional Naval Service personnel are being planned.  The provision of a new military post at Cavan, in replacement of the existing barracks which is very old, is at present under active consideration.</P>
    <P>The sail training vessel <i>Creidne</i> completed its full programme of cruises during 1978 despite the fact that the weather during the season was the worst experienced since the sail training scheme began about ten years ago. <i>Creidne</i> spent a total of 156 days on cruises covering a total of 5,296 miles and 121 adults, 170 boys and 46 girls went to sea on the vessel.  They came from many parts of the country and in some cases were in groups.  There was, for example a group of young cadets from the Naval Service, a group from An Slua Muirí, a group from the vocational school in Ballyfermot, trainee fishermen from the Aran Islands and young employees of the Bank of Ireland.  Unfortunately, all who applied for berths on cruises could not be accommodated&mdash;there were about 50 persons on the waiting list for cruises during the summer months.</P>
    <P>The highlight of the 1978 season was the international race of sail training vessels from Great Yarmouth to Oslo Fjord in August.  In this race <i>Creidne</i> finished in 12th position out of eighteen vessels in her class, a very creditable performance in view of the types of vessel against which she was competing.  Apart from the race itself, <i>Creidne</i> participated in a Parade of Sail in Oslo.</P>
    <P>Another full programme of cruises is being carried out this year.  Once again some of the cruises include visits to ports abroad.  The big event will be the international race of sail training vessels from Fowey on the south coast of Cornwall to the Isle of Man in late July/early August.  <i>Creidne</i> will also be taking part in an international race from the Isle of <Col N="444" /> Man to the Clyde commencing on 8 August 1979.</P>
    <P>Work on the building of the new sail training vessel <i>Asgard II</i> at the shipyard of John Tyrell and Sons Ltd., Arklow, is proceeding satisfactorily.  The keel was laid on 26 April 1979 and it is estimated that the planking of the vessel will be completed by August 1979 and the decking by the end of the year.  <i>Asgard II</i> should be ready for delivery in the summer of 1980.  Capable of carrying 25 persons, the new vessel will greatly extend the scope of the sail training scheme.</P>
    <P>The historic vessel <i>Asgard</i> which was used for sail training purposes from 1968 to 1974 when it became unseaworthy, was transferred to Kilmainham Jail on 1 April 1979 in accordance with a decision of the Government that the vessel should be presented to the Kilmainham Jail Historical Museum on the basis of an indefinite loan, for exhibition to the public.  After a lean-to roof has been erected over the vessel and a viewing platform provided, <i>Asgard</i> will be formally handed over to the museum.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in subhead G of the Defence Estimate for a nett sum of £825,000 for Civil Defence purposes. The amount voted last year was £504,000.  The additional provision this year is required for the purchase of much-needed equipment and towards the completion of the programme of Civil Defence Control Centres.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence organisation consisting, as it does, of voluntary personnel merits our praise and encouragement and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the local authorities for their achievements in the development of the organisation.  The fall-out exercise which was held in February last and televised through the courtesy of RTE involved not only the Civil Defence Warden Service throughout the country but also elements of the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána, the Meteorological Service and the Irish Lights Service and proved to be a useful test of the strength of a major component of the Civil Defence organisation.  Other exercises and competitions are planned for the present year <Col N="445" /> with a view to strengthening the rescue, casualty, welfare and auxiliary fire service elements of Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>Five hundred and one thousand pounds of the sum provided is required to meet the cost of grants to local authorities&mdash;at the rate of 70 per cent &mdash;on their outlay on administration, recruitment and training of volunteers and on the storage, servicing and maintenance of equipment.  Provision is also made for the purchase of new equipment.</P>
    <P>The active co-operation of the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John Ambulance Brigade with Civil Defence has continued and I wish to record here my appreciation of these societies' contributions.</P>
    <P>I must also record my special appreciation of the response the Irish Red Cross Society has given to the Government's recent request to set up a reception centre to cater for the intial reception and care of Indo-Chinese refugees. As Deputies are aware the Government have decided to accept 100 of these refugees for resettlement here.  I am confident that, with the help of the Irish Red Cross Society and of those other voluntary societies who have particular experience and knowledge of conditions in Indo-China, these unfortunate people will soon build a new life for themselves in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Army Pensions Estimate for the sum of £15,774,000 is also before the House.  The corresponding figure for last year, taking into account a Supplementary Estimate for £800,000 was £15,082,000.  This represents an increase of £692,000.  The Estimate includes a provision of £118,000 towards the cost of the increase in pensions and allowances which will come into operation from 1 July 1979 in accordance with the principle of bringing all public service pensions up to the rates in force on that date.</P>
    <P>The main increases are: £104,000 in subhead B&mdash;wound and disability pensions; £564,000 in subhead E&mdash;pensions and gratuities for members of the Permanent Defence Force; £153,000 in subhead L&mdash;free travel, free electricity, free television licence and free telephone <Col N="446" /> rental subsidy; £110,000 in subhead M&mdash;funeral grants.  These increases are offset in the main by reductions of: £118,000 in subhead D&mdash;Military service pensions; £128,000 in subhead G&mdash;special allowances.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be interested to know that there are 4,300 widows of military service pensioners in receipt of allowances equal to one-half their deceased husband's pension, subject to a minimum of £155 a year.  The average rate of allowance is £228 a year.  There are 900 widows of deceased soldiers in receipt of pensions under the pension schemes&mdash;contributory and <i>ex gratia</i>&mdash;which I introduced last year.</P>
    <P>I regret that the numbers of special allowance holders continue to fall.  There are at present 6,600 special allowances on pay and the average allowance is £322 a year.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the policy of the Government to improve whenever possible the benefits available to veterans of the War of Independence, provision was made in the budget for the following improvements which will come into operation on 1 July 1979: (a) a separate increase in special allowance of £100 a year over and above the budgetary increase; (b) a doubling of the funeral grant from £100 to £200 and its extension to all holders of the duly awarded service medal; (c) an extension of the free telephone rental subsidy to a veteran living with his wife, or with an invalid, or with an old age, blind, or widowed pensioner or with a person residing with him for the purpose of providing constant care and attention.  If there is any further information which Deputies may require I will be glad to supply it in the course of my reply to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesWhile" hpid="Mr. White Mr. White">
      <NameTxt>Mr. White</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some regret that I stand here for the last time as spokesman for Defence.  I have been moved to Fisheries and I will not be expected to reply to the Minister for Defence for the next couple of years.  I thank the Minister and the staff in the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps for their co-operation over the last few years and for the briefings they gave me when I visited the Army camps.  As a new party spokesman on Defence I had very <Col N="447" /> little knowledge of the Department and my experience had been educational as well as interesting.  It changed my whole attitude to the functions and the importance of the Department which at present is probably our most vital Department. We have a Border to patrol and we are also an island, so we must not under estimate the tremendous work of the officers and men in the Defence Forces. I, like the Minister, compliment the men at home and the men serving in the UN forces in the Lebanon and in Cyprus.</P>
      <P>I would encourage young men to make their careers in the Army, the Navy or the Air Corps where the pay and the facilities are first class.  We have not spent enough money on advertising careers in the Defence Forces and we have not outlined strongly enough the tremendous opportunities that exist in the Defence Forces.  I do not complain about the pay and the facilities.  Nobody can say that the Army is badly paid as they were ten years ago.  We should encourage young men to join the Army not just for three or four years but to follow a permanent career.  We have good jobs to offer them and they should become tomorrow's new patriots.</P>
      <P>We are dealing here with the Army, the Navy, the Air Corps and the FCA and I will deal with these four categories separately.  As spokesman for Defence, I had the privilege to visit most of the Army barracks, to visit the Naval Base, Haulbowline, the Baldonnel Air Base and so on.  I also visited St. Bricin's, the Cadet School in Galway and the UN forces in Cyprus.  As well as that I visited a Women's Army camp in Camberlaine and Guildford on the understanding that I would be speaking to the Minister in a few months' time when he introduces a new Bill to set up a new Women's Corps here.  I visited the British Military Attaché in Berlin and at first hand I looked at the refugee problem in Thailand in South-East Asia. During my contribution here I hope to cover all these areas and tell the Minister what I feel should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My greatest criticism relates to the small number of recruits enlisting in the Army.  The Minister in his speech said <Col N="448" /> that he envisaged an Army of something in the region of under 15,000, but he did not say that we have 15,000 on our establishment at present.  The Minister knows as well as I do that the present establishment is far short of this magical figure of 15,000.  I, like the Minister, am concerned that we are not getting the young 18 to 20 year olds into the Army, the Navy or the Air Corps.  The Minister should spend more money to launch a proper advertising campaign in the national and local press and in the Manpower and AnCO offices, where many of our young people go to look for employment in order to hammer home the message that they should join the Army for a better life.</P>
    <P>Everybody concerned with the Army is perturbed because of the numbers leaving after their three year stint has been served. There is something wrong with the establishment when we do not decide to give more service pay to encourage soldiers to stay on after so much money has been spent on their training.  We are encouraging young people to sign on for three years and as soon as the money has been spent on their training and they have become useful to the nation as trained personnel, whether in the Navy, Army or Air Corps, they leave when their period has been completed, not because they are dissatisfied with the conditions but because they are not given incentives, as they would get in private employment, to stay on for further periods.  I appeal to the Minister to offer them bonuses after their initial period of training to encourage them to stay on for five, or possibly ten or 15 years.  At the moment there is a massive wastage of trained manpower.</P>
    <P>As far as conditions are concerned, a Minister or an Opposition spokesman could not be satisfied with them. However, in all fairness we must agree that they have been improved considerably in recent years, particularly by Deputy Donegan, who was the first Minister for Defence to begin to improve Army conditions, in Donegal, in Cork, in Kildare and elsewhere.  I will deal with Army housing later on.</P>
    <P>My next point relates to arms.  All <Col N="449" /> military men agree that we have as good light arms as any nation in the EEC or in NATO, but they will also agree that our heavy armaments are practically non-existent.  The Minister last year told us he was getting Timoney armoured vehicles and tanks.  It is about time we began to think about improving our heavy armaments position.  At the moment we have one tank in the Curragh which can do sorties around the camp but which would not be able to travel from the Curragh to Dublin.  This is a serious defect, particularly when we have a land border.  I hope the Minister will proceed to spend money on the provision of heavy armament.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister joins with us&mdash;he did not refer to it in his opening statement&mdash;in expressing sympathy with the relatives of the victims of the Glen of Imaal tragedy.  I am disappointed the Minister did not tell us about the steps he intends to take, if any, to ensure there will not be a recurrence.  It is not good enough to post notices at the entry to the glen.  I suggest that the Department of Defence should circularise all guest-houses and the hostel in the glen with notices about the dangers of lifting anything in this tragic glen, so that both students and tourists will be beware.</P>
    <P>In my constituency about two soldiers per year have been killed on the road between Bundoran and Ballyshannon while walking on the path going and coming from Finner Camp.  The Minister should take immediate steps to ensure there will not be more deaths on this three-mile death stretch.  He should ensure, no matter what the cost, that not one more soldier will be killed on that road.  Both there and in the Glen of Imaal it would not cost too much to ensure the safety of people and soldiers.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Naval Service, the Minister said £7½ million is being spent on fishery protection.  Am I to take it that that money is part of the £30 million the EEC contribute to us?  If I am correct the Minister was being less than honest with us because the £7½ million he mentioned is only a fraction of EEC money being juggled back into our economy.  As I said, we are being given £30 million by the EEC to buy boats <Col N="450" /> and aircraft to protect our fishing waters.  Last year I mentioned that I did not think that EEC money was enough because we are getting a grant for buying aircraft and boats but we are not getting anything for the repair of them.  If this limit was established by the EEC surely we are entitled to eight-ninths of the total cost of the purchase, manning and repair of the aircraft, the boats and the helicopters.  Other members should pay their share.</P>
    <P>I am gravely concerned about the numbers joining the Naval Service.  The Minister 18 months ago estimated that by the end of 1978 there would be more than 1,000 officers and men in the Naval Service and estimated that by the end of 1979 that number would grow to 1,500, but we are all aware that we have not reached the figure of 1,000.  In fact, we are far short of it.  There is only one way to encourage young people to join the Naval Service; we must mount a publicity campaign pointing out the tremendous benefits there are in a career in the Naval Service.  It is possible that our Naval Service is being given a lopsided role.  The role of that service seems to be the protection of fishing vessels and the keeping out of non-EEC boats. Surely our first priority must be to defend our waters and our shores.  It would be bad for us to spend all the money available to ensure that our naval boats have small guns to keep out poaching Spanish trawlers or the like.  The Minister should investigate the possibility of buying a proper destroyer or battleship so that we would be in a position to defend the island because our fishery protection vessels would not be able to do much for us.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Naval Service on organising a trip to Keel last year.  Those who went on the trip gained tremendous experience.  I always encourage people to go abroad to see how people in the same field operate.  I should like to know if the £7½ million referred to by the Minister come from the EEC.  I understand that the Air Corps have been given money by the EEC to purchase a new &ldquo;Dove&rdquo; aircraft.  The Minister appears to be taking the credit for purchasing that aircraft, but I should like to remind  <Col N="451" /> him that negotiations in connection with that transaction took place long before the Coalition left office.  I welcome the purchase of that aircraft because it appears that at present we have but one Seaking aircraft to protect our 200-mile limit.</P>
    <P>Last year I suggesed to the Minister that he consider the purchase of a dual helicopter.  I pointed out then that I was concerned about what would happen if we had a tragedy at night.  We are all aware that since then we had a major tragedy at Bantry Bay.  It is sad to reflect that the RAF had to be called in because we did not have a dual purpose helicopter to do night work.  I should like to compliment the Minister on deciding to purchase such a helicopter now.  It is important that we should be able to carry out surveillance and rescue work at night time.  We must have a proper protection and rescue fleet.  It is interesting to note that American aircraft carriers have up to 70 such dual helicopters and that we can only afford to buy one.  I hope that within a couple of years we will be talking about a fleet of such helicopters.  I accept that they are expensive but we must be in a position to save lives.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that we are taking on enough cadets in the Air Corps.  We are also short in the number of mechanical trainees we have.  Something will have to be done to increase the number of cadets.  We are now talking about bringing in an extra aircraft, an extra helicopter and an extra jet and for that reason we must increase our figures dramatically.  The Minister should tell the House how many will be in the Army, the Naval Service and the Air Corps by the end of the year.  We must have a plan and decide on the number of people in those services in peace time.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that it was the intention of the Government to buy a new jet for Ministers on EEC work.  He mentioned the cost of the &ldquo;Dove&rdquo; and the cost of other items, but he did not mention the cost of the jet.  Surely, we are entitled to know the cost of that jet.  I understand that it will cost about £2,250,000.  Is that figure correct?  The <Col N="452" /> taxpayers are entitled to know the cost.  I am sure our taxpayers accept that Ministers are a very valuable commodity and that we cannot afford to have them hanging around Continental airports due to fog, bad weather or technical difficulties when they should be at home looking after the terrible problems that face us here.</P>
    <P>Another point is that there are different air strips under the control of the Department of Defence at present which could be opened to the business community. Naturally these people would have to be passed by security 48 hours beforehand and there would have to be an inspection of the aircraft on landing. In the rural areas these air strips exist and could be opened to the general business life, with a chance of encouraging more industrialists to our western sea board in particular.  I understand as much as the Minister does the necessity for security and I am not saying that should be in any way lax as far as these small planes would be concerned.  What I am saying is that we have a Department of Defence, we have a first class armed force and there is no problem in properly organising this.</P>
    <P>On the other problems facing the Department of Defence&mdash;and I think that even Deputy Power will agree&mdash;the first, as far as the men are concerned, is their housing conditions.  I suggested last year, and suggest again, that discussions should take place with different building societies with a view to getting loans for officers and men to encourage them to build their own houses.  I would go further to suggest to the Minister that a cash grant should be given as another incentive to the permanent members of the Defence Forces to encourage them to build their own houses outside the Department altogether.  At present, there is a £1,000 straight grant for a new home.  Perhaps, the Minister could also give £500 or £1,000 extra grant to encourage these people to build their own homes outside the Army.</P>
    <P>The Minister's present directive is to build more married quarters in all the different barracks, and I do not disagree with that.  However, he will have a great problem when these people retire from <Col N="453" /> the Army in 20 or 25 years' time and are faced with the problem of buying another home.  Already in Kildare and other barracks they have this major problem of overholding.  The Minister, as well as building houses in the different barracks, should be encouraging the thrifty people who want to own their own houses to built them.  The Department at present have thousands of acres of land lying beside the barracks.  On the perimeter of that land sites could be made available for the officers and men&mdash;if you want to divide them into the two categories.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem of all is getting people to stay in the Army.  They must have proper conditions, proper pay, and services too, and incentives as far as housing is concerned.  We must be proud of our Army, and it is an Army to be proud of.  I could talk about the barracks in Galway; I could talk about the barracks in Cork; I could talk about the barracks in Dublin.  As far as the barracks in Cavan is concerned, I welcome the decision which the Minister was pressurised into taking when some of us visited Cavan barracks last year.  This barracks was an utter disgrace and no place for any member of the Defence Forces to have had to live in for the last ten or 15 years.  I welcome the fact that this is under active consideration.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will tell us what is &ldquo;active consideration&rdquo;.  I want to see blocks being started in Cavan Barracks in the next couple of months, so that the men will no longer live in such terrible conditions.  I make no apologies to the House for spotlighting the need for a new barracks, on my return from Cavan.  I was utterly disgusted with what I saw there.</P>
    <P>The Minister quite rightly stressed the need for proper sports complexes, encouraging these and providing the money.  I must compliment him on this.  I am not going to down him all the time. He is a good Minister doing a job but, unfortunately, getting some of his priorities wrong.  However, he is interested in sport.  We must give the Army people these sports facilities.  The vast majority of these people are young men with plenty of the boundless energy <Col N="454" /> that we had 15 or 20 years ago, which they could expand in the sports complexes, the squash courts, the football fields and the handball alleys and so on. Everyone will agree that the more sporting facilities we give the members of the Defence Forces, the better men they will be and the better shape they will be in.  The Minister for Health would agree that if you get somebody interested in sport, there is far less likelihood that he will drink or smoke and he is much more inclined to take his sport seriously.  I would like to see every barracks in this country equipped with proper sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>I have another criticism to make as far as the Department of Defence is concerned. This is the rationalisation&mdash;if I may call it that&mdash;of the Border barracks, in particular.  We are now, we hope, approaching more peaceful times and the role of the Army will probably change away from the Border areas and back to their areas of command.  The Minister must plan exactly what to do with some of the present Border barracks. I do not wish to be quoted as saying that some of these should be closed down; all I am saying is that some must, sooner or later, be closed down because they are only very temporary accommodation as far as the Army is concerned. The Minister should make a statement, letting the hierarchy in the armed forces know how long a temporary barracks is going to exist, particularly in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>The longer these barracks are there, the harder it will be to move the people from that particular area.  For example, there is a barracks at Cootehill at present and a new barracks is being built in Cavan.  If it is foreseen that the Cootehill barracks people will be transferred back to Cavan when the new barracks is built in four or five years' time, if a soldier marries a girl from Cootehill, he will not buy a house or put down a mortgage on a house in the Cootehill area.  He will think of the future, when he will be moved to Cavan in a few years' time.  I have ten examples I could give of barracks right around the Border where this problem exists.  The sooner the Minister, whoever he is, issues a plan and lets the <Col N="455" /> young men in those barracks know the exact position regarding their future, the better for the Army and the better for the people concerned.</P>
    <P>This nettle must be grasped, and the sooner the better.  The Minister must make up his mind whether he wants many substandard barracks or fewer barracks that are better equipped.  This is a decision for the Minister, not for me. He should tell the officers and the men what he intends to do so far as the substandard barracks are concerned.  I have mentioned Cavan and I am glad to see that the matter is under active consideration. I hope the Minister will be as active about that matter as he has been with regard to some of his sporting activities.</P>
    <P>Earlier I asked the Minister what he sees as the total establishment for the Navy, the Air Corps and for the Army. This is an important question that needs to be answered now.  We must have a target, whether it be 15,000 personnel or 17,000.  We will excuse the Minister if he is only a few hundred short of the target but it is very difficult to understand why we cannot get people into the armed forces at a time when there is high unemployment. The young people would have the benefit of a well-paid job.  If there is one thing that the Army does for any young man it is that it knocks the corners off him, it smartens him up, it imposes discipline.  One can nearly always point to the man who has been trained in the Army because, as the old saying goes, he is head and shoulders above the others.  At a time of high unemployment there is no excuse for shortage of personnel in the armed forces.</P>
    <P>I had not intended dealing with the women's corps but shall make some comments on this matter in view of the fact that the Minister referred to it.  One of the commitments in the Fianna Fáil manifesto was that a women's corps would be initiated without undue delay. Two years have passed but we have not yet got females in the Army.  I was glad to hear from the Minister that this matter is being attended to.  However, my criticism is that there has been no planning with regard to this matter.  I do not see how we can have a women's corps <Col N="456" /> when we have not yet advertised for suitable officers.  Is it envisaged that the officers and the women will be taken on together?  If this happens it means that none of them will have any experience. Last year the Minister should have advertised for 12 or 20 suitable officers for the women's corps.  They could have been sent to the USA, to Israel or to Camberley or Guildford.  These people must be properly trained in order to take charge of the women's corps.  I presume there will be some advertisements issued in the newspapers before we next talk on this matter.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister has given a commitment that the number will be 400.  That is about 10 per cent of the English establishment.  People often ask what can women do in the Army.  At least one advantage would be that the men would be tidier in their appearance. When I was in England I counted 37 different jobs being carried out by women. They were not doing combat work, hand-to-hand fighting or they were not handling arms and I take it that the Minister will not include such activities in the work of the women's corps. However, I noted that women were engaged in the following areas: in hairdressing, working in bands, as postal officers and switchboard operators; they were working on signals as supply clerks, stewardesses, in branches of medicine, as receptionists, cooks, working in first aid, on map reading and there were women in charge of drill in the parade ring.  Women were engaged as driving instructors, driving cars, lorries and tanks and they were employed as recruitment replacement officers.  If we had female recruitment replacement officers, it might encourage more people to go for interviews to the National Manpower offices.  Women were engaged in work at radar installations, and on telephones; they worked as military police, on guard duty and there were women handling dogs and horses.  These are some of the things that the women were doing and nobody can say that there is not work for them in our Army.</P>
    <P>In comparison with England the retirement age here with regard to Army <Col N="457" /> personnel is too high.  Here the retirement age is 65 years but it is 55 years in England.  We could retire some of our senior officers earlier.  We could give them a pension because they deserve this after their many years of work for the nation.  It would be a better incentive for the younger men if there were more of them working at senior rank.  Up to last year there was only one colonel, Billy Ringrose, under the age bracket of 57-60 years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister to change the rank structure.  It is high time that the title of the Chief of Staff was changed to general.  At the time I argued with the Minister that he should have changed the rank of commandant to major but he told me it was not changed because of our history.  I disagree but admit it is only a small point. When our commandants are abroad &mdash;and this is general knowledge&mdash;they do not call themselves commandants, they call themselves majors.  The people in Cyprus and The Lebanon do not know what commandants are.  The Minister might look at this and it could be written in to the regulations that a man could be called major or commandant. The Minister told me that historically commandants were commandants, but I think we deal too much with history and do not look enough to the future.</P>
    <P>There has been a big improvement in the on-going conditions in the Army over the last five, six or ten years.  The general public do not realise that many camps offer the ordinary men three choices of lunch.  Very few hotels offer their clients such a choice.  It is worth noting that some of the sleeping quarters, for example the new sleeping quarters at Finner Camp, could be compared with a very good hotel.  Most of them have central heating.  I am sure none of us will be happy until the old billy stoves are done away with and proper central heating is installed in all sleeping and living quarters.  Many of these barracks are being divided into different units, perhaps four, six, or eight in each unit instead of 30 or 40 men sleeping back to back as happened not too long ago.  Everybody must agree that a great <Col N="458" /> deal of progress has been made in the accommodation we are offering non-married Army personnel.</P>
    <P>The canteens are a credit to the NCOs and the men who ploughed back money into their bars and entertainment facilities.  I have been in many barracks where the bars were as good as any bar in Baggot Street or Leeson Street.  The men take a personal pride in showing off their living conditions and what they have done in the last five or six years. They are to be congratulated on raising funds and spending them wisely.</P>
    <P>Nobody will be satisfied until every barracks in the country has a proper sports complex which will provide facilities for football, gym, squash, boxing and so on.  Some of our sportsmen in the Army, Navy and the Air Corps have done extremely well in different competitions.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned 4,800 military sorties that have taken place in the Border areas in the last 12 months. When we are travelling in Border areas we see the Army now and again and it is hard to realise they have done so much work.  They may have found illicit bombs, guns or cars going to or coming from the North.  The Army deserve the highest praise for the difficult work they are doing in those areas at the present very difficult time.  I am sure the Minister, like me, would like to congratulate them on a job well done.</P>
    <P>While agreeing with the Minister's announcement about the FCA I do not think he has gone far enough.  He has divorced the FCA from what we call the establishment&mdash;the actual armed forces. This will be a separate unit from the armed forces.  Until now there has not been any direct contact to the top for the FCA.  Now they will have direct contact right up the line.  If this is so, I welcome it and hope the officers who will take control of the FCA will be fully paid Army people with special responsibility for organising the FCA.</P>
    <P>As has been stated time and time again, the FCA will do surveillance work.  In other words, they will be the watchdog for the country areas.  They will report back in times of stress or war or if there is trouble, and all these men <Col N="459" /> will be vetted.  I agree with what the Minister has done but I am disappointed, too.  To give an FCA man four weeks' training is inadequate and laughable.  He should have introduced a new scheme whereby people who hope to join the FCA would be given a full year's training as a proper Army man. At the end of that year he would be given a bonus for completing a year's service and would be called on to perform FCA duties, as happens at present. He would also be given priority if he wanted to make the Army a full-time career by joining the cadets.  If the FCA is to play a meaningful role the men will have to be trained in the proper, modern, sophisticated methods now used in times of war.  The Minister should consider something along these lines.</P>
    <P>This is a great chance to mould our 18-year-olds and upwards and to give our young women a proper discipline, smartness, sense of duty and feeling that they are doing something worthwhile for their country.  I am not saying this should be compulsory but this carrot-dangling at the end should give them an incentive to join.  The navy and Air Corps are short of mechanical engineers and if we got such men into the FCA, who knows, we might have enough people to retrain into the arts and crafts which are needed in the forces.  I sincerely ask the Minister to have these people properly trained because the quicker they are properly trained the better.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of Defence are taking control of the 100 refugees coming here and that they will be working hand in hand with the Irish Red Cross.  I want to compliment the Department who did this job before when we had very difficult refugees coming from Northern Ireland.  First of all I would like to compliment the Department of Defence who held this role before when refugees came down from Northern Ireland because they were difficult refugees at that time.  I see no reason why the Department of Defence cannot take control of the present refugees.  The Government have committed themselves to taking in 100 refugees. I cannot understand why we are not taking  <Col N="460" /> in the 400 refugees that were talked about four months ago.  I hope that this 100 we are talking about now is just the first 100 of that 400.</P>
    <P>I have visited refugee camps in places like Thailand where one might see 40,000 or 50,000 homeless refugees, poor and starving, looked after by eight or ten white Europeans.  These people are completely at a loss; they have no work; they have no food.  I know of one camp where 15 of them have died since January.  It is high time that the western developed nations took their fair share of responsibility for this massive problem in the Third World.  Unless we do we are going to have problems eventually in the Third World countries, because it will not be too long until the Communists take over the whole lot.  The sooner a small country like Ireland takes her fair share of these refugees the better.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the reason given for taking only 100 refugees.  It was that we had no employment for them.  There is employment in the armed forces where we are short of people.  I am not saying everybody would be suitable, but these people coming in could be vetted. Already we have employment which they would be very glad to get instead of having to live off a few miserly pieces of bread and bowls of rice as at present. Thought must be given to this.</P>
    <P>At present there are many couples here looking for children to adopt and they cannot get them because there are very few adoptable children here.  Could we not start to take in some of these children from the Third World countries?  We have people willing and ready to take them.  Thought must be given to this type of thing.  I wish the Department of Defence well with the Red Cross and I will be looking with interest to see how displaced persons will be resettled here.  I have no doubt, because I have met them, that they are honest people.  They are good looking, fine featured people.  If they are given a chance they will do well.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the Lebanon.  I would like to compliment our forces in the Lebanon for a job which they have done very well.  We now have 2,100 people in the Lebanon and some of them <Col N="461" /> have gone back a second time.  It is a very difficult job in a difficult place&mdash;at present the heat level must be terrible&mdash;and we have dedicated soldiers who are going out there for experience.  I visited in St. Bricin's one of them who had been wounded there.  I asked him would he like to go back again.  He said he would go back in the morning if he got the chance because he had got more experience there in the last six months than he had got in his entire career in the Army.  None of us object to this.  We all agree that our officers and men need the chance to get the experience so that they can compare themselves with other soldiers in other nations.</P>
    <P>When I visited Cyprus I was talking to Major-General Quinn and he told me that the Irish soldiers are acknowledged to be some of the finest soldiers in the world.  It is not so much that we are great fighters but in a peace-keeping role we have what we call a great gift of the gab and sometimes the tongue can save many a life.  He said to me that the Irish soldiers were accepted as the very best soldiers that had served with the United Nations.  What other credit can we give to our soldiers than to say that they are doing a great job for their country and to carry on doing it.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister we have all got our pet hobbies.  The Minister was talking about sail training.  We welcome the building of the <i>Asgard</i>.  We are all looking forward to seeing it launched in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>My pet hobby is the equestrian business.  I should like to compliment the fine team of young officers we have in McKee Barracks at present.  I wonder how many people here realise that last year Ireland won the Aga Khan Cup?  I wonder how many of them realise that there was one Irish officer, Con Power, who did extremely well on that occasion? I wonder how many of them realise that the Army jumping team had 124 places in the last 12 months and have lifted a total of £26,000?  The placings and the money are great, but look at the advertisement that that has given the entire bloodstock industry in Ireland. The money just does not count for that because the position is that we have the <Col N="462" /> finest horses and riders in the world.  We should devote time and the money to seeing that the Army have the best riders and the best horses.  I know this is being done, but even more money should be spent on the equestrian centre because it is the greatest advertisement this country could have as the home of the jumper, the home of the hunter and the home of the racer.</P>
    <P>Also I should like to compliment the Civil Defence organisation on the probably thankless work that they have been doing.  We must remember that the Civil Defence do not get money.  They get a grant through the Defence Forces and through the local authorities, but they really do not get money as such and our thanks to them must also be put on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to wish Deputy Donal Creed, my successor, all the best in the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>In the very brief time at my disposal I shall have to be rather more telegrammatic than I would otherwise have hoped to be.  I hope the Minister and the Government officials will not take it amiss if my speech is to some extent critical because I mean to be complimentary as well as critical. They will have to take the compliments for granted because I want to get some of the criticisms across and I hope it will be understood as being constructive criticism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an irony that our defence budget, in percentage terms, is increasing faster than the defence budget of any other country in Europe.  It is quite an achievement, but in another sense it is a sad reflection on the society and the times we live in.  It is plain that the role of the Army is changing.  It is not really an Army which is destined to invade anybody.  It is not really an Army which is destined to defend this country against nuclear attack.  It seems to me that its two main roles now are that related to possible involvements with the UN peace-keeping forces and that of internal security.  I would imagine that the overall shape and direction of the Army is being directed now along these lines.  It would like to see, in addition, perhaps an association  <Col N="463" /> with the Civil Defence, some kind of investigation into the possibility of training not just the Army but our citizenry in general in the techniques of non-violent resistence.  I feel that this is a valid option for a small country such as ours and that it could well be incorporated under the general aegis of the Minister, perhaps in the area that I have talked about.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is to be a Women's Corps, but I must sound a note of warning. A Women's Corps will not serve the purpose for which it was intended if the only function that it will serve is to allocate to women within the Army jobs that men in the Army do not want to do. That would be a denial of its functions, a denial of any real division of responsibility within the Army.  Unless we have a real division of responsibility within the Army, the Women's Corps will very soon become a second class army and I do not think the Minister or anybody else would like to see that happen.</P>
    <P>In relation to fishery protection, I must put a serious question mark against the Minister's policy of expending so much money on all-weather fishery protection vessels when what we need desperately to stop the poaching that is plundering our salmon stocks at the moment are fast inshore vessels with small crews who can catch the poachers who are operating this kind of work.  I believe we are investing far too much money in the former area at the expense of the latter.  The whole policy really needs to be looked at again.</P>
    <P>On the question of sail training I cannot do more than totally commend the activities of Captain Healy and the other people involved in this enterprise.  I would ask the Minister, when the new vessel comes into commission, to see to it that Captain Healy and the other people associated with this venture get the full administrative backup that they need to ensure that this service is fully availed of by people within the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Horgan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the permission to raise this matter.  I do not intend to take my full 20 minutes but if Deputy Desmond is in the House I propose to allocate to him a few minutes of my time.</P>
      <P>The problem of coeliac disease is one which affects a relatively small number of people in our society.  On the best advice available to me, the estimated number of sufferers from this disease in this country is about 2,000.  The Irish Coeliac Society have made attempts from time to time, unavailingly, to get various administrations to add coeliac disease to the list of diseases for which free medical care is given.  The question I raise this evening, for which the Tánaiste as Minister for Finance, is responsible, is the added burden on coeliac sufferers and on the parents of coeliac sufferers, many of whom are children, caused by the application of VAT to certain foodstuffs which these adults and children need.</P>
      <P>Not long ago in the Dáil I asked the Minister for Finance about this matter. He pointed out that food as such was free of VAT and, as far as he was aware, there were only a small number of substances of a biscuit type which might come under the heading I described which were liable for VAT.  The Minister invited me to make further inquiries in the matter and come back to him.  In a sense this is what I am doing.  I have made further inquiries and I am coming back with an appeal to him to review the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As things stand at present, it imposes hardship on many people.  There are a number of substances consumed by sufferers from coeliac disease which are available, to the best of my knowledge, only in chemist shops.  These are particularly beneficial in that the gluten element to which coeliac sufferers are allergic is removed.  They are largely wheat or wheat products.  They are very basic products.  From inquiries I have made, they include among others the following  <Col N="465" /> list of substances: spaghetti, macaroni, a mixture for crumble for fruit pies, bread, flour, Liga biscuits and other biscuits made by other manufacturers which are similar to those made by the Liga company.  On account of the very high technology needed to extract the gluten from these products they are very expensive.  A pound of macaroni of this kind costs £1.45p which is considerably over the cost of the normal substance in a supermarket.  The normal substance in a supermarket is not available to a sufferer from coeliac disease. The irony is that the supermarket macaroni is, as a food not subject to VAT whereas this special gluten free substance purchased in chemist shops, because it is regarded more as a medicament, apparently is subject to VAT.</P>
    <P>The problem in relation to this is that the cost of the substance concerned is not readily recoverable by the coeliac sufferer or by the parent of a coeliac sufferer. Coeliac sufferers who have medical cards are entitled to medical services free.  Those not entitled to medical cards are entitled to refunds for purchases over approximately £7.50 a month.  In both of these cases, unless I am mistaken, the free medical services for medical card holders and the refunds for non-medical card holders only refer to prescribed items.  These items do not need a prescription.  They are an essential part of the normal diet of coeliac sufferers. They are extremely expensive to begin with and when VAT is added it seems to be almost adding insult to injury to the families concerned.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to review the situation.  There may be serious administration problems in relation to what should be exempted from VAT and what should not.  Perhaps the most simple way of approaching it might be to identify named substances by named manufacturers as meeting the requirements that they should be basically foodstuffs and exempting them, by name, in some special schedule published by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has small children knows, for example, that the normal Liga biscuit is a very essential part of a child's diet.  For the child who is a <Col N="466" /> coeliac sufferer a specially adapted biscuit of this kind is no less an essential food.  I urge the Minister, pending any action by his colleague, the Minister for Health, for the possible addition of coeliac disease to the list of long term illnesses, to take some initiative in this matter which would not cost the Exchequer a great deal but would show goodwill to coeliac sufferers.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Horgan said, he put a question to me recently on this topic.  In the course of my reply, I indicated to him that food generally, including gluten free food, is free of VAT.  I am somewhat at a loss because my information is somewhat different from the information Deputy Horgan has just given the House.</P>
      <P>My information is that the following items are zero rated and they are all available in the category of gluten free foods to which the Deputy referred: bread, flour, macaroni, Liga biscuit, pasta and spaghetti.  If that is so, and that is the information I am furnished with, I do not think there is a problem of anything like the dimensions the Deputy has in mind. I appreciate that sufferers from coeliac disease have considerable difficulties.  I have personal knowledge of such cases. I was, and am, under the impression that the position is that almost anything they need to purchase in the way of food, having regard to the disease from which they suffer, is zero rated.  The items available which are zero rated are such as to constitute a broad range of food. There is no situation in which they would be forced, by reason of their disease, to purchase items of food which would be subject to VAT.  If that information is correct, and I have no reason to believe it is not, then I suggest that the problem is not what Deputy Horgan thinks it is.  However, if Deputy Horgan can furnish me with information that items of the kind I have mentioned are being subjected to VAT&mdash;&mdash;</P>
